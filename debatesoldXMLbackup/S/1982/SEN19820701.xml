      <P>In section 5, a certificate of incorporation comes in under subsections (3) and (4).  But for a company to commence business, it would appear under section 6 as I read it, that an additional certificate is to be issued.  We are not talking about the same certificate in both sections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>The certificate under section 5 would confirm the registration of the company.  But to commence operation, would I be correct in saying that an additional certificate is required under section 6?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, for a public limited company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>We are moving very rapidly. On subsection (7) of section 6, where a public limited company would commence to do business or exercise borrowing powers in contravention of this section the penalty on conviction would be a sum of £500.  Bearing in mind the size of penalties and fines in relation to other contraventions of the Act that may arise, is the Minister satisfied that a penalty of £500 is an adequate deterrent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that it is.  It is inadequate, but I understand that the reason that £500 is always mentioned in these sections in relation to summary conviction is that there was a judgment of either the High or the Supreme Court some time ago suggesting that that was the limit of the monetary penalty that could be imposed by a court of summary jurisdiction.  I fail to follow the reasoning, because I would have thought that 12 months' imprisonment, for example, which can be imposed by a court of summary jurisdiction, is a very severe penalty.  Particularly in a context such as this, a £500 fine is meaningless, but this is the figure which the draftsman puts in.  If I felt that it would stand up I would prefer to change that to about <Col N="628" /> £2,000 at the very minimum.  Realistically, it should be about £10,000 to mean anything, but presumably there could not be a summons in a summary court.  One would have to bring it before a judge and jury, which would be a very lengthy procedure for a relatively technical matter of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back to the point that we were making earlier on the question of penalties.  The penalty here would appear to be rather small in relation to penalties in other sections of the Bill for other offences.  Perhaps the earlier observation of the Minister may apply to this situation as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does apply.  It is unsatisfactory, but unfortunately I cannot take the risk of putting in a more realistic figure because the section could be declared unconstitutional.  It does, at least, have the possible merit, but certainly the last one, that it is not just the company that can be fined £500 but the various officers or other individuals who were involved in telling of business when they should not, or it may be that a fine of that kind may be a little more relevant or meaningful to them.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 19 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section to which I was referring earlier, regarding £30,000 of authorised minimum share capital for the company.  Subsection (1) states that in this Act &ldquo;the authorised minimum&rdquo; share capital means £30,000 or such other sum as may be specified by order made by the Minister under subsection (2).  I understood from the Minister on Second Stage that his authority was confined, more or less, to extending upwards.  I do not get that understanding from the section, but my query is simply this: can the sum specified by the Minister be smaller as well as greater than £30,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically it can be less, but in practice it will never be less because the purpose is to raise the figure of £30,000 to keep pace with inflation and also with the possibilities of the changing relationship in value between the Irish punt and the European currency unit.  As it is drafted, it is correct to say that it could be decreased, but that will not happen in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I accept what the Minister has said, that technically it is possible to have a smaller as well as a greater sum.  I have no doubt, from the way in which he responded to the query, that for as long as he is the man with responsibility there, it will not be less.  It is nothing that can be guaranteed into the future and I am wondering &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In this Act &ldquo;the authorised minimum&rdquo; means £30,000 or such greater sum as may be specified by Order made by the Minister under section 2.</P>
      <P>The substitution of the word &ldquo;greater&rdquo; for &ldquo;other&rdquo; would put it beyond any doubt that it would have to be an increase upwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 42, line 1, before &ldquo;any&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the company should be wound up or if&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's positive approach to all the sections so far.  We have recognised already his commitment to good strong legislation, and this Bill is evidence of such.  However, on section 40 we believe that the amendment we have put forward would go along to <Col N="631" /> strengthen even further what we are all committed to.  In fact, it might even cover, to a certain extent, the problems that would arise regarding the low fines in the sections we have discussed.  In so far as we can, within the section, we try to make sure that companies who find themselves in a serious situation would be controlled under this section through the extraordinary general meeting that would need to be called when the net assets of the company are half or less of the amount of the company's called-up share capital.  Our first amendment asks the Minister to consider inserting before &ldquo;any&rdquo; on page 42, lines 1a subclause which appeared in Article 17 of the EEC directive related to this Bill, which we feel adds a thrust and force and could concentrate wonderfully the minds of the people calling the EGM to discuss the serious situation.  Article 17 includes the words &ldquo;whether the company should be wound up, or if any and if so what measures should be taken.&rdquo;  We believe that there was great purpose in inserting those words into Article 17.  We feel, with the seriousness of the situation that would demand an EGM, that clause should be included also in the section.  Is there any reason why the sub-clause of Article 17 of the EEC legislation was left out of our Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would tell the Senator that it was not left out, that the words &ldquo;whether any, and if so what, measures should be taken to deal with the situation&rdquo; include the question of winding up, quite obviously.  They also include various other possibilities.  The Senator, with respect, is putting too much emphasis on winding up.  What we should seek to achieve with companies who are in trouble is a resuscitation of them eventually, so that they will not go under and that employment will not be lost.  There is one certainty about a company that is wound up, which is that it is at an end and its activities are at an end.  But winding up is not the only solution to a company's problems.  It inevitably has to be a solution to the problems of some companies and is, but it is by no means the <Col N="632" /> only solution, and efforts to revive the company are what I would like to encourage, at least as much as winding up.  I am loath to give prominence to winding up.</P>
      <P>One of my reasons for being slow to accept the amendment is that if winding up is specifically referred to here as being the chief purpose of the meeting that would be called under this section, it will immediately frighten the life out of creditors and will make employees very nervous. The word gets out that such a company is having an extraordinary general meeting called specially under section 40 of this Act, which is the winding up section is the way it will be put, to consider the question of winding up.  There is no better way to ensure that a company will go into liquidation than to call a meeting for the purpose specifically of discussing whether or not it should be wound up.  It will bring every creditor it has in the country down on top of it like a ton of bricks.  I would prefer the broader wording in this section &mdash; to consider all or any measures that might be taken to cope with the problems that the company has. The prospects of restoring it to health, retaining it as a viable commercial entity and retaining the employment that is involved in it, are greater under the wording as in the section, rather than under the wording as proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I hoped that the Minister would realise that the introduction of this amendment would not inevitably lead to the winding up of such company.  What the amendment could, should and perhaps needs to do on certain occasions, is lead to an EGM being called when several options were put foward.  The option of winding up would be the last resort.  I agree with the Minister that nobody wants to see a company wound up.  That is the very last resort.  However, our sad experience is that on some occasions, reviewing the final winding up of a company before such intervention, it has been realised that if the company had perhaps thought seriously about the winding up process before they were forced into it, the debts might be far less than when they reached <Col N="633" /> that extreme.  I hope I have made myself clear to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most difficult and painful option for the EGM but the most realistic at that time, that of winding up, should have been looked at straight in the face. If this sub-clause is left out, that option might never need to be entertained, because it is not included in the agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting that there is a certain amount of merit in the Minister's argument, I advance two points in support of our amendment.  The first one is that the section as it is does not, in our reading of the situation, adequately reflect what was intended in Article 17 of the EEC Directive.  In our judgment, section 40 does not truly or adequately reflect what is intended or put forward as being necessary in Article 17.</P>
      <P>The second argument in support of the amendment is that while I to some degree accept what the Minister has been saying in relation to the panic that may be caused among creditors and employees if the story is out that an extraordinary general meeting is being held for the purpose of winding up a company, we provide for that situation.  We will be providing a very worthwhile inspiration to those whose responsibility it is correctly to guide the destinies of the company to get on with their job.  What we are proposing here could be interpreted by them as either a threat or a stimulant and, maybe, both.  For that reason, I feel that there is merit in what we are proposing.</P>

      <P>This is a dangerous amendment.  If the section were amended the meeting called would, first of all, have to devote itself to whether the company should be wound up.  It is only when that matter was finally decided, and decided against, that other measures could be considered.  If you have the emphasis on winding up and must have the decision first on that question, which I think you would, it is only then that the meeting could go on to decide other possible measures.  If it is just one of many things, perhaps some measures would be suggested that could be tried first, before the question of winding up was considered. <Col N="634" /> The emphasis, the whole psychological climate of a meeting in the circumstances of having this amendment included would be &ldquo;Will we wind it up or will we not?&rdquo;  It is certainly a very negative approach, rather than a positive approach to the future of the company.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, if winding up is the proper thing to do, I have no doubt that the meeting will come to that conclusion without necessarily putting it in as the first matter that has to be considered. From every point of view, it is more advantageous and certainly will give a better chance of survival to a company if all options are considered before they get around to the question of whether winding up is the only possible way of dealing with the situation.</P>

      <P>I take Senator Ryan's point.  However, unfortunately, I do not share the same faith and confidence in the wisdom of the management of that meeting.  We are trying to work this out in the most constructive way possible. We are afraid that if there is no mention at all of winding up, it may never be considered, to the detriment of the many people we are trying to save.  I understand that it might have to be the first option to be considered and therefore psychologically damaging.  However, by leaving it out altogether it probably would be left out at the EGM as well when it should be a realistic option to be looked at fairly and squarely.  What we are seeking is that companies, on arrival at a meeting, would not skate over the surface.  One of the measures which they might not consider would be the reality of having to wind up before the situation would get worse.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point the Senator makes, but what both I and Senator Ryan have said remains valid.  There is no question of the option of liquidation not being considered &mdash; the words used in the section could scarcely be wider: &ldquo;The purpose of considering whether any, and if so what, measures should be taken to deal with the situation&rdquo;. We should have a more positive <Col N="635" /> attitude.  We should start by setting out whether the company should have recourse to Fóir Teoranta, or to the IDA rescue unit, or to the ICC, or whether it should seek greater accommodation from its banks, or start a new marketing drive, or whether it should cut out some of its loss-making activities in order to preserve the rest of it.</P>
      <P>All these are options which I would like companies to look at with at least the same enthusiasm as they would look at the question of liquidation.  In order to try to preserve the companies that are in difficulties I do not want to highlight the fact that liquidation was decided by the Oireachtas as the chief remedy for problems: I do not think that represents the views of anyone in either House.  Both Houses would prefer that positive efforts be made to save the company before arriving at the ultimate situation.</P>
      <P>There are cases in which companies should have gone into liquidation before they did, but the losses sustained would not have been as heavy.  All of us are guilty, perhaps even as recently as last night, in trying to sustain the unsustainable beyond the period in which it should be sustained.  The factory that was under discussion last night, along with a number of others, were helped out in circumstances that on reflection was perhaps too long.  We should not go to the other extreme and regard liquidation as the remedy for everything.  If a man is ill the best way to avoid having to treat him in hospital would be to let him die: death is not a remedy for either human beings or ailing companies, because the problem of treatment will not arise after death.</P>

      <P>I agree to withdraw the amendment.  However, the Minister has been talking about extreme measures.  I would like to think that the collective intelligence of the management and executives at such a meeting would not be harried into feeling that because the company should be wound up in accordance with the section, they feel obliged to take the extreme measure of winding it up.  If there is to be any hope for Irish industry, it is first options we should be <Col N="636" /> thinking of.  As the Minister pointed out, human behaviour and our psychological make-up allow us to sustain the unsustainable. The amendment was to help industry to concentrate on something which they might find unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 42, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where a company holds an extraordinary general meeting pursuant to subsection (1) it shall during every subsequent 6-month period duly convene an extraordinary general meeting of the company in accordance with subsection (1) until the net assets of the company are in excess of half of the company's called-up share capital.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an attempt to extend the thinking and seriousness of the company regarding the situation that led to the EGM. The company, having got through the first EGM, and the situation not having improved &mdash; there might have been rapid disimprovement &mdash; there is nothing within the section to force that company to call another EGM to consider the situation which has become even more serious.  When the company reaches the stage when the net assets are half or less of the amount of the company's called-up share capital, going though the formula of one meeting is not enough.  We would like to think that the situation in the company would improve.  When the company holds the extraordinary general meeting, pursuant of subsection (1), it shall during every subsequent six-month period during which it finds itself in that situation, hold an extraordinary general meeting.</P>

      <P>Though I can see the objective of the amendment I feel justified in suggesting that it be rejected because of the burden and expense it would impose on companies which are in a difficult situation.  Moreover, there is a danger that too many meetings, if their <Col N="637" /> occurrence became known, would have a damaging effect on the confidence of employees, customers, creditors and shareholders alike.  Different company rescue operations, in most cases, would require more than six months to take effect.  In addition to the proposed extraordinary general meeting under section 40, in the normal course there would be the annual general meeting at which the shareholders would have the opportunity to review progress.  I am introducing an official amendment which will meet the objectives of the Senator's amendments because it provides for a reference to section 40 in the auditor's report under section 163 of the 1963 Act.</P>
      <P>If shareholders wish to examine particular difficulties in a company they, as a group provided they own not less than one-tenth of the paid-up capital with a right to vote at a general meeting, are free under section 132 of the 1963 Act to require the directors to convene an extraordinary general meeting.  If the directors do not convene such a meeting within 21 days the shareholders themselves can convene the meeting.</P>
      <P>There are three broad headings under which general meetings of a company can be held.  They can all be held within the one year and must be held, irrespective of whether the directors want them or not.  That seems to be adequate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (4), page 42, lines 15 and 16, and to substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) Where the day mentioned in subsection (1) is before the appointed day and directors of the company shall duly convene an extraordinary general meeting of the company for a date not later than 90 days from the appointed <Col N="638" /> day for the purpose of considering the matters mentioned in subsection (1).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 40 (4) provides:</P>
    <P>This section shall not apply where the day mentioned in subsection (1) is before the appointed day.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to try to include companies who under subsection (1) would not come under this section.  However, there could be a number of companies who would need such an exercise to be gone through, and what we are suggesting in out third amendment is that where the day mentioned in subsection (1) is before the appointed day the directors of the company shall duly convene an extraordinary general meeting of the company for a date not later than 90 days from the appointment of the day for the purpose of considering the matters mentioned in subsection (1).  It is an attempt to try to include companies who at present should be required to have such a meeting but would be excluded under subsection (1).</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but I must suggest that this amendment should be rejected also because as it stands it would embrace any day in the past, and that would not be appropriate.  For example, if a company which is trading profitably on the appointed day, which will be some day after the Act has been passed, and has no major problems, had been in a situation in 1965 that it had lost half its paid-up capital but had long since overcome the difficulty, under the amendment it would be a criminal offence for the directors not to call an extraordinary general meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree it would be quite inappropriate to force a viable company into that situation, which would be embarrassing and indeed damaging to it.  The directive does not require any degree of retrospection, but there are other considerations.  As a general proposition directors from the appointed day will be concerned with the state of their company because a breach in the statutory duty to call a meeting involves a criminal offence carrying a fine of up to <Col N="639" /> £2,500 and up to two years inprisonment, or both.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Senator to bear in mind that in accordance with the amendment which I am introducting and which we referred to earlier, it is amendment No. 7, every annual general meeting subsequent to the appointed day will have the comments of the company auditor in relation to the position of the company with regard to section 40 of this Act.  For example, the annual general meeting of a company could occur within one or two months, or some short period, after the appointed day under this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's amendment goes a long way to cover the point.  However, I am still a little concerned about companies who perhaps in 1965 would have been in default.  We are not talking about that; we are talking about trying again to protect as much as possible the creditors, the shareholders and the employees particularly of companies who would now be in a desperate situation but could be excluded under the section.  Maybe the Minister might consider making it retrospective within a certain date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The day mentioned in subsection (1) is the day on which the directors find that the company has lost more than half its paid-up capital and so on.  Subsection (4) provides that the section shall not apply when that day is before the appointed day.  If the company is still in trouble and has still lost half its paid-up capital, the fact that the appointed day shall be 1 October 1982 will not cure it, and the directors can look at the situation on the appointed day.  If it is still in that position on the appointed day they will have to call their meeting under section 40 or if they do not they will commit an offence.  If the company is not in the situation of heavy loss that is envisaged by subsection (1) of this section, then the necessity to call the meeting does not arise.  This section is to deal with present and future losses.  It is not meant to carry out a historic review of past losses.  If the company is not affected <Col N="640" /> by subsection (1) on the appointed day then it is healthy.</P>
      <P>Taking the example I gave to the Senator, why hold a meeting of this kind if at some date in the past the company was in a bad position?  Whether it is in 1965, as I said, or whether it is the previous month or week it does not matter.  If it is out of the bad situation you do not have to have those types of meetings so, therefore, there is no point or necessity or advantage or benefit in having a retrospective subsection of this kind, as suggested. It would only do harm, because the amendment implies that the company is now healthy but it was not a month or a year ago.  If it is now healthy we should say &ldquo;Thank God it is all right now,&rdquo; and leave it alone and let it get on with its business, rather than having post mortems into why it was in a section 40 situation a month or 12 months ago.  The gratifying thing is that it is not in the situation today.</P>

We then reach the list on page 71 and we have other names.  Right at the end we have the name of one woman.  While I would be the first to uphold the importance of women as housewives in this country, I would like to point out that I do not think the two lists reflect the positions and participation of women in the business life of the country at the moment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. B. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to extend the statutory limit on borrowings by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara from the Central Fund. For the benefit of those members of Seanad Éireann who may not be fully familiar with the role of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in the fishing industry, I would like to outline briefly what the board's functions are at present.  The general powers of the board were set out in the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, in very broad <Col N="644" /> terms, but the primary purpose of the board's establishment can be described as the assistance and improvement of all facets of the sea fishing industry.</P>
      <P>In their early years the board actively engaged in a number of aspects of the industry including the purchasing, processing and marketing of fish but, as the years went by, it gradually became clear that some of the board's activities were no longer necessary and that they should concentrate more on promotional, advisory and developmental activities.  In 1962 the board's role, in the furtherance of Government policy in modern conditions, was set out in a White Paper entitled &ldquo;Programme of Sea Fisheries Development&rdquo;. As a result, the board have withdrawn completely from active participation in fish processing and marketing and now operate in the role of a development body for the industry.</P>
      <P>The board's present functions include the administration of a marine credit plan under which grants and loans are given for the purchase of fishing boats, engines and gear; the provision of an advisory service to fishermen to improve fishing techniques and promote co-operation among fishermen; the development of markets at home and abroad for fish and fishery products; the encouragement of private investment in worthwhile fish processing undertakings; the operation of ice-making plants at some fishing ports where such facilities are not provided by private enterprise; the operation of the National Fishery Training Centre in Greencastle and a mobile training unit; the operation of a national mariculture grant scheme and the provision of an advisory service for those engaged in aquaculture.</P>
      <P>In addition to their grant-in-aid for capital development, the bulk of which is used to provide grants for the purchase of new fishing boats, BIM receive repayable advances each year from the Central Fund for the provision of loans at a reduced rate of interest for the same purpose. These advances are repaid to the Central Fund from the loan repayments made by purchasers of boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing legislation &mdash; section 2 of the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Act, <Col N="645" /> 1974 &mdash; the amount of outstanding repayable advances from the Central Fund to the board may at no time exceed IR£15 million.  That limit has now been reached and it is necessary that it be extended so that the development of our sea fishing industry may continue.  Because of the rapidly rising cost of these boats and the tendency to use increasingly larger boats together with the modernisation of the existing fleet, I consider that the limit should be raised to IR£40 million.  This should be sufficient to meet BIM's demands on the Central Fund for at least four years.  The original limit established in 1952 was IR£½ million which applied to aggregate borrowing and not the total outstanding.  The limit was increased to IR£1 million in 1956, to IR£3 million in 1959, to IR£5 million in 1970 when it was also decided to change the application of the limit to total outstanding borrowings instead of aggregate borrowings as before, and to the present IR£15 million in 1974.</P>
    <P>There is a need to modernise and adapt the existing fleet to meet the requirements of changing fishing patterns and market trends, and I would like to quote a few statistices to show how the board's work of assisting fishermen to acquire fishing boats has been expanding in recent years.  During the period 1975-1981, 410 new vessels were added to the fleet, and of these, 90 were over 50 feet in length.  Last year the Irish fishing fleet contained a total of 1,957 motor vessels, of which 246 were over 50 gross registered tons, 55 over 75 gross registered tons and 79 over 100 gross registered tons.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the same seven year period, the number of vessels exceeding 75 gross registered tons nearly doubled, from 67 to 123.  In the same period, the amount of annual direct financial assistance given by the board for the purchase of boats and gear has risen from IR£4.392 million to IR£6.670 million and bank guarantees given on behalf of fishermen to enable them to purchase larger vessels have risen from IR£610,388 to approximately IR£16.5 million.</P>
    <P>Interest in the larger fishing vessels has grown among fishermen and in 1980 four <Col N="646" /> new steel vessels in excess of 90 feet to a total value of IR£8.58 million and 11 new vessels ranging in size from 64 to 90 feet to a total value of IR£9.6 million joined the fleet.  This is indicative of the confidence of fishermen in the industry in these difficult times.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Fisheries I feel it is important to restore confidence in the fishing industry, Since I took office I have been at pains to point out the necessity to look very carefully at our fisheries policy.  In view of the new emerging common fishery policy of the European Community we must look very carefully at our sea fishing industry and see where we can build it on the cornerstone which I feel the new common fisheries policy will be to meet the challenges of the future.  This Bill is important and necessary and it will go part of the way towards restoring the confidence I am talking about.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill. Before dealing with it may I welcome the Minister to the House?  This is my first time to address the House since my reelection. I should like to put on record that I am the first full-time fisherman to be elected to this House.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to give the views of a fisherman.  I was proud and I am still very proud of my profession.  It has a long-standing tradition.  It is a good healthy life, but a very dangerous life. From time to time I have heard politicians speaking about the fishing industry. Listening to some of the statements they make one would wonder whether they had ever seen a boat in their lives and whether they made those statements for their own political gain or to downgrade the fishing industry.  It would be nice if they knew the full facts about the fishing industry, the people who make a living from that industry, as fishermen, in marketing, and so on.  This industry contributes a large amount of money each year to our economy.  The amount put back into fishing, in comparison with other industries such as farming, is very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> Since their foundation An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have built up a fleet in Ireland second to none having regard to the size of our country and the resources available.  Only last year they embarked on putting larger boats into mackerel fishing. These boats have been very successful indeed.  They give a great deal of employment and 14 or 15 crew members are needed to man one of these boats. Also the amount of fish they can bring in at one time is something in the region of 600 tons.  At prevailing prices this is a very lucrative industry at the moment.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to statements by politicians and others.  I should like to touch very briefly on salmon fisheries. In the other House when this Bill was being debated on 24 and 25 March last, statements were made that salmon fishermen had three miles of illegal net and that they blocked the mouth of the Shannon and did not allow any fish whatsoever up the Shannon Estuary.  This is absolute and utter nonsense because it would be a physical impossibility for any fisherman to put a net across the mouth of the Shannon due to the tidal waters.  No sooner would his net be in the water than it would be swept away.  For that reason alone, it would be impossible for these so-called illegal salmon fishermen to have these long lengths of net on board their boats.  There is no way a fisherman could use anything more than what I would consider to be the legal length of net, approximately half a mile.  In addition when one sets a net of half a mile in the water, again because of wind and tide, that net is like a melodeon or a concertina because it shortens up completely.  So, even with half a mile of net the biggest area that could be fished would be a quarter of a mile.  These accusations are completely false.</P>
    <P>I do not want to become parochial about it, but each county with a maritime coast should get a fair crack of the whip as far as salmon licences are concerned. In 1974 and 1975 Michael Pat Murphy was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture with responsibility for fisheries.  At that time the ESRI report said quite clearly that if something <Col N="649" /> were not done with regard to conservation of the salmon industry this species would become extinct.  Despite all this, off the coast of Cork 135 extra salmon licences were issued in that year.  Kerry has the longest maritime coastline in Ireland and there are nine salmon drift-net licences on that coast.  That is absolutely ludicrous.  Only last year there was an inquiry held in regard to reopening certain parts of our coastline in Kerry. This was agreed on and we are awaiting an announcement in the near future that extra licences will be issued and I would welcome this.</P>
    <P>There are other parts of the fishing industry which I would love to see under the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry because the jurisdiction that the Minister has over the whole fishing industry is limited in so far as he is not responsible for piers and harbours for which the Office of Public Works have responsibility. I would like to see all aspects of fishing, from fishing boat facilities on shore to landing facilities and development of ports completely under the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>There are many people in the fishing industry whom we should thank and I would like to do that here today.  I refer to those brave men who man the lifeboats and who go out to sea at the toughest and roughest times, through storms and bad weather.  These man are the bravest on our coastline.  On behalf of the whole fishing industry I want to thank all those who man the lifeboats and look after the fishermen when they are in trouble at sea.  They have done us proud over the years.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to safety at sea. That is, that the radio facilities that we fishermen have are not adequate.  Every boat in the fleet at the moment has a VHF radio transmitter and receiver. Unfortunately there are no receivers or transmitters onshore to receive messages if something goes wrong.  The only communication we have is from boat to boat. There is no communication link between our boats with the VHF receivers and any help that could be given to us from the shore.  I would like the Minister to look into this.  I know that this possibly is not <Col N="650" /> under his Department but probably under the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or the Department of Transport. But I would like the Minister to make representations on behalf of all of the fishermen to see that an adequate number of VHF receivers are put at strategic points around our coast to facilitate the fishermen as well as people who go out for pleasure in their own boats and also the bigger boats that frequent our shores from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on aquaculture and mariculture.  From the fishermen's point of view, I welcome the development of mariculture.  I would be slow to accept aquaculture which means fish farming in enclosed ponds or otherwise. A major development would be to develop to their fullest sheltered bays and inlets by replanting or reseeding with oysters, scallops, mussels or some other type of shellfish.  In this way one would be giving back to the fisherman, the boat owner, a job in these bays where he could fish comfortably within the confines of a bay during the roughest and toughest times of winter that a fisheman can be out fishing.  The other type of fish farming which is enclosed in ponds and so on is funded by private individuals and the amount of work available in that type of farming is sufficient for only two or three people, whereas the same type of effort in an inlet or bay would employ many more.  For example, Tralee Bay is one of the most natural oyster fisheries in the world.  Over the years it became over-fished, not because of the greed of fishermen but because it was just the place to spend the winter months in sheltered waters.  For as long as I can remember this has provided work for about 100 boats with three to four people in each. So, for five months of the year about 300-400 people were employed in that bay with a total landing of approximately £.75 million pounds worth of oysters. Recently the Minister's Department, together with BIM and FEOGA, invested a large amount of money in this bay and this was very welcome.</P>
    <P>I can see in the next couple of years, with proper development and proper control, this will definitely come up to <Col N="651" /> £3-£4 million every year, giving jobs to possibly double the number of people I was talking about.  I welcome that type of development.  But again, I would be very wary of fish ponds and enclosed areas operated by private individuals because from the very start it is a high risk operation. In most cases water is being pumped into these ponds and if something goes wrong with the pump such a business would be wiped out overnight. This is why I do not like it too much.  As well as that, these people that were never involved in fishing are a threat to the livelihood of the fishermen.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest things hitting our markets today is farm salmon.  There is no way that a farm salmon could compare with an Atlantic salmon.  But the general public who buy these fish hardly know the difference.  They are still salmon and that is it.  They are competing in a very big way at the moment with the Atlantic salmon.</P>
    <P>I have covered nearly all the points that I want to cover.  I wanted to be brief. I would recommend that the House give this Bill, to change the amount of borrowing from £15 million to £40 million, a speedy passage.  It might sound an awesome sum but our fishing industry has come from about £1 million up to about £66 million now.  The employment being given by the fishing industry is of great value.  I would say that the wealth of the seas around our coast has never been fully utilised.  This wealth is far greater than the total wealth of the whole island. We should look to the future.  We should give every possible chance to fishermen because at the end of the day, when we are hungry we turn to the sea.  We had to do this once before in the 1840's and the 1850's and the sea was not found wanting. If, again, we get hungry we will once more turn to the sea.  We should treat it with care and respect.  We should ensure that pollution will never, if at all possible, enter out seas.  I support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to welcome the Minister to the House and to congratulate him on his appointment.  I know the Minister to be courteous. <Col N="652" /> Indeed, I had the pleasure of knowing his brother in Donegal.  It is through that connection and my dealings with him that I know the Minister will be courteous.  I respect the fact that he is new to his position and I hope he will respect the fact that I am new to mine.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald spoke as a first fisherman Senator.  While he is taking on the role of St. Peter, I am a mere disciple trying to learn the ways of the fisherman. The Minister said that the purpose of Bord Iascaigh Mhara is to assist and improve all facets of the sea fishing industry. I would like to refer to one or two of those facets.  When I had little interest in fishing I still knew of the efforts and the struggle to establish a 50-mile limit.  We are now down to a six-mile limit in some instances and a 12-mile limit in some others.  I do not know what the common fisheries policy may produce, but I hope the Minister will dig in and try to improve the limits that we have and try to establish at least a 12-mile limit around our coast.  I am told that there are improvements in Donegal Bay.  I hope the Minister can establish improvements elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The second thing I want to refer to is the matter of the quotas.  There are inadequate quotas available to Ireland to guarantee the future of the fishing industry. I am advised that Britain is successfully claiming 36 per cent of the Common Market quota, on the grounds that she has 60 per cent of the waters.  Ireland, with 25 per cent of the waters, is seeking and, I am told, only attaining a mere three per cent.  If my mathematics are right, on an equal ratio, 60 per cent of waters to 36 per cent of quota equals 25 per cent of waters to 15 per cent of the quota.  I would ask the Minister to keep this in mind.  He should not accept three per cent.  He should be pressing for the 15 per cent on the ratio basis that I referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me, with respect, refer to membership of Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I do not want to cast any reflections on Members of this House, but I would say very clearly that there are two Members on the other side of this House at the moment who are members of Bord Iascaigh <Col N="653" /> Mhara.  Legally and technically there is nothing wrong with this.  I am told that the Minister intends to introduce legislation debarring Members of the Oireachtas from being members of Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  I would respectively suggest that Members of this House who are members of the board should resign forthwith.  I do no mean that as any personal reflection on them.  I know both of them to be decent men.  But in the knowledge that the Minister does intend to introduce such legislation they should resign immediately.  I would also refer to a fellow councillor, again a decent man and a man with whom I am friendly.  He has not the knowledge required to be a member of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and, indeed, if he has, there are others with somewhat deeper knowledge. I refer to one in particular, a man who has been chairman of the IFO for four years, who is a director of the IFO at present and chief executive of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation.  I remind the Minister that Killybegs is at present landing over half of the total national landings.  Despite that this man was dropped and replaced with somebody who has a knowledge but certainly not the same knowledge of fishing as his predecessor had.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Government aid.  At the moment the fishermen have a claim in for £2 million to be spent through the marine credit plan of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, an increase of £.4 million over last year when it was £1.6 million.  The application has been in for roughly a month.  When does the Minister intend to sanction the £2 million requested?</P>
    <P>Related industry is vital to the continuation and success of the fishing industry. The ratio of offshore to onshore is one to one.  In some Common Market countries it is a ratio of six to one.  The Minister and Bord Iascaigh Mhara should encourage financially and otherwise the setting up of related industries.  In the village of Rathmullan, in County Donegal, there are plans to set up a processing plant.  I welcome this.  I am told that in the village of Downings, where employment was given to 70 people in the boat building yard, which regrettably had to close <Col N="654" /> down, an interest in the yard has been expressed by a processing firm.  I ask the Minister and his Department to encourage and give aid as necessary in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Killybegs, one of the biggest fishing ports in Ireland, hopes to set up a boat building industry capable of producing the larger vessels now necessary to compete. This would have the dual role of providing employment in Killybegs and also, more important from the national point of view, fishermen would not be forced, as they are at the moment, to order boats from abroad.  We should encourage the idea of buying Irish, but when Irish boats are not competitive one cannot blame the fishermen for going elsewhere to purchase.  If the Minister and the board set up an industry in Killybegs that can build the bigger-type boats competitively they will be helping our balance of payments as well as giving employment in the area.</P>
    <P>Increased costs are playing havoc in every aspect of Irish life but particularly in the fishing industry.  Seventy per cent of the fisherman's basic costs is spent on diesel to fuel his boat and he can spend days at sea using that fuel without any catch.  It is in breach of Common Market rules to subsidise this diesel but I am advised that in four other countries diesel is being subsidised in some form or other, either by putting some other name on it or hiding it behind some other scheme. Diesel is 20p a gallon more expensive in Ireland than in Britain.  It is an ongoing expense, ever on the increase and this is a deterrent to people who wish to go into the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>There are a number of suggestions I might make that are relevant to my own county.  I mentioned the idea of encouraging a fish processing plant which I hope will be set up in Rathmullan.  Extensions and other works are needed for the pier in Rathmullan.  The Minister should encourage this.  I want to be more specific about another small part in Donegal, Ballyhoorisky, in the Fanad peninsula.  In 1962 when the first moneys were spent on a small pier there were three boats and 12 people employed.  In 1974, when Deputy Tom O'Donnell was Minister for <Col N="655" /> the Gaeltacht, at my behest money was spent there and it was well spent.  The number of boats there then was six and the number of people employed was 24; in 1982 that has increased to 11 boats employing 44 people.  I do not know how much money was spent but one can see that an increase of 20 jobs in the fishing industry in that area by a relatively small sum of money is a good investment.  I would ask the Minister to consider a request by the fishermen in Ballyporscee area that he build a breakwater to allow other bigger boats to land there.</P>
    <P>Regarding facilities in general, the Minister and the board should ensure that a power point and a water supply are put on every pier in Ireland.  These are basic necessities as the Minister and his Department and the board are aware.</P>
    <P>Fishermen are also looking for an extension at Downings pier and this is justified by the number of boats that are now landing there.  This is the only stop for big vessels between Newcastle and Killybegs and they cannot land there because of the size of the pier.  So money spent there would be well spent.  An application has been made in Killybegs for a synchrolift, a gadget for lifting boats when repairs need to be done underneath. I am told that this is now being shelved.  Could the Minister give me an assurance that this is not the case?</P>
    <P>I wish now to deal with something which is causing great problems for fishermen. Monofilament nets are in use to some degree but they are illegal and I do not know why.  There is a suggestion that it is because of their catching or killing power.  I am advised that the supernylon net has an equal killing or catching power as the monofilament net.  If this is the case, why is it that the supernylon net is legal and the monofilament net is illegal? Secondly, the monofilament net has a three-year lifespan as opposed to one year for the supernylon net.  Banning the monofilament net and allowing the supernylon net to be used is like telling fishermen to replace their fishing nets every year rather than once in three years, adding to their costs.</P>
    <P>There is a safety aspect attached to the <Col N="656" /> monofilament net.  With this type of netting fishermen can fish during the day. With the standard type of netting they are forced to fish at night with resultant dangers to the fishing industry.  We in Donegal are only too familiar with the sad tragedies which have occurred in the last number of years.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the State allows the importation of monofilament netting and collects revenue from its importation but once it is loaded for fishing it immediately becomes illegal.  I would ask the Minister either to bar the importation completely or to legalise the use of the monofilament netting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also ask the Minister to consider introducing grants for the reconstruction of boats which are out of date because the purchase price of new boats is a deterrent.</P>
      <P>It is only right that more money should be spent on the fishing industry, our third largest industry.  The Minister might consider the few points I have made and might concede at least some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, but in talking about our fishing industry we want to get things in context.  It is clear from some of the figures quoted by Senator Loughrey that in terms of size of the industry relative to the potential and shoreline, no doubt we are down at the bottom of the European league.</P>
      <P>It is worth while recalling that no Government aid was available in any reasonable form for our fishing industry before 1890 when the Congested Districts Board was founded.  For many years fisheries and agriculture have been linked and the earlier attempts to set up agricultural training schools in this country in the middle of the last century were blocked by the free trade policy adopted by the British Government under pressure from their consumers and some of their agriculturalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other countries Government support for the industry was given at a much earlier time.  It may not have been in <Col N="657" /> grants for boats, but there were training facilities, proper port construction, a whole infrastructure which supported fishing industries in other countries in Europe, but nothing was done in this direction here before 1890.  Another reason we are behind is that the most productive part of our fishing coastline, the west coast, was, at the beginning of this century, an area of considerable deprivation. If the industry was to be developed it needed massive Government aid and this was not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of our State we have made some rather tardy efforts to develop the industry, given its full potential. I welcome this Bill to increase the support.  In my home area of East Cork I see large Rumanian, Russian and East German factory ships in Ballycotton Bay every week of the summer, these ships being roughly the same size as the B&amp;I ferry vessel which goes from Cork to Pembroke.  When one realises the investment, cash and manpower involved we have a tremendous amount of leeway to make up and any increased Government support for our industry is important.  My argument would be that it is not sufficient. Be that as it may, any extra support is to be welcomed although one must realise when talking of an increase from £15 million to £40 million that inflation must be taken into account.  The real increase is about half the actual increase. Inflation is so rampant at the moment that it cuts the increase by about 50 per cent in real terms.  We are working very hard just to stand still and it is important that further Government support in terms of finance for the purchase of boats, for boat building, for the purchase of equipment, for rehabilitation of the existing piers and wharfing facilities, for providing ice-plants, fish treatment plants and fish processing plants should be permanently and regularly under consideration and the sums of money involved should be upgraded regularly.</P>
    <P>I refer to one or two of the items mentioned by previous speakers, in particular the argument over drift net licences and our salmon stocks.  I have been, in general, opposed to the issue of extra drift netting licences on the grounds that our <Col N="658" /> salmon stocks are in danger.  It is generally agreed that they are in danger from a number of sources, one of which is the increase in drift netting.  Although Senator Fitzgerald seems to suggest there is not much illegal fishing, I would say that the opposite is true: that there is still a great deal of illegal fishing and that is one of the factors which is seriously contributing to our dwindling salmon stocks. One must also say, at once, that it is not the only factor because the salmon or the sea trout, as everybody knows, has two parts to his life cycle: he spends a considerable part of his life in the fresh water and then returns to the fresh water at the end of his life to spawn, but he also spends a considerable time at sea in the salt water.</P>
    <P>Two other factors which have contributed greatly to the dwindling of our salmon stocks are the large increases in pollution of our rivers, mainly by agricultural effluent, which is really very serious, and also the drainage schemes. A large drainage scheme can upset the spawning beds and the fish may never be able to spawn properly again if the whole river bed is cut out, as it has been in many of our rivers.  We much balance the need for proper drainage with the need for spawning beds to be preserved so that the fish can come and spawn.  It is still not definitely determined which of these factors is the most debilitating in terms of our salmon stocks.</P>
    <P>I am one of those people who believe that we are in the greatest danger of killing the goose that laid the golden egg. Senator Fitzgerald will be aware of what has happened in certain areas of the east coast of North America where, instead of issuing further drift net licences, the Government bought out all existing drift net licences and closed down drift netting altogether.  It is one of the difficult areas.</P>
    <P>Fishermen deserve a good living.  They do not have it easy.  It is a dangerous life and they deserve a return on their efforts and their investments.  On the other hand, one cannot allow a situation to develop when our salmon dwindle to zero.  Then, whatever Senator Fitzgerald feels about the home-grown variety of salmon, it will be the only one on the <Col N="659" /> market.  There will be no competition and there is permanent danger of this.  This is something that the Minister and all of his successors must keep vigilantly under supervision.  There have been cycles in the catches and in the number of fish spawning.  At times it looks as if there is a permanent decrease, then the numbers seem miraculously to come up again.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the regular reports from the fisheries, such as the Foyle Fisheries Commission, there is no doubt that overall there has been a very marked decrease there.  The Foyle Fisheries Commissioners indicate that in their opinion the main cause of the decrease is the extra netting, some of which is done legally and a good deal illegally in the estuary and just offshore.  One has to take their opinion very seriously.  I would be very worried about the issue of drift net licences, given that the boats are so much more powerful and capable of catching enormous hauls of salmon.  Indeed, they are capable of wiping out our stocks altogether.</P>
    <P>The matter of monofilament nets has been raised and Senator Loughrey has pointed out it is not illegal to import monofilament nets.  There is a tremendous trade in these nets and they are being used widely, although they are illegal. It is difficult to provide an adequate policing system for fisheries, particularly for sea fisheries.  There is a vast amount of illegal fishing going on and the position between the monofilament nets and the other nylon nets is not quite as straightforward as Senator Loughrey would have us believe.  I believe that they do tend to catch everything.  The reason for their ban is that they tend to catch on a wipeout basis.  This is a matter that requires very deep consideration.  If they are not to be used in this country, why are they to be imported?  What grounds are there for allowing the import of monofilament nets if it is illegal to fish with them?  The situation is ludicrous and should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>This is a Money Bill and it is not up to this House to amend it.  We either pass it <i>in toto</i> or we reject it.  There is no doubt that everybody will support the development <Col N="660" /> of our fisheries, however far behind we are.  It is at least a small measure towards helping us to progress.  There is no doubt that there is still great potential. It is essential for us not to get too far behind our European competitors and to ensure that at least some small proportion of the benefits of having this great fishing ground off our coast within our territorial waters actually falls to Irish hands and does not entirely go abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddieByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill.  It is in essence a Finance Bill, but it deals with a very important industry.  It is an industry which has given a lot of employment and has a potential for greater employment in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>We read nowadays of the difficulties which our fishermen face off our coasts and it is up to whatever Government are in power to listen carefully to these problems and to try to improve the lot of our fishermen.  We are fortunate that in our midst we have a fisherman who spoke eloquently today and touched on many aspects of the life of the fisherman and his needs.  I refer to my colleague, Senator Tom Fitzgerald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishing industry in recent years has been bedevilled by a number of factors. I live by the sea on the west coast and I see it from an insider's point of view.  The biggest problem our fishermen have to face is the encroachment of foreign trawlers who are raping the rich harvest beds of our coast.  When we entered the EEC this was one area where we felt we would have a problem, and things are working in that direction.  It will take a great effort by our Minister to ensure that in the common fisheries policy, which is being negotiated at the moment, the best deal possible is secured for Irish fishermen.  There is a dwindling supply of fish and a greater number of foreign vessels are encroaching off our coast.  All of this adds up to less income for our fishermen.  Added to that there is the increased cost of buying fishing boats and the necessary equipment.  There is also the cost of diesel and the cost of labour.  Therefore, fishermen at this time are experiencing a very difficult period. There is an onus on this State to ensure <Col N="661" /> that the great potential for employment is realised and that every help and encouragement is given to our fishermen.</P>
    <P>Bord Iascaigh Mhara, a semi-State body who deal mainly with the problems and the facets of fishing, have done tremendous work down through the years and will continue to do so.  They have helped in giving an advisory service to fishermen and providing aids and loans to fishermen.  I would like to compliment them on their great efforts.</P>
    <P>There is one area about which I am not too happy, that is, the assistance to small boatyards.  Over the last two or three years a large number of small boatyards, which were giving good employment in small areas along the west coast, have closed down.  This has been contributed to by the fact that it was very difficult for small fishermen to secure grants for building boats.  I was associated with one boatyard and we failed to get a single grant from Bord Iascaigh Mhara for the building of a boat.  We survived for a number of years and eventually dwindled out.</P>
    <P>In my estimation there was far too much red tape in the processing of applications and possibly too much competition between the boatyards themselves. There was one clause in relation to an application for a boat-building grant where an applicant had to receive three quotations.  The applicant then proceeded to visit all the boatyards and play off one against the other and thus deflate the price of the boat.  When the application reached the headquarters in Dublin it took a long time for a decision to be taken.  I was of the opinion at that time that there was very little money for the building of boats.</P>
    <P>I read in a newspaper lately that the Minister made the remark that fishermen were now more keen on building steel boats.  From my experience fishermen were anxious to have boats under 50 feet built of timber.  It is not possible to build the larger boats of timber alone and it is necessary to use steel.  There was a market there for timber boats under 50 feet and that market was not helped sufficiently.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in the area of <Col N="662" /> shellfish.  I was glad to hear Senator Fitzgerald talk about the help and assistance the Tralee fishermen got from the Government and FEOGA towards the development of oysterbeds in that area. At Clarinbridge in Galway we have one of the finest oysterbeds in western Europe.  This oysterbed is partially public and partially private and many people will remember the controversy which raged before the 1981 general election over the purchase by the State of an oysterbed, known as the St. George Oysterbed. This bed now lies idle and in need of harvesting to make it fruitful for the years to come.  There are hundreds of acres of fishing beds in that area in need of development.  The Clarinbridge Fishermen's Co-operative have been trying with very limited resources to develop this area.  The time has come for an injection of capital and advisory support to the fishermen to develop this bed and continue one of our great traditions, the sampling of the Clarinbridge oyster. I would ask the Minister to make a special effort this year to assist the efforts to develop this bed.</P>
    <P>I make one further point regarding assistance towards the development of small piers.  It seems to be impossible to get money to develop a small pier in the west.  The amount of money required would be very small and it would be of tremendous benefit to the fishermen in the areas concerned.  I appeal again for assistance towards the development of small piers.</P>
    <P>Acquaculture is an aspect of fisheries that has become very topical in recent years and there is great scope for development in this area, but not enough advice or assistance or attention has been given to it by the State.  There are very few harbours or bays along the west coast where we could not have a viable acquaculture industry which would give part-time employment to a number of people in the area.  All along our western coast farmers are living on small means, assisted by the State, but their income could be greatly increased by providing them with the know-how and the financial assistance to develop acquaculture.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing this <Col N="663" /> Bill before us.  It was originally introduced by the former Minister.  I would like to compliment him on his concern for the fishing industry.  I know he is committed to it and I have read some statements he has made on the matter.  I am quite sure that we can expect some developments in the whole area of fishing during his time in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him every personal success in that office, however long or short its tenure may be.  It gives me great pleasure to speak on this Bill, involved as I am with a maritime constituency and having many connections with maritime constituencies in various parts of the country.  I would not say every maritime constituency that I have visited would necessarily display a connection with me but I could possibly at another time justify such a statement.  There is much salt water in my veins and I have a great interest in maritime affairs but I am not clear about the attitude of the sea to myself.  I think it would be only fair, and to place in proper perspective any comments that I have to make about the sea and maritime policy, if I were to admit that I share with the late Admiral Nelson a certain propensity when in close contact with the sea to acquire a patriotic shade of green and also to an urgent drive to separate myself from whatever useful food I may have recently acquired.</P>
      <P>It is interesting in listening to the contributions made by the various Senators here, and particularly to Senator Fitzgerald, who comes directly to this House, one might say, with salt water on his boots, to notice how many aspects of national policy and life are affected by the sea.  It serves to underline the fact that we seem to lack a national maritime policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned, I was speaking of the need for a national maritime policy.  It is a curious reflection on our history that, despite the fact that we are an island, the entire maritime sphere has been neglected, in effect, by successive Governments.  This is not to forget that there have been attempts from time to time by the more progressive Governments to address themselves to this problem, but there has been a lack of a coherent national approach to this sphere.</P>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak on a Bill concerned with Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Bord Iascaigh Mhara is an example of how a semi-State body can work and can work effectively.  There is a certain tendency at this time to attack the principle and practice of many semi-State bodies.  It would be no harm if, during the course of this debate, we underlined the fact that Bord Iascaigh Mhara is an example of success in this area. Obviously, they have been a considerable success in the areas of training for fishermen, providing grants and encouragement and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, I would like to mention here the role of the Board in giving publicity to fish as a food.  It would seem curious to the outsider, to people who are not familiar with our country, to note that sea food did not occupy the place in our national cuisine that one might expect.  One thinks, for example, of Japan, a country similar in many ways to our own, in the sense that it is a collection of islands.  It is very much embedded in the sea and sea food occupies a part in Japanese diet and cuisine far beyond what one would expect in another island community such as ours.  There are other reasons for that.  Whereas they may be similar to us in respect of the fertility of their island, and the amount of arable land available as a proportion of the total <Col N="665" /> land space, their situation is totally different from our ours and they are forced by their circumstances to turn to the sea in a way that we have not been.</P>
    <P>But my point here is to underline the role of the board in popularising seafood here, and the national fish cookery competitions have played a very important part in doing this.  I can speak with some experience in that area, not as a competitor but as an honorary judge and connoisseur in my own school, where my advice and expertise on the subject are frequently called in in the preliminary stages of preparation for these competitions. In this context, I would like the Minister to comment on the availability of seafood, or of the raw materials for seafood in the more inland areas of our country.</P>
    <P>The Minister in a personal capacity, not being totally separated from the maritime areas of our country but somebody whose commitment is in the inland area, would be familiar with the difficulty that people in inland areas often encounter in getting hold of fresh fish when they need it.  In this respect &mdash; maybe in this respect alone &mdash; we suffer from our predominantly Christian heritage, in that for a long time fish was associated with Fridays and with penance.  This point was made adequately before and we are moving away from that &mdash; not least as a result of the endeavours of the Second Vatican Council.  There may still be a residual trace of this attitude that in some way seafood is an unpleasant form of necessary or penitential diet.  I congratulate the board on their effective publicity in this matter of diversifying our diet, which is good for our health, seafood being good for the development of the brain and the intellect.  It provides a diversion from the possibly less healthy animal foods to which we tend to be addicted traditionally in our culture.</P>
    <P>So far as training is concerned, I refer to an incident in which I was involved some time ago.  In the course of my professional responsibilities, a lady student approached me to seek information about the possiblity of securing training as a trawler person.  I was not surprised at this &mdash; at least I exhibited no surprise <Col N="666" />&mdash; and I proceeded to make inquiries, whereupon I was informed by the board that it was not possible to provide training for young ladies in their scheme because there were not available to such people separate toilet facilities.  I felt that this was not an excuse that need necessarily rest and we discussed the matter with the board and also with the Employment Equality Agency.  The net result.  I am glad to say, is that some months later I received a brochure from Bord Iascaigh Mhara which displayed prominently upon it a young lady depicted in the course of training for these maritime arts and skills, and the matter now seems to be resolved.  I would like to congratulate the board and the responsible Minister for their intelligent and progressive attitude in this respect.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made here to the importance of developing our natural resources, our natural advantages in our indented coastline for the purpose of mariculture and aquaculture.  Senators who are more knowledgeable and experienced in these matters have already commented adequately on that.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity for a more coherent and dynamic environmental policy because part of the problem that has arisen in a number of cases here, but also severely in other countries and, in particular in Japan, has been the impact on sea fisheries of a failure to take adequate measures to protect the environment against toxic substances &mdash; toxic industrial waste and ordinary pollution arising from human dwellings.  In this respect I would mention briefly, as I mentioned in another debate, the pollution problem of the Lakes of Killarney which is more an inland question.  We should be very careful to ensure, in our industrial development and in our development of human habitation, that we do not jeopardise this important natural resource and that we take effective measures to see that this potential natural resource is not jeopardised.</P>
    <P>I would like also to join Senators who mentioned the lifeboat service and their vital role in providing some sort of security or guarantee for people who are engaged in fishing, which is a dangerous, <Col N="667" /> hazardous task.  One feels, from time to time, that the lifeboat service has to secure its own survival and continuance and maintenance to much by its own efforts.  It is necessary, particularly at this time of year, to mention that the lifeboat service is often abused by ordinary members of the public who set out to sea in vessels which are not adequate for their purpose and without the necessary skills and experience, leading to the calling out of lifeboats to rescue them, when those lifeboat crews should be resting, or should only be called out for serious matters. The Minister might well, if he feels that this is within his sphere of activity, make some public announcement to that effect, or arrange for the appropriate colleague in the Government to make a public announcement or to give publicity to this matter, so that people who very legitimately and quite rightly set out in vessels for the purpose of leisure should not do so in such a way as sometimes to jeopardise the lives and certainly the energies and limited resources of our lifeboat system.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by referring briefly to the problem posed for the board and for our fishermen by the presence close to our shores of boats and vessels &mdash; substantial vessels as Senator West has already indicated &mdash; from other countries. Whereas as good Europeans, we would not take the view that the resources of this part of Europe should be exclusively for our own use, although the penetration of waters that are ours by right, leads to endangering the livelihood of our native people; the Government should adopt a more serious approach to this matter.  It is with some sadness that we note the lukewarm and deferential attitude of the Government, and particularly of the Minister, in negotiations with the European Community, on the subject of sea fishing limits.</P>
    <P>It looks peculiar when we look back. The present Taoiseach, on 27 October 1976, during the course of a Dáil debate on EEC policy, indicated that it would be a gross dereliction of duty and a betrayal of responsibility by the then Coalition Government if they were to settle for <Col N="668" /> anything less than a 50-mile limit.  In the same debate, Deputy Molloy, known for his solidarity with the present Taoiseach, made the same kind of commitment of the Fianna Fáil Party to this limit.  It is of significance that at the same time the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald, in the course of his responsibilities on behalf of the National Coalition Government and on behalf of the country, succeeded in negotiating with the other countries of the Community to secure a special position for our country with regard to fisheries and in upholding our special position.</P>
    <P>I am saddened by the attitude of the present Government in this respect.  It is of little use voting substantial funds to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and having a debate of this kind if the Government, in the course of their relationship with other countries of the Community, give a general licence to the ships of other countries to penetrate almost up to our maritime doorsteps to remove from our fishermen the natural resources which belong to us in the first instance.  The attitude of certain supporters of the Government, in the course of votes in the Dáil on this issue, indicates a kind of cynicism and neglect for the interests of the fishing working class which accords ill with their statements in publicity documents and elsewhere that they regard themselves as the protectors and guardians of the working class and title themselves as The Workers Party.  I welcome the Bill in general terms.  Senator West already indicated that in real terms the money being provided here may not be in line with the value of money, taking inflation into account.  We approve the work of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and hope for a continuance of this work.</P>

      <P>I wish to welcome the Minister to the House.  I come from a family which has been involved on the retail side of the fishing industry for 80 years, and I look forward to the fishing industry growing from strength to strength.  Referring to Senator Loughrey's speech earlier today, if at this time two resignations were to take place from the board it would undermine the board <Col N="669" /> and the industry as a whole when delicate negotiations are taking place.  It would be better to wait for the Minister to make the appropriate amendment.  Senator Fitzgerald covered the industry in an excellent speech.  I would like to see the industry take on a more forceful marketing programme, one of promotion.  If that took place, both on international and home markets, it would secure better prices for our fishermen.  I agree with Senator O'Connell's comment on the nutritional value of fish, and I would like to see a fair share of money going towards that programme.</P>

      <P>I should first of all like to thank Senators who expressed good wishes to me on my appointment as Minister for Fisheries and I will always be available to give assistance on the various issues referred to.  I am grateful for the very useful suggestions expressed on both sides.  This Bill has given me the opportunity to get the views of Members of both Houses who have detailed practical knowledge and experience of the fishing industry and who have a valuable contribution to make.  I will always be grateful for those views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of very important areas were touched upon and I will try to deal with them as quickly as possible.  Senator Fitzgerald spoke of the issue of salmon licences and the difficulties that are being experienced by fishermen in getting drift net licences, particularly, in various parts of the country.  I understand that in the past there may have been an imbalance in the way in which licences were issued because various boards of conservators <Col N="670" /> issued licences without taking an overall national view of the situation.  With the emergence of the Central Fisheries Board and the restructured regional boards, it will be possible in the future to get an overall view of the national scene in relation to the issue of salmon drift net licences.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that a decline has taken place in salmon stocks year after year, measures will have to be taken to halt that decline.  It is recognised and well known that the commercial nets that are being operated around the coasts are taking the major proportion of the salmon catches and I, on my appointment, spoke to the manager of each of the regional boards.  I pointed out to them the importance of the strictest enforcement of conservation measures in relation to salmon drift net fishing.  It is my hope that in as far as it is possible the issue of drift net licences will be curtailed.  We will endeavour to do this, at the same time bearing in mind that in certain areas there has been a tradition of and a long standing livelihood enjoyed by people involved in drift net fishing.  As far as possible, we should endeavour to facilitate those people who have been traditionally engaged in salmon fishing, depending on it for a livelihood.  Keeping all this in mind the total number of drift net licences issued, assuming that there may be imbalances from region to region, will not be increased in the future.</P>
    <P>Anyone engaged in the fishing industry will realise that we cannot continuously fish out our valuable national salmon resource or allow a situation to continue through which the stocks of salmon are declining year after year.  We have to deal with it through conservation measures at home and through the European Community, in so far as they can help.  Any effort the Community can make to curtail activities of people outside of our jurisdiction will be welcomed.  Through the Community we have succeeded in curtailing the fishing activities for salmon on the high seas by having restrictions imposed which will be operated by the Community on the catches of salmon by Greenland, and in particular the Faroe Islands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> Many fishermen here have been concerned that a trend in recent years has developed whereby fishermen, especially in the Faroe Islands, who were not engaged in salmon fishing have engaged in that activity.  Because this is damaging stocks of salmon which were reared here, and are therefore our salmon, I believe we have an obligation to seek Community aid to have this restricted in so far as it is possible to do it.  Restrictions have been brought in by the curtailment of the tonnage which the Faroese are allowed to catch.  We have to monitor this very carefully to ensure that their substantially reduced quotas will be complied with.  I am keeping in close communication with the Community and with outside interests who are involved with salmon fishing in the Faroes to see that the restrictions imposed there by the Community will be maintained.</P>
    <P>In relation to salmon protection generally, there has been concern by many people at a work to rule which has been going on in the past few weeks because of the disagreement between the regional boards and the staff.  I am happy to be able to announce that that dispute has been resolved and that normal working is about to be resumed.</P>
    <P>There were comments on the negotiations taking place on the common fisheries policy.  It is well known that these negotiations have been taking place for a long number of years, and on occasion people felt agreement was near, but for one reason or another agreement was not reached.  As I said earlier today, I see the emergence of a common fisheries policy as being central to and the cornerstone of future development in the Irish fishing industry.  I have been in Brussels this week at the Council meeting, but regretfully not much progress was made. Nevertheless, another Council meeting has been arranged for 22 July, and a high level working party of the Community are engaged in discussions leading up to that Council meeting.  Some of the minor details which make up the policy, which are important to us, have been agreed upon and are more or less being held in abeyance pending the resolution of the <Col N="672" /> major problems, which will be the access question and the question of the various quotas and total allowable catches.  I think we can get agreement on these points at the next Council meeting and we will have the basis of a policy which will be satisfactory from our point of view and which will enable the industry to consolidate its position and to expand and develop in the future.</P>
    <P>We have a basis for negotiation on the proposals which are on the table, a basis on which we can make some further progress, but I would like to give some details of the proposal we have in relation to the limits.  The proposal provides for the freezing or the non-user of some of the rights which member states enjoy in our six to 12-mile zone.  They do not intend or wish to give up these additional and historic rights.  Under the proposal before the Council, some of those rights will be frozen and will be subject to further debate; the proposal is designed to reduce the rights being enjoyed by the UK on the west and south coasts and by Belgium on the west, south-east and the east coasts and by the French on the north and north-west coasts; by Germany and the Netherlands on the south and east coasts.  It would also eliminate the rights granted on the south and east coasts for Denmark, which was given in the Treaty of Accession to the European Community.  It is not clear whether we will be able to maintain this position, but we will be endeavouring to maintain this position and we will seek extensions in other areas.  We would have an exclusive 12-mile zone between Erris Head in Mayo and Lough Foyle.  It would be an exclusive 12-mile area.</P>
    <P>This would mean that the French who have had traditional rights there would be freezing their rights.  It would give the area north-west of Killybegs an exclusive 12-mile zone which is a far better improvement than any situation we have had up until now.  Similarly, on the south-west coast, from north Kerry to Mizen Head in Cork, we would have a very important area which would be exclusively a 12-mile zone.  The area westwards of Castletownbere, which is one of our major fishing harbours, would <Col N="673" /> have a guaranteed 12-mile exclusive zone.</P>
    <P>We have not adopted a policy of defeat on this.  We are prepared to negotiate the best possible deal.  The present proposals are much improved on anything that we have had up until now.  Nevertheless, we will endeavour in the negotiations which are taking place, and which will be continued on 22 July, to keep our 12-mile areas as exclusive as possible.</P>
    <P>Another question which has arisen and which has been discussed at some length is that of quotas and the total allowable catch for various species, which are very important for us.  I expressed to the Commission my disappointment at the fact that the total allowable catches and quotas in the various species are unacceptable from our point of view.  If I give an indication of one particular species which is of great importance to us, Senators might understand the situation better. The proposal originally from the Commission was that the Irish quota for mackerel for this year would be 56,000 tonnes. I made my feelings known both to the Commission and to the Council that this would be a totally unsatisfactory quota from our point of view.  Late on Tuesday night the Commission, in a revised proposal on quotas, submitted a proposal which would increase the quota for our mackerel from the 56,000 tonnes to 80,000 tonnes.  This is a significant improvement on the quota for mackerel, but it would be our wish to get as much as possible because I realise it is of great importance to Senator Loughrey and to the people in Donegal who are heavily engaged in the mackerel industry.</P>
    <P>We have got to point out as well, regrettable as it is, that the stocks of most of the traditional species Irish fishermen have fished for are now threatened. Salmon stocks are now under severe pressure. It is apparent to almost everyone and to the fishermen themselves that we cannot continue to fish mackerel stocks indiscriminately.  We have to keep in mind that unless we produce conservation measures here and take care to ensure that the stocks we have are protected we will be threatening the whole future of the mackerel industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> Conservation measures must be taken, not only by ourselves but by the members of the Community who also have responsibility. Other member states of the Community have not been playing the game in relation to the level of their fishing efforts in the past number of years.  I will be making that point quite clear to the Community.  If we expect our fishermen to take conservation measures we will equally expect other members of the Community to take similar measures in the areas in which they have traditional rights.</P>
    <P>The new quota proposals which are on the table are an improvement on the situation which pertained up until now, but we are still not satisfied with them.  I have pointed this out and will continue to point it out.  I will endeavour to get the best possible quotas, bearing in mind that other issues as well need to be attended to by us.</P>
    <P>The development of aquaculture and mariculture was advocated by numerous Senators.  Senator Fitzgerald spoke of the Tralee Bay Oyster Fishery.  As is well known, since 1978 we have been getting grants from FEOGA through the Community for aquaculture and for general fishery development.  The total grants from FEOGA for 1982 will be in the region of £10 million, and about £500,000 has been granted for the Tralee Bay Oyster Fishery.</P>
    <P>Senator Byrne referred to the St. George Fishery in Galway.  I had a meeting recently with the oyster fishermen in the Clarinbridge area.  I pointed out to them that we would give the same attention to the Clarinbridge project as we have to the Tralee Bay project.  The fishermen themselves have responsibility here and we will give them all the assistance we can by way of providing a development plan for the fishery there.  We will also help out if the co-operative is established there and which will be organised in the same way as the Tralee Bay Oyster Fishery.  From our point of view, we have purchased the St. George Oyster Fishery.  It is my intention to develop it and we have proper management proposals for the development and <Col N="675" /> expansion of the beds in the future.  Of course, the local people have a responsibility here as well.  I had a meeting with them recently and I am prepared to meet them again.  Every effort will be made to promote the development of aquacultural activities and to provide, in so far as it is possible, the back-up service and the proper management and development programmes for these aquacultural projects.</P>
    <P>The potential is there.  The National Board for Science and Technology in a recently published document have highlighted the areas in which there is potential. They have also highlighted the number of jobs that can be created by a properly developed aquacultural industry. There is no doubt that there are job opportunities and benefits from an aquacultural programme.  At the same time one has to be cautious.  One has to ensure that in this type of specialised and skilled area the best possible scientific and management expertise will be employed. Unless it is done carefully and well, irreparable damage can be done in many other areas.</P>
    <P>I would appeal for the co-operation of the various groups who are interested in aquacultural projects.  From our point of view, in the Department and in An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, we would be willing to help out in any way possible and meet any organisations, especially co-operatives, who would be interested in plans for aquacultural developments in any areas which are suitable for that type of development.</P>
    <P>Senator West mentioned the need for more investment in the fishing industry. The sum voted for fisheries this year was £19.5 million, a considerable amount of money bearing in mind the difficult financial situation.  The same Senator spoke of other problems which could cause damage, such as pollution and effluent control. I said recently that people who are involved in projects such as aquaculture need to be careful and be familiar with the dangers that can arise from the indiscriminate disposal of waste, or pouring silage effluent into rivers.  We had a number of very damaging cases where almost <Col N="676" /> complete stocks were wiped out this year, not because of any wish on anyone's part to do this, but because people were not fully familiar with the damage that can be done to fisheries through this type of indiscriminate silage making on the banks of rivers.  I have made numerous statements in an endeavour to bring home to people the damage that can be done.  Many organisations could play a part here and help us in the drive to eliminate this type of activity.</P>
    <P>The question of damage to stocks through the use of monofilament nets was raised and a suggestion was made to me that we could introduce a total ban on the importation of monofilament nets.  It certainly would be desirable, but the difficulty is that monofilament net is used in more areas than salmon fishing. Experienced fishermen here will know that for gill nets and other types of fishing activities, expecially for cod, monofilament net is used and would have to be imported for this reason.  You cannot impose a ban on all monofilament nets without creating problems in other areas of fishing activity.  At the same time, I will have the question examined to see if it would be possible to have some further restrictions on the importation of monofilament nets.  No doubt, they are most damaging and every effort must be made to try to ban their use.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators were concerned about infrastructural development and the need for proper harbour facilities and proper development in our fish landing places.  I agree with many of the views expressed.  In areas where fish are landed, especially in small isolated areas which are remote and difficult of access, small amounts of money can provide important works.  I am very conscious of this.  In the past the policy has been to develop the five major harbour centres and, this year, something in the region of £4.15 million will be spent on the development of harbours generally.</P>
    <P>Most of the allocation of money has gone into the development of the five major fishing harbour centres, which I feel has been the right policy for the development of the industry.  However, we have come to the stage now where we <Col N="677" /> can have a look at the secondary ports and I visited a number of them recently. I saw the problems of fishermen, and the dangers that are involved, and the importance of building up secondary harbours where there has been an increase in fishing activity over the past number of years, and where the facilities are not adequate and, in some cases, are dangerous.  Once the major centres are finished we can direct our attention to some of the medium-sized or secondary harbours. The difficulty is that along the whole coastline we have about 850 landing places and, to be realistic about it, there is a limit to the amount of available resources.  We have to try to spend the resources in the areas which will be of most benefit having regard to the amount of fishing effort involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Loughrey was concerned about the synchrolift in Killybegs.  My information is that the equipment is in hand for the lift and the construction of the platform will be undertaken shortly by the Office of Public Works.  I am not aware of any delay.  Perhaps the Senator could check it out and if there is a delay we can talk again about it.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred to the importance of safety, and to the work being done by the voluntary organisations such as the National Lifeboat Institute and many others.  As Minister I referred on numerous occasions since my appointment to the dangers involved for fishermen. We have only to look at some recent tragedies to realise the risk at which fishermen stand.  We must try to minimise this risk.  No effort should be spared to see that all the safety facilities and equipment needed by fishermen are provided. A working party involving the Department of Transport mainly, and some people from my own Department, are looking at the whole area and the views expressed here today will be brought to their notice.  I should like to pay tribute to those people who have given their time and energy voluntarily, and at times risked their own lives, when there are accidents at sea.  I want to put on record our deep appreciation for the work they have done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> Senator O'Connell referred to the work done by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara who have taken a fair share of abuse. Politicians do too.  I join with Senator O'Connell in expressing my gratitude to the board and the staff of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and to encourage them to press ahead with the work they are doing. I am aware that theirs is a very difficult task.  Reference was made to the need to promote more sales of fish at home.  Reference was made by Senator O'Connell to the difficulty being experienced in inland areas in getting fish supplies, especially fresh fish.  Coming from a maritime constituency I can assure him that not only is it a problem in inland areas, but it is a problem in the maritime constituencies. It has been said that it is often more difficult to get fresh fish in Killybegs than it is in Dublin.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are aware of this.  There is always the difficulty when you are dealing mainly in the fresh fish market, as we are, that you have problems with continuity of supply, and so on.  The main thrust of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara's activities from here on will certainly have to be in the marketing area.  At a recent function which I attended in Avondale I highlighted the value of fish, and I suggested that a herring a day might keep the doctor away.  I will circulate copies of that speech.</P>
    <P>Senator Loughrey referred to approval for extra finances for boat-building, and the problems being experienced in the boatyards.  I, too, am conscious of the problems in the boatyards.  I am not certain that, even an expanded fishery policy in the future which would necessitate the provision of additional boats and additional landing capacity, would in itself resolve the problems in the boatyards. Many of the boatyards have been in difficulties. Some of them have closed down.  I am not convinced that the development of the fishing industry alone can resolve the problems in the boatyards. They can be resolved only by restructuring and rationalisation of the boatyards themselves and areas other than the fishing areas.  The yards are now privately owned.  The owners of a number of boatyards are having discussions with foreign <Col N="679" /> companies in an effort to produce joint ventures.</P>
    <P>The point was made that if we built all the boats at home we could save more jobs in the yards.  In fact, 96 per cent of the boats built for fisheries in the past seven years were built at home.  Certainly it is a cause of concern that there are redundancies and difficulties in the boatyards. As I have said, I am not certain that even an expanded fishery fleet will solve all the problems there.  I had discussions with the boat builders on numerous occasions.  We have a problem this year because the allocation of funds made by my predecessor is not adequate to meet some of the applications for boats which have been approved.  This is the subject of discussion and I hope to have some results as soon as possible.  The question of the provision of additional grant assistance is being looked at actively by me at present.  Grants for the reconstruction of boats, and grants for the improvement and modernisation of vessels, are already available from BIM. If there are any particular problems perhaps we can talk about them later and see if we can resolve them.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I found the debate today most encouraging, most constructive and helpful. I should like to thank Senators for the very patient way in which they accepted my script at the start of the debate.  In fact, it was not a script.  They were speaking notes.  It was not meant to be a script for circulation.  They were speaking notes which I put together for the purposes of this Bill.</P>

It is always in order to go a little wide on Second Stage.  In the House, the practice is that the Chair allows a fairly wide-ranging debate.  But when we come to the sections on Committee Stage we have to keep to the actual scope of the section, and section 2 deals with the short title and collective citation.

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, I wonder if your attention has been drawn to the very irritating buzz in the House.  I am prepared to concede that some of it may be due to my somewhat impaired faculties, temporarily, I hasten to add.  If anything could be done about it, it would be a great relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the points I had been making yesterday was the alarmingly rapid rate of destruction of our national monuments, and indispensable to any serious attempt to arrest this is the question of surveying what we have.  In the long-term, there has been an archaeological survey going for 50 years, but it has been conducted on a kind of man and boy basis and is very slow indeed in its processes. It is good to note that in what I might call the failed Bruton budget, a substantial sum was set aside for a rapid survey which is now going on.  In fact, University College, Cork, has been given a substantial grant to survey and enumerate the archaeological position of national monuments in Cork and Kerry.  I am glad to say that, somewhat contrary to people's expectations, when the Bruton budget failed the incoming Fianna Fáil administration retained this generous grant. Would the Minister like me to repeat that?  I have paid an unwonted tribute to the present administration.  Actually, I am fairly well disposed to the present administration, apart from one or two of <Col N="682" /> the personnel.  The point of the survey is that only a proper survey can give information to developers, regional planners and local authorities.  So it is very important, pending the setting up of the national council, that we continue with effective surveys.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the intimation in the Bill that a new National Monuments Bill is on the way.  Then I went on to the National Museum, which is, I suppose, an gad is giorra don scornach, because it is outside our door, so to speak, and we are so much aware of it and its problems. I made the point that it is doubtful whether this policy of sending the treasures of Ireland abroad is a wise one.  I should like to repeat that today.  Most serious consideration should be given to this.  If it is still in operation, so to speak, when the new council are set up, that is something they will have to consider very seriously.</P>
    <P>A national museum should be a comprehensive museum and, ideally, all in the same place.  It is undesirable that what we have in the line of folk material should now be mouldering peacefully away in mouldering buildings in Daingean.  I remember being a member of an appointments board to appoint someone to the museum with a speciality in folk life.  This must have been four or five years ago or more and, at the time, there were great expectations that we would have a meaningful folk section in the museum.  Alas, there is no progress to be reported, only the reverse.</P>
    <P>Other Senators have referred and will, I am sure, refer to the lamentable conditions obtaining in the National Museum.  It is ritualistic to pay tribute to the staff despite their difficulties, and I do that most sincerely.  What can they do?  They are up against all kinds of handicaps. For example, with reference to Senator O'Connell's comment on the canoe which was given a lot of publicity in the past few days, there was a post instituted as keeper of conservation and my information is that this post is unfilled.  I do not see how we can be serious in our expressions of concern for the National Museum if we are prepared <Col N="683" /> to tolerate the inadequate staffing of the Irish antiquities section.</P>
    <P>It is no good deploring the state of the National Museum unless the new council address themselves to the state of the museum.  No matter what money is poured into the existing building, it will not do any good.  Money alone is not the problem.  The present location of the museum is unsatisfactory.  The conditions are archaic.  For example, the condition of the air in the museum is a matter of concern.  There is no process for air cleaning, I understand.  Nor can such a system be instituted in the existing building.  This results in layers of dust and generally deleterious conditions.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of disappointment then that the Minister's speech, welcome though it was in other respects, gave no indication that a new museum is being contemplated.  A new museum we must have, unless we all move out of Leinster House, and even then the complex of buildings is not suitable.  I wonder whether we have lost our chance; or whether a chance has passed us by.  The most desirable site in Kilmainham with its spaciousness, room for car parking, and a mile only from College Green, could be well integrated with the tourist route along the Liffey.  Kilmainham would have been the ideal site for a new museum.  That opportunity has passed us by and other developments are taking place there.</P>
    <P>The National Museum is the concern of all of us but, to coin a phrase, Dublin is not Ireland, and the existence of regional museums is just as important. There has been some welcome development here in recent years.  There have been remarkably good developments of museums like the one in Monaghan.  I may say without being chauvinistic that the museum in Cork is a very good museum.  It is incidental that I am a member of the museum committee.  If we may distinguish between regional and local museums, it is very laudable that small town communities should want to have their own local museums.  Such museums are really of little use unless there is effective supervision, and unless there is a <Col N="684" /> semi-resident curator, and unless they are in constant contact with whatever expertise there is in the regional museums.</P>
    <P>The new council should turn their attention to setting up this kind of system where you would have a regional museum in Cork advising the local enthusiasts in places like Macroom and, if I may refer to a place nearer to the Minister's heart, Kilmurray, which is the subject of a lovely song we all learned at school.  In Kilmurray they have a remarkably good local museum.  I am afraid the news there does not seem to be good because it needs this kind of constant supervision.  If the resident enthusiast passes on to another world, it is sometimes very difficult to get anyone to keep up that kind of enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>Local museums remind us of another important facet of the whole heritage picture, that is, the existence of local scholarly societies.  It is welcome to note in recent years the proliferation of such societies.  They have added to the whole interest and colour of people's existence in rural Ireland.  I speak with some authority because for 16 or 17 years I edited the journal of the Cork Historical and Archaeological Society, one which is thriving I am glad to say and which could be a model in its mix of educational winter lectures and summer outings for similar societies which may be set up in the future.  I hope that the council when constituted will cast a benevolent eye on such societies and integrate them meaningfully into a general national plan.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the point which I hope will be debated ultimately in the proposed amendment to the Bill, that is, the overriding necessity to set up regional committees.  In section 12 of its First Schedule the Bill empowers the council to create such committee under their general aegis.  It should be more than a kind of desirable option.  It should be given mandatory effect.  I propose to submit an amendment which I hope the Minister will consider favourably.  In fact, in his speech he said he was prepared to consider positively any suggestions we might make, since this is a non-contentious Bill. The council of 15 may well be an excellent <Col N="685" /> council.  They may be deliberately designed to include regional, nationwide representation but, nonetheless, they will sit in Dublin.  The concerns of the capital and the questions in the capital, the museum and so on, will be their primary considerations.  We need regional committees.</P>
    <P>The Bill should contain a provision to institute a regional committee, for example, in Connacht-Ulster, the kind of European constituency there; Leinster, since it includes Dublin will probably get a lot of considerations from the main committee; and of course Munster.  It is not just a question of keeping regional considerations in the forefront of the council's deliberations; it is that each region has, to some extent, its own distinctive heritage which can be appreciated only, if you like, by the regional committee.  I speak, as St. Paul says, as one less wise in matters archaeological, but my understanding is that the heritage in Cork and Kerry is quite distinctive from that in other parts of the country in terms of archaeological monuments. Only a regional committee will deal properly with that.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I propose to submit an amendment making it definite that the council will set up regional committees, each with a considerable degree of autonomy, and each responsible for funding archaeological research, survey which is such an important stage, excavation and museum administration. Among its functions would be effective liaison with local societies, as I have indicated, and of course education and the dissemination of information.  I am going to make a point here which I propose to make again towards the end of my contribution, and that is that it is centrally important that people be educated about their national heritage, that information be disseminated, that each county should have an information centre, perhaps affilitated to the regional museum or the library, where members of the public and tourists and children can have archaeological information presented to them in very palatable form. The existence of regional committees is <Col N="686" /> absolutely essential to the success of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Coming back to a point I made yesterday, I am glad to see that some revision of the National Monuments Act is in sight.  I am also glad to see that the Bill provides new and more realistic penalties than the ones presently obtaining.  We must have realistic penalties.  Otherwise the council will not be taken seriously. We must have new provisions about treasure trove.  Members may recall that in the case of the Derrynaflan find the professional archaeologist took some stick there because, the point was made, it was left to a local enterprising amateur to discover this treasure and somehow professional archaeologists had been amiss in not being aware that it was there. What was not adverted to sufficiently was the damage that can be done by the enterprising amateur because his concern is with unearthing the treasure trove and God only knows what damage he does to the archaeological context in his enthusiasm and in his greed.  So, I hope a new National Monuments Act will contain effective measures to prevent that kind of thing.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that this Bill is here. Senator O'Connell yesterday made a very important point when he linked social unrest and frustration in the country with people's lack of conviction that the heritage is really theirs.  I was opening an art exhibition recently &mdash; indeed the Minister is to perform a similar task shortly &mdash; and I made the point that the arts here are, to a large extent, the preserve of a small clique.  Some of that clique is elitist and snobbish.  There are many people who affect to patronise the arts and do not understand very much about it.  I do not mind that.  Snobbery is welcome if it results in money for the arts.  I prefer the philistine who pretends to be appreciative to the philistine who has no interest at all.  But the point I really want to make is that one of the great reasons for vandalism here is that the youth particularly and a large section of the ordinary people do not identify with the arts, with music, with classical music and so on, even though public money goes into these things.  The same <Col N="687" /> is true of our archaeological heritage. Vandalism is frequently explained in terms of sheer frustration and alienation, as Senator O'Connell said.  People are bewildered and angered because they see things happening around them to which other people have access, which other people find fulfillment in but which is denied to them.</P>
    <P>I come back to my point about education, the dissemination of information.  A national heritage is a contradiction in terms unless the people feel that it is theirs.  So if this proposed council does its job right, if it is provided with money and power &mdash; and it must be provided with money and power &mdash; then this Bill is a very important one.  It is a very important one indeed.  Preserving our heritage is not some kind of option.  It is not something which we may do or may not do as we please.  We have to preserve our heritage if we are to call ourselves at all a civilised country.  If the Bill helps us in that then this is a very important Bill and a very important debate in the Seanad. That is not to say that the office of Public Works, for example, is not doing its job extremely well.  There is a general measure of satisfaction between professional archaeologists and the Office of Public Works.  If the new council is to be no more than another ineffectual semi-State body or another semi-State body which will be ineffectual for lack of teeth, lack of muscle and lack of money, then we might as well stay with the existing system. If it is for real, as they say, then this potentially is a vital important Bill and I am very happy to welcome it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> Even though Senator Murphy and myself may not share membership of the same political party we at least share common membership of the Historical and Archaeological Society.  I would like to begin by referring to the last point he made in regard to the educational activities that should be part of the responsibility of this new council.  Section 4 (1) of the Bill provides that it shall be the general function of the council to identify, preserve, protect, enhance and develop for the benefit of the public and to foster public interest and pride that part of the national heritage to which the functions conferred on the council by or under the provisions of this Act relate.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties that the rising and somewhat turbulent generation face is that they do not seem to understand what all this is about.  Surely for our size we have an extraordinarily rich heritage. For our size it is probably the richest in the world.  I will refer to the various dimensions of that heritage later on.  We have colossal wealth in all areas of our country, and one of the big jobs before the council is to get the people to realise the enormity of the wealth we have and the responsibility that is on each and everyone of us to see that that wealth is preserved and nurtured.  It is a wealth that will surely not be affected by inflation. I know emphasis is placed on it in most schools and educational establishments. But more and more interest must be put on it.  A grá must be built up in all the students through enthusiastic teachers, lecturers and professors, as far as this wealth is concerned.  Otherwise we will continue to have this wanton destruction. All the inhibiting laws that could be framed will be useless if we do not have that love of our heritage that has been handed to us.  It is most important that this council would get in touch with all education establishments and all bodies that foster and mould public opinion.  I made similar remarks recently when speaking on the Litter Bill.  We must get the people behind us so far as preserving our heritage is concerned.</P>
    <P>I commend every speaker who referred to the importance of local councils fostering <Col N="689" /> preservation of our heritage.  I would go so far as to say that there should be a museum in every parish or at least in every district.  When people get interested in such things the amount of enthusiasm that can be worked up is amazing. We see splendid collections of materials and artefacts in other countries.  They are most attracative to tourists from abroad. Why not have them in our own country? Tourists prefer to see those things than to go to noisier and different types of entertainment.  There is a great opening for displaying our heritage here and there throughout the country, and I mean the whole of Ireland, &mdash; the Glens of Antrim and the hills of Donegal or the Glen of Aherlow or the Golden Vale of Munster or the banks of my own lovely Lee.  We should take pride in what was handed down from our forefathers irrespective of what part of the land we live in.  There is a tremendous sense of unity when speaking to people from other parts of Ireland regarding what they have and cherish, and it is very nice to enter into friendly debates with people from all over the thirty-two counties comparing and arguing about in a friendly way the connections that exist and that could possibly have existed between our various heritages.</P>
    <P>I will not go through the various points I have already noted here, because most of them have been referred to already.  It is proposed that 15 Members will be appointed to this council.  They must have the highest educational qualifications, the greatest degree of enthusiasm, and they must be people of vision and understanding. It is important that they come from all parts of this country.  The membership of that council should not be confined to the Republic of Ireland.  This could have a great uniflying influence on our people.  The elements for this unity are there but they have got to be seen and felt.  Those 15 members must have a deep knowledge and understanding of history, archaelogy, and most of all, a deep understanding of the greatest heritage we have, our native language and all that goes with it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is described as an Bille Oidhreachta Náisiúnta, 1982, the <Col N="690" /> National Heritage Bill, 1982.  When the Minister was reading his excellent opening address I jotted down a few dimensions of that great national heritage of ours that ran through my mind.  I put down a note in regard to linguistic heritage; that is of enormous unfathomed wealth.  The same would apply to the musical heritage; we have an extraordinary musical heritage, possibly one of the best endowed of any country of this size. We have a philosophical heritage &mdash; we need not go beyond our sean-fhocail to see that.  We have a legal heritage, a military heritage, a sporting heritage, a literary heritage, a religious heritage, an agricultural heritage, an art heritage and we have what is being dealt with in this Bill. a physical and environmental heritage. The Minister said that the main functions of the council would be to protect, preserve and develop various aspects of our national heritage, or could it be done by calling this Bill the National Heritage Bill, No. 1?  If something like that is not done people might think that the only national heritage we have is the physical and environmental one.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent Bill.  I commend the Minister on his excellent speech and at this late stage welcome him to the House &mdash; I should have done it earlier.  Is maith ann é.  Fear cumasach is ea é a chuireann an-suim sna nithe seo.  Mar fhocal scoir, caithfidh mé tagairt a dhéanamh do rud eile.</P>
    <P>I hope this council will give recognition to the royal county of Meath, so richly endowed.  When will Tara and the area around it get the recognition it so richly deserves?  I have been hoping and praying for this since I was a young boy and I thought I would already have seen the day when it would happen.  Meath and Tara are adjacent to Dublin Airport in the heart of the county and would become one of the most famous places, second only to Blarney.  It would be a wonderful attraction, royal Tara of the kings.  It is still nearly impossible to get to Tara because the roads are so narrow and it would need collossal development, but I hope I will live to see the day when it will become our greatest national park.  I will not say any more on this.  I will leave it to <Col N="691" /> my fellow Senators from County Meath to develop that point.  Again, I commend the framers of this Bill and the Minister. I hope we will have many more contributions before the Second Stage is finished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better preface my remarks by stating straight away that I am all for a heightening of activity in the area of our national heritage.  But I am not very enamoured of the idea of setting up a council because I do not believe it is necessary.  The Office of Public Works and the other Departments who have responsibility in this area are doing a very good job.  It may be that, through some sort of error on our part, lack of vigilance perhaps, some insensitive development was allowed to take place around or near our national parks and caused problems that we might not otherwise have had. but this is no reason to take the responsibility away from those Departments and set up this council.</P>
      <P>At this point I should make it clear that I do not want to oppose the Bill.  It would not be right to do so.  Before making a decision on this Bill I would have to hear the Minister's reply.  I say that on behalf of my party.  It is necessary to make that clear, since most of the contributions from the House have been in favour of the Bill, with no dissenting voice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be opposed to any Bill that gives way to pressure groups.  We have the people in the Office of Public Works. They are highly competent and they have the expert knowledge.  They know all the employees.  They know the people they are dealing with on a first name basis.  It may be a bit of an exaggeration to say so but they practically know every blade of grass in those parks.  We are about to take that knowledge and pull it asunder in the interests of satisfying what I believe may only be the hobby of some of the people whose voices have been raised. The country is in a bad way and we say we cannot avoid cutbacks in certain areas.  Yet here we are talking about introducing a body which will create more costs as a result of superannuations, overlapping of responsibilities and so on, <Col N="692" /> and some of the responsibility will be left to the local authorities.  These are all hidden cost factors.  At a time when we are talking about not being able to give more money to local authorities we embark on a course of action which would in fact create other costs.  If it was necessary I would not mind the extra cost.  But I do not believe it is necessary. It is the responsibility of the State to look after the things they inherit on behalf of the public.  I do not believe that is the function of any private body or of any semi-State body.  It is the job of the State. That is being handed away by transferring responsibility to people who are not elected to either of the Houses or to any of the local bodies in the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any of the public in Killarney having made an outcry to have a council set up to protect the national park.  The people in Donegal did not do it either.  I can only assume that somebody somewhere put the pressure on.  It is either that or the whole concept of de-nationalising is at work in the minds of the Government.  In order to pursue the de-nationalisation course they think up councils and hand over to a very large extent a great deal of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy had some reservations about whether they had the teeth and the muscle.  I believe that they do have the teeth and the muscle.  If we had given the teeth and the muscle by way of legislation in this House to the various Departments that were responsible, Education, the Office of Public Works, Environment, Fisheries and Forestry and so on, they would have been able to deal with problems.  But we who did not give it to them, and that is no reason for setting up a council and then giving the teeth to the council.  Full power of attorney seems to be the order of the day in the proposals in the Bill.  It has gone a little bit far in the sense that this is not a body to govern in a general way but for a specific purpose.  It is sad to think that local government bodies all over the country must, if they have a problem in certain areas regarding a change in the character or facade of something, turn to <Col N="693" /> a body that is not elected for discussions in the first instance.  That is incredible.</P>
    <P>I am all for creating this desire and interest in our people to look to their national heritage, to understand it.  But I do not believe it was necessary to go the way we have gone to realise those things and give away a lot of authority of a lot of Departments in one fell swoop.  Some may say that I am magnifying the powers given to this body of people.  But if one looks at it relatively speaking, that is the power they have.  They are not elected representatives.  For this reason I feel resentful that elected people who could do the job if they are given the muscle and the teeth have not been given it and we have now given it to a crowd of people who will be selected to look after the national heritage.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Bill goes far enough on the question of accountability. There is the question of doing something about our inland waterways because they are in such a bad way.  It is not the fault of the public or anyone else.  It is not the fault of education.  We have the knowledge. We knew what was wrong and we did not give the necessary powers to our people and back them up with the money. These people were already in existence in the various Departments to look after these things and we did not give them the power.  Then we come along and give power to people who will not be elected representatives.  As I said earlier, the people in Donegal who own the national park, the people in Killarney, the people in other areas who have inherited valuable precious things, have not been out screaming to have a special council set up to look after them.  That is what puzzles me about the need for the council to be set up and have all these powers transferred to them from the State.  That is my reservation about the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that anyone should be allowed to alter the character of a beautiful building.  I do not approve of some of the planning permission that has been given.  At the same time I do not believe that any body which is not elected have the right to have a local authority turn to them and discuss something that is rightfully the property, the business and <Col N="694" /> responsibility of that body.  I know the Bill does not go as far as to say that they can put a stop on it, but they must before they go ahead advise these people what they are doing.  It is the people who govern the country who should give advice about these things and should decide whether the local authorities or some one else can go ahead and do something in a certain way or any body that has been given the responsibility for developing the national heritage.  We are the people who give that authority and they can come and get it directly from us.</P>
    <P>We have just seen recently the process of denationalising in regard to Posts and Telegraphs and I can only assume that we are going down road by setting up this council.  I cannot find any evidence of any real lobby for it among the general public. We must assume that some pressure group have been making noises in a very loud way and finally they were yielded to.  Why not a commission for the countryside? Why not more powers for local authorities to look after these things?  We are giving them power to increase fines and so on.  It is a desirable thing that people should be fined and punished if they abuse the natural beauty of the country in any way, if they take advantage of it and are insensitive to their surroundings.  We could have introduced the same sort of provisions in other legislation and dealt with the question of how people should be treated.  I do not see why it is necessary to set up a council and give them all these powers.</P>
    <P>I must reserve the position as to whether we vote for or against this Bill until I hear the Minister's reply and I cannot make it binding on any of my people either way.  Most of us share the view that there should be a great cultivation of our people's desires towards what is desirable and beautiful.  On this line we are at one but the question of whether the means of realising it is to set up the council is the one that gives me most trouble.  Consequently I reserve my position and that of my party on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and also welcome the introduction of this legislation.  I disagree with <Col N="695" /> my colleague, Senator Harte, because I feel that it is very necessary that we should have a co-ordinating body of the type proposed here.  Senator Harte mentioned the diminution of powers of elected representatives.  It would be easy to forget that the greatest diminution of powers of local councils came about with the setting up of An Bord Pleanála some years ago by a member of Senator Harte's party and that is a rut into which we have fallen.  We know the delays which have taken place because of that body being set up.  I know that nothing of that type is envisaged in this Bill.</P>
      <P>For many years people throughout the country have been very worried that there has been an unco-ordinated view of our national culture and heritage.  Each country has its own unique heritage and its own unique culture.  We as an island race have a different type of culture from other countries in that we have been invaded on many occasions by numerous people &mdash; Vikings, Norsemen, Danes, Dutch, Brits and Scots.  They were here and many of them are still here and thankfully we can live with what they brought to this country.</P>
      <P>Travelling through the country as a potential Senator one gets the opportunity to visit each county and one can see different styles of buildings and it is also apparent that the people came from different races originally.</P>
      <P>It is essential that we look at the National Museum very carefully.  There is no doubt that the organisation of the National Museum through its staff is excellent, but the building in which the museum is housed is totally inadequate for its purpose.  We can go into the National Museum and see artefacts which can stand up with those to be found in any country in the world.  I do not think one will find anything superior to the gold, silver, metal, bronze and wood artefacts in that museum.  Unfortunately many of the better items cannot be put on show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the basement of the museum we have from Kilkenny a huge collection which has not been seen for the past 50 years.  The Kilkenny collection came <Col N="696" /> from the museum which preceded the National Museum.  For many years people have been trying to set up regional museums and we have not yet been able to do it.  It is essential that we do.</P>
    <P>If one visits Egypt one finds American, Dutch, German and other tourists from all over the world arriving in plane loads, boat and bus loads day after day, year after year.  We can match here anything to be found in Egypt.  There is no place in Egypt that can compare with Knowth or Tara.  There are things in the Valley of the Kings that one will not see in Ireland but they are not superior to what one sees in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the Hill of Tara and the need to develop that area and Royal County Meath.  It is royal in the Irish sense and not royal in the British sense.  It goes way back.  I would not like to see too much development of the area around Knowth or Tara because it is essential that one sees an area like Tara in its natural state.  In Egypt the British and French archaeologists in the late 19th century opened up all the beautiful treasures but they now find that even the famous Sphinx is disappearing into the sands of the desert because it was not protected.  I sincerely hope that we do not find that the same will happen here in Ireland.  If we find something of archaeological or antiquarian value it must be preserved.</P>
    <P>One of the shortfalls in the Bill is that we have at present a multiplicity of houses, castles and stately homes for sale by auction.  A huge amount of our national heritage is being exported. Major international auctioneering firms are raping this countryside.  I suppose this is inevitable when we have strong currencies like the dollar and the £ sterling competing against the Irish £.  If one goes to one of the bigger auctions one finds that the people there are not those who are bidding.  The bids come in by post and by the telephone, generally from abroad.</P>
    <P>There is an auction taking place today in Dublin run by a very reputable auctioneering house from Kilkenny.  Some of the finest books from some of the best libraries in Ireland are being auctioned <Col N="697" /> off and I have no doubt that the majority of these books will go abroad.  The American universities are bidding through some of the Dublin or Galway book dealers, and an Irish purchaser has no way of buying a book of Irish interest.  One finds the Annals of the Four Masters have risen to a price which cannot be paid by any Irish person at present.  Even local historical books such an Canon Corrigan's excellent history of the Diocese of Ossory has gone out of reach of the ordinary Irish person.  I would like to see included in the Bill the setting up of a monitoring service so that an attempt could be made to hold on to the treasures of Ireland. They should be held in this country and not allowed to go abroad.</P>
    <P>When anything cultural is discussed there are people who like to be seen to be associated with cultural objectives. Museums which have nothing to do with the high arts are also very important.  The ordinary household utensils which were used in the 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th centuries are being bought up and sent abroad.  There is a great need for a museum which would take into account the lifestyle of other centuries.  An old wooden plough is just as important as the Derrynaflan plate in several respects, because they are both unique in their own way and they are both Irish.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of amateur archaeologists using metal detectors. They can create tremendous problems.  I do not think we should stop people who are amateurs from delving into the archaeological sphere, but perhaps they could be supervised.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator Murphy stress the point that we should not be hung up on one single element of the culture of Ireland.  Our antecedents came from many different places.  They came from Norway, Denmark, Spain and Great Britain.  They have all left their stamp here.  There are people in this country who think that if you are not from the Celtic tradition you are not Irish.  It is good to hear Senator Murphy and other people in this House say that the traditions of this country do not belong to any one race or creed.</P>
    <P>Mention was made by Senator Harte <Col N="698" /> of the Office of Public Works.  There is no doubt that they have done magnificent work throughout the country.  They have done excellent work at the Rock of Cashel, at Kells in County Kilkenny and at Kells in County Meath.  They have been all over the place and they have some of the most excellent craftsmen. One of our biggest problems is that the crafts these people have could soon be lost because there are not enough apprentices.  The apprentices in the O.P.W. at present are very few in number. I am afraid that the craftsmen in stone and wood might be the last unless something is done very quickly to bring about a renaissance.  One has but to go to Rothe House in Kilkenny to see what these people can do.  They renovated a sixteenth-century town house and not one nail was used in the total fabric of that building.  It is a magnificent treasure house showing the Irish craftsman at his best.</P>
    <P>Senator Harte said that the headquarters of this council would be in Dublin.  I would not see anything at all wrong with having the headquarters in Kilkenny. Kilkenny Castle, with its magnificent building, grounds and proximity to Kilkenny Design Workshops, would make a very good centre for this council. We claim that Kilkenny is the cultural centre of Ireland, in the best sense of the word, and we would like it to remain so.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill, that is section 7, gives me some trouble.  I could see county managers having a look at this if they have in their areas buildings which have a preservation order on them.  Section 7 (2) (a) states:</P>
    <P>Where a State authority proposes to demolish, or (by means of alteration to the structure, decoration or finish thereof or by means of any other alteration thereto) to alter fundamentally the character of, a heritage building, or any part thereof, vested in the authority, the authority shall, before carrying out the proposal, notify the Council in writing of the proposal and the Council shall tender its advice to the authority in writing in relation to the proposal not later than six weeks after the <Col N="699" /> receipt by the Council of the notification.</P>
    <P>That would seem to give an &ldquo;out&rdquo; to a council or to a local authority.  It puts the onus on the council to preserve a building that they might not want to preserve and they might try to force funds which might not be available to carry out this particular demolition.  I would suggest at Committee Stage that this section be taken out of the Bill, because it does nothing for the preservation of the heritage building. I am of a suspicious nature, and it would appear to give a local authority an &ldquo;out&rdquo; in relation to the maintenance, preservation, restoration, repair, upkeep and improvement of the said building.</P>
    <P>Many of our ancient forts and old keeps and castles have been knocked down by developers.  It is essential that curbs be put on this type of activity.  If a farmer wants to develop a 20-acre field and finds that he has a four-acre fort in the middle of it, a fine of £800 will not deter him from taking that fort out. Education here is of the essence, and we are becoming more and more educated in what needs to be preserved in Ireland.</P>
    <P>During the fifties, sixties and seventies we were turning into a plastic, fast-food oriented society.  People now realise that the plastic does not last, and that things which seemed to be out of date ten years are now coming back into fashion.  I hope that trend will continue.  In Kilkenny we seem to have got rid of most of the plastic signs over shops and business places.  We give a five-year planning permission for any overhanging or outside sign, and as each of these comes up for renewal now we do not allow them to continue with plastic signs.  I would like to see that trend extended throughout the country. because it has been proved that they do not enhance the building and do not draw in any extra business.  We can get back to the unique sign writing techniques and the beautiful designs that can be produced by sign writers.  We could have people coming here just to see what can be done by such craftsmen.  There is an alderman in Kilkenny Corporation, Alderman McGuinness, who has a hobbyhorse <Col N="700" /> called &ldquo;Plastic &mdash; removal thereof&rdquo; and I wish that everybody would follow his example, and shout and roar about the removal of plastic wherever and however possible.</P>
    <P>People talk about our lack of education in the beauty of Ireland and our lack of care for the things around us.  Comparisons are made with what people see abroad.  I wonder how much of what is said about what people see abroad is true. When one goes abroad one is generally on holidays or on a business trip.  On a business trip one does not see very much and wants to get back as soon as one can. People on holidays wear rose-tinted glasses.  Everything is good while you are on holidays.  Even if it is not good you pretend it is good because you want to enjoy your holiday.  You pass by the litter in Germany and Spain and you come home and say Ireland is a dirty country. I would not like too many people to get the idea that Ireland is a totally clean country, but it is not as bad as a large number of people would make it out to be.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it co-ordinates the efforts that have been made by many voluntary societies over the years. It is essential that these efforts should be co-ordinated.  I hope that when the council is set up it will fulfil the wishes of the people to preserve what is necessary. On Committee Stage I hope the Minister will have a look at section 7 and see if it could be deleted totally or amended so that it would not have the effect I fear.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I hope that this Bill passes without any great acrimony from the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and give my own particular welcome to this Bill.  I do not believe that the objectives outlined in the Bill are incompatible with what Senator Harte has said.  Modern development requirements are not totally at variance with the preservation of our national heritage. The Bill is the first realistic step towards preserving for future generations our national heritage.  It covers a great multitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> Senator Lanigan was a little parochial when he mentioned Kilkenny as a possible site for the headquarters.  Coming from Maynooth in County Kildare I would like to see Carton House as being the only realistic centre for such headquarters. That house has a very special relationship with the House in which we now sit.  Carton House has been available and has been offered to the State on a number of occasions in the past couple of years.  I would ask the Minister now to give careful consideration to the idea, which was put in my mind by the previous speaker.  As the debate progresses, one will see many valid reasons for such consideration.</P>
    <P>The only reservations I have in relation to this Bill are its limitations initially.  It proposes to encompass areas previously controlled by the National Monuments Advisory Council and the National Museum.  The success of this Bill will depend entirely on whether its scope is broad enough in the beginning.</P>
    <P>I refer to our canals, a very valuable amenity already in existence which we have so far failed to preserve for future generations.  It would be very remiss of us if we were to pass this Bill without incorporating in it sufficient structures to ensure the speedy implementation of proposals for the restoration of all of our canals.  I know that the Department already have such proposals.  Some irreparable damage has been done to the navigational element in relation to canals in certain parts of the country.  For that reason, if for no other, I am adamant that we should at the initial stages put the canals within the scope of the Bill and ensure that we have immediately put into operation sufficient machinery to bring about their restoration.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties which the Minister mentioned yesterday in relation to the legal procedures.  There appear to have been no difficulties in overcoming legal procedures when some local authorities decided to lower the bridges over some of those canals, thus doing irreparable damage to the navigation.</P>
    <P>There is another weakness.  A number of the areas already outlined and which will come within the scope of this council <Col N="702" /> would encompass what we have come to regard as lame ducks, or poor relations. I am not casting any aspersions on the Office of Public Works who have been looking after a number of these institutions up to date, but sufficient importance was not placed on the work that they were doing and sufficient finance was not made available in time to ensure that they carried out their functions as originally envisaged.  The assignment of further functions I have covered already.</P>
    <P>The Minister should, at this stage, pay very careful regard to the areas which the Bill should cover, already referred to in his opening speech.  These should now be incorporated in the Bill and he should spread the scope of the Bill's responsibilities. The next very important thing referred to by a number of speakers already and not covered by the Bill is consultation, in the real sense, with other bodies.  There are references to advice, but a number of Members have already expressed reservations, for instance, in relation to the diminution of powers of local authorities.  In this area, there should be written into the Bill specific sections or amendments which would entail consultation on an on-going basis in relation to proposals of the council and this consultation should take place with a number of bodies.  One of these should be the local authorities, where there are elected public representatives who have ample opportunity to hear the views expressed by all other bodies and by the general public.  At that forum they can, at least, impress upon the council, through the local authorities, their views and the views of the people they represent. An Taisce is another group with whom, presumably, consultations have already been undertaken.  It is essential that not alone should there be advice but also there should be on-going consultations with An Taisce.  They have done immeasurable work in trying to maintain at least some semblance of <i>rationale</i> in preserving for future generations elements of our national heritage.</P>
    <P>The National Museum has been referred to by a number of speakers, and as a member of the National Museum Development Council I would like to <Col N="703" /> dwell on that issue.  It is unfortunate that for many years thousands of artefacts have remained to their detriment in packing cases hidden from the general public, particularly our young people.  It was Senator O'Connell who yesterday mentioned the canoe found in Lake Derravarragh. There are many many more such similar instances.  There are many more treasures which are not available to our young people now, which should be.</P>
    <P>People have asked whether it should be a national museum, a regional museum, a combination of national and regional, or county museum services.  A number of local authorities have already very successfully set up county museums under the auspices of the library service. A number of private bodies have successfully set up their own private museums, agricultural museums, steam museums and so on.  If and when this council is set up it will be essential that it be able to give the assistance that these bodies have heretofore not been able to get.  I speak, of course, about advice and financial help when necessary.  There is a very good case, first of all, for the establishment of the existing National Museum.  For far too long the situation has prevailed here that quite a number of items have not been available for viewing by the public, and that cannot be allowed to continue.  We can also progress towards regional museums and, in fact, transport a number of these now unavailable items to those centres for viewing by the public.</P>
    <P>There should be a specific reference to county museums.  Every child has a special affinity with his or her own county and children should not necessarily have to travel either to Dublin or to another regional centre outside their own immediate area to appraise the artefacts that originated in their areas.  This is very important, because I have heard teachers and children mention that when they have come to the National Museum and to some other museums, they have had to travel quite a long distance to see the treasures which came originally from their own parishes in many cases.  I accept that there are a number of items, like the Derrynaflan chalice and others, which <Col N="704" /> must be housed in a central location, but there are many other items which could be located in regional or local museums, be they county or privately owned ones.</P>
    <P>Other bodies with whom the council must have on-going consultation are the various preservation societies.  I have already mentioned The Inland Waterways Association.  I mention again the Royal Canal Preservation Society, and also point out that this group have done tremendous work single-handed, but with a certain amount of assistance from one or two local authorities.  They will be looking very critically at this Bill and at the council to provide them with finance to improve the canals &mdash; and that is not very difficult in certain instances at present &mdash; and to ensure that the present amenities are utilised to the full as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The regional development organisation is another body which should be consulted on a regular basis in relation to certain elements of this Bill.  From my knowledge as a member of such a body, I know that they would have a very significant input.  In order to avail of that advice it would be necessary to have consultation on a continuing basis, not just at the setting up of the council.  CIE are another body who could and should be approached with regard to the proposals of the council.  I mention them in regard to the preservation of artefacts of interest to railway enthusists, locomotives and so on.  CIE should have a valuable contribution to make in that area.</P>
    <P>We also have a number of great houses of historical and architectural importance. Carton and Maynooth have been mentioned already but quite a number of these houses have come on the market, some have been acquired by the State, and some have not.  When more space is needed for museums it would be realistic and beneficial if the State could acquire some of these buildings to house some of the items mentioned earlier.  That would give the present and future generations the opportunity of viewing the treasures housed and the architecture at the same time.</P>
    <P>The necessity to protect sites of historical and archaeological importance has been referred to.  This should also involve <Col N="705" /> their acquisition, and the Bill specifies acquisitions on the advice of the Minister or the council.  Our involvement in protecting our national heritage up to now has been somewhat limited by lack of finance, not necessarily lack of willingness to do so.  There are at present 150,000 people unemployed, many of whom would be prepared to give free, gratis and for nothing one day a week of their time to act as couriers and/or custodians of items of local or national interest. Some arrangement could be made whereby people with the necessary qualifications could be encouraged to give their services in return for some small recompense.  It could be peculiar, in these times of economic recession, if we were not able to provide the necessary staff to man the centres which are necessary for the display of our national treasures.</P>
    <P>Lastly, as mentioned by Senator Lanigan, it is a disgrace that some of our natural treasures are going abroad.  I hope that this council will have sufficient power and finance to ensure that that does not continue.  I welcome this Bill.  It is a positive step in the right direction. My only fear is that it has certain limitations. In the case of canals, there are legal difficulties which can be and should be overcome now before the canals disappear. We would then be labelled with having neglected our obligations in that regard and future generations will form their own conclusions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the other speakers in welcoming the Minister to the House.  I also welcome this Bill and the proposal it contains for the establishment of a National Heritage Council whose main functions will be to protect, preserve and develop various aspects of our physical heritage.  I also welcome the Minister's statement that his mind is by no means closed on the contents of the Bill and that any suggestions for its improvement will be carefully and seriously considered.  I have a few suggestions for the Minister's consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the National Heritage Council will take over responsibility for the National Museum and will also be responsible for formulating museum policy.  The Minister also stated <Col N="706" /> that it will be the task of the council to ensure that we have a museum service worthy of our rich past.  I welcome this statement because of the importance of museums as cultural and educational institutions.  The National Museum is the storehouse of many of our most important treasures of the past.</P>
    <P>Local museums also play an important role in preserving our heritage.  Many such museums owe their existence to the dedication and effort often of a single individual and, unfortunately, when that individual passes on, the museum dies too.  I hope that the National Heritage Council will provide every encouragement and assistance to existing local museums and that it will also encourage the establishment of other local museums in areas which are not well serviced in this regard.  Every locality has a heritage of material that could and should be assembled.  If this were done, the cultural and aesthetic life of the community in that locality would be enriched.</P>
    <P>The National Heritage Council should formulate a national plan for the establishment and development of a number of regional museums throughout the country, for which the council would have overall responsibility.  This could be done in many cases by the designation of existing museums as regional museums.  A regional museum should consist of a museum area, an exhibition centre, an interpretive centre, possibly a genealogical centre and a local historical information centre.  Preferably, the regional museum should be housed in an existing building of architectural, historical or artistic merit, such as an old castle or disused church.  Such a regional museum would require the services of a curator, either part-time or full-time, who would have overall responsibility for the day to day running and development of the museum.  It would then be possible for the National Museum to lend or permanently transfer artefacts of regional or local importance to the regional museums for exhibition, or preferably for permanent display there.</P>
    <P>Senator Durkan mentioned that there are many artefacts in the National Museum which have never seen the light of day because of the restrictions which <Col N="707" /> obtain there as far as space is concerned. The development of regional museums would mean that those artefacts could be displayed in the regions from whence they came originally.</P>
    <P>I, like Senators Lanigan and Durkan, would wish to see far greater restrictions in force with regard to the sale or export of objects of artistic, historical or cultural value, and I would hope that sufficient funds would be made available to the National Heritage Council to enable it to purchase such items when they come on the market.  At present in the town of Strokestown, in my own county, a former Church of Ireland church, no longer in use as a place of worship, is being developed by the local development organisation as a heritage centre.  The building is one of considerable architectural merit. When the project is complete I believe that it will meet all the criteria which should make it eligible for designation as a regional museum.  All the people who have been involved in any way in that project, or in like projects elsewhere throughout the country, deserve the highest commendation.</P>
    <P>There is one other point that I wish to make in relation to the National Heritage Council, which has been touched on by previous speakers.  Because of the role which the council will have in relation to the protection and preservation of buildings and sites of historical, national, artistic and archaeological significance and also because of their role in relation to areas to be used for recreational purposes, the National Heritage Council will require the assistance and co-operation of the country's local authorities.  For this reason, I would agree with the suggestion that a local heritage council should be established in each county, or in each local authority area.  Such a local heritage council should be under the auspices of the local authority and could perform valuable work as an advisory body in relation to their own specific area.  It would also have the effect of creating a greater awareness among the general public of the richness and diversity of our physical heritage and the importance of that heritage to us in preserving our sense <Col N="708" /> of identity as a separate nation and people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and join with the Minister in hoping that the establishment of a National Heritage Council will be the beginning of a new era in the protection and development of our physical heritage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill marks an increase in our awareness of the importance of the preservation of our heritage.  By taking a rather carefree attitude since the foundation of the State and, perhaps going back even further, we have lost a great deal which is now irretrievable.  I welcome the spirit in which the Bill is brought forward but wonder if the powers given to the council are strong enough.  I do not believe they are.  I would like to put down some amendments to increase the statutory powers which the council can have, particularly when dealing with other State bodies.</P>
      <P>One does not have to go back very far and not very far away from here, to come across one of the major pieces of desecration carried out since the war on the far side of Merrion Square by a State body, when the finest stretch of Georgian housing in the world &mdash; a Georgian street one mile long from the bottom of Merrion Square up to Leeson Street &mdash; was savaged by the ESB.  Their development is totally out of context with the rest of the street.  There was a great controversy at the time.  We were told by the architects that it would look perfect and would fit in with the Georgian heritage.  It was just a bit of architectural savagery.  That took place ten, 15 or perhaps 20 years ago.  I am glad to say that I do not think, with or without this council, that a State body, or any other body, would get away with a design or a development like that nowadays.  On the other hand, we must be eternally vigilant if we are to preserve our heritage.  While we have a greatly increased awareness of the importance of some items, in other areas awareness has yet to be increased.</P>
