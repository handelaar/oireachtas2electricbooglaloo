      <P>Before we deal with the Order of Business, I wish to inform the Seanad that owing to an oversight in the General Office copies of the Irish Shipping Limited Bill were not circulated to Senators in the usual way.  The Bill was circulated to Deputies before the composition of the new Seanad was known and should have been circulated to all Members of the new Seanad when its membership was completed.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise a matter which is of public importance: the serious situation that has arisen regarding the transfer of jurisdiction for family law cases, in view of the hardship and the problems raised for women, particularly in violent situations, where barring and protection orders are being disallowed to <Col N="80" /> women through no fault of their own.  I would ask the House on the Order of Business either to suspend Standing Orders to discuss this urgent matter or to allow it on the Adjournment.  The urgency of the situation calls for this House to debate it and make recommendations for an alleviation of the situation to be made.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House about the arrangements regarding the taking of motions.  I would like to refer particularly to motion No. 7 in the names of Senators Ross, Murphy and Robb in the light of the Taoiseach's appointment of two Senators from Northern Ireland.  As this is the policy of the Taoiseach and the Government, we should have an opportunity to discuss items such as motion No. 7 and other motions on Northern Ireland which are going to come up.  I would like the Leader of the House to indicate that motions will be taken regularly so that we can deal with these topics on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During my 11 years in this House we have had a number of excellent discussions on topics involving Northern Ireland.  They were discussions which would have given a good deal of heart to people in Northern Ireland if they had heard them and, in the new position in which we find ourselves after the Taoiseach's nomination of two Senators from the North, I hope that we will get regular opportunities to discuss motions such as <Col N="81" /> No. 7 and motions concerning other items dealing with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse that and also to say that I am disappointed that we are not proposing to take any Private Members' motions today.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he is going to give any regular allocation of time to Private Members' motions and how is this going to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that it is a singular honour you have paid me by inviting me to come here to serve?  I look forward with great interest and eager anticipation to the forthcoming term.  The people of Northern Ireland have responded generously to this generous and sincere gesture that has been made to us by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>I am sure Senators will be interested to hear that I have received only one piece of criticism concerning the decision to accept the Taoiseach's nomination.  At the same time, the people of Northern Ireland are eagerly watching what is going to happen and they will take a great interest in this appointment, and the debate and the conflict, perhaps, that it will create, will have a constructive effect on their feelings and on the fundamental changes that are taking place in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Members of this House to support the suggestion made by Senator West, and endorsed by Senator Ross, that you allow time, perhaps a disproportionate amount of time, to discuss the very important issue of the place of Northern Ireland as it evolves into a future with the rest of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what has been said of the desirability of discussing items relating to Northern Ireland, especially in view of the singular coyness of the Government side in recent times in their support for discussing anything at all to do with Northern Ireland or the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest that there is no reason why on every sitting of the House the taking of a motion could not be considered.  Our understanding was, in the second last session, that we should take a motion on average once a month.  Clearly that did not work out very satisfactorily.  There is no reason why we should not think in terms of taking a motion on virtually every sitting of the House, especially as the whole character of this House is geared towards discussions of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to back up what the Independent Senators have said.  In doing so I would like to welcome Senator Robb and congratulate him upon his maiden contribution to this House. As Senator Murphy said, the nature of this House, the record of the number of sittings and the volume of work which is normally required are such that they do not preclude us from having a proper discussion of motions.  In the last Seanad, a number of important topical motions which could well have been discussed succinctly were allowed to rest and to gather dust upon the Order Paper.  The debate we had on the Polish situation was a model of what this House can do and the contribution it can make to public debate and to the articulation of public issues.  I would ask the Leader of the House to try to arrange the Order of the Business in such a way that this House can continue to show, as it has done in the past when it was given a chance, how relevant and responsible it can be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Ferris in regard to the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EEC, that has appeared on the Dáil Order Paper and I expect it to be taken some time this week.  We will certainly take it on the first sitting day after the Dáil has passed it and there will be no delay as far <Col N="83" /> as we are concerned.  In regard to the various contributions about motions, as most of the Members are aware, this has in the past been regulated by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the procedure which has been adopted over many years is that at least one motion is taken each month.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges have not met yet but I think it is more than likely that they will agree to continue this arrangement.  In the meantime, I propose that we adhere to the arrangement to have at least one motion a month.  It does not look as though we are going to have one during May so that in that case we will take two next month.</P>
      <P>The other arrangement that was made was that each group, in rotation, will have the opportunity to take a motion, that is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Independents, in that order.  This is all a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and if anybody has strong views that this arrangement should be changed it will be up to him or her to bring the proposed changes before the committee but until such time as the committee have been set up and have had an opportunity to discuss the matter, it is my intention to take a motion on the next sitting day and a further motion sometime in June.  We did attempt to have motion No. 10 ready for today but the Minister for Agriculture could not be available today.  We will take it on the next sitting day and after that we will take the motions in the order which I suggested.</P>
      <P>That is the position at the moment.  It has never been a rigid situation: sometimes we have taken motions more than once a month, sometimes we have not been able to take a motion in a particular month.  It has operated in a reasonable satisfactory manner with that flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Senator Murphy, it would not be possible to take a motion every sitting day because on many sitting days we do not even get through Government business on that day or even by sitting on the following day as well.  On that basis it would not be possible to take a motion every sitting day.  For the <Col N="84" /> moment it is my intention to adhere to the procedure we had in the past and it will be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  If any Members have any views they want to put before the committee they are entitled to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have pleasure in proposing Senator McDonald as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  He was elected first to this House in 1961. Indeed, I first met Senator McDonald in the campaign for election to the House in 1961.  He has been a Member since except for four years when he went off to <Col N="85" /> investigate circumstances in another place and then returned to us, evidently finding the Seanad more to his satisfaction than that other place.  He has held the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach in this House.  He has held the position of Cathaoirleach in this House.  He has also held the position of Vice-President of the European Parliament and, as such, a member of the extended bureau of the European Parliament.  He is, therefore, a parliamentarian of great experience. He has shown himself, when acting in the Chair in this House, to have a command of the business of the House and also an ability to conduct business smoothly.  He is, in my opinion, in every way suitable to be Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I propose that the House should elect him as such.</P>

We have served under his jurisdiction as Cathaoirleach and as Leas-Chathaoirleach.  He is eminently suited to and qualified for the post and I am pleased to support his candidature.  I am also pleased that it has now been established again, as it was in the last Seanad, that the Leas-Chathaoirleach would come from the Opposition side of the House.  I welcome that and hope it will be continued as a precedent in future situations in the House.  I welcome his nomination.</P>

Faoi mar atá ráite ag Senator Dooge, tá taithí ag Senator McDonald ar obair an tSeanaid agus fad is a mhair an Seanad deireannach d'fheidhnigh sé go héifeachtach mar Chathaoirleach, agus sa mhéid is a bhí taithí agam féin air bhí sé ciallmhar i mbun coistí.  Deirim arís, áfach, faoi mar a dubhairt mé an tseachtain seo caite, go bhfuil sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeadh Gaeilge líofa acu siúd a thoghaimid chun dul i bhfeidhm ar ghnó an tSeanaid.

      <P>I was interested in the comment made by Senator Ferris that it has now been established again that the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach should go to the Opposition.  I would remind the House that that tradition existed for many years.  I can recall Senator Lindsay as Leas-Chathaoirleach of this House, also Senator Dooge and Senator McDonald, but that tradition was broken in 1973, not by this side of the House, but when Senator Dooge was elected Cathaoirleach of this House and Senator Evelyn Owens of the Labour Party was elected Leas-Chathaoirleach.  It is important to place on the record that on the one occasion that was broken it was done so by the Coalition in this House.</P>

I would especially like to thank my proposer, the Leader of the Opposition in the House, Senator James Dooge, my seconder Senator Reynolds and also Senator Ferris and Senator Murphy for the kind words they have spoken.  It is difficult sometimes to keep one's head from expanding when listening to speeches like that. However, I shall do my best to exercise the duties as Leas-Chathaoirleach in as fair a manner as possible.  I hope that the office will not lie too heavily upon me.

    <Title>Irish Shipping Limited Bill, 1982     [Certified Money Bill]:    Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>The immediate need for the proposed legislation derives from the intention of the Government to institute a special financing arrangement for the <i>Panamax</i> bulk carrier which is at present under construction at Verolme Cork Dockyard Limited for Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
      <P>The contract for the construction of the bulk carrier was placed in February 1981 and the original arrangement was that the cost would be financed by the provision of £7.1 million State equity to Irish Shipping Limited, a Shipping Finance Corporation loan of £7.1 million to the company, and a State subsidy to the shipyard.  The estimated cost of the vessel at the time of placing the contract was £25 million.  The contract is subject to escalation clauses and the final cost is now estimated to be £28 million.  The net effect of the original financing arrangement as far as Irish Shipping Limited are concerned is that the vessel would stand on their balance sheet at £14.2 million, that is the £7.1 million equity and the loan of £7.1 million.  In cash terms the obligation incurred by the company would be the payment of interest on and the repayment of the capital sum of the £7.1 million loan over a period of eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special financing arrangement now proposed is in line with Government policy to take advantage of funds on offer from the private sector and is being pursued by Irish Shipping Limited in consultation with my Department and the <Col N="88" /> Department of Finance.  The arrangement, which is still at the negotiation stage, will incorporate a leasing contract in respect of the vessel on attractive terms.  The Government will underwrite lease payments by Irish Shipping Limited to such an extent that the company's commitment will be no greater than that which would have applied under the original financing arrangement.</P>
    <P>Although, as I have just explained, Irish Shipping Limited will only be responsible for payments equivalent to that which they would have paid under the original financing arrangements, it is necessary for the purposes of the special funding arrangement that they should assume formal responsibility for the full £28 million cost of the vessel.  The banking institutions concerned require that the Government give formal guarantees in respect of the obligations which will fall to Irish Shipping under the special arrangements.  Such guarantees are, in effect, similar to normal State guarantees of borrowing by Irish Shipping for which there is already statutory authority.  I am advised that specific statutory authorisation as proposed in the Bill before the House is necessary in respect of the particular type of funding now proposed. The Government are empowered already to give such assurances in the case of other State bodies&mdash;for example, Córas Iompair Éireann, under the State Guarantees (Transport) Act, 1962.  The legislation which I am proposing today will remove the obstacles which at present exist to leasing and other contracts being entered into by Irish Shipping Limited with the benefit of a Government guarantee.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise again that the negotiation of the revised financing arrangements has been the responsibility of Irish Shipping Limited themselves and that the company are entirely satisfied that, from their point of view, they offer terms as advantageous as the original financing proposal.  I am also satisfied that the special arrangements represent the most efficient way of meeting the Governments undertakings in relation to financing the vessel.  Due to the fact that negotiations are still in progress and that <Col N="89" /> premature disclosure might jeopardise the success of the negotiations, I am unable, at this stage, to give particulars of the proposed arrangements.</P>
    <P>I would wish to draw the attention of Senators, however, to the fact that the Bill in section 5 provides for an annual statement as to guarantees to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>On a more general note I should like to refer to the general activities of Irish Shipping for whom the past year has been one of considerable progress.  Through their new subsidiary company&mdash;Ocean-bank Limited&mdash;the company have sold a 25 per cent share of both Irish Continental Line and their shareholding in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and the Property Corporation of Ireland.  This transaction released funds to the company which helped them to finance the purchase of a secondhand car ferry&mdash;the <i>St. Patrick II</i>&mdash;and to lengthen the existing ferry the <i>St. Killian.</i>  These developments have substantially increased carrying capacity on the Rosslare/ continental routes to the benefit of both tourist and commercial users.</P>
    <P>The company have also been very much involved in the reinstatement of the Belfast/Liverpool service&mdash;my fellow Ulstermen will rejoice in this&mdash;previously operated by the P &amp; O Company. The new service began on 1 May and is operated by the former <i>St. Patrick</i> now re-named <i>St. Colum I.</i></P>
    <P>Irish Shipping's main activity, the operation of a fleet of deep-sea ships, has had to contend with a fall in freight rates due to the present stagnation in worldwide shipping resulting from recessions in the US and other industrial countries. The company, nevertheless, hope to benefit from the upsurge in activity in the bulk carrier trade in coal.  The National Board of Science and Technology in their study of Ireland's coal shipping requirements estimated that the business of shipping coal to Ireland will increase from £18 million in 1984, to £29 million in 1986 and may reach £47 million in 1988.</P>
    <P>There is valuable business here for Irish shipowners and I have no doubt that Irish Shipping Limited will be able to <Col N="90" /> trade the new bulk carrier profitably in this market.  In the latter connection, I understand that the coal requirements of the ESB are expected to increase substantially during the next decade and I would hope that Irish Shipping Limited as well as other Irish shipowners will be able to play a major role in providing the necessary transport.</P>
    <P>The final accounts for the year ended 31 March 1982 are not yet available but the indications are that the company will maintain their profit record and will improve on the profit of £3 million which the company returned in 1981.  The company will also be reporting an increase in passenger carryings by Irish Continental Line of the order of 2 per cent.  This is certainly a very satisfactory situation and very much to the credit of the board and personnel of the company, having regard to the tough trading conditions of recent years.</P>
    <P>Is main liom mar sin an Bille seo a mholadh don tSeanad.  Go bunúsach, is Bille é a chuireann ar chumas an Aire Airgeadais barántas a thabhairt i leith íocaíochtaí áirithe a dhéanfas Loingeas Éireann Teoranta.  Tá an chumhacht sin ag an Aire cheana chomh fada is a bhaineann le hiasachtaí, agus is ceist teicniúil dlí í an chumhacht chéanna a thabhairt dó maidir le íocaíochtaí.  Rinneadh an ní céanna cheana i gcás Chóras Iompair Éireann.  Ach taobh amuigh de sin, tá dhá mhór-chuspóir leis an mBille, uimhir a haon, chun a dheimhniú go mbeidh ar chumas longchlóis Verolme i gCorcaigh an lucht oibre a choinneáil ag obair ar an long nua atá dá tógáil acu, agus, uimhir a dó, feidhm a bhaint as airgead príobháideach ó bhancanna agus a leithéid chun cabhrú le aidhmeanna na gcomhlachtaí Stáit.</P>

      <P>As you announced at the commencement of business today a Chathaoirligh, due to an oversight this Bill was not circulated to Senators, and accordingly some Senators only received the Bill perhaps less than one hour ago.

Most legislation introduced in order to give guarantees to companies or organisations is introduced because there is some doubt about the ability of such companies to be able to raise money without the backing of State guarantees.  This has not been the case with regard to Irish Shipping, and would not be the case in the future in regard to Irish Shipping but for the special circumstaces that have arisen in regard to the building of a particular vessel.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that a vessel is being built at Verolme Dockyard of a type which Irish Shipping would have been able to purchase for £14 million and for which the original estimate at Verolme Dockyard was £25 million and the latest estimate is that it will cost £28 million. There always is a need to balance the objectives of public policy.  There is always a need to balance the very important objective of competitiveness in world trade with the very important objective of the promotion of employment at home.</P>
      <P>At different times we will reach different decisions in regard to how much weight should be given to each of these two objectives.  When that decision has been made it is vitally important that we be quite clear about what weighting has been made.  The only real way to do this is to be quite clear in regard to the expenditure of money and how much of the money will be allocated for a purely commercial purpose and how much in order to achieve a social objective of a non-economic kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his Second Stage speech, in regard to the purchase of this new vessel, that 50 per cent of the cost would be the commercial cost of the vessel on the open market and that 50 per cent of the cost will be a subsidy for employment and for the continuation of the Verolme Dockyard.  It is important <Col N="92" /> that this should be clear.  One of the things which worried me about the form of the Bill is that on the face of it, looking at the Bill without the Minister's introductory speech, it is not clear at all that the guarantee which is given in section 2 is in fact not a guarantee but a subsidy. The guarantee given to Irish Shipping is not a guarantee to Irish Shipping in the ordinary sense, it is not even a subsidy to Irish Shipping, it is a subsidy to another organisation.  The original arrangement apparently was that Irish Shipping were to be responsible, raising by their own devices which had sufficed for them in the past, just over £14 million.  Apparently they would have been in a position, if the ship had been built outside this country, to have been able to borrow this money at 8 per cent over an eight year period.</P>
    <P>At that time it was suggested there would be a direct subsidy by the Department of Industry to Verolme dockyard. Under this, everything would have been clear.  There would have been no doubts whether they could be removed by footnotes or otherwise, in the accounts of Irish Shipping.  There would have been no doubts in the accounts of Verolme dockyard; there would have been no doubts in the accounts of the Department of Industry and Commerce or in the accounts of the Department of Transport. But the new proposals are by no means as clear.  It now appears &mdash; I am sure the Minister will correct me if I misinterpret any of the arrangements, but the fact that I would misinterpret something would reinforce my argument that it is not clear &mdash; that the cost of £28 million is to be made up by some unknown, as yet unnamed, financial institution. It appears to me on reading the Bill that, whereas under the previous arrangement the contract price between Irish Shipping and Verolme dockyard would have been £14 million, now the contract price will be £28 million.  Irish Shipping are to lease from this financing group over a 12-year period.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that Irish Shipping will be no worse off, given this guarantee. But it is equally important that it should be clear to everybody not just that <Col N="93" /> Irish Shipping is no worse off but that Irish Shipping is no less efficient today than it has been over the past ten years. There must be a balance with objectives but it is equally important that there be a clear distinction between economic costs and social costs.</P>
    <P>The failure to distinguish between economic and social costs in many of our enterprises is responsible for a great deal of our problems today and successive Governments are largely to blame for that.  What is proposed now is particularly regrettable.  The Minister said in his introductory speech that:</P>
    <P>Such guarantees are, in effect, similar to normal State guarantees of borrowing by Irish Shipping for which there is already statutory authority. The Government are empowered already to give such assurances in the case of other State bodies &mdash; for example, Córas Iompair Éireann, under the State Guarantees (Transport) Act, 1962.</P>
    <P>and in the summary of his speech:</P>
    <P>Rinneadh an ní céanna cheana i gcás Chóras Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>Ní hí an cás céanna atá ann i leith CIE agus Loingeas Éireann.  There is a difference between the operation of CIE over the past ten years and the operation of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping was formed during the war years with a non-economic objective, with a public objective.  The public objective was the strategic one of ensuring that this country had both a merchant shipping fleet and a merchant marine capable of operating it.  The remarkable thing about Irish Shipping which could be a headline to many other of our State-sponsored bodies is that Irish Shipping transformed itself, after an initial period of 20 years during which like most of our State companies it lost money.  Irish Shipping looked at its operations around 1966.  It could have carried on by saying, &ldquo;we have been given a public objective by the Government of maintaining a strategic merchant marine and therefore it does not matter if we make a loss because this is part of the stategic cost to the country <Col N="94" /> of having a merchant marine available in time of war,&rdquo; but Irish Shipping did not accept that position.  It took a thorough look at its own operations and set out its objectives.  When we are discussing Irish Shipping here and the way in which this Bill may change the perception of Irish Shipping it is no harm to look at the objectives of the company.  I will quote from the submission by Irish Shipping to the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and which appears in the appendix to the report of the Committee of 3 March 1981 (Prl 9663):</P>
    <P>Within the framework of a profitable company to provide, maintain and operate efficiently and economically a basic fleet of vessels under the Irish flag together with the necessary organisation, management and personnel to run this fleet.  The aggregate size and composition of the basic fleet to be reviewed and agreed from time to time with the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>They did not stop by setting down that objective.  They set out basic policies under that objective and they set about turning themselves into a profitable organisation.  They did it by the elimination of uneconomic ships from their fleet; they initiated discussions with the full co-operation of the unions in regard to the manning of the ships in the Irish Merchant Marine; and they did it by means of diversification.  As a result of that transformation, in the next five years from 1967 to 1972 instead of an anticipated loss of £2.5 million they had a profit of almost £2.8 million.  The position is that Irish Shipping, while still fully maintaining its non-economic objectives, has managed by good management and by good enterprise and by solid contributions by management and worker to do that job within a profitable environment.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary course of events Irish Shipping needs no guarantees.  It is unfortunate that this Bill should come forward in this particular way.  In the report on &ldquo;Enterprise in the Public Service,&rdquo; (Prl. 8499), the National Economic and Social Council urged that our State-sponsored <Col N="95" /> bodies should operate in a particular way. If we look at the record of Irish Shipping we will find that most of the things recommended in that report are part and parcel of the everyday work of Irish Shipping. I am not convinced that the new arrangement is a suitable arrangement. The Government were right to say that the ship rather than being built in Japan should be built in Verolme dockyard in Cork.  This is a perectly legitimate decision and one with which I entirely agree. That decision having been made, what should have been done is that the original proposal for the subsidy to be paid directly to Verolme dockyard should have been adhered to.  However we must deal with the proposal that is now before us.  The powers of this House with regard to a Money Bill are limited and I do not oppose the passage of the Bill if only that the Bill might be passed and Irish Shipping relieved of the burden of the bridging loan of about £10 million which it appears to have had to bear because of the subsidy not having been paid directly. There are details in regard to the arrangement that are not clear from the Minister's Second Stage speech, but they are perhaps better taken up on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>May I say in summary that I am glad to have had the opportunity to congratulate Irish Shipping on achieving the objective of carrying out a public function within a profitable framework and indeed am anxious whether there should be even the appearance that this company is not carrying on with the high degree of efficiency which characterised it over the past 15 years.  If the original arrangement had been adhered to there would not be the danger of such doubts arising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Dooge I welcome the Bill, In his contribution he has raised very important questions.  In semi-State company terms, Irish Shipping shine out like an economic beacon throughout the country.  They are an example to every other semi-State body of how to combine commercial expertise while at the same time adhering to the principle of the semi-State body.  No small <Col N="96" /> credit is due to the enlightened management that we have in Irish Shipping and that we had in those who drew up the ground rules, those people who were far-sighted and visionary enough to say that we were not prepared to accept the usual definitive position of a semi-State body, that they had to be subsidised by the State.  If for no other reason than to pay tribute to this outstanding semi-State body I welcome this Bill.  It gives us an opportunity to discuss economic costs versus social costs, economic costs combined with social costs and what percentage should be economic and what percentage should be social, which is what Senator Dooge was getting at.</P>
      <P>I suppose if we had the answer to that we would not have any loss-making semi-State body in the country, but we should pursue actively a policy in this House of ensuring that the executives of every other semi-State body will study the operation of Irish Shipping, the way they plan and the way they recruit their personnel.  There is no doubt that it is because of these policies that Irish Shipping are in the constant profit-making position they are in today.  I suppose most of us are cynical about semi-State bodies, that they know there is a certain subsidy coming up and that they operate in anticipation of that amount being paid.  We are now living in a new era of very expensive money and very scarce money and we cannot any longer go on having the ordinary taxpayer paying massive subsidies to promote and to continue inefficiency. Today we have an example in Irish Shipping of the direction in which this country should be going.  It is important, provided we can meet the cost, that we manufacture, assemble and build everything in Ireland, that we give employment to the people we represent, that we give employment to our own people at home rather than having them emigrate in order to get employment. Surely it is far better to subsidise the building of a ship rather than paying out that money in dole to a tremendous number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thing I want to get to is that we must pose the question nationally now, we must try to seek the answers to <Col N="97" /> this question, and the question is: why are Irish Shipping so successful?  Once we can find the answer, our other semi-State bodies can learn from our findings and I think we will have made tremendous economic progress as far as the country is concerned.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed with Senator Dooge's contribution and the depth of research that he has done in relation to this.  I know that the questions that were posed to the Minister are very important questions and must be answered.  But at some other stage we will have to have a debate on the measuring of economic versus social costs, because the kernel of our problem lies in that direction.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping have not just been satisfied to sit down and operate through a very narrow channel.  They have diversified. They have gone into other businesses allied to their own operation and they have made a success of all these businesses.  Surely it is time for us to examine why they are doing this and how they are doing it successfully.  This is a great opportunity to have a Bill like this which at first appears to be an innocuous Bill but has tremendous importance and relevance for the whole country.  It is important that we examine and plan for the future how we can make other bodies equally efficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to that of the previous speakers who have complimented the Irish Shipping Company on the quality of their work.  They are, of course, as we know one of the most successful semi-State enterprises in the country.  They show consistent profit over time and obviously all of us in the House would wish to applaud them, having been given this opportunity today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of our recognition of the immense value of the work of this company and their commercial expertise, it is a pity that the funding operation is being organised in the way that it now seems we are to do it.  As I understand the position, when the Government indicated to or instructed Irish Shipping to build the ship in Verolme dockyard, the arrangements were quite straightforward; £7.1 million of the then £25 million <Col N="98" /> cost was to come through State equity, £7 million through borrowing by the company and £11 million by direct subsidy from the Exchequer to Verolme itself. That arrangement had the merit of distinguishing clearly between the market price of the ship and the subsidy which was being made to Verolme for employment and other social reasons.  I support the idea that the ship should be built in Verolme. It is important not only that we maintain the employment which is there but that we, perhaps more importantly, in the long-term maintain the skills which are being accumulated in the area of shipbuilding in the country.</P>
    <P>That initial arrangement for financing the ship in 1980 seemed to me to have the merit of distinguishing between subsidy to the shipyard on one hand and indicating also clearly that the Irish Shipping Company were responsible only for the commercial, international market price value this year.  The new arrangements confuse these two matters and I share Senator Dooge's concern that by confusing them the reputation of the company could conceivably be damaged.  Perhaps the most useful thing that I could do today is to try to elicit more information about the terms and form of the new leasing arrangements.  In a situation in which all of us in this House are concerned about the public finances, it is important that in the Seanad and in the Dáil we try to have before us as much information as possible about precisely what is happening in the leasing arrangements proposed for Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>Is it possible for the Minister to give us information about who is funding this leasing arrangement?  Is it the case, as I expect it is, that the ship at the end of the 12 year leasing period will become the property of Irish Shipping?  What rate of interest is being charged under the consortium arrangement?  What will the total annual payments be and how will these be distributed between Irish Shipping and the Exchequer?  Under what headings in the annual Estimates will these Exchequer payments be shown?  Is it the case that the leasing arrangements are integrated into the section 84 Finance Act arrangements whereby the banking <Col N="99" /> or financial institutions concerned can write off costs against profit?  In that sense, can the Minister give us an indication of the total cost of the operation to the Exchequer over the 12 year period, including the section 84 arrangements if these apply?  This information would be most helpful to us.  The Minister stated that it is not possible to indicate all the details of the proposed arrangements but, at a time when there is such concern about public expenditure, it is important that he provide us with as much information about the proposed arrangements as it is possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one additional point in relation to Irish Shipping.  We all applaud their operation and accept it as being one of the most successful of all the commercial State enterprises.  However there is one major problem which I am concerned about.  It appears that Irish Shipping are trading into South Africa. If this is the case, as was asserted recently by the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement all of us in this House would be deeply concerned.  It appears that in 1979 Irish Shipping became the Dublin agent for a company called Sasmarine, which is a South African shipping company.  It is also the case that in the 1982 yearbook of the Chartered Institute of Transport in Ireland, Irish Shipping advertised the fact that they can be contacted for all imports and exports to and from a range of countries including South Africa.</P>
    <P>While all of us wish to support and applaud the work of this State enterprise, many of us would feel a deep sense of moral outrage if this is the case and if it continues beyond the present point.  I ask the Minister if he does not have the information with him today to make inquiries of Irish Shipping as to whether or not, as asserted by the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement and as seems to be the case from the advertisement which I have just read out, they are shipping into South Africa and, if they are, to talk to them about stopping that particular operation. We are talking in this case about something which transcends commercial requirements and which is, in fact, a moral imperative.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The proposed legislation is urgently required in order to enable funds to be made available to continue the payment of instalments to Verolme dockyard for the bulk carrier which they are at present building for Irish Shipping.  If the instalments cannot be paid there will obviously be a loss of jobs and a consequent threat to employment in the yard generally.</P>
      <P>In mentioning Irish Shipping it is only right and proper, as other Senators have done, to congratulate them for the great work they have been doing over the years in the commercial and tourist spheres of the country.  They are as suggested by other Senators a first-class semi-State organisation and one which can be copied with authority.</P>
      <P>The Bill was given to us late today. The specific purpose of the Bill is to enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee moneys payable by Irish Shipping Limited under guarantees given or under contracts entered into by that company. Mention has been made of what was required in regard to financing.  It was a State equity of £7.1 million, a loan from the Shipping Finance Corporation of £7.1 million and a subsidy to the yard of the balance of the cost of the bulk carrier.  I know that this has been changed in accordance with Government policy which is to involve the private sector in matters of this type.  It is only right that we should do this because recently a growing private sector interest has developed notably among financial institutions, in participating in the financing of public sector investment projects.  We should welcome this approach to national development and the scope which it offers for the enlargement of investment activity in the economy.  We should have no doubt about this particular type of arrangement.  It is one that we should welcome.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an important one.  It does, as has been said by other Senators, raise many other problems for another day.  I welcome the Bill and hope it has an easy passage through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that other Senators, notably Senator Dooge and Senator O'Mahony, have sought some elucidation on matters arising from this Bill because I found the text of the Bill very difficult to comprehend.  Given the late date at which the text became available and the lack of an explanatory memorandum, that difficulty was compounded, though I must say that from what I have seen of explanatory memoranda they are frequently rather meaningless documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share some of the doubts about the shipping arrangments which have been <Col N="102" /> expressed by previous Senators.  I understand that the need for the Bill is because there is need for legislation to authorise this kind of arrangement but I have difficulty in comprehending why it is necessary to change from the relatively straightforward earlier arrangements to the ones now being contemplated.</P>
    <P>A point which is pertinent to raise is whether the people in Irish Shipping are satisfied with the new arrangements. That is rather important.  One cannot but agree with the general proposition that the bulk carrier should be built in Verolme for Irish Shipping Limited.  Any Corkman who disagreed with placing a contract with Verolme would not be very happy at the prospect of returning home. At the same time I must say, speaking as an absolute layman in these matters, I am mystified as to why the cost of building a bulk carrier should be so extravagantly greater in Verolme than would have been the case had Irish Shipping placed their contract on the open market.</P>
    <P>I support what other Senators have said about Irish Shipping and their successes. Too often in this House we have to deplore the losses sustained by State companies.  I remember particularly one painful occasion during the last Fianna Fáil administration when the Minister had to come before this House and outline the appalling losses sustained by one such company.  It is good to listen to a success story and to reflect that the whole Irish Shipping success saga has been born out of our own experience as a State.  It is very much a domestic achievement and an Irish achievement that we can be proud of.  It may not be entirely inappropriate to recall that Irish Shipping were born out of our neutrality during World War II and of the very real struggle we had to keep everything ticking over while that policy was being successfully maintained and directed.</P>
    <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that Irish Shipping were born of Winston Churchill's pugnacious antagonism to this country.  At any rate it was, and remains, the application of the whole principle of self-reliance to an important area of the economy.  It is applying sinn féin to the area of maritime commerce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> It is one of the things we did our way and did it well.  The achievement has been all the more admirable in view of the fact that the maritime economy was not only an underdeveloped area for a maritime nation but an exploited area by the previous imperial Government.  There is no doubt that one of the reasons we are backward in the whole area of maritime development is a colonial hangup and so the achievement is all the greater.  One can only wish that other features of our economic personality were as successful.</P>
    <P>One important thing to stress is the principle that State enterprise can be a success, that men and women working for the State can work with commitment. The opposite is often stated.  People think that James Connolly was very naive when he said that in a future socialist Ireland men and women would derive the same satisfaction from working for the public good as they would for a private employer.  People are still very cynical about that point of view but surely the essence of the success of Irish Shipping is the dedication of the men and women employed in the public service.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley, while praising Irish Shipping, seemed by implication to say that other companies were unsuccessful because they did not pay the same attention to enterprise and the good management of their resources.  I do not think it is as simple as that.  It may well be that Irish Shipping have been particularly fortunate with the kind of people they have employed and the policies they pursue, but the fact that one State company are successful does not mean that application of the same principles or managment techniques would make other State companies successful.</P>
    <P>CIE have been mentioned in the Minister's speech.  We must remind ourselves that here are a company who have an entirely different function from Irish Shipping which arguably can never be commercially successful and it is the State's business to understand that.  The State should be as loyal and sympathetic to State companies which provide a social service as it is proud of companies like Irish Shipping which make a profit.  I <Col N="104" /> welcome the Bill but I share Senator Dooge's idea that we should separate the economic and social factors involved.  I ask the Minister to clarify why it was considered necessary to change from one procedure to another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his speedy work as regards this move for Irish Shipping.  It is very encouraging to see that Irish Shipping are involved in other businesses as well as shipping.  It is encouraging to see that we are prepared to get involved in other areas, for instance, in the purchase and sale of ships and the extension of ships.</P>
      <P>As a Senator from Cork, I am very glad to see that the Minister is encouraging Irish Shipping to buy within the State.  The impression has been given that subsidies are only given in Ireland.  That is not fair or true.  The fact is that in Japan this year alone £350 million has been allocated directly to the shipyards and indirectly subsidies are being given to the steelyards.  It is quite obvious that all areas of shipping at this time are losing money and it is not just happening in our country.  Speaking of steel, what a pity that we have to go elsewhere to get steel to build our ships when we have it in our own country.  Perhaps in the future with the new plant which is in Cork, this might not be the situation.  British shipyards are also getting subsidies directly.  This year they received £52 million.  We shout about whether or not it should be given to Verolme.</P>
      <P>As regards Irish Shipping, one of their first bulk ships was built in Verolme.  It did Irish Shipping good and I fail to understand why we should ask why it is going into Verolme and why it should not be given to other countries.  These are facts.  It is only right and proper that it should be said.</P>
      <P>The people who are working in Verolme must be protected.  Irish joiners in the Verolme dockyard are half-idle.  I compliment the Minister for creating a situation where naval boats are now being built and are ready to be put on stream.  I hope that will not be held up. It is very encouraging to see this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make one or two other <Col N="105" /> points.  The planning of Verolme dockyard cannot be condemned, because it is to be complimented for the type of ship that is built there.  Other countries throughout the western world have complimented them.  As regards price, we will always be asking where State money is going and, as a Cork Senator, I have no objection to the fact that the Minister is prepared to let it go to Cork.</P>

If we have any doubts about the Bill they are about the funding arrangement.  We all welcome the Bill.  There is a great need to give whatever help we can to Irish Shipping Limited.  Their new involvement has proved that they are well worthy of whatever support they get.  It is stated that by 1984 business will have increased from £18 million to £29 million.  That is a very big increase.  For that reason, all of us should compliment them on the excellent job they are doing. Perhaps in the near future we will hear about the funding arrangement and that is what most of us are unclear about.  If we were clear about it perhaps we would not rise to speak at all.  We hope that in due course we will be made aware of the way this money will be funded.</P>

      <P>It is my first opportunity to welcome the Minister to the Seanad, and I do so happily.  Unfortunately, I have a habit of forgetting that particular pleasant formality.  It may be because of my belligerent nature but I have a habit of doing that and I apologise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few things in this Bill that fascinate me.  First of all there is the obvious fact that Irish Shipping is a successful commercial organisation in an extremely competitive environment.  At a time of over-capacity in international shipping, Irish Shipping has managed, and is continuing to manage, to run a <Col N="106" /> commercial organisation independent of any direct or indirect State subsidy.  We should remember that there are two kinds of State subsidies to industry. There are the direct ones that are measured and there are those given in the form of tax exemptions, tax reliefs, and tax supports where people, instead of getting a handout from the State, which is obviously unacceptable to a lot of people, get a handout by being allowed to pay far less than what might otherwise be their fair share of taxation.  As far as I know, Irish Shipping get neither.</P>
    <P>A prominent backbench member of the Minister's party went on record at a youth conference recently as saying that all our semi-State companies are insolvent. That was Deputy Séamus Brennan. If he wants a list we can give it to him. They are not all insolvent, and many of the ones that have commercial difficulties are doing a lot better than many of their counterparts in the private sector.  Aer Lingus has been rated as one of the most efficient airlines in western Europe.</P>
    <P>It is important that public representatives should record vigorously and strongly that there are many successful semi-State companies in operation and that some of the ones that are less successful are often less successful because of political impediments that are put in the way of their commercial operation and not because of any inefficiency on their part.  I instance Bord na Móna, who are asked to supply energy at a price which may well, for justifiable social reasons, be below the world energy price. They have to pay for their raw energy at the world market price.  They are accused of being insolvent but they are caught between the devil and the deep blue sea, possibly rightly so.  However, they should not be accused of being insolvent; but we could go on about this forever.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said the bankers required guarantees.  One could elaborate at great length about who actually dictates public policy, whether it is the State through Government Departments and Government Ministers or the bankers who require guarantees.  I remember when we had a telecommunications Bill here which was meant to offer <Col N="107" /> opportunities to the private sector to invest in the telecommunications industry, we also had guarantees required from the State.</P>
    <P>I find it fascinating that in two areas such as these which are commercial, which are seen to be efficient and which are potentially extremely productive, bankers require guarantees which would be far in excess of what they would expect from a company operating in the private sector.  I thought that banking was about the skillful analysis of opportunity, the skillful analysis of the money market and a highly competitive use of the funds of people who lodge their money with the banks, and not about safe, guaranteed investment in public companies where if anything goes wrong their investment is copperfastened.  I do not understand why banks who are investing in a commercial enterprise which has a proven record of handling its own investments should insist, in addition, on a State guarantee. It is, at the very least, a disincentive to the banking institution to invest in real private sector growth industries if they have these doubled up guarantees to invest in the public sector.  I suspect that Irish Shipping could raise their funds without these guarantees, and I often think that maybe we should tell the banks that if they are in the commercial business and giving lectures to everybody else about the importance and the role of private enterprise and of enterprise in risk-taking, then perhaps they should take a few more risks themselves, preferably in more productive areas than property speculation in Dublin's inner city.</P>
    <P>Can somebody explain to me, will the distinction about leasing provide yet another tax outlet for some banking institution?  Will we have a banking group investing money which is guaranteed by the State in a semi-State company in such a fashion that they will be able to guarantee for themselves that they will have to pay no tax to the State from the guaranteed return they have on their guaranteed investment?  That is what I would call a fairly clever use of funds.  Is there, <Col N="108" /> therefore, a tax benefit to the banks who are involved in this lending because of the fact that this is now a leasing arrangement as distinct from a lending arrangement?</P>
    <P>I should like to record my congratulations to Irish Shipping, to record vigorously the fact that they are just one of a considerable number of semi-State corporations run efficiently, perhaps not commercially because of artificial constraints imposed upon them.  I still believe that part of the mechanism in the vehicle for growth in productive industry has to be through a vigorous, expanding thriving, enterprising, public sector.  The excessive reliance on private enterprise being advocated by private concerns and by the disciples of private enterprise in the IDA will not work.  We have many models in the public sector of successful enterprise.  They are to be encouraged, extended and expanded.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirleach, I wish you well in your new office and I want to ask you to convey my good wishes to the Cathaoirleach on her election as Chairman of the Seanad and to say how pleased I am to meet the Seanad for the first time in this session.  With regard to the circulation of the Bill my office informs me that, whatever happened, we furnished the Bill in good time for circulation.  I do not know what happened after that, but I just want to make that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge talked about the particular circumstances of the funding of the <i>Panamax</i> which is being built at Verolme Dockyard. I might as well come bluntly to the point.  The reason the Government decided to make moneys available originally for the building of this ship was simply that we had a shipyard in Verolme which needed the work. We had 1,100 skilled people of one kind or another who did not have work, or were not likely to have work, if this provision were not made.  The market, red in tooth and claw, would build this ship. The Japanese were quoted to us at the time at £14 million, and we made a considered judgment that we should subsidise the building of the ship and allocate <Col N="109" /> it to Verolme Cork Dockyard.  It was as blunt and as simple as that.  I invite Members of this House to calculate over a two and a half year period the unemployment benefit that would accrue to 1,100 workers, some of them highly skilled, add redundancy money to that, do the sum, and tell us, even on hard financial grounds, whether we chose wisely in choosing as we did.</P>
    <P>It raised the whole question of social and economic objectives.  Senator Dooge, Senator Crowley and others mentioned this in the course of their contributions. It is, as the House knows, one of the serious problems which confront any Administration.  Senator Dooge asked for a sharp distinction to be made between the economic cost and the social cost.  In my opening speech I made that distinction quite clearly.  At present certain economists are propounding theories about what I call the market red in tooth and claw.  Worse, not merely are they propounding it, but certain Governments and economies are following that philosophy with very dire consequences not merely to the countries in which they are being followed out but to the rest of the world as well.  The economic cost was outlined in my opening speech, and the extent of what you can call a subsidy, if you wish, was also outlined to the House.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I was interested to hear in a very good contribution from a new Senator that the Japanese Government were subsidising the shipyards directly and, in a hidden fashion, subsidising the steel industry which would also help the shipyards. I was interested to hear that since the country which could have built ships so many millions cheaper than the Cork Dockyard could was, in fact, Japan.  Irish Shipping Limited quoted to us what it would cost in the open market and they said that, in accordance with the principles on which they were running their business, they would regard it as unjust if they were forced by us to accept a contract at anything greater than what they could have got it at on the open market.  I do not think there was any failure in what I said to distinguish between the economic cost, the cost on the open market, and the price we put on <Col N="110" /> the ship.  If you subtract the economic cost from what we now call the social joint economic and social cost, you will see exactly where the amount of subsidisation came in.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to say that, because of this arrangement, which is, in fact, a subsidy for the shipyard rather than for Irish Shipping Limited, any kind of doubt about Irish Shipping Limited should rub off as the result.  It was made quite clear by us when we made the original decision and it has been made clear by us now, what the motivation was, which was connected with the availability of 1,100 skilled people in the shipyard for whom we wanted to provide work.  I made a reference to CIE simply to indicate the kind of guarantee the Government can give.  I was not comparing the activities of CIE with the activities of Irish Shipping Limited.  I accept the point made by Senator Murphy later on that, in so far as we have a public service which on strict economic grounds cannot be justified but which can be heavily justified on social grounds, we should be as proud of that service as we are of the one which is making a profit in the State.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge and all the other Senators who spoke paid a tribute to Irish Shipping Limited, a tribute which is very well deserved.  What particular benefit paying the subsidy directly would have, as Senator Dooge suggested at the end of his speech, I do not know, if we can lay our hands on finance now at reasonable cost and use it for this development.  Senator Crowley again raised the matter of economic and social costs in the semi-State area.  Some Members of this House took part in the joint committee deliberations on many of the State companies, and nearly everybody in public life is aware of the problems.</P>
    <P>There is a danger in developing a kind of subsidy syndrome and lying back and waiting for the State to pay the debts at the end of the year.  I am not necessarily conceding to Senator Crowley that this is the case in any of the ones he mentioned, or any of the ones under the aegis of my Department and whose activities I have been studying very carefully and very deeply over the past few weeks.  I admit, <Col N="111" /> as Senator Crowley said, that the money that is around nowadays is dear money and there is a difficulty when a semi-State body have to be subsidised with dear money as of now.  In the other House today we introduced a Bill setting up An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  The Government deliberately made generous allowance for the original funding of those two boards because they did not want heavy debts with heavy interest rates hanging around their necks, thus inhibiting them and impeding them from the very beginning.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Mahony paid tribute to Irish Shipping but expressed regret at the method of funding of this operation.  I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate what I have already said, that in no way could this arrangement be construed as being critical of Irish Shipping, casting any doubts on their ability to carry out the business for which they were founded and which they are carrying out very successfully.  Both in Senator Dooge's contribution and in Senator O'Mahony's there seemed to be an indication that there might be a kind of guilt by association or something like that.  I should like to refute that.</P>
    <P>I was asked a number of questions which I will answer in so far as I may at this moment.  The funding is being done by banking organisations.  It is a banking transaction.  The details are being worked as of now, so I cannot give the rate of interest.  As I mentioned and as can be seen in the Bill itself, these details will be available when the accounts are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. With regard to the repayments, Irish Shipping will not have to pay back any more than they would have had to pay under the original arrangement, that is to say, their obligation will be tied merely to the £7.1 million mentioned in the original arrangement.  As far as the Exchequer is concerned, as I indicated already, the Exchequer will repay it.  It will appear in a subhead in the Estimates for the Department of Transport.</P>
    <P>I was also asked about ownership.  At the end of the period the boat will belong to Irish Shipping.  Another point raised <Col N="112" /> was about trading with South Africa.  I have no information on that as of now, but I will inquire into it and I will communicate with the Senator.  Senator Fallon emphasised very heavily the importance of the provision of jobs in the prevailing economic climate.  We welcomed the idea that private investment should be available and that there had been an invitation for such private investment for some time.</P>
    <P>I come now to Senator Murphy's contribution. I regret the lateness with which the Bill reached him.  My Department inform me that they had it ready.  I do not know what happened that it did not reach Senators in time.  All I can say about the shift in arrangements for financing is that it is to the benefit of Irish Shipping.  He put a very pertinent question when he asked: &ldquo;Are the people in Irish Shipping themselves happy with the arrangements?&rdquo; In fact, the people in Irish Shipping are working out the arrangements in consultation with the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport. So the answer to the question is that Irish Shipping are perfectly happy with the arrangments which have been worked out.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy said he was mystified at the great difference between the cost of building the ship in Verolme Cork Dockyard and the cost on the open market. I agree that it is mystifing.  Perhaps a fellow Senator gave an indication of one of the reasons, which is that the shipyard being quoted to us when this arrangement was first entered into was heavily subsidised by its own Government. Perhaps Senator Murphy was not in the House when I referred to that.  The Japanese shipyard which was prepared to build at the low figure I mentioned may have been getting an open Government subsidy, both direct and, as the Senator said, indirect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, in fact, a subsidy. This is a system of subsidising the building of this ship.  Senator Murphy went on to give a short historical conspectus on <Col N="113" /> the origin of Irish Shipping, and rightly said they were born out of our own domestic need and were a domestic achievement of which we could be proud. In fact, there is a recent history of the whole shipping story which spells this out in great detail, and which is of great interest, and a source of great pride to any Irish citizen in assessing how this self-reliance was developed - the self-reliance which was referred to by Senator Murphy.  I also agree with him, and it has been proved in the case of Irish Shipping, that people can get as much satisfaction from and dedication to public enterprise as they can from the private field.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the interesting contribution by Senator Cregan, who quoted an exact figure of £350 million in direct subsidies to shipbuilding companies in Japan, and also mentioned, as I did, indirect subsidies through the steel industry.  Senator Lennon was a little worried about the funding arrangements but, again, welcomed the fact that the ship is being built in this country.</P>
      <P>Senator B. Ryan made a useful defence of our semi-State companies and congratulated Irish Shipping on being so successful in what are agreed to be rough economic times.  He mentioned something very interesting about Bord na Móna being asked to supply fuel at lower than world prices and said we should not blame them if this shows on their balance sheet.  This is interesting to me because I come from a little bit north of an area where Bord na Móna have been a very strong sustaining economic force.  I remember years and years ago reading the ESB annual report, and seeing there that the unit cost of electricity produced from turf or the various kinds of processed peat Bord na Móna were supplying to the ESB, was greater than that for oil.  Now the reverse has taken place, so we should not be too positive about anything in the field of economics.</P>
      <P>A pertinent question asked by Senator Ryan at the end of his speech was: Is a tax benefit at the expense of the Irish taxpayer going to somebody outside the country?  The answer to that is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank Senators for their contributions. <Col N="114" /> We are anxious to have this Bill passed and become an Act on the Statute Book for reasons which became obvious from my speech on Second Reading.  Our reason for changing from the original arrangment was quite bluntly to tap a new source of funds not otherwise available to the Government.  That is desirable in these times, provided &mdash; and we are sure of this - we are getting a good bargain and it will not cost us any more.  In fact we may gain substantially from it.  Irish Shipping, as I have said already, are very happy with the arrangments and are working out the arrangements themselves.  I think I have covered all the points made by Senators and I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 1, it is not usual to have points on the definition section, but I have one on this Bill.  There is a danger of confusion in the Bill in regard to guarantees given by Irish Shipping and guarantees given by the Minister for Finance.  The definition of &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; attempts to ensure that this confusion does not arise in the interpretation of the Bill.  But unfortunately it defines that &ldquo;guarantee means, except in section 2 of this Act, a guarantee given under that section&rdquo;.  My problem is why this does not read &ldquo;except in section 2(1)&rdquo; because it appears to me that guarantees other than guarantees given by the Minister <Col N="115" /> only appear in section 2 (1).  The effect of the definition as it stands was to make me search the other subsections to see if both guarantees were mentioned. I suggest that it would be better drafting of this Bill if it said &ldquo;guarantee means except in section 2 (1) of this Act; a guarantee given under that section.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Senator is saying that because the word &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; is used only in section 2 (1) it would be better to have section 2 (1) in the definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The word &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; in the sense of guarantee by Irish Shipping rather than guarantee by the Minister for Finance is, as far as I can see, in section 2 (1) only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister may guarantee, in such form and manner and on such terms and conditions as he thinks fit, the due payment by the Company of any moneys (including moneys in a currency other than the currency of the State) payable by the Company in respect of any guarantee given by the Company...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>That guarantee in line 23 is the guarantee other than the one given by the Minister.  Guarantee in that sense occurs only in that subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I still think the fact that the Senator is pointing it out in the terms in which he is pointing it out shows that it does not cause any ambiguity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Let me be absolutely clear on this.  That definition is necessary because two types of guarantee are mentioned in subsection (1).  My point is that it is only in subsection (1) that I can find the two types of guarantee. All the guarantees mentioned in subsections (2), (3) and (4) appear to be guarantees given by the Minister for Finance under subsection 2 (1).  For anybody, like me, studying the Bill, it took five or six extra minutes because it said &ldquo;except in <Col N="116" /> section 2&rdquo; rather than saying &ldquo;except in section 2 (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were not clarity I would feel the need for putting it in there. A careful reading makes it quite clear to whom or to what the word &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo; refers.  For that reason the definition should stand.  I would only be too willing to accept what the Senator says if I thought there is lack of clarity.  I do not think there is any lack of clarity in it which would cause any confusion later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is that it is not good drafting.  It would be better drafting if it said &ldquo;except in section 2(1)&rdquo;. The present drafting wasted some of my time.  It will probably waste the time of anybody else reading the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The indication I have is that each reference to guarantee in subsections (2), (3) and (4) is to the guarantee under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  That is the point I made at the outset, which means that the only time any other guarantee arises is under section 2(1).  We are absolutely <i>ad idem</i> about the effects of the various subsections.  My point is that, given that position, the draftsman should have said in section 1 &ldquo;guarantee means, except in section 2(1) of this Act, a guarantee given under that section.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 is the heart of the Bill.  A number of Senators would like clarification on this section, as far as it can be clarified now, on the question in regard to what new arrangements are. The Minister indicated in his reply on Second Stage the decision to build in Cork.  There is, of course, absolutely common cause on that.  The question at issue, in the sense that there was any question at issue on Second Stage, was the particular manner in which this should be done.  I understand from what the Minister said in his reply that the position will be that there will be a subhead in the Estimates for his Department which will provide each year for the repayments over and above those repayments which would have had to be made by Irish Shipping if they had been able to sign a contract for £14.2 million and borrow at 8 per cent for eight years.  I should like to ask how will that will read.  Will it read as a payment to Irish Shipping to be paid by them to the financial institution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same point, I am not quite clear, I think the Minister said during his concluding remarks on Second Stage that Irish Shipping would have an obligation to meet the charges on £7.1 million, approximately a quarter of the total cost of the carrier.  Is that the case, that the Exchequer will be responsible for approximately three-quarters of the annual repayment costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The original was £7.1 million, plus £7.1 million equity and the remainder.  I take it that Irish Shipping are being guaranteed that they would have no further financial commitment other than the one originally mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge asked about the actual payments.  I mentioned in my reply that phased payments would be paid by the Government through the Department of Transport and would appear as a subhead in the Vote for the Department of Transport. <Col N="118" /> As of now the description would not have been settled on as to subhead number but that is the mechanism through which the pay-back will be shown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Here I think we have the nub of my difficulty and I think it is a difficulty shared.  If that reads &ldquo;payment to bank X&rdquo; then there is no reflection on Irish Shipping.  If it reads &ldquo;payment to Irish Shipping&rdquo; there is a reflection on Irish Shipping.  I think it is important. This is part of our difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I had assumed with Senator Dooge that given the first paragraph in page 2 Irish Shipping will have to &ldquo;assume formal responsibility for the full £28 million cost.&rdquo;  That would consequently mean that the Exchequer payment covering the so-called subsidy element of this total cost would have to go to Irish Shipping to be paid on by them which would cause this confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a real difficulty. The Minister mentioned in his reply that there was no difficulty.  He made it quite clear in his Second Reading speech and he is making it quite clear in his reply that this was a subsidy to Verolme not a subsidy to Irish Shipping, but to somebody reading a Book of Estimates in the future there is the difficulty of misinterpretation.  Let us all be humble: what we say here today quickly becomes something filed away.  Over a period of 12 years apparently there will appear a sum in the Book of Estimates year after year and if that appears as anything remotely like &ldquo;subsidy to Irish Shipping&rdquo; this is something undesirable; this being substituted for &ldquo;Subsidy to Verolme <Col N="119" /> Dockyard&rdquo; in the Estimates of the Department of Transport is an undesirable thing.</P>

At the opening of his Gettysburgh address he said that people would not remember very long what he had to say. Irish Shipping Limited are satisfied with the arrangements we are making.  In the subhead in the Estimate for the Department of Transport it will not read as a subsidy, whatever the formula of words, to Irish Shipping Limited.</P>

I would like to say that I hope that as a result of this arrangement it does not involve long, detailed consultation.  When Irish Shipping were giving evidence before the joint committee they mentioned that on one occasion they had lost £2 million due to delays in decisions arising out of the purchase of ships.  I hope that the Minister will make every effort that all decisions <Col N="120" /> made, not just on this matter but on other matters in regard to Irish Shipping, will be made with due expedition.</P>

      <P>I have been raising points on section 2 (1), but in regard to section 2 (3) we are here concerned with the question of whether foreign currencies are involved and this indicates that they will be calculated by the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the giving of the guarantee.  When is the guarantee going to be given?  We are now talking about a ministerial guarantee.  Here is one of the questions where my point on section 1 comes in.  Is it possible that the Minister could give a guarantee for the total amount in the beginning and that there could follow exchange fluctuations which might be to the disadvantage or possibly to the advantage of Irish Shipping? Is the position one of global guarantee or is it an annual guarantee in regard to the particular burden which will fall on Irish Shipping each year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <P>In regard to section 5, this does indicate that we will get <i>post factum</i> information in regard to guarantees which have been given.  There is reference in section 5 to particulars of the guarantees.  My question to the Minister is how particular will the particulars be? We have had the experience in this House of having financial returns in regard to guarantees and funding and sometimes we have to take out our pocket calculators in order to work out what is the basis, what rates of interest have been involved here, what sums have been involved. How much detail does the Minister envisage will be here?  Will there be enough detail for simple-minded Senators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to say that the particular branch of the human race which is called simple or innocent Senators has not come into my ken yet. The financial particulars of the guarantee will be detailed enough for Senators to be able to see exactly what is happening with regard to the particular guarantee funds.  I would be quite confident that the guarantees will be clear enough to an average intelligent person reading them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am asking the Minister here is that he should assure us that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, will not talk over our heads and will not bemuse us in this regard.  I do not think it would be sufficient to have the information in the form in which we have had certain information in the past.  We have indicated here that there is a very <Col N="123" /> real difficulty.  The Minister said it will need ingenuity in regard to the Book of Estimates to avoid giving a wrong impression that there is a subsidy.  We certainly would need fuller particulars than are usually given in such returns to the House and I would be glad if the Minister could convey that to his colleague.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that my reading of section 5 (a) is that particulars of the guarantee are the general particulars of the guarantee.  If he looked at (b) and (c) he would see that there are specifics there which should satisfy any Member of the House.</P>

I regret very much that the Senator does not think that (a), (b) and (c) taken together form a comprehensive statement which would make it very clear to the House exactly what the details of the whole transaction are.  I am pretty sure that when the Senator comes to examine it in the first instance he will see that in the combination of (a), (b) and (c) there will be a clear statement of the position easily intelligible to a Member of the House.</P>

I believe strongly now that we must improve radically the accounting systems, the financial data systems which are available to us in the House.  I hope that the Minister can provide the fullest possible information when it comes to the point.</P>

I am not questioning the right of Senators to try to push that out to the limit of information they are entitled to and that is the absolute limit.  That having been said, I would like to indicate also that there is no reason why what is laid before the House should not be the subject of full discussion either here &mdash; courtesy of your Chair &mdash; or in the rare case that there is time to spare in the other House.

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 (Part II) (No. 8) Regulations, 1982 and Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 (Exporter's Licences) (Fees) Regulations, 1982</P>
      <P>copies of which were laid in draft before the Seanad on the 27th day of April, 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. L. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. L. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. L. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>These proposed regulations would increase the fees payable in respect of cattle, horses, sheep and pigs presented for veterinary inspection under the Fresh Meat Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  The present rates of fees are quite inadequate to meet the cost of the veterinary inspection service provided by my Department and it is necessary that they be brought more into line with that cost.  It is proposed to raise the fee for cattle from £1 to £1.75 per head, for sheep from 17p to 30p per head, and for horses from 5p to £1.75 per head. In the case of pigs the increase would be from 0.01p to 50p per head.</P>
      <P>Hitherto no charge has been made for the veterinary inspection of live animals before export.  That inspection and the veterinary inspection at export slaughtering premises are both carried out by my Department's veterinary service and it is appropriate that both trades should contribute equally to the cost of the inspection facilities provided.  Accordingly, in order to ensure that there is equivalence of treatment between the export trade in live animals and that in meat I have introduced an identical fee in respect of the veterinary inspection service provided by my Department for animals exported live by sea or by air or across the land frontier for export from Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 31 December, 1980 the fee for pigs was 25p.  At that time the pigmeat industry was going through a difficult period and the Government decided that it would reduce exceptionally the level of fee from 25p to 0.01p per pig for the years <Col N="126" /> 1981 and 1982.  This represented an annual relief of about £500,000.  It was envisaged that the industry would cooperate in centralised marketing through the Pigs and Bacon Commission and would pay to that body an administrative levy of 65p per pig.  However, following on a decision by the Court of Justice in Luxembourg and a Supreme Court decision here which ruled against the charging of a statutory levy the Commission was effectively left without a source of revenue to enable it to function.</P>
    <P>The Government remains firmly of the opinion that centralised marketing is essential in the long-term interests of the pigmeat industry.  Because of the reasons I have outlined, however, this can only be done on a voluntary basis.  I am pleased, therefore, that the industry itself has decided to take over completely the running of the Pigs and Bacon Commission since 5 April.  To enable the restructured organisation to get off the ground with a clean slate, the Government for their part have taken over responsibility for the accumulated deficit of some £5.6m of the old Pigs and Bacon Commission and I will be introducing a Supplementary Estimate later to provide for this.  In undertaking to clear this deficit the Government made it clear to the industry that a fee for veterinary inspection services would be reimposed on pigs, and hence the draft regulations now before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The cost of providing the veterinary inspection service at meat export plants has increased steadily over the years. This is mainly attributable to increased salaries and inflation as well as to some expansion in the industry generally and increased diversification.  The cost has risen steeply in the past few years, and the position now is that the present fees are much less than adequate to meet the cost of the service.</P>
    <P>The new rates of fees are expected to bring in £3.1 million in a calendar year while the cost of the meat inspection service is estimated at £4.4 million.  When they are viewed in the context of the present-day values of livestock the rates of fees are very modest.  The veterinary inspection service is a vital element in our <Col N="127" /> meat export business.  Without satisfactory veterinary supervision and certification our products simply will not be accepted abroad, and as major meat exporters we must ensure that our products meet the highest standards of hygiene demanded by the customer.  It seems only reasonable that those interests which benefit directly from the service should bear the cost.  I propose to bring the increases into effect on 31 May, 1982.  The proposed increases have been cleared by the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like belatedly to take the opportunity of congratulating you and wishing you well in your position as Cathaoirleach.  When I spoke here last week you were absent so I omitted doing it on that occasion.  I would also like on this occasion for the record to express my warm wishes and congratulations to An Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator McDonald.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated to us certain increases envisaged in the case of beef, mutton and pigmeat.  In the case of cattle it is a very substantial increase from £1 to £1.75p per head.  It goes from zero in the case of pigs to 50p, and goes up to 30p per head for sheep.  I am not opposing the introduction of these measures, but I would hastily add that future costs along these lines would need to be thought out very carefully because the industry at the present time will find it extremely difficult if not impossible to carry this sort of cost.  During the current year we are talking in terms of between £3 million and £4 million extra which must come from the trade and which indirectly has to come from the producer.  That is a factor I would ask the Minister to bear in mind. Allied to this we have a situation which we might also remember in the agricultural export context, that 35 per cent of all of our exports are in fact agricultural. This is relevant to the present debate. We must make certain that our exports in the agricultural world are preserved and furthered in whatever way we can. Any upsetting of that would be very dangerous. It must also be remembered that <Col N="128" /> for every £100 produced here in the form of agricultural goods only £20 of that is imported.  That stands up very well in comparison with other spheres.  I do not wish to overstress this whole agricultural theme, but we are talking about exports and regulations concerning them and I would point out again that 20 per cent of our population are directly involved in the agricultural industry.  The allied industries such as the food and drink industry, which would include dairy co-operatives, fertiliser industry, cattle meat plants and bacon factories, would represent 7 per cent of our total workforce. Added to that we have the service sector of 18 per cent.  Putting this picture together we see where 45 per cent of our workforce, a very sizeable portion, is directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture. We ought to be extremely careful in every step we take to ensure that our agricultural exports, which are one of the main lifelines of our economy, are not upset.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to mention that the agricultural sector &mdash; and we will have an opportunity of debating this at a later time &mdash; is in a very serious position, having declined very badly since 1978-81. Farmer incomes dropped by 50 per cent during that three year period.  I hope that during the current year we will see a position whereby farmers' incomes will match inflation, but that assumes certain favourable factors such as good weather, good returns on crops and so on.  The position is still very critical and we have a situation where a drop in income of 50 per cent is not likely to alter to any extent except to match inflation in the current year.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the marketing of beef, pigmeat and mutton, together with other agricultural exports, there is a great urgency about streamlining the whole operation right across the spectrum here. The CBF is a promotions organisation and consideration should be given to giving CBF greater authority and perhaps giving it some marketing powers. We are aware, of course, that it is a promotions body, not a marketing board as such.  I suggest in the case of pigmeat, <Col N="129" /> which is marketed by the Pigs and Bacon Commission, that consideration should be given to &mdash; I am aware that there are re-arrangements at the moment afoot &mdash; the establishment of something akin to Bord Bainne, which is a co-operative society.  Bord Bainne have worked very effectively as a co-operative society and, in accordance with the EEC regulations, they had to form themselves into a co-operative society at the time of our entry into the EEC.  There has been a very serious weakness in the whole marketing of pigmeat in the last number of years and I ask the Minister to address himself to that area and perhaps some lessons could be learned from the marketing of dairy produce which has been quite good.</P>
    <P>When we come back to the question of exports within the beef sector, while it is indicated that there has been some levelling off of the position between live exports and killed meat, I suggest to the Minister that there is still a very serious gap here between cattle sold live and cattle sold in dead meat form.  The exports refunds are totally and wrongly in favour of the live trade.  I hastily add, however, that the live trade must be preserved. I do not think we can suggest that there would be a cutting down or cutting out of the live trade, but I am talking about equalisation, that the actual refunds for live animals should be on a par with actual refunds for dead meat. The proposed regulation to which we have referred already of £1-£1.75 for cattle, up to 50p for pigs and 30p for sheep are not sufficient to cover the costs of veterinary inspection, but I again emphasise that this amount of cost is indeed sufficient and it is right that any costs are borne by the Exchequer, and any additional costs should also come from Exchequer funds.  At present, as the Minister is aware, if our agriculture industry is to recover we need a very significant boost to our stock.  We had in 1981 a very severe de-stocking of holdings when farmers, for the purposes of income, had to sell stock.  Another relevant point is that since 1981 beef slaughtering was down 35 per cent, yet no less personnel were required for veterinary inspection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> That needs to be looked at, and I also draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there should be a veterinary inspection for dead meat and live animals.  Perhaps they are not the one and the same thing.  I appreciate that veterinary inspection is required for live animals being exported but I suggest that the same degree of detailed work is not involved in the two operations.  Another point that strikes one very forcibly is that at present the EEC Commission are proposing regulations to harmonise the cost of veterinary inspection within the EEC of all slaughterings.  Perhaps we could get some information fairly soon on that and harmonisation may be desirable from our point of view.</P>
    <P>I have referred to these urgencies and I have also talked about the general situation surrounding these regulations, but the position in Irish farming at the moment needs attention very seriously and very urgently.  There are many farmers in a very serious position.  We have a motion which the Leader of the House told us today will be for discussion at the next sitting on credit for farmers, and we look forward to discussing that because it is very relevant at this stage.  There are many farmers on the verge of going out of business and I do not think we can overstate the case.  I agree with the measures which the Minister has introduced and draw his attention to the very critical economic position of Irish farming at the present time.  I appeal to him to make certain that whatever streamlining is required is done and to make our whole marketing area more efficient and more competitive because we have a potential for improvement right across the spectrum of agriculture produce.  I look forward with interest, and we believe it to be an extremely urgent matter, to discussing this whole question of credit and the overall income situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with everything that Senator Hourigan said.  While the increases do not look much on paper, they are if you add them to the many other increases that are there at the moment as far as pigs and, to a greater extent, cattle are concerned.  The timing <Col N="131" /> of this increase is wrong.  It has almost doubled, and while the Minister has said that there has not been any increase over the last number of years, perhaps it would have been better if it had gone up at a slower rate rather than doubling later on. For that reason the timing is wrong, because this comes on top of the many other expenses there are at the end of the line as far as the producer is concerned. At the moment we are in a position where we were meant to have free 45 day or 30 day testing, which was passed in Brussels last year and has not come yet.  That comes on top of many other increases in haulage and other expenses which come at the very same time as this end of the line increase here.</P>
      <P>For that reason while I find it hard to agree to any increase, being a farmer and a cattle producer, I have to agree with Senator Hourigan when he says there is a big job ahead of the Minister as far as beef is concerned.  We have seemed to drift in the past few years from having a glut to having a scarcity in the beef situation, but we must have a proper marketing system.  I would like to take the opportunity to remind the Minister that the free testing which was meant to come into effect last year has not come yet.  It is for those reasons that I oppose any increase at present because, as Senator Hourigan rightly pointed out, the farming community are going through a very difficult time at the moment and nobody knows that better than he, coming from a good farming county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of a survey carried out by ACOT over the past few months is startling. Being a member of the ACOT board for a short period, I thought the number tended to be on the low side rather than the high side because this survey had been carried out by the instructors who are working with the farmers.  It is true that many farmers had not been in touch with instructors at all. There are also many other farmers who would be in trouble and would not like to disclose this to anybody.  For that reason, I think the position is much worse than it appears on the surface.  I would like the Minister to attend to those points <Col N="132" /> urgently.  While some might say that the package yesterday is going to give some relief to farmers, I say it is too little too late to a hard-pressed community that is going through a very trying time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address a few remarks on this enabling draft that is before us.  There is no relationship whatsoever between the charges here and what it probably costs in veterinary inspection, for cattle, sheep and pigs and, to a limited extent horses.  In principle, we agree that some charge has to be made.  But I think it is the feeling of the House that this particular function is the responsibility of the State rather than of the industry.  One of the reasons that there is veterinary inspection in factories, irrespective of trying to decide on the quality or otherwise of carcasses is the hygienic aspect of it, both for our home market and for the export trade.  In that instance I do not think we should exempt the State from its responsibilities in this matter.  To foist increases, which run from 50 per cent to quite a steep increase in cattle, at a time when the processing industry on which employment in agriculture is so dependent and in which there has been tremendous loss of employment over the last couple of years, would be taken as an added blow to the disincentives that are already there for producers to sell to factories.  In 1974 the factories, through the co-operatives, made colossal profits at the expense of the producer.  Very few of us had sympathy for the factories at that time, very few of us have sympathy for them now because with the export of live cattle they can now close their factories or work a three day week.  In spite of extensive processing facilities which are totally under-utilised, increased charges are being levied on the industry using this processing and that will be a further disincentive to make the fullest use of the processing plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You may say that 75p on the price of a bovine animal is not a considerable amount relative to its total cost but an increase to 50p in the price of a pig for inspection of a carcass is often the total amount of profit that is available to a pig <Col N="133" /> producer.  I would like the Minister to realise that when you talk about an increase of this nature in a section of the industry which has its peaks and valleys and because of our improvement in production, breeding and food conversion, the pig producers who have remained in pig production are more than likely to stay in it but they have to be prepared to work on minimum profit and, at times, no profit.  I dwell on the pig industry particularly, because that increase is so close to the profit margins which are applicable to this industry.  The State seems to be abdicating what is a statutory function relative to hygiene and passing it back to the industry which, unfortunately, according to all economists cannot take these kind of charges.  Perhaps this is the fault of the industry, but in 1980 we produced something like 2 million pigs which were valued at about £130 million and the projection for 1986 is that we will produce about 2½ million pigs.  In spite of that increased production, the number of people that have managed to stay in pig production has dropped considerably, something like 1,000 pig farmers are all that will be left producing pigs, which means that they have had to rationalise.  They have had to have a complete look at their housing, input costs, feed conversion and have had to improve breeding efficiency.  They have managed to do that to stay in business, and that is good.  Nobody wants to prop up any sector of society whether it is in agriculture or otherwise unless there is justification for it.</P>
    <P>We must realise that our bacon and pork industry has been the backbone of small farmers for a long time.  Unfortunately, because of economics they have slowly gone out of the business.  Now we have a chosen few who have had the courage to stay, and we must admire them.  These farmers have increased pig producing figures, the numbers per sow and numbers of bonhams and they have increased dramatically over the last decade. It is doubtful whether the EEC compensation announced by the Council of Ministers yesterday of 10½ per cent in pigmeat, will be sufficient to compensate the <Col N="134" /> people who are at present in the pig trade.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined another anomaly in his introductory speech, that is the predicament that the Pigs and Bacon Commission found themselves in.  I agree totally with Senator Hourigan's proposal that we should look at the whole sales spectrum, particularly regarding pork and bacon, because they are now surviving on a voluntary levy which is applied at the slaughter house to prop up the exports to make us competitive with our EEC partners, especially the Danes. Because it is voluntary, the whole structure of the sale of bacon and pork in foreign countries is in a most unhappy situation.  It is likely to change if this voluntary levy is removed at any time or the industry will put the responsibility on the State who have accepted it in the past but, because of EEC regulations, have had to rationalise and go to the co-operative movement.</P>
    <P>If this is the way forward I think the State should clearly indicate that we do not want the bacon industry to collapse, because it gives a lot of employment to the limited numbers in it.  It gives tremendous potential to the people who produce the cereal for pig feeding and it will benefit, in the long term, the whole national economy and the hygiene if even this voluntary levy was extended to pork butchers who are now unlicensed.  I am worried that they can indiscriminately carry on a business in which bacon curers who are licensed have to comply with certain regulations.  We should take a complete look at our processing industry.</P>
    <P>This draft regulation does not allow us to go into full detail of how important the agricultural industry is, but I resent the charges being suddenly foisted on an industry at a time when they are at a tremendous loss.  Factories are totally under-utilised and workers are losing their jobs which are directly involved in agriculture which we all aspire to having improved and maintained.  If as a nation we are to survive we must ensure that agriculture does survive and is maintained. The State has a role to play in this.  Increasing these charges, passing them to the industry indiscriminately and abdicating our rights under the hygienic <Col N="135" /> regulations that we would like to see operated, is an unfair measure.  The principle of it is correct.  I would not argue about costs because they are probably not comparable with what it costs the State to carry out these inspections.</P>
    <P>Senator Lennon asked the Minister, in regard to the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication scheme, to comment on the fact that there is £4 million approved by our European partners for the acceleration of the disease eradication programme to assist farmers in the pre-sale testing of animals, but that, because of staff embargo, this cannot be implemented here.  That is a national disgrace. We have a responsibility to ensure that all animals moved in this State are tested. The money is available from our European partners to do so and, because of that, the State has a responsibility to the industry to ensure that there will be no further delay in eliminating the indiscriminate movement of non-tested animals at tremendous risk to the clear herds and the reasonably clear status of all our herds.  If that is implemented it will go some way towards removing the dread and fear of people who avail of the live export trade because of the fact that you can ship to Libya without going through the regulations of testing, without going through the worry of locking up your herd, in an industry which at the moment is in dire straits about making its economic package meet the requirements of its input costs.  Any one who has any knowledge of the industry realises that the outlook is anything but rosy.  We will have another opportunity soon, I hope, to debate the full economics of agriculture but I object to charges being passed on to an industry which cannot afford it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>A measure like this does not entitle us to a full debate on the agricultural industry unless we want to incur the wrath of the Cathaoirleach and I am sure we do not want to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure that we are discussing here this afternoon has been discussed time and time again in the past.  I remember I had to introduce measures similar to this and, of course, at a time when the <Col N="136" /> market is buoyant nobody worries about it.  At a time like this, particularly in the past few years, when we know that the agricultural industry has gone through a pretty difficult period when farmers' incomes have dropped by something like 50 per cent in the past three years, we can well understand the attitude of farmers and their organisations to a measure of this kind.  However, when one looks at the overall benefit that those inspections bring to the industry, it is very important that the highest standards of hygiene are maintained at all times.  Human nature being what it is, there must be some kind of inspection to ensure that only first class products are exported and that we maintain the markets that we have abroad. We all understand that we have great potential for bacon, mutton and beef abroad at present and it is right that we should exploit that to the full.</P>
    <P>We know too, that our bacon maintained a very high standard in England for a long time and for the past two years there has been a certain amount of criticism of the type of bacon presented there now.  That is something we should monitor very carefully, so that we will not lose this market to the Danes or anybody else.  I know that the Pigs and Bacon Commission in the past have had their problems, and perhaps they could not give enough attention to the export of bacon, but now that they have been reconstituted and that the deficit of £5.6 million which they had incurred has been taken over by the Government, it is up to them to see that the high standards are maintained and that Irish bacon maintains its place in the foreign market.</P>
    <P>We know that the pig industry here has changed dramatically in the last number of years.  It is no longer the type of trade that we knew when we were young, when everybody had a few pigs.  It is much more specialised now and people who are in the trade have to watch their costs and have to monitor those costs very carefully because we know that the profit margin is not great, but I still do not believe it is as small as Senator Ferris says it is.  They still have a fairly reasonable profit.  Naturally enough, they have to watch that and they do not like to see veterinary <Col N="137" /> costs of this kind increase any more than we do.  For the overall benefit of the trade, it is important that we maintain those inspections and the highest standards at all times.</P>
    <P>We have a great market for beef in foreign countries, particularly in Germany.  This is something that the CBF have been sponsoring and trying to build up their trade over the past few years, and they have been very successful.  I hope that will continue.</P>
    <P>We hear arguments time and time again about exporting live cattle &mdash; exporting on the hoof &mdash; and we have the lobby for and against.  It would be disastrous to give a monopoly of this trade to the factories, because anybody involved in the agricultural industry knows what happened in 1973 and 1974, when the factories had a monopoly in this trade and I do not think there is any farmer who would want to see them have that monopoly again.  For that reason it is important to balance the trade, that we would have our live exports at all times and that we would exploit the markets and ensure that we develop them but that we also would have the meat factories doing their share.  I would not like to see the factories having a monopoly in the trade.  It would be bad for the industry, for the farmers, and they are the people that we have to think of at all times.</P>
    <P>In view of the buoyancy in the trade at the moment, both in cattle, sheep and pigs I think the charges being imposed here today are very small, and I am sure the industry will benefit from the inspections that are taking place.  It is very important that those inspections be maintained at all times for the sake of the industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome back my colleague, Deputy Lorcan Allen, to congratulate him on his re-appointment to the Department of Agriculture and I hope that he will have every success in that office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to let this opportunity pass without registering my opposition and indeed my protest at what <Col N="138" /> is being proposed here in these regulations.</P>
      <P>In principle, I was always opposed to the levies and duties which are part of the package.  In their present form they essentially came into existence about four years ago and, at that point, what basically inspired them was a concession to an anti-farm lobby on the question of farm taxation generally.  Not alone was there a concession in 1978 for that particular lobby but they were also seen as a means of exacting money that was urgently needed for use in farm development. If I opposed them then on that principle I am still opposed to them today.</P>
      <P>I am more deeply concerned about what is being proposed to us this afternoon.  The extent &mdash; Senator Ferris referred to it &mdash; of the increase that is being proposed here is nothing short of amazing.  While the increase in the inspection fees for cattle might appear acceptable to some people, it is almost a doubling of the fee.  The inspection levy for sheep is certainly very close to a doubling of the fee.  In the case of pigs, unless my calculations are way out, we are talking of an increase of 5,000 per cent.  An increase of 5,000 per cent in the pig industry at the present time I cannot support and I cannot be part of it.</P>
      <P>Another point was made by Senator Ferris: the figure of 50p per pig has often been the profit margin in that industry per pig.  Perhaps it is something better now, but even if we work on a figure of perhaps £1 per pig, by introducing this levy of 50p we are agreeing to cut the income of the pig producer by half.  That too, is something that is not acceptable to me.  I accept the Minister's comment about the desirability to have central marketing.  It is something that I have always believed in and I want to see it encouraged.  Therefore I do welcome the decision by the Government to provide the £5.6 million necessary to enable the new Pigs and Bacon Commission to start off with a clean sheet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in fact imposing on an industry, as the Minister has told us, more than £3 million in levies in any one year, an additional burden of £3 million on an <Col N="139" /> industry that is far from being in a satisfactory position as far as cash flow and credit and finance are concerned.  I say to the Minister, and I am sure he will accept it, that there are a number of ingredients that are necessary to be considered with the object of promoting progress and increasing productivity on Irish farms, and there is no doubt that high among these is finance.  No matter how we look at it this evening we are putting a cost increase of 5,000 per cent on pig producers. It is being proposed that we lift a sum of more than £3 million from an industry that is in urgent need of finance for development.  Therefore, it is with the greatest reservation that I approach what is being proposed here, and it does not have my agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the previous speakers with regard to the order that is now before us.  I agree with one sentence from the Minister's opening remarks, that is, that the Government remain firmly of the opinion that centralised marketing is essential in the long term interest of the pigmeat industry. Indeed I would go along with that for the beef and pork industries as well.  Much can be done in the marketing of our meat products that perhaps has been done in a haphazard way up to now.  The CBF have done a reasonably good job in the short period of their official existence. Nonetheless, there is tremendous scope for improvement, particularly in the beef area.  The imposition of levies, and anything that will ensure that meat is properly processed is in itself admirable and I would go totally along with it.  Whether we should put the actual cost of that directly back to the producer &mdash; that is in <Col N="140" /> essence what we are doing because it will go back to the beef farmer who is already hard pressed &mdash; is another matter.  As the Minister has stated, the levy is small.  He might admit that the actual profit in the beef industry is equally small and the input costs have increased dramatically over the years and have left an industry very severely pressed &mdash; I sympathise particularly with a number of the small producers.  The Minister to some extent has eliminated an anomaly that existed. Though there was a levy at the slaughtering stage which did not exist at the export stage of live cattle, and though at the same time it is still going to come back to the producer, one cannot but have reservations about its implementation.  In the future we must look very seriously at the whole area of marketing and the investment that this State must commit itself to in the long term interest of a very important aspect of our society and of our whole economy, because we derive so much from the beef and bacon industries that if we attempt to impose levies we will push more people out of it.  I particularly say this in relation to the pigmeat industry in which there will be fewer and fewer people producing for slaughter. Any attempt to impose additional costs on the producer will eliminate more and more of these.</P>
      <P>There have been peaks and various crises in the industry down through the years, and it is one we must monitor very carefully.  I would think that the State, while it is taking up the slack in so far as the £5.6 million referred to by Senator Howard is concerned, nonetheless is taking something in the order of £3.1 million directly out of the producers' pockets.  That is in essence what you are doing by imposing this levy.  However, anything that will advance and improve the product which we process is to the overall advantage of the economy and to the overall advantage of the producer.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to a complete overhaul of the processing of pigmeat, with particular emphasis on marketing.  Beef has advanced to some degree but there is scope for a very major improvement in that respect.</P>

Under subhead (a), legislation covering these receipts will be introduced in the course of the year.

      <P>If you add it up there was no provision for the £4 or £5½ million that we have made provision for to pay for debts for the Pigs and Bacon Commission. I want to put it on record so that people will know the true situation.</P>
      <P>On some of the matters raised, I would like to deal first of all with the pigmeat industry.  It is not for the first time that fees have been in existence in this country. These have been in existence since 1930.  They were last reviewed in 1978.  In 1980 there was a fee of 25p per pig.  That was reduced to help the pig industry which was going through difficulties at that time.  An understanding was entered into at that time that there would be a levy of 65p per pig at the end of that year which would be payable to the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  That fell through in 1981 because of two High Court cases. At the time the 65p per pig was agreed upon by the Pigs and Bacon Commission and the producers.  What we are now proposing is a reduction of the figure then agreed upon.  Let us have our facts right when we are having an argument about the pig industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="142" /> Some Senators mentioned centralised marketing, which has been agreed upon in real terms.  We agreed with the Pigs and Bacon Commission and producers to pick up the deficit of £5.6 million that they at present have.  That is something which should help the pig industry in general.  Senator Hourigan said the refunds favoured the dead meat industry more so than the live meat industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">

    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. L. Allen Mr. L. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I meant. Our present Minister for Agriculture resolved that problem through his hard work and endeavours at Brussels to reverse that situation.  That is the up-to-date situation.  The dead meat trade is now on the right side.  That should be welcomed by the industry in general and certainly as far as the factories are concerned.</P>
      <P>The increases will only yield £3.1 million whereas the expenditure is estimated at £4.4 million.  That is approximately 70 per cent of the cost of inspections.  The factories for some time have been complaining that there were no inspections or no charge for live exports.  That has now been brought into line so that the whole industry is one.  This alleviates any discrepancies.  The factories were complaining that the live exporter had that advantage over the dead meat trade.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the point made by some speakers that we are not committed to increasing cattle numbers in this country. By our endeavours in Brussels we have been trying to get not alone a calved-heifer grant but also the £22 for calves up to six months old.  In so far as CBF are concerned, their grant has been approximately doubled this year to try to boost the sales of meat across Europe.  It is being increased from £371,000 to £765,000 this year.  That in itself speaks for our commitment in this area.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to deal with any of the other matters raised because they were totally irrelevant to this motion.  I thank Senators for their contributions. I hope that it will be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Clare</i>): The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act of 1958 contains a list of investments in which trustees may place trust funds unless the instrument setting up the trust forbids them to do so.  The terms of a trust may provide wider powers of investment than those set out in the Act; in that case of course trustees are not limited to the investments authorised in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> Section 2 of the 1958 Act provides that the list of authorised investments may be amended by order.  Before the Minister may make the order a draft must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution of approval must be passed by each House.</P>
    <P>The list of authorised investments has been reviewed frequently since the passing of the original Act.  As a result, several orders have been made under this section which have considerably increased the range of outlets for trust funds.  The most recent order was made in 1979.  The draft order now before the House proposes to authorise trustees to place trust funds in interest-bearing deposit accounts in three non-associated banks.  The Central Bank, which is the licensing authority for banks, has recommended that trustee status should be granted in these three cases.  This will bring to 31 the number of licensed banks in which trust funds may be deposited: these include the four associated banks and most of the other leading banks in the State.</P>
    <P>Before an order of this kind is laid before the Oireachtas, the following people must be consulted: a judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Public Trustee, the Governor of the Central Bank, the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, the Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee and the President of the Stock Exchange &mdash; Irish Unit.  All the statutory requirements in this respect have been complied with.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the banks named in the draft order are secure and that they are suitable for the investment of trust funds.  The order will further widen the range of investment opportunities open to trustees.  I therefore commend the motion for approval by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There cannot be objection to this.  It is desirable that there should be flexibility in regard to the investment of trust funds provided that there have been the usual guarantees. The Minister has indicated in his speech that the Central Bank has recommended that he has fulfilled the statutory consultations <Col N="145" /> that arise under section 2 (3) of the original Act and accordingly this is welcome.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that orders of this type have been made repeatedly from time to time.  The number of banks has now risen to 31 compared to 12 in the original Act of 1958.  It might be helpful if rather than have orders like this we could have consolidation.  Rather than have us in the position that we have to refer to order after order to find out how the original list is being extended, a short Bill which would make a substitution for section 1 of the 1958 Act might be in order.  I notice that section 1 of the 1958 Act which we are extending here was a total substitution for section 1 of the Trustee Act, 1893.  This might make it more convenient for reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad and wish him a fruitful period of office if not, from a constitutional point of view, a long one.</P>
      <P>I would like to give a general welcome to this order but I would like to ask the Minister a question about the general matter involved.  The Minister has outlined the statutory requirements of people who must be consulted before these investments are made.  I have no doubt that, having examined the credentials of these institutions and the proper people having been consulted, the Minister is satisfied that these institutions are satisfactory investments for trustee purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a matter of general principle here to which we should direct our attention. In an issue of this kind the Government, the State and ourselves are giving a certificate to a particular institution and informing the world at large, and investors in particular, that the institutions named in these orders are satisfactory and secure.  We are talking here about trustee investments.  Consequently, they must be investments which can offer security to the type of investment which is involved in a trust of this nature.  We are dealing with substantial investors in many cases but we are also dealing with relatively small investors.  We are dealing <Col N="146" /> with trusts from which people would otherwise have no income or access to an income upon which they are dependent. Consequently, the responsibility of the State and the Seanad is very considerable because we are giving a certificate, in effect, to these institutions and to these investments.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to raise this issue in view of the general economic climate of the country, but also in view of certain events in the financial area which have attracted considerable public attention.  It would be invidious for me to mention names or to give specific instances, but I think what I am talking about will be clear when I proceed.  I will give an instance in which very substantial moneys in the property field have been manipulated, and I do not necessarily mean manipulated in a morally pejorative term.  I am talking about the role of financial institutions, the role of investment bodies, some of which may involve trustee investment.</P>
    <P>We are talking about 31 banks.  I am referring to the role of these banks as the trustees and custodians of money and in many cases small investors' money, where that money is going, how it is being invested, to whom and under what circumstances it is being advanced.  If we as the Seanad, give a certificate to a particular institution, are we in effect giving a licence to that institution to provide money to whoever turns up at the door of that institution?  Recently, we had in the public prints and elsewhere the case of a very substantial property empire which was built upon advances of substantial moneys by important financial institutions.  There can be little doubt in any of our minds that some of the sums involved in that may well have been trustee investments.  It is neither the time nor the place to go into the precise financial details of that operation.  The Chair may feel that I am bordering upon the irrelevant, but the point I am trying to make is that we have a situation in which substantial moneys were advanced for operations which were essentially paper operations in terms of what they were dealing with, but which by manipulation of this money led to what could have <Col N="147" /> been, and possibly in other cases may well have been, and may still in this particular instance turn out to be, very substantial profits for an individual or small group of individuals, and this was based upon the manipulation of moneys and investments which may have come from trustee sources.</P>
    <P>I should like to make myself very clear. I am not insinuating or in any way suggesting that there is anything illegal in these operations or that they contravene the rules by which this type of thing operates.  What I am referring to is a situation in which one has small investors, trustee investments, trustee savings and the accumulation of funds on a trustee basis and these moneys being used to accumulate very substantial profits for property speculators.</P>
    <P>At the same time we have a situation where very large numbers of people are struggling to buy houses for themselves and for their families.  They are enduring and will endure very substantial hardships. In many cases they have committed themselves to payments of one kind or another, premiums on loans and so forth. They now find themselves possibly redundant or unemployed and in order to get their hands on the bricks or tiles of their houses, are struggling to acquire relatively small sums of money.  Yet at the very same time, we have institutions prepared to advance very substantial sums to people in the speculative area and often on what appears, by recent accounts, to be very small security.</P>
    <P>What I should like to ask is this: have we, in this House, any way of referring to this problem?  Have we any way of indicating to these institutions that, on behalf of the people who are in this situation, we take a very poor view of some of the operations which have taken place?</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, when he is concluding, to answer two questions. Firstly, what are the criteria by which people who vet these applications decide that one institution rather than another is suitable for this kind of investment or suitable to be designated under this legislation? Secondly, I should like him to <Col N="148" /> indicate and in particular to indicate to the people of Dublin West who are involved in this kind of situation where they have participated in the democratic process, what the policy of his Government is on the subject of the manipulation of investment and trustee moneys in order to provide speculative gains for a small group of individuals.</P>

      <P>I thank the two Senators for their contributions.  Senator Dooge's suggestion about a consolidation Bill will be considered.</P>
      <P>With regard to the institution mentioned by Senator O'Connell, there is a merchant bank attached to the firm to which I think he is referring.  That merchant bank is not authorised under this Bill or by any order.  As regards the question of scrutiny, there is very tight scrutiny maintained by the Central Bank on all banks.  I am sure that the question of misuse of trustee funds is taken into account every time they scrutinise the authorised banks.  That is the instrument of scrutiny.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>European Association of Programmes in Health Services Studies (Corporate Status) Order, 1982</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft form was laid before Seanad Éireann on 18 March, 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This draft order is being made under the International Health Bodies (Corporate Status) Act, 1971.  The only other corporate status order that has been made under the Act is the International Federation of Voluntary Health Services Funds (Corporate Status) Order, 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The association has now established a <Col N="149" /> permanent secretariat in Dublin.  The order sought will enable the association to be incorporated in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The European Association of Programmes in Health Services Studies was established in 1966.  It consists of 29 corporate members from 13 countries. These members are Universities and Institutes with educational, training and/or research programmes in health administration or health services studies. The Institute of Public Administration is the Irish corporate member of the association. Membership of the Association is also open to individuals, associates and honorary members.  It is a charitable non-profit making organisation.</P>
    <P>The aims and objectives of the association are to promote collaboration between European countries in the organisation and conduct of educational and training programmes in health services studies.</P>
    <P>The association arranges for information to be exchanged, organises study visits, encourages studies and research and runs an annual symposium and workshop for faculty of its corporate members. It has, in co-operation with the World Health Organisation and on its own initiative, conducted surveys and issued reports on training in health services and hospital administration in Europe.</P>
    <P>The scale of the Association's activities has, however, been restricted by lack of resources.  During the past year, however, the W K Kellogg Foundation in the USA made a grant of £174,000 to the Institute of Public Administration on behalf of the association.  The grant, which is to extend over a period of four years, is to enable the association to reach its full potential in fostering co-operation in education and training for the health services.  The grant will be used to pay for a full-time director and secretariat; to organise symposia and study teams, for example, to upgrade curricula; to arrange faculty development fellowships on a basis of exchange within Europe and between Europe and North America; and to support visits for study purposes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the association is a <Col N="150" /> body that should be welcomed to this country and that its status is such that I consider the corporate status order should be approved.  I have, in accordance with the Act, consulted the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism and he has no objection to granting corporate status to this body.  I have consulted the Minister for Finance and he has no objection to the proposal on the understanding that it involves no commitment for the Exchequer to provide financial assistance for this body.  I have no proposal before me to give financial assistance to this body.  Should the question arise in future years, the matter will be taken up with the Department of Finance.  I have also consulted the Ministers for the Public Service and Foreign Affairs and they have no objections.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, commend this resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreBolger" hpid="Mrs. Bolger Mrs. Bolger">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bolger</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Leas-Chathaoirleach on his appointment.  I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him every success.  It gives me great pleasure to support this order and the granting of corporate status to the European Association of Programmes in Health Services Studies.  Any organisation which promotes and encourages research, development and education in this field should be welcomed with opened arms.  I note that the Institute of Public Administration represents Irish membership of this association.  I commend them for all their work in this area.</P>
      <P>The two basic aims of the association are to stimulate new developments within the field of health care management and policy making and also to act as an intermediary between members of the association to ensure that the members learn from each other's experience in research and in development.  This country must surely hope to benefit enormously from membership of this association and from exchanges of ideas.</P>
      <P>I look forward to a long awaited policy and to a plan on community care in Ireland.  We must look to other countries who are leaders in this field and implement the best ideas from these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> Up to now, voluntary bodies have given up their time and energy in this area but they have been struggling for lack of finance, information, support and assistance. We see enormous sums of money being consumed in Ireland on the administrative side of the health and social welfare system.  I should prefer to see some of this finance diverted to research, education and preventive medicine.</P>
    <P>We should encourage the development and education of the community in health care.  The community should become more involved and our leaders at local level should be more active and outspoken. The society of the eighties is creating changing needs in health care.  Everybody realises this.  Hopefully, this association will help us to tackle the many ills in our society and rehabilitate those most in need.  Much has yet to be done in this area.  I understand that the Minister is very familiar with the problems which have to be tackled.  Very little has been done on research, preventive medicine and health education.  There are many areas that need research and study.  Alcoholism and drug addiction are two of the most serious social ills of our times.  It is a worldwide problem, so that we can only benefit by our active participation in this association.</P>
    <P>Take unmarried mothers and in particular schoolgirl pregnancies and non-accidental injury.  The increase in this area is absolutely frightening.  The underlying cause of all this is unemployment.  The problems connected with housing are creating tensions and putting excessive strain on couples and their families.  We cannot run away from these problems any longer because emigration no longer is the answer.  Marital breakdowns are on the increase.  We seem to accept this.  We give social welfare benefits and help these people in whatever financial way that we can, but I do not think that we do enough in this area.  We must ask ourselves why. We must do more research and see how other countries have answered these problems.</P>
    <P>One thing that continually disturbs me is the increasing rate of suicide.  It has been pointed out over and over again by <Col N="152" /> the medical profession that the numbers are being covered up.  The statistics are frightening.  We must uncover these statistics and tell the truth.  We must do our research and find out the reason for them. There are far too many pressures on our school-leavers and our students in third level education.</P>
    <P>We have had the Year of the Elderly, the Year of the Handicapped and so on. We have paid a lot of lip service in these areas.  There is still tremendous work to be done.  I hope that by our research in this area and by our membership of the Association at long last we will be doing something more than paying our usual lip service.  We must find ways to keep elderly people in their homes.  We must see how other countries are coping with this ever-increasing problem.  There is tremendous research to be done in the child care area.  Support services should be readily available for all people in the community.</P>
    <P>This order is a major step forward.  I look to full participation by this country. It is only by consultation and by research in a worldwide context that we can hope to develop in the health services studies for the betterment of our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tender to you my congratulations on your appointment as Leas-Chathaoirleach and to also tender to you my thanks and appreciation for your kindness to me and I am sure to other neophytes in the last short-lived term of the Seanad when you were Cathaoirleach.  I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Woods, to the Seanad and give my approval to the resolution which is before us today &mdash; the granting of corporate status in line with the other European countries.  I welcome the financial input to medical research and investigation.  It is in line with our development as a full member of the European Community that we should be kept aware of and move forward with various areas of research into health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the remarks of Senator Bolger. She touched on something which had been my point to make and which I am glad to take up.  She spoke of housing and <Col N="153" /> the need for proper housing in the overall context of health.  That is a point that should be made again and again.  I know it is one that the Minister for Health is very well aware of and one that he has spoken of often and has taken cognisance of.  I do not think one can take health as a subject and say if we give you such a thing and treat you for such a thing you are a healthy person and you remain healthy.  There should be much more emphasis on what I would call the broad subject of a healthy person, a healthy mind in a healthy body.  The saying <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i> was very wise.</P>
    <P>The area of housing is one which can lead to mental stress leading to ill health, and this should be looked at.  I should like to see some of the Kellogg research funding, which is so welcome, channelled into ascertaining how the domiciliary conditions of people affect their health. It is just a point I should like to put to the Minister when he is here.  As a member of a local authority I have come across many cases of mental stress leading sometimes, as Senator Bolger said, to marital distress and perhaps to marital breakdown. It is something that we should give due emphasis to.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister announced that he is totally committed to an in depth study of the causes of drug abuse.  I welcome his very outspoken statement on this matter recently.  In Athlone over the past month we held a symposium on it to which the Minister for Justice, Deputy Doherty, came and there was a huge response.  Over 1,000 parents attended, showing that there is awareness of the problem and that parents are anxious and worried about it.  There was a great number of young people present too, showing they are perceptive of the problem in their midst and that they want to find out the dangers abounding in it.  As I said, the Minister has announced publicly that he will implement an educational programme into the causes of drug abuse.  I welcome that and hope that within the parameters of the granting of corporate status under the Kellogg foundation financing, some money can go into that area.  It is a very major field.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment of voluntary <Col N="154" /> bodies to the field of health.  There can never be a replacement for voluntary commitment.  No matter what administrative staff or paid staff there is in any organisation there needs to be the backup of voluntary commitments which are given by so many bodies throughout the country.  Child care legislation for the prevention of child care abuse which the Minister has recently announced, following the tragic case last week in Dublin, is very welcome.  I suggest to the Minister that as regards social workers, care for young people and care for children at risk some money might very usefully be used for research in these areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome this very important injection of capital into the field of research in health and I should like to see it, as I know the Minister means it to be, expanded to include not only preventive medicine and health in general, but also areas such as housing, schooling and the environment which have such a bearing on the health of people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Woods) Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate you, Sir, on your appointment. To me it seems as if you have been there all the time, because the last time I was speaking here you were also in that position in the Chair.  I congratulate Senators on their return to the House and hope we will have many useful discussions and contributions on legislation which will be coming before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the two Senators for their contributions, which show that they understand what we are talking about, because the very complicated nature of the title puts most people off in the first instance. I appreciate that.  I could not do anything about it in the title because it happens to be the actual title.  The European Association will be primarily concerned with health management and with educating and training health managers.  It will not be directly concerned with medical matters but with the development of the theory of health care policy, which is something we are very interested in.  Both Senators made that point this evening.  It will be concerned about the theory of health care policy-making and management and the transfer of this theory into <Col N="155" /> effective practice.  This is something that we are very much concerned about &mdash; if we can get our direction right then how do we transfer that effectively into practice in our health services?  I know that some Senators here have a good knowledge of the practice of the health services so they understand the challenge which is involved.</P>
    <P>The Association is particularly concerned about research and information activities and it is intended to improve the education of health managers throughout Europe as a whole and to relate to those people working in the United States in particular.  They have done some interesting work already. They held a major conference recently on primary health care management education at which 52 participants from 13 countries participated, and they have also carried out a comparison of European and American approaches to health management education and management arrangements for multi-hospital systems.</P>
    <P>Senators see the kind of thing that they are dealing with, the multi-hospital systems where there are different kinds of hospitals and the inter-relationships between these kinds of hospitals.  This is something that is very relevant to us at present because of the way in which we are developing our services.  We have some hospitals which are less concerned now with acute hospital care and would be available for other kinds of care, and the question is should these relate back to the acute systems and to the community systems as Senator Bolger said.  The Association has also established a task force to investigate the process of reviewing the quality of educational programmes and health management among our Eastern members.  The task force is working currently.  They publish on a regular basis a newsletter covering details of development in health management in Europe and health management education among the members.  I might have words with the Director to ask him if there is any suitable literature which I might place in the Library here for the benefit of Members.  The newsletter comes to mind as a useful reference for <Col N="156" /> Members.  They propose to publish a directory on health management education in Europe which, among other things, will give details of research activities among the members.  That will be a directory of health management education in Europe which, in effect among other things will give details of the various activities undertaken by research members throughout Europe.  They will also publish occasional papers arising form the fellowships which they plan. Before the end of the year they plan to hold two further conferences.  One of these conferences is entitled &ldquo;More Value for Money in the Health Services&rdquo;. We all know what we are talking about here.  This will arise from some of the studies.  There has been a European collaborative hospital study in which the Regional Hospital in Limerick has participated. That has been supported by the European association, and obviously this will help to bring some of the latest thinking and research findings in new approaches to cost containment and cost effectiveness and value for money generally into the health services in Europe.</P>
    <P>The other conference which they are planning for later this year is entitled &ldquo;Future of the Welfare State&rdquo;.  Again that is a fairly readily understandable title and will lead in itself to another major publication which will be very interesting. This one is actually co-sponsored by the Nuffield Provincial Hospital Trust.</P>
    <P>I think Senators have got a very clear idea what this body can do for us.  We are very glad to have them based in Ireland. It has a lot of benefits.  We have proximity for communication and keeping in touch. I suppose it will be our own fault if we do not make the most of that.  We are very happy to welcome them here in Ireland. I am very thankful to Senators for the welcome they have given to them, because I know that will be noted and very sincerely appreciated.</P>

      <P>Before I start on the formal business may I congratulate you on your election as Leas-Chathaoirleach and wish you a fairly peaceful session without too much disorder?  May I also welcome the Minister for Justice and hope that we shall be seeing much of him in the Seanad as well?  The Seanad should also be operating in the important area in which he is operating, that is, the whole area of reform of legislation.  I hope this is but the first of many visits by the Minister to the Seanad.  I thank him for coming here this evening.  I also am grateful to the House for giving me the opportunity to move this motion on the adjournment, and also for allowing me a certain amount of flexibility as a neophyte.  Senator O'Rourke may have been in the last Seanad.  I am merely preparing myself in this session.</P>
      <P>However, I welcome the fact that I am allowed to address the House and the Minister on this very urgent issue.  The urgency of it will become clear as we discuss it further.  For many years now Members of the House and all of us have been aware of the pressure and the lobbying for a humane socially just law reform in all areas, and particularly in the area of family law cases, where some of the most vulnerable members of our society find themselves the victims and at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I talk not just of a minority but of a majority when I talk of women and children. It is sometimes forgotten that women and children collectively form a majority.  It is of the very essence of importance that we address ourselves to <Col N="158" /> family law reform and the whole institution of marriage.  We pay great lip service to the institution of marriage and the protection of women and children in the home within the Constitution, but lamentably we have failed miserably to live up to that by having any kind of law reform which would actually ensure that the very people whose rights are enshrined within the Constitution got a fair deal under the law.</P>
    <P>Many people have lobbied for such reforms; legal practitioners, voluntary organisations, and particularly women's organisations in the past ten years.  We never felt the answer was the situation in which we now find ourselves.  Under the Courts Act, 1981, which became law on May 12 last, important areas of family law were transferred from the High Court to the District and Circuit Courts, this despite requests to the Minister for Justice both inside and outside the Dáil that such action be deferred, and such Act be deferred for at least 12 months, in order to give everybody an opportunity &mdash; but particularly the courts and the facilities within the courts &mdash; to provide the resources and facilities needed for the extension to them of such a very serious area of law and a very complex one as well.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately it was not entertained in the Dáil, and I know that many anxieties and concerns were expressed publicly and also to the Minister at meetings.  For instance, the Council for the Status of Women which represents over 30 women's organisations had a meeting with the Minister on this very issue and stressed to him the concern they felt about it on behalf of their members.  We now find that the worst fears of people who spoke against it have been confirmed.</P>
    <P>There has been delay and confusion about drawing up rules and notifying them to the court personnel within the District and Circuit Courts.  No provision has been made, to my knowledge, for improving the already bad or non-existing facilities in a large number, lamentable too large a number, of our District and Circuit Courts.  I cannot over stress how serious this is.  It is serious for anybody <Col N="159" /> coming before the law.  This has been a cause of scandal throughout the State for many years with regard to civil cases.  When we think of sensitive, painful and complex cases involving human suffering and psychological and physical damage, then we begin to realise the extent of the lack of such facilities: consultation rooms, confidentiality, the personal and painful lives of people being tried in bad, small, cramped, open public courts.  It certainlty does not help or support people who find themselves at a very vulnerable time in very painful situations. In fact, it is totally unacceptable.  As well as that no special training has been prepared or given to court personnel in this sensitive and complex area.  My remarks regarding the facilities in the courts would refer as much if not more so to the personnel because here, not alone are we being unfair to the people who come before the courts, but we are also being totally unfair to the personnel who are expected to try to administer such legislation.</P>
    <P>We have reached the very dangerous and painful situation when chaos and industrial action which had been feared have now become a reality.  This has led to women being in the vulnerable situation of going down to the courts for barring and protection orders and being turned away.  This is particularly serious in the case of protection orders which are invoked only by persons in fear for their immediate physical safety.</P>
    <P>My remarks regarding the sacredness of the family and the vulnerable people in our society really take on a stark reality when we add in violence.  That is the situation in which women and children find themselves.  They are at risk from violence, physical, psychological and emotional.  It is a great pity that, when we eventually decided to transfer jurisdiction from costly over-crowded higher courts, a commitment to social justice could not have been made at the same time.  It is not that there were not people around to lobby, to suggest, and that we did not have experience in other countries of how courts dealing with family law cases should work.  We have models <Col N="160" /> in other countries.  We have just had a very supportive and developed debate here in this House on health and, of course, one of the areas of health stressed both by the Minister for Health and the Senators who contributed to it was the health and welfare of our people.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister for Justice that there is no point in our discussing the health of the nation and particularly its vulnerable members when the law as it now stands to protect them totally fails to do so.  Apart from being able to think about preventive medicine we cannot even think about preventive violence.</P>
    <P>There is much to be done, and I should like to ask the Minister what he proposes to do having regard to the urgency and seriousness of the situation in which we now find ourselves.  The District and Circuit Courts lack the additional personnel who should have been appointed before such changes took place.  Additional personnel and existing personnel should have been trained to meet the complexities and the needs and demands of this new area of legislation.  Facilities should have been extended to enable them to cope adequately and comprehensively with the areas of laws transferred to them.  Does the Minister feel the District Courts can deal on the pavement or in the toilets of certain courts with family and marital problems before their cases are tried?</P>
    <P>In the long term we have all been struggling for a social, just and equal society. Unfortunately I have to say &ldquo;in the long term&rdquo; because, as far as I know, nothing has been put forward by this Government towards the establishment of proper, humane and socially just family courts to deal comprehensively with family law cases coming before them, backed up by conciliation services, relieving over-crowded courts, and perhaps preventing those cases from coming to court if they get the right support in time.</P>
    <P>I have been informed, for instance, with regard to dealing comprehensively or non-comprehensively with such cases that, as the matter stands at the moment, part of a case involving family law can be tried in the higher court while the other part of it has to be tried in the lower <Col N="161" /> courts.  It does not even make good sense logically, much less humanly or personally, which hopefully we want this law to be all about, particularly in these very sensitive cases.</P>
    <P>While I should like clear, concise and hopefully very quick answers and solutions to the first part of my question, I should also like some commitment from this Government and from the Minister on the establishment of such family courts.  Without these family courts there is no way within the present structure or the present system in which marital breakdown and the consequent pain, loss, financial, emotional and otherwise, and the damage to children, can be dealt with in any kind of humane or comprehensive way.  We are not just talking about a certain elite or exclusive part of the establishment.  We are talking about a law, a structure, which has to deal with an increasing number of marital breakdowns and the consequent pain and harm that come from them.  The longer the Government fail to face up to the reality of such breakdowns, the longer the court cases will become, the more overcrowded will become the already under-staffed courts lacking in facilities.</P>
    <P>We must keep in mind that we are not just talking about this generation, about the difficulties, problems and damage to the couples involved, we are talking about the next generation as well.  We are talking about the children of marriages which have broken down, about our great heritage to which we all pay great lip service, and our children are our greatest heritage. Research in other countries has shown that the most human, the most caring and the most supportive way in which marriages and the marriage breakdowns can be helped is by having a comprehensive legal system accessible quickly and easily to everybody and not depending on how much money or influence one has.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind this House, because it shames me to do so, that women in family breakdown situations have had to have recourse to Europe and to the European Court, because this State and the law of the land in this State <Col N="162" /> totally failed them, excluded them and discriminated against them.  Are we to continue to live with this shame and this embarrassment?  Are we to allow not just this generation but the next one to suffer from the damage and consequences?  At this moment here today, women &mdash; and, of course, their children &mdash; are being denied barring orders, are being denied protection orders to protect themselves physically.  Can we as a civilised nation, in one of the Houses of what is considered to be a democratic Parliament, sit here and realise that there are women in houses tonight desperately hoping that they will not be damaged physically, mentally and emotionally by tomorrow morning?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister in the name of the law we all revere, the law that should exist in the terrible situation in which women and their children find themselves, to take immediate action and to inform this House what that immediate action will be, and also to give a long needed commitment to family courts to deal with the most important areas of life in this country.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, first let me congratulate you on your appointment and wish you well in your very onerous task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this motion I want to say that on many occasions while I was Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Senator Barnes came to that Department and discussed the legislation which is now the subject of some controversy. Indeed, on all occasions when she visited me, she stressed the urgency for the introduction of such legislation.  She was aware &mdash; and, indeed, I stated it at the time of the introduction of the legislation &mdash; that there would be a 12 month period before the legislation would become operable in some regards.  However, unfortunately for eight months of that 12 month period I and my party were not in Government.  I found that on some of the matters which could have been dealt with no sensible or responsible approach was taken by my predecessor during that period.  Neither was there any extraordinary cry during that period from <Col N="163" /> the people who are now making such loud noises about this very important and sensitive area.</P>
    <P>As regards the drawing up of rules for the District and Circuit Courts, on two occasions the Department of Justice urged that those rules should be sent forward for ministerial approval, and the most recent occasion was in April of this year.  Unfortunately I do not have any representative on the Rules Making Committee in either case, but I should like it to be known that some of the solicitors and barristers now talking do have representation on the Rules Making Committee.  It would have been in their interest, I am sure, to have urged their colleagues on the Rules Making Committee to bring forward the rules as a matter of urgency, rather than to attempt to cause what I can describe as nothing less than political embarrassment on the one hand or to frustrate very sensitive and delicate discussions now taking place.</P>
    <P>It is not correct for Senator Barnes to say no training was given to court staff. Justices have had the benefit of a special seminar arranged by the Chief Justice to give them the experience of High Court judges.  Court staff have also attended a course in the new jurisdiction.  I must make it perfectly clear that no chaotic situation has been caused by the coming into operation of the provisions of the Courts Act, 1981, which conferred jurisdiction in family law matters on the District Court and on the Circuit Court.  A problem has arisen in the District Court as a result of action being taken by the court clerks concerned who are not only refusing to deal with cases under the Courts Act but also under other recent legislation.</P>
    <P>I must also deprecate the continuous efforts made by vested interests both in the Houses of the Oireachtas and outside, to bring into disrepute the provisions in question.  The law represents the decision of the Oireachtas as to the jurisdiction in family matters, and gives effect to the recommendations of a most eminently qualified body, the Committee on Court Practices and Procedure, presided <Col N="164" /> over by Mr. Justice Walsh, and also including the Presidents of the Circuit and District Courts.  The changes involved were all changes deemed to be in the wider public interest.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that vested interests are concerned in efforts to prevent these changes, and I do not intend on this occasion to spell out in any greater detail what I mean by that.  I am sure it is clearly understood by many.  The vested interests I refer to appear to me to have a greater concern for their monetary aspirations than they have for giving cheaper and easier access to the court provisions in this Act.  I know Senator Barnes is seriously concerned about family law, and about the terrible difficulties now being posed, and posed in the past, for families where there is violence in the home.</P>
    <P>However, I will have no hesitation on some suitable occasion in the future in making more specific reference to the vested interests and what they are attempting to do.</P>

      <P>I mentioned the campaign on this occasion because it seems to me to have led to confusion about what is happening in relation to the present court problem.</P>
      <P>The action being taken by the court clerks is a different matter.  As workers, understandably enough they are concerned to get the best deal possible.  Similarly, the State has been conducting the necessary negotiations having regard to the public interest&mdash;&mdash; the very interest about which Senator Barnes is rightly concerned.  What is involved essentially is a grading claim.  It should hardly be necessary for me to acquaint Senators on the other side of the House with the importance of issues of this kind in relation to public sector pay.  I do not want to say anything here this evening which would tend to harden attitudes in the present dispute, but I am convinced that the demands being made on the taxpayer by the officers concerned are out of proportion to the realities of the situation. Nevertheless I am hopeful that with recourse to the normal procedures provided, we can settle this dispute at a very early date and ensure that the provisions in the Act which were intended to help people in greatest need can be brought into operation fully if there is reason and understanding on all sides.</P>
