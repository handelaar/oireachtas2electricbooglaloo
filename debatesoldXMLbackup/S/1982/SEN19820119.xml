    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the statutory limit on the amount of capital available to Fóir Teoranta from £35 million to £70 million. Fóir was established under the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972, as a State rescue <Col N="3" /> agency for potentially viable industrial concerns which are unable to raise capital from normal commercial sources.  The provision of financial assistance is subject to certain general criteria.  For example, a company seeking aid must be engaged in industrial activity or an ancillary activity. Employment and capital employed must be significant either locally or nationally.  The promoters' capital contribution must be reasonable.  More important is the stipulation that Fóir must satisfy themselves that a firm has good prospects of future profitability.</P>
      <P>I think it is important to examine closely the environment in which Fóir are operating in order to arrive at a full appreciation of the rôle they play as an essential part of our overall industrial strategy.  As stated by the Minister for Finance recently, one of the major problems facing the country today is unemployment arising partly from the growth in the labour force and more seriously in my opinion from redundancy, the displacement of those already at work.  This is the prime area of Fóir's concern&mdash;the protection of existing jobs where this can be economically justified.  Indeed Fóir are not alone in this regard, as the IDA, who concern themselves in the first instance with the creation of new jobs, also have a rescue unit who help those firms which are experiencing trading difficulties and try to find new projects to replace firms which have closed.</P>
      <P>The severity of the recession forced many existing companies during 1981 to concentrate on staying in business rather than on expansion.  For many firms the pressure of increasing competition for shrinking markets, the difficulty of introducing new products and rising input costs proved too much.  The statistics on redundancy are important in quantifying the size of the problem confronting State agencies such as Fóir and the IDA rescue unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Job loss, as measured by the level of notified redundancies, deteriorated considerably in 1980 as compared with the previous year, while a further disimprovement is again evident from the figures for 1981 which are available so far. <Col N="4" /> In 1980 the total number of notified redundancies was 14,664 or 94 per cent higher than in 1979.  Of these, some 56 per cent were in the manufacturing sector even though only about 20 per cent of the total at work are engaged in this sector. In terms of numbers involved, the worst affected industries were food, textiles, metals and engineering and clothing.</P>
    <P>While figures are available only in respect of the first three-quarters of 1981 it is already clear that the numbers of notified redundancies, both in manufacturing industry and in total, will significantly exceed the 1980 returns.  In the first nine months of last year, total notified redundancies numbered 13,024, of which some 8,114 or 62 per cent related to the manufacturing sector.  Metals and engineering, food, fertilisers, chemicals and clothing were the worst affected sectors during this period.  The indications are that the outturn for the full year will show that 1981 was by far the worst year for notified redundancies since the peak figures recorded in 1975.</P>
    <P>Disturbing though these figures are, they do not, unfortunately, reveal the true incidence of job loss occurring in the economy.  While no official statistics are available on total job loss, it is estimated that notified redundancy figures, which refer only to notifications for possible statutory entitlements under redundancy payments legislation, may understate the true extent of overall job loss by a factor of between two and three.  Taking manufacturing industry as an example, the IDA estimate that gross job loss in the sector amounted to 27,000 during 1980 whereas the number of notified manufacturing redundancies recorded was 8,279. Not unexpectedly in the face of the disappearance of jobs on this scale, the numbers engaged in manufacturing are estimated to have fallen by over 9,000 during the year.  During 1981 it is tentatively estimated that, despite some fall-off in the rate of job loss being experienced, it will not be sufficient to prevent a further decline in the level of manufacturing employment.</P>
    <P>In the light of job losses of such proportions it is imperative that we as a community do not jeopardise the efforts <Col N="5" /> being made by the IDA, Fóir Teoranta and other agencies to protect and create employment.  In addition to a very serious and growing unemployment problem the economy is also experiencing grave difficulties in the areas of inflation, the balance of payments and the public finances. Unless all sectors in our society co-operate fully in overcoming these difficulties, the actions of Government and other State agencies in this regard will be seriously undermined.</P>
    <P>In addition to the problems which I have just mentioned we face the challenge of an increasing number of young people coming on to the labour market. The task of providing jobs for those people, together with that of reducing the current level of unemployment, require that we increase our efforts to maximise our productivity and output and also to attract the highest possible level of both domestic and foreign investment. In order to succeed in doing so, it is vital that all concerned, both unions and employers, adopt a sensible approach to income developments and to industrial relations.  Over the past three years our competitive position has deteriorated as compared with our other trading partners in the narrow-band of the EMS.  This situation has contributed to the growing number of redundancies experienced over the past two years and has to some extent diminished the attractiveness of the economy as a base for new investment.</P>
    <P>While the effects of income increases out of line with those of our competitors are obvious, the way in which a poor industrial relations climate can have an equally damaging impact on economic recovery may be less clearcut.  Less obvious or not, the expansion of investment and output and the safeguarding of jobs are equally dependent on our industrial relations behaviour.  Industrial strife not only disrupts existing production and services but also seriously damages our prospects of attracting new industry from abroad, thus reducing our potential for future employment creation.  Its effects are always damaging and particularly in a time of international recession, when there is intense international competition <Col N="6" /> for orders and for mobile investment. The prospects for the international economy in 1982 are for some recovery. However, this will not automatically mean that our recovery is also assured. Unless we adapt to the harsh realities of the international environment and work in a spirit of industrial peace we cannot hope to take advantage of the expected improvement in world markets.</P>
    <P>Securing industrial peace requires committed efforts by both workers and management.  In the interest of the entire community, every attempt must be made to avoid industrial action and to make full use of the normal procedures available to both sides of industry in doing so. Moreover, there must be greater appreciation on all sides of opposing points of view on the issues underlying disputes and to resolve them as quickly as possible. This applies both to the public and the private sectors.  In the public sector, where disputes gain greater prominence, disruptions to essential services can have a very damaging effect on production and employment in the economy generally. In the private sector, we cannot afford the loss through industrial unrest of output and employment in any enterprise or concern, no matter how small, in the current economic climate.  The success of our efforts to resolve the economic crisis requires the fullest possible co-operation. Therefore one must view with great concern the prospect of any escalation of the current dispute between certain craft unions and the FUE more particularly when a quite adequate structure is available to process wage increases in this sector.</P>
    <P>I would like now to quantify the efforts being made by both the IDA and Fóir to ensure employment in the years ahead for our work force.  Despite adverse circumstances and an uncertain economic environment during 1981, the Industrial Development Authority achieved a record level of commitments to industrial projects in the year: 2,500 new projects involving an investment of well over £900 million were approved by the Authority for grant assistance amounting to more than £300 million.  The companies concerned expect these projects to provide <Col N="7" /> employment for 36,500 persons when full production is reached.  These figures indicate the confidence of industrialists both Irish and overseas, in the longer term prospects of Ireland as a suitable base for manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>In recessionary times the competition from other countries seeking overseas investment will present formidable obstacles to the successful negotiation of new overseas projects in Ireland.  The IDA, therefore, will be striving to obtain an increased share of declining world investment.</P>
    <P>During 1982, the IDA will continue to seek new opportunities in sectors with good growth prospects.  These will include areas like precision engineered components for the automotive, aerospace and robotics industry, electronics products, international services such as computer software, R &amp; D international financial services etc., natural resources, beef and dairy products, forestry, all of which could form the basis for considerable development.</P>
    <P>On the job retention front 44 rescue or refinancing packages were completed by the IDA during 1981 involving the maintenance of more than 7,400 jobs and the creation of 200 new ones.  In addition, the IDA successfully assisted in 33 takeovers, when rescue packages proved impossible.  More than 700 jobs were saved in these takeovers which have a potential to create an additional 1,770 jobs.</P>
    <P>Also in 1981 Fóir Teoranta approved loan assistance totalling about £5.5 million to 39 firms employing some 5,400 workers.  Since their establishment in 1972 Fóir have approved funds in excess of £52 million in respect of about 470 concerns with an employment content of over 60,000 which represents a very considerable total.  By the very nature of their operations a certain proportion of firms assisted will not survive. Experience has shown that of all firms assisted about one-third are trading profitably, one-third are marginal cases, and the remainder have closed down.  However, this does not mean that these jobs are totally lost.  Many firms re-open under <Col N="8" /> new ownership with new equity injections</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Seanad's attention to the detailed investigation of the company's operations and performance undertaken in 1980 by the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, which has had many distinguished Members from Seanad Éireann, including the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Eoin Ryan, who made a tremendous contribution to the work of this committee as chairman.  The committee's detailed examination of Fóir activities covered the restriction of Fóir's responsibility to manufacturing and mining, the basis on which they become involved with firms in difficulty, and their relationship with other State agencies.  In their conclusion they saw no need to alter existing practices in this regard.  On examination of the cost per job saved, the committee were of the opinion that the effective cost of Fóir's activities had not been unreasonable. They found that the cost per job saved is significantly lower than the cost of a new job created by the IDA in larger firms but closely related to the cost of a new job in smaller firms which are representative of the majority of Fóir clients.  The committee felt that Fóir had made &ldquo;a reasonable impact in stemming the level of factory closures&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Finally, the committee looked at Fóir's relationship with the commercial banks. They felt that as most Fóir clients would also be clients of the banks, the provision of finance by the banks on foot of guarantees from Fóir should be investigated. The present position is, of course, that, in many rescue cases, Fóir Teoranta act in conjunction with the private banking sector and in many cases Fóir will negotiate arrangements whereby existing bank loans are continued or extended as part of the rescue operations.  Responsibility for rescue is thus a joint one and I think the present system works reasonably well and, while the committee's recommendation in this regard is being discussed with Fóir Teoranta, I do not envisage any real departure from it.</P>
    <P>I think that it is highly significant that the joint committee's principal conclusion was that Fóir were fulfilling a useful <Col N="9" /> role and that there was a continuing need for a lender of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo;.  They also agreed with the assessment of the Department of Finance that &ldquo;Fóir performs a most valuable function on the basis of rational criteria by helping industrial firms in temporary difficulties to survive and recover profitability.  Its services are of particular value in times of exceptional economic difficulties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta are reaching the limit of their borrowing power which was fixed at £35 million by the amending Act of 1976. Amending legislation to increase their resources is therefore necessary to enable the company to continue their work.  Section 2 of the Bill before the Seanad today proposes that the new limit on borrowing by Fóir Teoranta be fixed at £70 million which is an increase of £35 million on the present limit.  On the basis of disbursements since the last Act, the extension proposed should suffice for another four or five years depending on demands for reconstruction finance.  The company have been almost entirely financed by borrowing from the Exchequer, as the returns on the company's share and loan investment have been comparatively small so far.  The company's income from their investments and the repayment of loans is growing but they will continue to be short of the amount which they are likely to have to advance in respect of new applications for assistance.  It is proposed, therefore, in section 3 of the Bill, to raise from £35 million to £70 million the limit on the power of the Minister for Finance to provide loan capital to the company.</P>
    <P>When the original Act was introduced the Seanad was informed that an administrative limit would be introduced on Fóir Teoranta's discretion to advance funds.  This was fixed at the time at £250,000 and it is now intended to raise it to £1 million.  Any advances in excess of this will be subject to the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Energy.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta, are, of course, but one link in the chain of the State's efforts to give assistance to industry.  Most of this effort is, through the IDA, principally <Col N="10" /> geared to encourage industries to establish and expand in Ireland.  CTT, our export board, provide valuable assistance to firms who want to expand into new markets.  The present tax system for manufacturing industry is extremely generous by any standards and provides every possible incentive for expansion.  However, we will always have problems with our existing industrial base due to changed market conditions, costs and so on.  So, while we would ideally like to see Fóir used as little as possible as that would mean a healthy industrial base, there will unfortunately always be a need for reconstruction finance in certain cases.  Fóir Teoranta provide an orderly and efficient procedure for dealing with these firms.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the Seanad as it will enable this vital State agency to continue their important work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my support to this Bill.  I regard it as a very important Bill which should be welcomed by all.  As the Minister said, the purpose of the Bill is to extend the statutory limit on the amount of capital available to Fóir Teoranta from £35 million to £70 million. Before Christmas Members of both Houses discussed the Youth Employment Agency Bill and many Senators and TDs expressed an element of objection to it because they said there was not sufficient mention of job creation.  Nowadays job creation is very important.  Last week the number of people unemployed reached 140,000 and the Tánaiste recently said that that figure would probably rise.  Therefore job creation, and in this case job preservation, are obviously very important matters.  For this year and the years ahead the exercise of job preservation will and can be vital.  Fóir Teoranta, the body given responsibility for coming to the assistance of ailing industry, are obviously the people to do this, and they have been doing it successfully down the years.  The Minister said the company seeking aid must be engaged in industrial activity or an ancillary activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we are asking for the limit to be increased from £35 million to £70 <Col N="11" /> million seems to indicate that this is an opportune time to refer to the activities of Fóir Teoranta and to extend their operations to embrace many other activities, including agriculture and a whole series of industries right across the board. I am aware that the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies discussed this matter and were not in agreement.  There must be an onus on us to extend it in the knowledge that we are in a very serious recessionary and difficult period.  The number of applications received by Fóir Teoranta for 1980 showed an increase of 50 per cent and that is clearly a reflection of the serious international economic recession which has forced many companies out of business.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees that this trend will continue and that large and small industries will go to the wall this year and in the years ahead.  I cannot help thinking that perhaps a greater involvement by Fóir Teoranta in smaller industries would be a help.  I know the difficulties which face a small company, for example a company employing 25 to 30 people, and for obvious reasons they do not receive the same headline as an international company or any large firm.  For example, the Clondalkin Paper Mills got quite a lot of publicity, and I hope that that business will be saved, but the smaller companies have not got the clout which the bigger companies have.</P>
    <P>People in the rural areas do not know enough about Fóir Teoranta and are not aware of the existence of this body until it is too late.  A firm employing 25 to 30 people touches on the lives of maybe 200 or 300 people.  If that firm gets into difficulties or closes, it can have a very wide-ranging effect on that rural area.  I would like to think Fóir Teoranta would move in, if possible, more swiftly, to save the day.  If this happens there would be a greater amount of success.</P>
    <P>The IDA are doing extremely well in the area of job creation.  It is basic economics to say that savings can be made through a job preservation situation.  For example, a person with a job is contributing to the pay-as-you-earn scheme and to PRSI.  If he has a car he is buying <Col N="12" /> petrol.  He also buys food.  This means that a great deal of his salary is going back to the State through taxes.  On the other hand, the unfortunate who loses his job goes on social welfare, or gets his redundancy payment.  This means he is getting from the State all the time.  Every effort to preserve or rescue jobs, as Fóir Teoranta are doing, is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister said Fóir Teoranta approved funds in excess of £52 million in respect of 470 concerns with an employment content of 60,000, which represented a very considerable total. That is extremely good work but the years ahead are going to be more difficult and therefore more finance will be necessary.</P>
    <P>I was a little surprised at what the Minister had to say about saving jobs.  He said the committee were of the opinion that the effective cost of Fóir's activities had not been unreasonable.  They found that the cost per job saved was significantly lower than the cost of a new job created by the IDA in larger firms but closely related to the cost of a new job in smaller firms which are representative of the majority of Fóir's clients.  That surprised me, I thought the opposite would have been the case.  However, I accept what has been said.  Generally I would be failing in my duty if I did not support it. The Minister rightly said that Fóir Teoranta must be satisfied that the firm to be saved has good prospects of future profitability.  We should not be propping up lame ducks.  State funds should not go to failures.  I welcome the Bill and hope that the Minister can do something to extend the scope of the activities of Fóir Teoranta.  I wish success to Fóir Teoranta and continuation of their important role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. S. O'Leary Mr. S. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and express my support for the measures proposed therein to raise the borrowing power of the company from £35 million to £70 million and to amend the 1972 and 1976 Acts accordingly.  It was my unfortunate duty, not only as a public representative and a citizen but as a former practising accountant, to go with a number of my clients to discuss with the executives <Col N="13" /> of Fóir Teoranta the possibility of saving whatever particular industry was under consideration at that time.  It would be remiss of me if I did not place on record that the management of Fóir Teoranta, in so far as they deal with the business of carrying out the duties imposed on them by the various Acts passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, give an excellent service to industry. They are to be commended in that regard.</P>
      <P>The general welcome on all sides of the House for this Bill is important because it emphasises the all-party approach towards improving our industrial base. This unanimous approach is something which should be built upon and emphasised because in requesting industrial firms to come here it is important they realise that all the political parties likely to achieve power in the foreseeable future have as a common objective rational industrialisation to give an improved standard of living and to give employment to our growing population. We should not underestimate the importance of the unanimous and general approval that measures of this sort get in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is easy to discuss the Fóir Teoranta Bill because it is not the brainchild of any one political party but has unanimous support.  There are various provisions, which I hope will be included in future Bills, to enable the scope of the activities of Fóir Teoranta to be widened considerably to take into account the changing circumstances.  This means that the aid we give to our industries will be changed to meet the challenges of the 1980s and of our growing population.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in introducing the Bill, referred to the Seventeenth Report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies on Fóir Teoranta which was under the chairmanship of the distinguished Leader of the Opposition in this House. The report is a model of investigation of the activities of this non-controversial organisation and lays before the Oireachtas information which is invaluable in considering the appropriateness or otherwise of the amendment of previous Fóir Teoranta Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> The criteria within which Fóir Teoranta work are laid out in paragraph 6 of The Seventeenth Report.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The primary objective of Fóir is to provide, or enable the provision of, finance for industrial firms in financial distress.  Financial support can be made available through investment in the ailing firm by way of share capital, debentures, secured or unsecured loans, bill finance or guarantees in respect of borrowings by such firms.  To obtain financial support, distressed firms have to be, in the opinion of the Company, &ldquo;eligible concerns&rdquo; under the criteria laid down by the Fóir Teoranta Act.</P>
    <P>These are worth repeating.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A concern shall be an eligible concern...if in the opinion of the Company</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(i) it is engaged in an industrial activity (including any activity ancillary to industry)</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon has already referred to the limiting restrictive nature of that criterion and in the expansion of our concept of what is industry and what role service industries can play, some reconsideration of this criterion would be worthwhile and possible.</P>
    <P>(ii)  the employment involved and total capital employed are significant either nationally or locally,</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;locally&rdquo; should be stressed. What appears not to be important nationally could be very important locally.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The proportion of its owners' contribution to the total capital is reasonable,</P>
    <P>Obviously, if the owner has not been in a position in the past to make a contribution, it is unreasonable to expect that public money would be used in that situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> (iv)  it has reasonable prospects of profitability on a permanent basis, whether as for the time being constituted or after adaptation,</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to expect profitability, not for the sake of the future wellbeing of the owners of the company, but recognising that in profitability rests the best chance of success and the continued operation of the firm.</P>
    <P>(v)  its continuance is in doubt because of inability to obtain its financial requirements from commercial sources,</P>
    <P>The banks should examine the matter first to ensure that Fóir Teoranta is used only as a lender of last resort</P>
    <P>and (vi)  its failure to receive financial assistance would have serious repercussions either nationally or locally.</P>
    <P>No rational person could disagree with the criteria which are set down but one should examine whether they are the only criteria that should be applied.  I propose to deal with that point some time later.</P>
    <P>What is important with regard to the criteria is not their existence as such but how they are interpreted by the executives of the organisation.  There is no doubt that the executives of the organisation, while not being interfered with by the Minister in any individual application, will interpret them in a manner which is consistent with the philosophical approach of the Minister for Finance or of successive Ministers for Finance.  If successive Ministers for Finance have a particular approach towards the granting of aid, that will in time work its way down through the criteria and will be applied by the executives.  Successive Ministers for Finance have indicated, and indeed the joint committee have indicated also, that the interpretation of these criteria has been too narrow and has had the serious consequences of a declining manufacturing base referred to by the Minister in his introductory remarks.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the scale <Col N="16" /> of the problems which exist in the manufacturing area and the scale of the redundancies which face the country.  We should not misinterpret the importance or we should not lay down the importance of the manufacturing area in the general wealth and wellbeing, not only of that portion of the economy which is directly dependent on manufacturing but in the general health of the economy, in the number of services we can provide and the way in which the Government can generate money to ensure that the services provided to the community are suitable for the twentieth century State.  The scale of redundancies which the Minister referred to is, under any criterion, frightening.  This situation has existed during the tenure of successive Governments and the whole question of the competitiveness of our industry is obviously a very significant reason for the failure of a number of these concerns and also for the excessive cost of money in these inflationary times.  While it might be cheap in the long term it will not have the backing one would have if investing in land or in an office block, which would inflate at a price which would be greater than the cost of the interest.  If one is investing in something like a manufacturing concern where a substantial portion of the investment is in plant which will depreciate rather than appreciate from the date on which it is required, the high inflation and high rates of interest are a considerable drawback and disincentive to the proper organisation of a manufacturing industry and its retention.</P>
    <P>Redundancies in the first nine months of 1981 totalled 13,024 and the 1980 figure was higher.  The scale of redundancies is obviously going to be of the order of 16,000 or 17,000 for 1981.  The significant fact is that 62 per cent of them are in the manufacturing sector.  The manufacturing sector with which Fóir Teoranta deal only affects 20 per cent of those at work. Yet they deal with a highly significant portion of those who are being made redundant in the manufacturing sector. Therein lies both the problem for the manufacturing sector and the problem for our economy because no economy can continue without a healthy manufacturing <Col N="17" /> base.  In our case we are talking about mining and agriculture-based industries.  Therefore, the importance of the manufacturing sector is rightly stressed.</P>
    <P>There appears not to have been either on the part of the Joint Committee or of anyone else sufficient analysis as to the reason for these 13,024 redundancies. We all have an idea of the importance of inflation and of the international decline and recession but no attempt is being made to quantify them.  It is very difficult to see to what extent Fóir Teoranta who, given a free hand, have changed that situation.  This is really where our problem lies.</P>
    <P>It is well that the House should know what happens when a firm approach Fóir Teoranta.  The way in which the money we are authorising by way of this Bill will be used will be that a firm who find themselves in distress will approach Fóir Teoranta who will lend money at a high rate of interest.  All that interest might not be collected because the firm might fail in the long run.  I am not in the slightest concerned with the small number of millions of pounds which have been lost by Fóir Teoranta by reason of failure.  Given the service which they have provided for the industrial base of the country the small amount lost&mdash;about £11 million in a period of nearly ten years&mdash;is a very small price to pay for the excellent work they have done.  It indeed shows a very conservative approach to their work because they are in the high-risk business. These loans are given at a high rate of interest and very often what happens is that all you are doing is postponing the inevitable and with interest rates as high as they are you are not really solving the problem of the company to lend it more money because a company in financial difficulty very often has not the capacity to repay substantial loans.  What they need is not an interest-bearing loan but a non-interest bearing loan by way of equity.  It is within the capacity of Fóir Teoranta to make investments in a company by way of equity.  The way in which they have been doing that is that 10 per cent of the advances they have been making have been by way of share capital, <Col N="18" /> and 90 per cent by way of loans.  The balance between interest-bearing loans and equity investment has gone much too far in favour of a preservation of the security of the money which Fóir Teoranta are investing and not gone far enough towards the very important factor of giving non-interest bearing money by way of equitable investment in the equity of the company.</P>
    <P>It appears that very often what has happened is that where a company has got an investment from Fóir Teoranta it has survived for a period of time and has then succumbed.  It is not the fact that it has eventually succumbed that worries me but the fact that Fóir Teoranta, by going in and taking some of the security which was available after the bank is given the original security, has given preference to itself and reduced the rights of the unsecured creditors of that company still further.  In fact, the company have speculated not with the taxpayers' money, not with Fóir Teoranta's money as voted by the Dáil and approved by this Act but with the money of the unsecured creditors.  The people who eventually pick up the tab are the unsecured creditors who get a lesser percentage in the £ than they would have got if the company had gone out of existence in the first place.  As a result and because of that, it is necessary that Fóir Teoranta's mind should be directed very forcibly&mdash;this was referred to in the examination of the executives by Deputy Liam Lawlor&mdash; towards the advisability of investing in equity in the company, because very often a company could be viable if it had a non-interest bearing loan but would not be viable if the money which it received was interest-bearing, particularly in a situation where the interest is likely to be of the order of 20 to 21 per cent.</P>
    <P>What is required with the £35 million which this Bill proposes to make available to Fóir Teoranta is a change of emphasis towards the giving of shares in equity in suitable firms&mdash;I am not saying in every firm.  Obviously, there is a problem, as pointed out by the executives of Fóir Teoranta, in that some of the companies are so small and the ownership of the company is so tightly held that the <Col N="19" /> investment of equity there would leave Fóir Teoranta in a very difficult situation. That can be overcome by the creation of a special class of equity, by giving instead of ordinary shares what one might call A ordinary shares and special rights which will guarantee the security of their money over and above the existing types of equity.  Those who originally invested would still be given the prospect of a reasonable return for their money.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta has to develop very much away from the idea of being just a banker and a lender of last resort to being both a lender of last resort and an industrial holding company, as it is authorised by the way in which it was established, with a substantial portfolio of investments. Some of those would be successful and some would not be.  In a situation like that there is risk and that risk must be recognised.</P>
    <P>What I propose is not extraordinary or in conflict with the Government's published programme which includes a national development corporation which I would see very much in the rôle of doing the same thing for new ideas and new ventures.  With regard to the existing manufacturing scene, Fóir Teoranta could become very much more an industrial holding company, holding, in some cases, the majority of the equity of the company and, in other cases, the minority. Its existing portfolio should be reexamined to see whether in the case of some of the third of the companies which at present it has on its books, and which it considers to be marginal, the conversion of the loans to equity would improve the chances of the survival of that company and, by doing that, improve the stability of the manufacturing employment which is given, thereby improving the general economic climate here.  That should be undertaken as a matter of extreme urgency.  I do not think that in doing so we would be out of line with any of the countries which do not pride themselves on their left wing leanings; even the most right wing, or the most conservative of countries like the United States of America, use Government funds to support manufacturing industries as <Col N="20" /> these form the basis of their service sector. They use public funds for this purpose. They do it in sophisticated ways like awarding defence contracts to companies and by doing that they enable that company to exist in a hostile climate.  In France and Italy there are State conglomerates in existence partly as bankers and partly as industrial holding companies and they recognise, as we must, that a country cannot exist without a strong industrial base, that the rest of the employment which we create depends on the strength or otherwise of our industrial base.</P>
    <P>We should fight tooth and nail to make sure that we do not lose any industrial jobs except where that is inevitable and where there is such a fundamental change in the pattern of trade as to make that inevitable.  No single manufacturing job should be lost here because of the lack of imagination of the Government or because of the lack of a proper instruction to Fóir Teoranta as to the method in which they interpret the criteria laid down for them in the Acts dealing with Fóir Teoranta.  We need a new approach, something which is not included in this Bill.  However, I hope it will be considered as a result of this debate and as a result of other stirrings that are taking place throughout the economy.  I hope that new approach will be considered by the Government, and the Opposition, so that it will become our common objective. I can give the House an example of a range of companies which were dealt with quite expeditiously and judiciously by Fóir Teoranta but which together make a pretty dismal tale.  The whole timber processing industry here has virtually collapsed.  Each individual company was examined and the criteria set out were applied to them with the result that in some cases a decision was arrived at that the company should close or that further help would not be given although it would have been to the overall benefit of the company if the Fóir Teoranta board had been in a position to take an over-view of the whole position with regard to that timber industry.</P>
    <P>In the recent past four companies were in existence&mdash;some are still in existence <Col N="21" />&mdash; involved in the processing of native timber.  The processing of this native timber was profitable for the Department concerned and also of advantage to the Department in that the thinnings in the forests were being used in constructive fashion and our forests were being improved by the extraction of the timber. The companies I am referring to are Munster Chipboard in Waterford, the Scariff company, Irish Board Mills in Athy and Clondalkin.  To a greater or lesser extent they all used the thinnings from the forests or various items of native timber.  Those four companies have been or are still the subject of help by Fóir Teoranta.  In the consideration of each of these, Fóir Teoranta no doubt made the correct decision but nobody ever thought what would be the position of the Irish forests if each of those firms went out of business.</P>
    <P>The economic option in the case of each of those companies was followed but the overall problem was that it was unreasonable to expect manufacturers to prosper when they did not have control of the native timber.  As the manufacturers did not have control of the native timber they did not prosper and as a result each of them got into difficulties to a greater or lesser extent.  Sweden would be a very beneficial example in that regard in that the Swedish economy is very much owned and controlled by the State.  Yet in that country the timber resources are predominantly in private hands, not in State hands.  It is recognised that the manufacturing end can prosper only under the benign control of the State.  Here the native timber industry has fallen almost exclusively under the control of the State and the manufacturing concerns were in the hands of private individuals.  When the pressure came on, the private individuals were not able to sustain the vast investments which were required and, as a result, each of the four companies I have mentioned, and the industry in general got into difficulties.</P>
    <P>If the Government wish to retain their exclusive or predominant position in the growing of native timber they must move into the area of controlling and operating manufacturing companies which use this <Col N="22" /> native timber.  If they do not, private companies who do not have this resource available to them will not move in without owning the raw materials or at least having some share in the equity of those raw materials.  The consideration of that by Fóir Teoranta was in a very isolated way: whether the mill in Athy was worthwhile, or whether it could survive. They did not have it in their brief to tell the Forestry Division that a real problem existed, that the Forestry Division had the potential to make a profit, and that profit should have been used to maintain the manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>A very much larger and broader approach to the problems of industrial development is needed from Fóir Teoranta before we achieve the kind of objective we all desire to achieve, that is, to have the manufacturing industry placed on a firm and sound basis.  We all recognise that no manufacturing industry here can be on a firm basis until such time as the underlying malaise of the economy is tackled and anything I say has to be read in that context.</P>
    <P>The kind of matter which I should like to have included in the Fóir Teoranta (Amendment) Bill does not conflict with &mdash; in fact, it supports and goes hand in hand with &mdash; the concept of a national development corporation which I would see as taking the new industries and developing them for the benefit of the country.  Fóir Teoranta should be developed in a very constructive way to be very much more the dynamo of the Irish economy, to create and make the pace in the economy rather than just reacting to the bad news as it arises.  Their development area and industrial conglomerate area should be put to one side, or should be the responsibility of half their management, and their rescue area should be the responsibility of the other portion of their management.  By bringing the two of them together on occasion we should get a situation in which a company which goes to Fóir Teoranta would have a prospect of getting loans at market rates of interest and also a prospect of getting substantial investment by way of equity which would not be interest bearing.</P>
    <P>The major problem which faces us with <Col N="23" /> regard to Fóir Teoranta is the direction in which they should go.  The matter was considered by the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  Mr. McGuinness, chief executive and manager of Fóir Teoranta dealt with this matter.  I quote from page 4 of the report of the minutes of evidence taken before the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  In response to a question from Deputy Liam Lawlor he said:</P>
    <P>On the question of share capital, it is true that most of our assistance takes the form of secured loans.  There are a couple of reasons why we are not too keen to become involved in an equity situation.  Most of the companies Fóir Teoranta helps are small to medium sized and generally tend to be owner-controlled and owner-managed.  If we were to take equity for any significant part of our assistance, we would probably swamp the existing equity and become virtual owners of the company. As a matter of policy this is not a situation in which the Board would wish to find themselves.  They do not wish to control, or even negatively control, a company which is in competition in the private sector.  There is the negative side of it too.  If, having got involved in an equity situation, we find that a mistake was made in giving help in the first instance, and that probably the right thing to do was to wind up the company, it could become very difficult to do so if the State, through a State organisation, had an equity interest in it.  It could become very difficult to close down a company even if it is patently clear that that is the right course of action to take.  Further, providing money by way of secured loan in many instances affords a measure of protection for the State's money because, if, unfortunately, things do go wrong, there is a prospect of recovering some of that money.</P>
    <P>That reply, which is consistent with the policy followed by Fóir Teoranta, and which obviously is followed on the advice of and with the support of successive Minister for Finance, encapsulates the <Col N="24" /> whole problem of Fóir Teoranta.  They are very much involved in making sure in so far as it is humanly possible, that the money they lend is secured and less involved in the question of whether or not the interest on the money they advance is a burden on the company in question.</P>
    <P>Many of our industrial concerns, particularly our smaller and medium-sized industrial concerns, were started off by people with a very small share capital. They put very little money into them. They put years of work into them.  This is of immense value.  It is not shown by way of share capital in the profit and loss account, but it is of immense value.  Many companies are under-capitalised.  I am not talking about companies affected by the recession, but ones which are structurally defective and cannot overcome the recession because they have not got the resources to fall back on, which is another way of saying they are under-capitalised. The man who started them is not in a position to put in sufficient funds to enable them to cope with the bad times.  Where they are under-capitalised, lending them money is no solution to the problem because lending them money only adds to the burden of the interest repayments they have to make.</P>
    <P>There are many companies &mdash; of course this does not apply to every company &mdash; whose only prospect of survival is to get money without having to pay interest on it.  That can be done only if part of the equity or ownership of the company is transferred to the group or individuals who supply that money.  Fóir Teoranta have a substantial rôle to play in that regard.  If it is necessary to introduce legislation to insulate them further from the kind of pressure which Mr. McGuinness seems to think they may be subject to &mdash; and I am sure he is right &mdash; that should be done.  It is most important that we should support and preserve companies who need money, who cannot borrow it from the banks, but who have the capacity to repay interest should they get money from Fóir Teoranta.  We should also support companies who have not got the capacity to repay interest, who have no realistic prospect of repaying <Col N="25" /> the money but who, if they got the money in the first place would be a viable proposition on their new equity basis, on their new improved and expanded equity.  It is our responsibility to ensure that they get State participation, and that we face up to the many problems created by the State having an indirect share-holding in many of these manufacturing companies.</P>
    <P>Throughout the twenties and thirties successive progressive Governments were not afraid to invest in industrial projects which have borne fruit.  Some might be bearing less fruit now 50 years later, but we have had 50 years of good results from them.  We should again take our courage in both hands and not be inhibited by any Department of Labour or other ideological hang-ups.  If it is necessary for the Government indirectly to invest in these manufacturing companies for the good of our community, then they should do that.  They should do it in the way appropriate to our country, in precisely the same way as the Government of the United States of America do what is appropriate to their country and as do the remaining members of the European Economic Community, countries considerably more advanced than ourselves. We might well emulate the way they have done it in the past for the benefit of their industries.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill.  I welcome the increase from £35 million to £70 million, given the prospect of this new approach. I am anxious also that the requisite legislation to establish the National Development Corporation be forthcoming. That should include an expanded rôle for Fóir Teoranta in respect of our existing companies, because no manufacturing industry here should be lost unless preservation is totally uneconomic.  If it is, then we must face the inevitable.  When this Bill is passed I hope the Government will consider further the representations I have made and those of others, including Deputy Lawlor to whom I would like to pay tribute on his excellent probing of this matter before the Joint Committee. I hope the Government will consider these points and ascertain whether a further <Col N="26" /> change of policy would be in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming this Bill.  It is not often, either in the House or outside, that we can confidently commend the work of a State agency. Therefore I am happy to congratulate Fóir Teoranta on their excellent work to date and wish them well in the future.  As a body they are of course primarily concerned with the preservation of jobs.  We all agree that jobs and their creation now present the primary economic and social objective of our time.  An increase in the capital available to Fóir was under consideration by the Department of Finance at the time the hearings took place with the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  This has now come to fruition in the form of an increase in the capital available from £35 million to £70 million. This is a welcome step.  Unhappily it is a matter for regret that, in the light of our present unemployment levels, this money will be needed as never before.</P>
      <P>I wish to touch on a few points only, the first or which is the early warning system referred to in the Joint Committee Report.  Discussing the problem of the early warning system and the reason for it, Fóir stated and I quote:</P>
      <P>...the fact is that we continue to receive requests for assistance at very short notice.  The reason for this would seem to be psychological; many businesses experiencing financial difficulty will go to endless trouble to conceal their plight from creditors, bankers and financial advisers in the expectation that things will come right.  The result very often is that irreparable damage has taken place before we become aware of the company's problems.</P>
      <P>I would urge Fóir Teoranta to continue their efforts to improve the early warning system.  It is not really good enough that companies in such difficulties should behave in this fashion when there is so much at stake including jobs.  These companies should bury their pride, or perhaps their incompetence, and seek assistance at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> On the question of competence it is evident from the reports of the company itself &mdash; again referred to in the Joint Committee Report &mdash; that, among the companies seeking rescue assistance, the poor calibre of management and bad industrial relations stand out.  This makes the case for more investment, more funds for management training through such bodies as the Irish Management Institute, the University Business Schools &mdash; I being attached to the UCD Business School &mdash; for more resources and effort in the field of management education and, in the context of industrial relations, in the field of trade union education.  In recent years there has been a very welcome increase in funds for trade union education.  It is my hope that increased funds&mdash;despite the financial stringencies at this time&mdash;will be made available in the coming budget.  The Minister referred at some length to industrial relations.  The critical level of industrial relations practice, it seems to me, is at the work place. Therefore management training, including first-line management and shop steward training, are of vital importance to improving the level of knowledge, expertise and professionalism at that level.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rightly stressed the importance of orderly developments in pay and in industrial relations generally. I fully subscribe to what he has said, including the obvious need for both sides to adhere to procedures for dispute resolution.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the underlying causes of industrial disputes. One of the problems that both sides of industry have to cope with in this country is the absence of a basis of factual information on which to improve industrial relations; in other words, there is a continuing need for more research on which to base proposals for change and policy decisions.  In that context, at present time &mdash; in my department in UCD &mdash; we are carrying out a study into the causes of industrial disputes in the period 1960-1980, including unofficial disputes.  We hope that, following our efforts, some valuable research material will be available for use by practitioners.  I might add <Col N="28" /> that we are working on very slim resources.  This raises again the question of priorities and resources for industrial relations education and research.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, an important link between the quality of industrial relations and industrial investment and, therefore, an important link with jobs.  As a country we have a lot going for us even in these difficult days.  We have political stability, we have a young educated labour force. As members of the EEC we have access to the teeming markets of the Community and it is generally agreed that the IDA do a highly professional job in attracting industry to this country.  However having referred to the EEC, that brings us back to the question of pay levels and of our competitiveness if we are going to make any real impact on our problems.  The harsh reality in regard to attracting industrial investment is that Ireland is competing against many other countries in attracting investment here.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the conclusion that we just cannot afford the luxury of bad industrial relations which, after all, is a field within our domestic control.  My final point is in the form of a question: Fóir Teoranta come under the Department of Finance and the IDA come under the Department of Industry.  Is there a case for the same Minister being responsible politically for both institutions? After all the work of the IDA and of Fóir Teoranta is closely interlinked.  It might make for more efficient decision-making in dealing with companies in financial difficulty were both agencies responsible to the same Cabinet Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all other Senators I, too, welcome this Bill to increase the capital available to Fóir Teoranta from £35 million to £70 million.  I acknowledge also the criteria laid down by Fóir Teoranta to examine applications on the basis of the employment content, of the amount of capital employed in these companies, the capital subscribed by the owners of these companies and also the prospects of the companies relating to profitability, marketing and so on.  I accept that these are adequate and sufficient yardsticks to examine the efficiency <Col N="29" /> and profitability potential of the companies. I agree with other Senators when they said that failure to receive assistance in time has often led to many closures and many losses of jobs.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that in 1981 approval of loan assistance totalled £5.5 million to 39 firms who are employing 5,400 workers and I pose the question, how many of these workers would be redundant now if Fóir Teoranta were not there?</P>
      <P>The arrival in a company of a receiver is often the death blow to the ailing company. When the liquidator is appointed his salary and expenses are the first charge on the company and in many liquidations we have seen in the past the liquidator and his staff are the only winners. We should call for an investigation of the fees charged by the liquidators and the order of preference they hold in winding-up situations.  I submit further that the redundancy and holiday payments of employees of the company should be the first charge on a company and not that of the banks and the fees of the liquidator.</P>
      <P>The management unit of Fóir Teoranta assists and advises on marketing, production, finance and other matters and it has its own team of experts.  I believe that this should be expanded and it should be used more than it has been in the past.  It should be used to help companies who are in difficulty or who are moving into difficulty.  We have good young companies who are strong in finance and very weak in organisation, who could be very strong in production and weak in finance, who could be strong in finance and very weak in industrial relations.  The management unit should be expanded to help companies who need advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation at present in commercial life is that when banks come to process cheques of companies they will process the cheques to suppliers and others and the cheques for PAYE and PRSI will be referred to drawer.  The Government always come last as far as the commercial banks are concerned.  When we look at liquidations, the liquidators' reports and the list of creditors we find in nine times out of ten that the biggest creditor is, in <Col N="30" /> fact, for PAYE and VAT.  There should be a higher profile as far as PAYE and VAT are concerned.  We should examine the situation as to why the Government tend to be the largest creditor.</P>
    <P>During the years the assistance of the IDA to encourage industry has contributed much to the growth of industry in the country, but particularly in Kildare.  There is a great debt owed to the IDA for their encouragement through the 45 per cent grant.  I believe that now is the time to review this grant structure.  It is not good enough in the Dublin area to have 25 and 35 per cent and in places like Kildare and other expanding areas the grant should be increased from 45 to 50 per cent.  Much more restrictions should be placed on financing people who themselves have not been successful in business.  They are inclined to move into business but make a mess of it and the employees suffer. The employer himself then gets off to a fresh start with the blessing of the IDA and a new grant.</P>
    <P>There should be greater liaison between An Fóir Teoranta, the IDA, the development officers in the counties and between the banks and local businesses. They should have an established meeting, I suggest on a quarterly basis, to examine all the factories in the area.  If there was such liaison at local level between these groups, many businesses who find themselves in difficulties could be steered clear of those difficulties.  I believe also that at national level there should be closer liaison with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Irish Industry, Córas Tráchtála, the Industrial Development authority and Fóir Teoranta to examine larger companies, and on a national basis to examine the difficulties that are arising daily in industry throughout the country and to recommend remedies before it is too late.</P>
    <P>We have a situation throughout the country where the meat companies are on a three-day week because of the exporting of cattle on the hoof.  The employment content in the processing industry in the meat companies is massive. There is a movement in that industry <Col N="31" /> towards high technology which is, in itself, a high employment content area. If this were properly structured there is great potential here for very considerable employment at local level.  These meat companies employ local people from rural areas in the hinterlands of the towns.  The present position is that these companies are on a three-day week. There is a massive loss to the Exchequer because of the assistance it has to give for the two days they are not working.  There is a loss of revenue because of PAYE and PRSI, a loss of revenue to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs because of non-usage of the telephones and a loss of revenue to the ESB because of the non-usage of the electricity in these factories. There is also a loss of confidence in the meat business as far as fresh capital is concerned.  People are not inclined to invest because of the situation.  There is a feeling of despair in the management and staff of these companies.  It is not good enough at this time that we should have that kind of a situation in which the Government and Exchequer are actually losing on both sides.</P>
    <P>We have a growing young population. There are many people out of work.  We have an educational system in which the pressures are so competitive now that the young man or woman starting out is often broken before he or she starts, because the emigrant boat is no longer available as it was in the past.</P>
    <P>I served my time, like all my classmates, in England, and many of these have not returned.  The young people now refuse to take this option.  They will stay at home.  They will demand work at home.  If we do not provide that work through agencies like Fóir Teoranta, to rescue companies in trouble, to do something about the meat industry, to employ more people, then our young people will have no option but to take to the streets in protest.  I believe that it will be a hard option and the 1916 Rising will resemble something like a storm in a teacup by comparison.  Our young people will not accept the present situation.</P>
    <P>We are driving our young people, by <Col N="32" /> their frustration, to drugs and drink.  We should beware of the consequences of our own actions.  I welcome the Government's commitment to the National Development Corporation and their present commitment to properly financing Fóir Teoranta by providing the necessary funds in this, the most critical time in our history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill, we are being asked today to increase the borrowing powers of Fóir Teoranta from £35 million to £70 million.  It raises an important question that is in everybody's mind &mdash; what value we get for borrowed money.  It is in that context that I want to say a few words.  I note, by way of introduction, that the Minister for Finance had advanced £33 million by the end of 1980.  In 1980 itself, he advanced £8 million.  I am a little concerned that the delay in bringing this matter to the House, for whatever reason, may have held up Fóir Teoranta in their work.  I note from the data given today by the Minister that the approvals of grants by Fóir Teoranta were significantly down in 1981 as, indeed, was the number of jobs assisted, from 8,700 in the 1980 annual report to 5,500 this year and the grants approved from £12 million to £5½ million. It would, indeed, be very worrying if the valuable job they are doing was held up.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the question of borrowing, over the years of their operation, 1972 to 1980, Fóir Teoranta have relied 70 per cent &mdash; £7 out of every £10 &mdash; on borrowing by the Minister for Finance, advanced by the taxpayer, essentially, who picks up the tab there.  Low interest is charged to Fóir Teoranta for that money.  In effect, at the end of 1980 there was an implicit subsidy, from the taxpayer, of £5 million which does not show up in Fóir Teoranta's accounts as a subsidy. For clarity in the taxpayer's mind as to what exactly he is paying for, that should be clearly stated in their accounts. That is not intended as a criticism of their operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I would like to ask them is what value are we getting for our money, or how effective is Fóir Teoranta in its present operation.  The evidence <Col N="33" /> which the Minister cited and which was also cited in the Joint Oireachtas Committee report was that about one-third of companies assisted failed and about one-third are back in profit, with the rest continuing to struggle on.  In effect, one in every two cases dealt with is a success, one ending in job preservation on a long-term basis and one ending in closure. This has to be viewed against the criterion that the company is working on, which is that it is only companies who have a reasonable prospect of returning to prosperity and profitability in the long term and meeting their commitments will be assisted.  The evidence that one out of two fails certainly raises certain questions as to whether that criterion is being applied properly.  If it is not, it may not be the appropriate criterion, but it is the one set up and that sort of rate is a bit worrying.</P>
    <P>I did not find out from the report on Fóir Teoranta and would be interested to know, while one in three is failing and one in three is back in profit, how many of the jobs are failing.  In some of the companies which go back into profit, a significant number of the jobs may be lost.  We are perhaps getting a more favourable view of just the success ratio in preservation of jobs by Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The really worrying thing revealed in the Joint Oireachtas Committee Report on Fóir Teoranta is that half of the companies helped come back a second time to Fóir Teoranta for further help.  In terms of the penal code, this is recidivism. Something is definitely awry when a company who have supposedly made the management changes necessary to restore profitability and been given an injection by Fóir Teoranta have to come back a second time.  It suggests that the amount of money going to the successful cases may be much lower than we think.</P>
    <P>In terms of the actual amount expended on companies getting assistance, it may be of interest to the House that the average amount of capital spending, in 1980 pounds, paid out per job assisted came to £2,600.  That means, in terms of jobs saved, if we take the ratio that one is saved and one is lost, that the total amount that we are putting in to <Col N="34" /> save the job would be about double, plus a contribution from the IDA.  You would be talking about something around £7,000, in 1980 pounds, per job saved. That would be more in current funds, of course and is quite expensive.  That raises some questions.  Granted, that saves, presumably, the £1,500 redundancy payment which is drawn attention to.  Also, it saves a recurring amount of about £2,000 in unemployment payments. When looked at in that context, it does not compare dramatically favourably with the sort of operation that the IDA are engaged in, where something of the same order of magnitude of money is being put in.  In that case, it is for a totally new job.</P>
    <P>It is an aspect that needs more careful investigation&mdash;whether, perhaps, we are assisting a number of companies which do not in the long term have any prospects, thereby pushing up the cost per job saved beyond what would be reasonable for the taxpayer to bear.  The financial implications in Fóir Teoranta's accounts are that they are writing off about one-third of all the loans that the Minister for Finance advances to them. That should be borne in mind when we are considering this.  They also receive only about one-third of what would be regarded as a commercial return on the money they put into loans.  What this has meant, in fact, is that the interest collected from the companies they have helped is no longer even covering the expenses of operation of the company &mdash;that does not mean that in the past the interest collected had been far in excess of the expenses of Fóir Teoranta.  So there is a deterioration in their ability to operate in a self-financing way.</P>
    <P>The faults in their operation are represented mainly by this problem of recidivism, the fact that some companies are coming back a second time.  That is the key problem that Fóir Teoranta should address themselves to at this time.  Presumably those companies that come back a second time are getting about twice the amount of help as companies who are successfully going through the operation and getting themselves back into profitability. The question this raises is: are we <Col N="35" /> putting off the evil day?  In those companies we are financing losses temporarily and, perhaps, during that temporary financing we are postponing the needed changes in the company and at the end of the day when they are put into liquidation the chances of salvaging may be that much worse since they have had another couple of years to slip backwards.</P>
    <P>Implementing effective changes in the management of companies in trouble brings us up against a serious political problem for Fóir Teoranta which we have to take account of.  Certainly in a small area, if Fóir Teoranta refused to give financial assistance to some company because the existing managing director refused to step down as a condition of getting financial assistance, that would cause an awful political uproar in the area.  That is something we have to face up to.  We have to look at it politically in a mature way.  There is no point in trying to shore up companies because of political pressures if there is not a genuine chance of survival there.  I will come back to that point later on.</P>
    <P>The real question then is: if Fóir Teoranta on the occasion of giving out financial aid list the management changes they regard as necessary, why are these changes not carried through and why does the company come back a second time for another dose of the same medicine? One possibility is that Fóir Teoranta's attitude to companies coming to them is to advance money in dribs and drabs.  That may be self-defeating because a company gets a certain amount and does not implement the necessary changes; things do not improve in the way they hoped and they have to come back again.  Fóir Teoranta might look into this.</P>
    <P>It is notoriously difficult to set standards for control of a company such as Fóir Teoranta.  The question of setting standards is the great challenge being presented to politicians, at present more than at any other time.  Some of the people here will have been watching &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; the other night.  It did not reflect well on politicians of any <Col N="36" /> persuasion.  They seemed not to be facing up to the issues in a fashion that was workmanlike enough.  This case gives us an opportunity to look hard at public money that is being spent.  Certainly Fóir Teoranta can rightly point to the enormous benefits that are coming from their operations, namely, preserving jobs, saving redundancy payments and saving social welfare payments and giving extra tax.  They are certainly things that have to be brought into assessment.  We are right to give the job of assessing these things and the value for money to an independent body such as Fóir Teoranta. But I would like the Houses of the Oireachtas to have effective checks retained for them.  These are borrowed funds they are using and we could use those borrowed funds in other ways to create employment.  The question of preserving jobs can be over emotive.  We should be aware all of the time that by preserving a job we are also giving up the opportunity to use that money to create some other sort of job.</P>
    <P>Coming back to controls, I do not believe that the control at present in operation, namely, that above a certain amount &mdash; previously £250,000 and in future, the Minister tells us, to be £1 million &mdash; ministerial approval is required.  I do not think it is of particular benefit.  It is suggesting that the management of Fóir Teoranta can only be given responsibility for certain sums.  We should have the courage of our convictions. When we set up a body such as this we should give them clear responsibility and allow them to operate.  What I would like to see, as a check on how they are doing, is that they would be charged the interest on the Exchequer advances they were given, so that each year we would have an explicit view of the proportion of money that was a current subsidy to them.  At the end of 1980 they had outstanding loans with their companies of £17.4 million.  The interest on that would be about £2½ million.  The interest they actually recouped from those companies was only one-third of that sum, so that they were effectively getting £1.7 million in a current subsidy.  I would be concerned to see the position where, if Fóir <Col N="37" /> Teoranta were unable to get back even a third of the implicit interest they should be getting, it would be a warning signal that we could watch out for.  I would prefer to give them freedom in their operation, but asking questions in the event of a situation like that deteriorating.</P>
    <P>As the management themselves say in Fóir Teoranta, they operate as a financial institution and therefore we should set a financial criterion such as that to check how they are operating.  I am not asking that they should cover their interest in its entirety, because by the nature of things the sort of work they are in is such that they cannot cover everything.  These are firms in trouble.  They are not able to meet their payments.  At the same time there should be a limit beyond which we do not go.  That sort of criterion would be very valuable for us in looking at what value we are getting for the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>The second possible criterion we could use is the proportion of money that they write off each year of the advances outstanding. This is effectively taxpayers' money, money that we have borrowed from foreign banks or elsewhere that Fóir Teoranta are having to write off completely. In 1980 they wrote off £2.7 million out of their outstanding loans of £17.4 &mdash; in other words, 15 per cent. Again it would be worrying to see that proportion rise from 15 per cent.  That again would be a warning light to the taxpayer, to the public at large, that Fóir Teoranta were not staying within a reasoned approach to their criterion, namely, that only firms with prospects of returning to prosperity and profitability should be assisted.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of the operating of Fóir Teoranta themselves.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee drew attention to the fact that they have six management executives, people who are available to advise companies on difficulties and to go in full time, if necessary, to take over as managing director to see that the changes needed to bring the company around to profitability are implemented. This has been one of the most successful elements of their programme. <Col N="38" /> Certainly in cases where they have put in a full-time managing director there is no doubt that the changes they saw as necessary were implemented.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are six people in such positions and public money would be well repaid if there were more Fóir Teoranta employees who were in a position to go in to bring about management changes.  That would possibly be the most effective way.  Admittedly, there would be problems where the owner of a company was involved in the equity.  However, managers could go in in an overseeing capacity even in such cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that the joint committee suggested that the banks should take a more active role and provide extra facilities under Fóir Teoranta guarantee.  The Minister said he does not foresee any changes in that.  I am not satisfied that no changes should be made. The banks have a social role which all parties agree they are not playing.  They are not making sufficient social contribution. In this area more than in any other they would not only have a contribution to make in financial terms but also in terms of expertise that would significantly improve the operation of Fóir Teoranta.  What I have in mind is that they would not only provide extra facilities and, to some extent, take up part of the risk that is borne entirely by Fóir Teoranta at present&mdash;that would be a financial contribution&mdash;but they also could make a very useful contribution in serving as an early warning mechanism. They perhaps more than anyone else would know when firms were running into difficulty and could bring this to the attention of the Government and Fóir Teoranta.  The Tánaiste in recent speeches drew attention to the fact that in some cases they discovered the difficulties firms were experiencing too late to do anything worthwhile about them. If we brought the banks into this more actively perhaps that situation could be remedied.</P>
    <P>I should not like to give the impression that I am being negative towards Fóir Teoranta.  I am confident that they are doing a very good job in difficult times but I should like to see stronger financial <Col N="39" /> checks.  There are two aspects for which I commend Fóir Teoranta.  Firstly, they are subcontracting the bureaucratic element of their operation to the ICC.  They are using resources that are there already and this is good example for other semi-State bodies particularly in a situation where we are envisaging setting up a new agency in this area.  It would be a shame if they all got their own accountants, secretaries and so on as this would push up costs.  Fóir Teoranta are exemplary in keeping down that cost.</P>
    <P>The other point which is exemplary in the case of Fóir Teoranta is that when taxpayers' money is put into companies it is on the basis that interest has to be paid back on it.  One of the criticisms I have of the operation of the IDA is that when they give out money there is absolutely no claw-back for the Exchequer, not even in profit taxes.  Fóir Teoranta are providing funds on a much more business-like and cost-covering basis than the IDA.  That should be taken into account when considering the amount of money devoted to saving a job compared to the IDA, spending for jobs.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to mention a few things that were raised in the course of the debate.  First, there is the point Senator O'Leary made that there should be an expansion of the equity side of Fóir Teoranta's operation.  To be honest, I sympathise more with Fóir Teoranta's own attitude towards this.  In cases where Fóir Teoranta become substantial owners it is much more difficult for them to operate in a reasonable way.  They increase the political pressures involved if they permit a receiver to go in and do not keep putting money in.  If they are owners they will be seen to be much more responsible.  The other point which seems to be implicit in what Senator O'Leary was saying was that if we advanced equity to these companies the taxpayer would be expecting no debt service or return from the money.  We should expect some return.  I should not like to see the shift to equity mean simply that they get money for nothing.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery brought up the very important question of long-term survival <Col N="40" /> and the problem of how we can get a more constructive management approach to it.  I am not sure that I go along with him altogether in the belief that the answer is simply education.  To some extent agencies such as Fóir Teoranta should have people who are concerned with the more innovative side of industrial policy as well as accountants and so on.  These people should look at the products the company are producing and see what their long-term future is and also the market situation.  If Fóir Teoranta had someone on their operation who was informed in that area it might be a useful addition to their operation rather than hoping that education will in some way solve the problem in the distant future.</P>
    <P>As regards Fóir Teoranta assisting foreign companies, I do not know how they ensure that the money they put into a company does not preserve jobs in the home-base of the company rather than in the Irish operation.  That is something I should be interested to have information on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill concerns the most important social issue facing us as a people&mdash;the unacceptably high unemployment rate and the evidence of further redundancies in the pipeline.  I share the concern expressed by the Minister and Senators who participated.  This is the most serious problem facing us as politicians. I have decided to contribute on this Bill because the debate so far has not considered at a deep, serious level the nature of the problem and how to resolve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unemployment figure is at an all-time high.  This Bill proposes to double the capital that can be borrowed by the State rescue agency, Fóir Teoranta.  That is only a very partial response and the debate has been a partial response to the immensity of the problem.  Not only have we the highest unemployment rate we ever had but we also have a richness and a wealth in a real sense but nevertheless an added dimension to that problem&mdash; a growing number of young people coming on the labour market without any prospect of employment.  In the context <Col N="41" /> of discussing increasing the capital that may be available to a rescue agency, we must also address ourselves to the underlying extremely serious and challenging problem.</P>
    <P>References have been made by Senators to the need for improvement in management, particularly in the firms which are at risk and come to Fóir Teoranta. Emphasis was placed on the need for better industrial relations, on the need for an effective early warning system and on the desirability of better liaison between the existing State agencies and the banks and other finance bodies at local level.  I agree with all of those points.  There were a number of positive and constructive suggestions but I still feel that we are scratching the surface of the real problem.  Jobs are being lost in Irish industry at a frightening rate and more and more young people are being faced with the prospect of not getting a job in the immediate future, not getting a job in the medium term and perhaps never getting a job unless we are prepared to influence the forces that have created this situation and to act on them much more positively than we have done. Therefore we need more than an effective early warning system.  We need a much more concentrated effort on behalf of the whole community to develop preventive measures, to prevent the loss of existing jobs and to develop further job opportunities for our population.</P>
    <P>This is a very difficult and almost intractable political challenge, but before we can face up to it we must identify it. We have to face up as a community to the urgent necessity to have a much more developed strategy to prevent further loss or erosion of jobs, to prevent further job insecurity, further redundancies.  In order to do that we have to communicate the nature of the problem and this is where political responsibility and the role of and challenge to the Government come in.  Any body in a public representative capacity has a potential to communicate the need for a response from the whole community, the employed, the unemployed and those going through the educational system hoping to become employed.  It must be done in the context <Col N="42" /> of the kind of society that we have in 1982, in the context of the forces in our society and its potential.  Reference has been made, in particular by Senator Hillery, to the very positive factors in our society, to our young and better educated work force and to the potential for greater development of our resources.  It is these on which we need to build as part of the overall preventive strategy and also a positive strategy to create new opportunities for employment and for developing industries.</P>
    <P>The nature of the problem and the way it is outlined in the Minister's speech requires a different kind of response from us, a radical change in our approach as politicians and in the way we speak about the problem, in the way we communicate it and act upon it.  It appears to be necessary for us to enter into a radical open dialogue with ourselves, the kind of open discussion which occurred in France in 1968 when there was from the grassroots and also higher up in the educational system a felt need for radical change, a need to change direction in a very important area in life in France at the time, an area which was very structured, very rigid, very stratified.  The capacity to change came because of the extent of the dialogue which was opened up, the extent of the communication.  We need a similar type of opening up of the lines of communication, an awareness of the nature of the problem, an awareness of the collective responsibility of decision-makers and of the whole population at large, in every town and every village and in every workplace.  It is the challenge facing us as politicians to creature structures of participation and structures of dialogue and communication which enable us to face the problem and to develop the resources and wealth of the country in order to overcome and surmount that problem. We cannot do it in present circumstances. We will drift into higher unemployment and switch off a whole young generation which will not have an opportunity of participating in our society. Therefore we must change the approach and change the nature of our perception of the problem.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to note, not just <Col N="43" /> in this country but in other countries where there are severe problems of unemployment, that frequently when a receiver comes in and a plant is closed there is a takeover by workers in that plant.  It may be by way of sit-in or by way of a workers' co-operative which is assisted by local bodies or by the State. It may happen in a planned way or it may happen in an unplanned, desperate way by workers who want to secure their employment.  Why do we have to wait until the firm has become unviable and has closed for this kind of activity?  Why can we not, as part of the approach which places emphasis on preventive measures, on the prevention of loss of employment, have much more attention paid to the possibility of increasing participation by workers, development worker co-operation and structures to keep a plant viable and motivating the employees in a plant by ensuring not only that they have access to a very accurate picture of the potential of the firm but that they have an opportunity to influence the future strategy of that firm faced with the possibility of either further redundancy or of loss of employment?</P>
    <P>Much greater empasis should be placed on stimulating in employment in the private sector a dialogue, an assessment in each workplace of the employment potential and the employment prospects in that workplace for 1982 and future years.  There should be a very accurate flow of information and full disclosure to workers in that workplace.  There should be an openness by management and employers to listen not just to the trade union representatives, though obviously it is important to listen to them, but also to the workforce at large, to the workers in the particular plant or factory where problems are occurring or even where there are no obvious problems now.  No workplace in Ireland is free from the prospect of very serious problems in the near future because of the competitiveness of the modern market and the influences of modern technology.</P>
    <P>Under these twin pressures it is imperative, as part of our approach in increasing funds available to the rescue agency <Col N="44" /> to try to maintain certain manufacturing plants as viable units, that we also have a much broader and more radical approach to the kind of measures that can be taken, to the kind of climate we can create, to the physical resources which can be developed, and to the manpower resources which can be harnessed much more effectively, which can be listened to and which can be brought in in a more positive and more motivated way to secure and develop jobs.</P>
    <P>The increase in the potential capital available to Fóir Teoranta is only one small part of an overall picture, and very much part of that picture I would hope in 1982 will be the role and potential of the National Development Corporation.  The Minister, in introducing this Bill, did not refer expressly to the National Development Corporation.  I would like if he would, in his reply, refer to the potential of the National Development Corporation for further job creation and development of the resources for maximum value added potential in Ireland so that we do not export, as we are doing in the meat industry that potential for job creation but rather develop it for ourselves.</P>
    <P>One final comment arises from the references by the Minister and a number of Senators to the report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies on Fóir Teoranta.  That was a very useful report.  The Minister was a very prominent member of the State-Sponsored Bodies Committee.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that that committee disbanded as did the EEC committee when the general election was called and it has not been reconstituted. We have had no State-sponsored bodies committee for the last seven months.  We have a staff for the State-sponsored bodies committee and that staff are not declared redundant when there is no committee.  Being in the public sector the staff are shielded from that but the staff are idle while important work remains to be done.  There are a number of other State bodies whose work needs to be examined and the committee have a very important workload as have the EEC committee which also require to be reconstituted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred to the value of the report furnished by the State-sponsored bodies committee.  In the past it has been the all too frequent experience of Members of this House that we are asked to authorise further borrowings.  This is usually only a measure involving a single section of a Bill. There is usually no explanatory memorandum and there is a very brief speech introducing it.  We do not know what the basis is.  Here we do know.  We have had an assessment by the joint committee of the work of Fóir Teoranta and that assessment has been a fairly positive one.</P>
      <P>The intention to double the borrowing capital which will be available is a necessary and an important one which both sides of the House will support.  Since this is the first measure dealing with unemployment the House has taken in 1982 it should give us an opportunity to mark the highest level of unemployment the country has faced and the serious threat to existing Irish jobs which is posed over the coming years, the very difficult and intractable economic forces which are at play and the need, in that context, to have a quantum change in our approach to employment and unemployment, the need for a collective concern about it, the need for opportunities for employment impact assessments at different levels and the political responsibility of the Government and public representatives to bring home at a very public and psychological level the collective interest which we all have in the difficult job of preserving and maintaining existing jobs and the further challenge to create new jobs.  I support this Bill but I hope it will form part of a broader debate during 1982 on how we can, in a planned social context, maintain, secure and provide new jobs for our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but I wonder what value will it be in the long term.  Fóir Teoranta were set up as a fire brigade operation which could deal only with problems which arise in the manufacturing <Col N="46" /> and mining sectors of the economy.  While I agree that the manufacturing sector of the economy is of vital importance to this country and the mining sector is also of very grave consequence, there is no way in which this Bill does anything for the service sector of the economy, which is a major employer. The jobs which are provided in the service sector are not in any way State subsidised.</P>
      <P>There is, throughout the Minister's speech, a cohesion as between the role of the IDA and the role of Fóir Teoranta. It would seem as if Fóir Teoranta are basically going in to solve the problems which have been created possibly by ill-advised industries being set up by support from the IDA.  Would there be such a need for Fóir Teoranta if a much more severe look was given in the beginning to the viability of the projects which the IDA approve?  In some instances we had Fóir Teoranta going in to rescue firms in which the directors and the capital for these companies came from breakaways from existing companies.</P>
      <P>Throughout the country at present there are engineering firms in trouble.  In the beginning there was an economically viable engineering firm and suddenly five or six people left that firm to set up on their own; they were helped by the IDA and then possibly one of them got into trouble and Fóir Teoranta had to assist them.  The basic principle of the strength of the original operation was broken down and Fóir Teoranta had to come in. One wonders whether it would have been better for the IDA to strengthen the original company rather than break it up into smaller firms.</P>
      <P>The transport industry is vital to the survival of any manufacturing entity within the country and still there is no way in which the transport industry gets one solitary bit of help from either the IDA or Fóir Teoranta.  The creation of jobs within the transport industry is dealt with either by CIE or by private industry. CIE are not able to compete with private industry in the transport sector.  One wonders should there be a change over in the transport of manufactured goods from CIE to private transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> In the agricultural sector there is no way in which anybody can be helped by Fóir Teoranta at present.  Is this right? Our basic industry is precluded from help from Fóir Teoranta.  Surely our agricultural industry should be helped by any rescue agency set up by statute? The IDA recently set up a services division which will provide support services for computers and the provision of computer software for companies abroad. But this is of no use when one speaks of what the average person would call our services sector.  There is no manufacturing entity which can stand on its own feet without the help of services to support its machinery and to keep its transport going.  Why cannot these people get a bit of help when they get into trouble?  Why should the manufacturing end of industry always be the area in which State money is spent?  Why should the IDA not be able to supply money for the provision of jobs in the service industries, when up to now they have not gone either to the IDA or to Fóir Teoranta?</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation we hear about is emphasised more in terms of the bigger firms, but there is an underlying loss of jobs, which is a matter of urgency, in the smaller firms throughout the country, firms which up to now have been employing four and five people but never got a penny in State help.  They are losing a quarter of their jobs &mdash; and that may be only one job in certain instances.</P>
    <P>As a &ldquo;fire brigade&rdquo; operation, Fóir have done very well for a number of companies.  If Fóir have to go in to rescue a company, the criterion supposed to be set down is that that company should be financially viable and able to produce a profit.  Senator Bruton mentioned the social responsibility of the banks, but if a firm is financially viable the banks should allow it to trade out of its difficulties rather than stop the inflow of cash and leave the company to be rescued by Fóir Teoranta.  If a company are trading profitably, there should be no need for Fóir Teoranta to go in.  There must be something wrong with our banking structure when a company which is financially sound and capable of making profit, have <Col N="48" /> to ask Fóir Teoranta to help.  There should be a financial institution capable of providing the finance required.  If there is a lack of confidence by the financial institutions in management and staff, I do not think Fóir Teoranta will get that back.</P>
    <P>I would like to know the present success rate of companies into which Fóir Teoranta have gone in relation to pounds spent.  How many jobs have been saved? How many firms have Fóir Teoranta gone into in the past 12 months?  How many of these companies are now trading on a profitable level?  What is the return on Fóir Teoranta's investment for re-investment in other firms?  That figure is important because to the ordinary public Fóir Teoranta appear to go into an ailing firm, protect them for a number of months and inevitably the firm go out of business, with no return to Fóir Teoranta or to the Government.  According to what I can make out, it does not look as if Fóir Teoranta are a priority creditor when a company goes bankrupt.  Have Fóir Teoranta the same protection in priority as PAYE, VAT or taxation, because taxpayers' money is going into these firms? Therefore, Fóir Teoranta should be a priority creditor in the same way as the PAYE capital taxation, trading taxation or VAT.  Judging by the rumours we have heard about impending closures and lay-offs, the number of calls on Fóir Teoranta over the next few months will be enormous.</P>
    <P>While a doubling of capital from £35 million to £70 million might seem a great deal of money, in terms of the numbers of jobs at present at risk it is a little drop at the end of the bucket.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker;</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a necessary and well-justified measure and I welcome it. As Senator Robinson said, job creation and retention, unemployment and job losses, are vital matters of policy.  I do not intend to discuss them now hoping to have an opportunity of doing so on the Appropriation Bill.  I would not have risen to speak on this Bill except as a reaction against the eloquent but to my mind insidious arguments of Senator S. O'Leary in favour of directing Fóir <Col N="49" /> Teoranta to adopt a softer line &mdash; in other words, to provide equity capital subscription on a much more liberal scale instead of interest-bearing loans.  He has not persuaded me.  On several occasions in this House I have criticised the otherwise admirable reports of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies for giving too ready an ear to a pseudo commercial argument in favour of injecting massive State equity into ailing State bodies without any prospect of substantial dividends coming forward in the future.  I find Senator S. O'Leary's arguments difficult to reconcile with the expectation I have, and which I hope many others share, that next week's budget will do something to switch State borrowing to more productive purposes.</P>
      <P>Fóir Teoranta, as its name implies, is a rescue body, not a holding company and certainly not an adoption board.  In the corporate industrial context I think one should be seeking to rescue live bodies, not dead ones, or at least bodies with a capacity to live.  The test is, therefore, one of viability, which means being able to pay its way and remunerate capital, whether it be loan capital or share capital, over a reasonable term of years.  The difference between share capital and loan capital may be exaggerated in the Fóir Teoranta context.  Not having to pay a dividend for a period of difficulty is not all that different from having a moratorium agreed on one's interest on loan capital or having the interest rolled back for a period as very often happens when arrangements have to be made for the rescue of companies in difficulties.  We all see that these arrangements involve also the giving of moratoria or the rolling back of interest by financial institutions as well as by a State body.</P>
      <P>I would very much favour leaving it to the good judgment of Fóir Teoranta how they conduct their rescue operations and I certainly would not want to direct them into the provision of share capital rather than loan capital.  The arguments, which Senator O'Leary very honestly read out, against share capital, arguments which were made by a previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, remain valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> One cannot get into any company by way of a substantial share capital subscription without necessarily taking on many of the obligations of proprietorship, an obligation to decide what to do about the business in future, an obligation to manage it and, of course, the very regrettable obligation of deciding to shut it down if after all one's efforts it cannot survive.  I would leave it to Fóir Teoranta.  I would do so especially when I consider how little evidence there is that they are hard-nosed Scrooge-like financial operators.  The Minister has told us that of the cases they assist only one-third manage to survive and trade profitably.  I gather that in so far as they receive repayments on their loans these repayments cover only about one-third of their total help for the industries they have assisted.  That is good enough evidence for me that they are considerate, that they take risks, that they are not refining down too much their concept of viability and that they are in no need of any direction to be more liberal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senators for their contributions to this debate.  Quite rightly a great deal of the emphasis in the debate has centred on the employment question and the extent to which Fóir Teoranta can assist in maintaining and protecting industrial employment here.  The fact that there has been a recently published figure of 141,000 unemployed, as of the latest monthly returns, very significantly masks what I regard as the crisis proportions on the employment front.  I say that advisedly because I have argued vehemently, and will continue to do so throughout this year, that all our scarce national resources and every shilling of productive resources here must be, if we are not to have a crisis situation, diverted deliberately into productive job creation, job maintenance and protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can be accused of being no more than a peddler of gloom if one constantly reiterates the reality of the situation.  This can be very demoralising for many Irish people, particularly young people seeking jobs; but if one does not start from a <Col N="51" /> base of reality one is wasting one's time The reality is 141,000 unemployed.  Notified redundancies for 1980 were over 14,500 and the indications are that notified redundancies for 1981 will be 17,500, closer to 18,000 when one gets the final figure.  If one takes 1980 and 1981 alone, notified redundancies in industry total 32,000.  As Senators are aware, notified redundancies only relate to persons who are probably going to be entitled to statutory redundancy payments.  The gross losses in manufacturing industry in 1980 was 27,000.  One can deduce from that that, if there were 17,000 notified redundancies in 1981 as against 14,500 in 1980, that figure of 27,000 must be substantially higher for 1981.  It may be 30,000.  It means that in the past two years there have been 60,000 gross employment losses in the manufacturing sector and that fact does not seem to have dawned on the Irish people yet.  Were it not for the work of the IDA in 1980, work which has inevitably slowed down in 1981, the picture would be utterly grim and the unemployment total of 141,000 would be close on 200,000 today.  Despite all that the net situation, therefore, is that we are about 10,000 down on the net situation in 1981.  The situation is quite critical.</P>
    <P>We have had many references to firms in difficulty here.  If there is one thing which I learned, and which my colleagues Senator Hillery, Senator Eoin Ryan and those of us who served on the joint committee learned when we investigated Fóir Teoranta it was that our entrepreneurial tradition generally is rather weak.  We are not yet a vibrant and strong industrial nation.  The desire of the average Irish person with an average amount of money &mdash; if there is such a person in existence &mdash; to put his money into a financial risk-bearing enterprise in a private manufacturing company is exceptionally weak. This is contrary to the attitude of the French or of the Germans who are adventurous when it comes to making money on a profitable basis.  The innovative competence of our own people in the manufacturing sector&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be that in other <Col N="52" /> countries there is, for the person who wants to go into an entrepreneurial situation, a better chance of getting a return than is the case in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>What other best incentive can one give?  I should like to develop the point briefly before going on to the actual aspects of redundancy. Unfortunately, in this country we tend to invest our money in land, pubs, supermarkets, in property, all of which have very safe investment levels.  We put a great deal of money into the services sector in terms of investment.  Of course these services suffer dramatically when the manufacturing side gets a crucifixion because they have very little to do. Therefore, there is a real need for us to develop a climate and an attitude and, above all, an education system based on technological development whereby our people will willingly take risks in productive, manufacturing enterprises.  That is our only hope.  Fóir Teoranta are prepared to help those firms, particularly in the manufacturing area, who might be in temporary difficulties, especially those who export.  Fóir Teoranta should certainly give them every possible help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to disabuse the House of any idea that this Government are going to bail out, irrespective of their prospective viability, even in the job-crisis situation we are in, those firms who have no prospect whatsoever of regaining profitability. That is not the job of the IDA, of Fóir Teoranta or of the Government. Arguably it is far more the job of some banks than has been the case up to now. It is certainly not the job of the State to do for managements in the running of their private enterprise what they must do for themselves in maintaining their own viability because the exercise in the long run is totally self-defeating.  I do not think we should let it go out from the House that there is easy money anywhere to be got in the State in maintaining such companies because the political pressures at the moment are intense, enormous and all-pervasive.  Even some major multinationals and some strong Irish financial groups who take over a multitude of firms and who then have one or two who are <Col N="53" /> ailing automatically regard the State as a soft touch to bail out the ailing firm and get it back into some element of transient profitability.  That is certainly not the function of Fóir Teoranta and it is something which will be resisted very strongly by the Government in the years ahead. Despite the fact that unemployment is likely to grow we cannot indulge in panic financial measures.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have to devise a far clearer strategy towards encouraging domestic Irish indigenous firms particularly into the export markets.  For example, if one comes across a clothing firm tomorrow morning which have a high proportion of their output going to exports and they are in temporary financial difficulty due to, say, the temporary collapse of an export market, by all manner of means Fóir Teoranta will move in and immediately endeavour to help that kind of firm, because that is where the money should be going.  I would strongly urge that that is where financial resources should be geared.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon raised the question of extending Fóir Teoranta's activities to other sectors, including agriculture, and also to small firms.  It is important to point out in relation to agriculture that Fóir Teoranta do not get involved in the agricultural business.  As we know, that sector employs a considerable number of workers.  Naturally, the Minister for Agriculture has been pursuing quite actively the problems of individual firms in that sector and of individual farmers and his Department are best equipped to deal with some of the complex problems in those areas.  Fóir Teoranta give priority to agribusiness firms where they are in particular difficulties.  There is no great inhibition in that area.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon also raised the question of priority being given, through the management services unit of Fóir Teoranta, to such small firms.  Certainly  Fóir Teoranta are extremely conscious of the needs of such firms and the farms services unit will be readily available to any firm in that area to assist these conpanies.</P>
    <P>We know that many of the closures which were scrutinised by Fóir Teoranta in the past few years have arisen from <Col N="54" /> bad management, ineffective management, or from the absence of adequate information systems within companies, or a total inability on the part of some compamies to react to change.  Many firms, even in the private sector, often embark on entirely unrealistic manufacturing projects.  However, there is an area which is under the direct control of Irish people, and that is the area of industrial relations.  Admittedly, any firm can go to the wall due to the sudden shortage of owner funds, but it takes a fair bit of a whack and a long period for a firm to go to the wall simply arising from a bad developing industrial relations situation. I referred earlier to the critical importance at this juncture of our economic development of avoiding unneccessary and undesirable industrial disputes.  I had some critical comments to make on the prospects of a dispute which might involve the maintenance craft workers against the member firms of the FUE.  I stressed the futility of the prospect of such a dispute, more particularly when that dispute would be far more concerned about what one might call industrial power structures within the trade union movement rather than the advancement of the living standards of the particular craftsmen concerned.  I had that view and I have shared it for a long number of years.  I certainly hope that this tendency will be strenuously resisted by the ICTU, the FUE and the Government.</P>
    <P>One can think in terms of there being in the past 12 months 17,500 people who were declared redundant.  These would be persons who were more than two years in employment.  At the same time there is a dispute in Tara involving 1,000 workers. I would stress very strongly that we have lost nearly 60,000 jobs in the past few years, that today there are 141,000 out of work and we have had 17,500 redundancies in the last 12 months alone, and we have spent £260 million on unemployment benefit and aid for small firms. Therefore, our exports drive must be maintained if we are not to have a critical balance of payments situation.  We need disputes, particularly like that at Tara, like we need a hole in the head.  Our attractiveness as a manufacturing base <Col N="55" /> must be preserved and developed.  These kinds of industrial disputes cause untold damage to the work of the IDA, Córas Tráchtála and of Government Ministers trying to attract foreign industry into this country or to get existing firms to develop here.  Therefore, I hope that that dispute in particular, where a solution is within the competence of the parties concerned, will be solved in the near future.  Accordingly, I welcome the final intervention of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary raised the question of the possible extension of Fóir's activities to the service industry when we are reviewing the Bill.  Senator O'Leary's comments will be borne in mind when future legislation is being drafted.  However, we have to take account of the critical importance of the manufacturing sector of our economy because without it the service sector can do very little.  It is vital to preserve a healthy and expansion-oriented manufacturing sector. If we are to achieve this through the work of Fóir Teoranta then we will work in that area.  I agree there is a need to examine the services sector.  It has a high employment content.  It may be possible, although I give no assurances, to reappraise the role of that sector in the context of the revision of Fóir Teoranta legislation in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised the involvement of workers in their own enterprise. There is a very serious inadequacy in regard to Irish company law legislation relating to information being made available to workers.  Nevertheless, very often trade unions in industry only make approaches to Government, to individual Ministers and to State agencies after the receiver has moved in and when the liquidator has taken over.  It is arguable that despite the deficiencies of the company law information outlets, workers inside most industries have a fairly acute anticipation that things are going wrong well in advance of the receivers, even where managing directors, accountants or production managers cloak matters, particularly financial matters, hide them and deliberately keep them back and perhaps do not pay PAYE or VAT returns <Col N="56" /> to the State and so on.  Nevertheless, from what is being produced on the floor and from the climate one can smell in the company when one walks in the door, there is an obligation on the part of unions to be much more up-coming, if one might use the phrase, in bringing to the attention of the State and State agencies their concern about the future viability of the companies in which their members are working.  There is an obligation, therefore, for an internal early warning system to be operated within the trade union movement so that it is more constructive, positive and concerned. Therefore, I urge the trade union members in their day-to-day employment to exert their own capacity to alert the State to the areas of concern within their own sectors.  That will be of some help although it does not in any way diminish the necessity to amend company law so that there is far more disclosure.  The report of the joint committee was critical of those companies which deliberately mask critical situations in the hope that the banks, the Government and their creditors will not find out, with the result that it is far too late for Fóir Teoranta, the IDA or any other State agency to give any assistance.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised the point that unemployment is a major problem which raises serious political challenges on all sides, requiring radical change and radical measures.  I agree with the Senator's contribution.  Some of the points we faced up to here this afternoon are of major importance.  When one stresses the unemployment situation at the moment, the balance of payments, inflation and the current budget deficit, all of which are inter-related and have a direct impact on employment, one can see that none of these problems can be solved in isolation. There have been pathetic sit ins and workers bereft of work having their earnings reduced to about 60 per cent, even though they are on pay-related benefit. There is a myth about how well people do when they get a couple of thousand pounds redundancy money and when they go on to pay-related.  We should all do that every couple of years and we would rapidly cure the mythology which <Col N="57" /> is all pervasive in that area.  It is pathetic when management take up their tents, float off into the night and workers remain behind sitting in.  One must ask why sit in?  Workers, generally speaking, have very little experience of running enterprises; very often they have very little awareness of the marketing expertise required to export the particular products they may have been producing for 20 years.  That brings me back to the basic, urgent point.  That is the capacity within our people to adapt and innovate, to have management competence and ability to run our own enterprises and have a tradition of this internally devised, starting with our educational system. One can sit in for 20 years but if one does not know how to run a company, how to export, or to speak a foreign language, telephone France or Germany and talk to customers and ask them to buy one's products, one is wasting one's time.  They are sitting in for the rest of their lives and these are the realities of the industrial environment we have today.</P>
    <P>I hope, since Senator Robinson raised the point, that the National Development Corporation will make a contribution, that it will be distinctive and quite effective in some sectoral areas but I do not regard it as a panacea for all the problems. There is also a myth that if one sets up State enterprise agencies and State development corporations, then automatically jobs will flow.  Industrial life, exports, management and investment are rather different from that kind of assumption.  While I accept and I strongly hold the view that the National Development Corporation can make a major contribution, we should not regard it as a total panacea for all problems which the industrial sector faces.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary said not enough was being done by Fóir Teoranta to inject equity.  He got an answer from his colleague, Senator Whitaker, in that regard. I take his point.  I would hold the view that in a number of cases Fóir Teoranta invest in equity.  I must stress that this can give rise to very serious problems with existing shareholders.  In some cases Fóir Teoranta invest in preference shares with extremely low, effective interest <Col N="58" /> rates.  It is a policy decision of the board that they should not acquire majority shareholdings in concerns.  We all know the implications involved.  It is bad enough to try to handle a bad case with political pressure being exerted on the Government in relation to State aid, but in trying to deal with it when the State has a majority shareholding in a company which has only a marginal prospect of viability, the pressure becomes altogether intolerable.  Therefore, there is a case for State equity, or for direct equity, but it should be of a very limited amount. The Senator will appreciate that, when the worst happens to a firm, namely closure, Fóir Teoranta lose significantly, and can lose very significantly if they have a major equity shareholding.</P>
    <P>Senator Bruton raised the question of the overall State deficit in this operation. It is fair to say that one-third are marginally successful and the rest go to the wall. He pointed out that there can be irrecoverable losses.  The accumulated deficit at the end of 1980 as a result of these losses was about £11 million, representing direct losses to the taxpayer.  That must be put on the record.  This deficit, incidentally, may have to be written off in the years ahead with the approval of the Oireachtas.  We will have to consider that over the next four years.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary said there was no overview of the timber industry by Fóir Teoranta.  He suggested State control of the manufacturing end of the industry.  I take the general point that the development of an industry such as the timber industry is more appropriate to the IDA. The IDA are now adopting a much more coherent and structured approach to the needs of that industry.  The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is also involved. By and large the situation has improved with the IDA more directly involved in that sector.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary said what most companies needed was interest-free capital. We have dealt with that area and, frankly, it is not on.  I have no intention of providing interest-free capital.  Out of the total expenditure to date of Fóir Teoranta, £35 million pounds, £11 million has been irrecoverably lost.  Let us <Col N="59" /> be blunt about that.  It has been written off &mdash; and that was a major loss &mdash; but it contributed towards the maintenance of employment.  I would be very opposed to the provision of direct interest-free capital because it is an extremely difficult area.  If the argument were carried too far it might suggest that any firm threatended by closure could avail of such a proposition.  I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs would agree with me that the European Community might have some strong views to express about such a provision.  I will leave it at that because it is fraught with considerable implications relative to competition.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery raised the interesting point as to whether I should be here dealing with this Bill.  He has a point. When Deputy Richie Ryan was Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Finance, in February 1976 he proposed the transference of Fóir Teoranta to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I agreed with him, but because of the general election it did not happen.  I am not suggesting it will happen in the immediare future; there has been no such Government decision in relation to this State body.  At that time quite a number of bodies were shifted to various Ministers. For example, the Sugar Company went from Finance to Agriculture and Fisheries. The National Stud was shifted and other bodies we investigated on the joint committee.  It is logical enough.  I agree with his suggestion and I will bring it to the notice of the Minister.  The second last Government proposed that development.</P>
    <P>Senator Conway said the management services unit of Fóir Teoranta should be expanded.  While this is directly a matter for the board, I can tell the Senator that I would be very much in agreement with the board if they decided to extend this unit.  At present they are recruiting a number of key executives with industrial experience for this unit.  That development is welcome and I am sure the Senator will be glad to take note of it.  The Senator also called for greater liaison at local level with the companies concerned. I will bring this matter to the attention of <Col N="60" /> the Minister for Industry and Energy.  His Department should be co-ordinating and directing that approach.</P>
    <P>Senator Bruton was concerned about a delay in bringing in this legislation which, he suggested, may have obstructed Fóir Teoranta's efforts.  I can assure him that there was no delay.  I was a bit worried about that aspect prior to Christmas so we arranged that it would be taken on the first sitting day after Christmas.  There is no problem about Fóir Teoranta at the moment.  There is still £3 million left unissued under the present legislation and Fóir Teoranta have not felt inhibited in any way.  In any event they will have the new funds available now.  They were not in any way under strain with regard to their liquid resources prior to the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised a question about agriculture and the service sector. I have already dealt with that point.  He raised the question of the possible economic justification for assisting projects which might ultimately undermine existing viable projects.  I can assure him that Fóir Teoranta are extremely careful in this area.  It is a very delicate area.  There are very competent and experienced individuals on the board of Fóir Teoranta and at management level as well.  I am sure all Members of the House will agree with that and in particular Senator O'Brien, Senator Hillery and others who met members of the board and senior executives of the board at meetings of the joint committee.  It is fair to say that they themselves have a large number of business contacts in their own right.  In addition, the Fóir Teoranta management are in a position, through their contacts with the IDA, to bring to the attention of the board any possible dangers that might exist on this front.  Therefore I can assure Senator Lanigan that the possibility of projects being assisted by Fóir Teoranta undermining existing viable projects certainly will not arise.</P>
    <P>The final point I would make &mdash; Senator Bruton raised it &mdash; is the question of foreign companies availing of Fóir Teoranta funds.  This has been mentioned and is very closely monitored by Fóir <Col N="61" /> Teoranta.  I can assure my colleagues here that no funds are released by Fóir Teoranta unless they are absolutely guaranteed and it is certain that the funds will be used locally.  In many instances Fóir Teoranta insist that parent companies not only leave these funds within the Irish subsidiaries but actually commit substantial additional funds themselves directly to the venture before Fóir Teoranta make their contribution.  Usually Fóir Teoranta make their terms quite conditional on such commitments.  Therefore there is no real problem in that area.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their assistance on the Second Stage of this Bill.  There is no doubt that we face a critical employment situation at present.  In view of the benefits of Fóir Teoranta in ameliorating the worst effects of the close on 18,000 redundancies last year, and of the 15,000 redundancies the year before, with a gross loss in overall employment of close on 60,000 in what could only be described as a crisis employment situation I would submit that the additional money we are giving to Fóir Teoranta is money well spent, utterly desirable and will be used in the best interests of the companies and the workers concerned in those companies.</P>

In his speech the Minister said that the discretion of Fóir Teoranta to allocate money without the consent of the Minister will be increased to a ceiling of £1 million.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct, as the Senator says, that it is not in the Bill.  It is mentioned largely as a matter of courtesy.

      <P>You anticipate me a little, a Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I would like to begin my contribution on this motion, noting the Eighteenth Report on Developments in the European Communities, by paying a quiet tribute to the person or persons responsible for compiling the information in this report which is submitted to both Houses of the Oireachtas every six months.  It is a very valuable source which any of us can consult, particularly in order to ascertian whether a regulation or a directive has been passed at the European Community level and, if so, in what way it was implemented here in Ireland.  It is necessary to have that kind of information, to have an updated source to draw upon in order to ascertain what steps have been taken.  I have fairly frequent recourse to these reports, both in an academic and political context.  It is worth noting and indeed commending those who put a lot of work into it for the detail and the useful updating and information contained in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do this in order to encourage them because in one or two instances, they did not quite follow through with the Irish instrument which complied with the directive or whatever.  I am thinking, for example, of the Directive on Wild Bird Conservation.  There is a reference to the Official Journal, where the directive is contained, but there is no reference at that point to the Irish implementing measure.  I would like to encourage the practice of not only referring to the measures at the European Community level <Col N="64" /> but also specifically in the footnotes to the Irish measures.  It is very difficult sometimes to get up-to-date information. It is also difficult to get up-to-date information on appointments to institutions, on when people took office, and for how long, on who attended particular council meetings, on the various measures which are still in draft and what is the current text that is being discussed.  It may be easier for members of the EEC Legislation Committee to keep up-to-date with this than for other Members of both Houses.  But there is always a difficulty. This report, therefore, fulfils a valuable function.  Its value has been recognised by people of other nationalities and indeed bureaucrats or Eurocrats who work in the EEC institutions in Brussels. I have frequently come across a German or a Dutch person referring to the report as being a very useful way of ascertaining what is the present state of play.  At that level the report is valuable.</P>
    <P>It is also very useful to have this regular and recurring opportunity to debate recent developments in the European Community.  In doing so it is necessary for each of us to select particular areas of concern.  I intend, in my contribution, to pose questions to the Minister and I await his reply on these specific issues.</P>
    <P>The first area I would like to seek more information on is the precise form and shape of the proposal for a European Act which is currently being discussed at the level of Foreign Ministers and in the context of European Political Co-operation. I would like to know what precisely the European Act is envisaged as being.  Is it to be merely the type of joint declaration of which the Community has had previous experience?  I am thinking of the Joint Declaration on the Protection of Human Rights which the Council, Commission and the European Parliament entered into a few years ago.  Will it imply some sort of commitment at a political level but without any precise legal basis to it, or will it be more than that?  To what extent is it related to the necessity for a further commitment to future funding of the Community?</P>
    <P>I think it must become more and more obvious to observers of developments at <Col N="65" /> the European Community level that the Community budget and financial resources are at present quite inadequate to deal with any of the serious political problems at that level.  The budget of the European Communities is only a very small fraction of the GDP of the member states.  It is not a budget that would enable the Community to have any significant impact on unemployment at the Community level.  It is not a budget that would enable the Community to have a genuine industrial policy at the Community level.  It is a budget which enables the Community to have a common agricultural policy, but even there the criticism of the common agricultural policy would at times suggest that the sums of money being talked about constituted a significant percentage of the GDP of the ten member states.  Again, that is not the case.  Agricultural spending is itself a very small fraction.  If it is proposed to have further developments at the &ldquo;high profile&rdquo; political level by way of adoption of a European Act, then surely this is without real significance &mdash; indeed is a con job &mdash; unless it is accompanied by a commitment on the part of the member states of the European Community to increase the own-resources of the Community itself beyond the present ceiling of 1 per cent of the VAT revenues of the member states.</P>
    <P>This is the overall political problem which is not sufficiently discussed and not sufficiently highlighted in the context of debates on the European Communities. The debates centre on issues which have much less real significance in the medium and longer term development of the Community as a political entity.  They centre on the question of the contribution to be made by member states, largely because of the emphasis placed by the United Kingdom on the contribution which it has been making and which it maintains must be revised and changed. That is a good example of a country arguing its own cause, and making a very strong and rather chauvinistic case which emphasises the particular disadvantages of the position which was clear when Britain joined the Community &mdash; clear at least in its overall terms &mdash; and which <Col N="66" /> Britain has consistently sought since then to renegotiate.  It does so with a certain residual political leverage because of the known unpopularity among a fairly broad mass of the British people of membership of the European Community.  But that political argument and debate, which have been very substantially covered by the media in this country, in Britain itself and in other member states, take away from the much more fundamental political issue of whether the Community is going to find the political will and commitment to transform its budget from a tiny fraction of the GDP of its member states to a genuine budget which would enable the Community collectively to address itself to the various economic and social problems facing the peoples of the member states of the Community, and so that it had the capacity to make a substantial impact on those problems.  Then there would be effective action on those problems both at the community level and the national level where there would still be substantial room for manoeuvre and substantial room for national sovereign measures to be taken as well.  That is the central problem facing the Community. It is one which would have to be faced in the context of a proposal to subscribe to any further European Act or other instrument.  Even if that Act or instrument was of no legal significance in itself it would, as I say, be a con job to do it unless it was matched with an appropriate level of financial contribution.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of the proposals for reform of the common agricultural policy.  Here again, there has been very considerable debate and discussion but in a fixed and rigid context, about a problem which evolves and changes from season to season and from period to period as the cycle of supply and demand in the agricultural sector shifts and changes.  In particular, I think, the level of political assessment and commentary in the British media is very shallow, very superficial and very doctrinaire and rigid on the CAP.  It applies a single vision and a single set of criteria to a constantly changing situation.  Again if one looks at the very small fraction of the overall GDP of the ten member states which is tied up <Col N="67" /> in funding the common agricultural policy, if one looks at the essential objectives of the common agricultural policy in providing stable prices and funds for development and restructuring of farms in the European Community and a supply of essential foodstuffs to the people of the Community, then it is difficult to see why the common agricultural policy has become the focus of so much doctrinaire criticism unless it is seen in the context of an artificial debate in the first place, an artificial debate about an artificially low budget of the European Communities, as it is.</P>
    <P>However, for this country the position is not only clear, but one which can be supported with very strong legal as well as political arguments.  The Government are right in maintaining their present position that the structure and support for the common agricultural policy was one of the <i>acquis communitaire</i> on which we decided to join the European Community and which was central to the constitutional referendum which was required in order to enable Ireland to join and participate in the European Community.  To that extent, the Government are right to indicate that, if necessary, a veto will be exercised by Ireland on any attempt to change fundamentally the structuring of the common agricultural policy.  This is an instance where it is clearly in Ireland's vital interests to preserve the overall shape and functioning of the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Having clearly said that, not wishing to be misunderstood on it and having referred, in very general terms, to the current debate, I think it would be helpful if in his reply the Minister might indicate whether there are ways in which there could be developments in relation to support for our farming community which would allow a movement from a total adherence to the price support mechanism in the direction of an income support. I pose that question because I have frequently participated in seminar discussions very often with English, sometimes German, occasionally Dutch or Belgian critics of the common agricultural policy <Col N="68" /> who point out that it could very well be in Ireland's interest to explore the possibility of income support for farmers as opposed to relying primarily on price support in certain areas of development of the common agricultural policy.  I would hope to have a general response from the Minister on that aspect.</P>
    <P>The present situation in regard to fixing farm prices for this year appears to be that the Commission have not yet proposed their recommendations for farm prices.  Again, it would be helpful if the Minister would indicate whether there is a political background to that, whether the Commission are seeking to force the hand of the Council of Ministers in getting some agreement and causing a vacuum which will lead to delay and apprehension on behalf of the farming community both about the level to be recommended by the Commission and the date on which the farm price increases will be fixed for 1982.  It would be helpful to know the nature of the debate and discussions which are going on because it is sometimes difficult to understand the situation fully.</P>
    <P>On the specific chapters of this report on developments in the communities, I would like to draw attention again, as a number of other commentators in recent months have done, to Ireland's failure to implement the company law directives which have been passed at European Community level, the time for implementation of which has gone by.  The failure to implement these directives is indicative of a lack of active concern here for reform of our company code in a more radical and comprehensive way.  It is because of that failure that we have not complied with the time limit there and, as I understand it, proceedings against us are either being brought, or threatened, before the Court under Article 169.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify that position.</P>
    <P>On the social policy of the Community, the Commission have sought from member states an account of the steps taken and the measures adopted to comply with the Treaty itself &mdash; Article 119 &mdash; and the Council directives in the area of equal pay and equality of opportunity. <Col N="69" /> Although the Commission have published an assessment of the responses from member states from time to time on this issue, what is not available to Members of this House is the response given by Ireland to the questions posed and the information required by the Commission under the directive to be furnished to it about the nature and extent of the implementation here of our obligations under the Council directives dealing with equal pay and equality of opportunity.  This information should be available and, indeed, we should also have full access to information on the steps being taken to comply with the third directive, the directive on equality in the area of social welfare, which we are required to implement fully by December 1984.</P>
    <P>There has been unnecessary secrecy about the Government responses to the Commission in these areas, perhaps because it is felt that these responses would be somewhat embarrassing or that the material might be used to be critical of the situation here.  All this material, the drafts and, indeed, the final documents of responses to the European Commission in this area, should be fully available to us.  The information should be either tabled or copies put into the Oireachtas Library.  Certainly, it should be made available so that we can examine the kind of responses that have been given.</P>
    <P>There is another area which has been much discussed and debated in recent times and on which there was a special debate in this House and, therefore, I do not intend to dwell on it at any length. That is the question of the discussions in the context of the European Political Co-operation, which, it has been alleged, could pose some threat to Ireland's position as a non-member of NATO, as a country which has a tradition &mdash; however one wants to define that tradition &mdash; of neutrality and where there is a very broad public resistance to and public concern about any involvement, even a peripheral involvement, in a military or defence pact situation.</P>
    <P>I had the benefit of participating in a very useful seminar on the subject organised by the Irish International Committee <Col N="70" /> under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy.  It was very helpful in understanding some of the subtleties and, indeed, some of the sophistication of language involved in distinguishing between security and defence, in distinguishing the extent to which Ireland could participate and where we drew the line.  The more it was attempted to draw the line, the more complex and difficult the issues became.  Therefore, it would be useful if, in the context of this debate on the report on developments in the Community, the Minister would clarify on the record the precise position which Ireland has adopted and will continue to adopt in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude my contribution by drawing attention to the fact that the legislation passed at the European Community level since last June &mdash; Council Regulations, Council Directives and Decisions, and indeed Decisions taken by the Commission or Commission Regulations or Directives which have affected Ireland &mdash; has been totally without any Irish parliamentary scrutiny.  This is a very serious indictment of the Houses of the Oireachtas and to some extent of the Government of the day which has a leadership role in this regard.  When Ireland took the decision to become a member of the European Community there was very real concern at that time about legislation being enacted at the EEC level without requiring any direct approval by or endorsement of the Oireachtas.  We did, after all, make the necessary constitutional change which altered the position from the pre-existing one that the Oireachtas was &ldquo;the sole law making Body for the State&rdquo;.  Now the Oireachtas is not the sole law making body, it shares that legislative power and to some extent has given up that legislative power to EEC institutions.</P>
    <P>Shortly after we joined the Community the political decision was taken to establish a watchdog committee and it was given important terms of reference.  It is not acceptable that such a long time elapses between the dissolution of the Dáil &mdash; and as a consequence the dissolution of any select committees that exist &mdash; and their reconstitution.  Very much <Col N="71" /> the same delay occurred when the general election was called in May 1977.  On that occasion the Joint Committee was not reconstituted until December 1977. Now, by January 1982 the necessary motions have been passed by both Houses but the selection committees have not met to approve the nominations for membership of the committee.  The Joint Committee has not yet got together, it has not elected a chairman, it has not begun to address itself to the backlog of regulations and directives which have been passed.  I think this is worrying at two levels: it is worrying that there has not been any scrutiny of EEC legislation for seven months &mdash; none at all by the Irish Parliament &mdash; but it is even more worrying that nobody seems to care anymore.  Nobody seems to be drawing attention to this lack of involvement by elected representatives here, lack of concern about the very far-reaching measures which are either proposed at the European Community level or passed at the European level and which do not have any filter of scrutiny by Irish elected representatives.</P>
    <P>This shows a lack of focus on real legislative priorities and the essential legislative and parliamentary role to be fulfilled by our elected representatives who are coming under increasing criticism.  At least in this regard such criticism is warranted. I think we are deserving of criticism if we are not seen to be anxious and concerned to have an active committee scrutinising European Community legislation. Also, since we have taken a decision in the past to establish such a select committee, and have allocated to that committee full-time staff, then there is waste of manpower as well by not having that committee reconstituted.  Perhaps the Minister would consider the possibility of devising some more automatic mechanism for the future whereby select committees could be reconstituted.  It appears that we are going to have possibly six select committees of both Houses established during this parliamentary session. If that is the case, I believe a very early decision should have been taken, perhaps before either House resumed <Col N="72" /> after the recess following the nomination and election of the Taoiseach and the appointment of members of the Government. If before the two Houses reconvened it was necessary that a decision be taken to reconstitute select committees, they would be reconstituted.  If that had happened on this occasion, the EEC Committee would have come into being during October and would now be well into its working sessions.</P>
    <P>I believe that this is not a small or irrelevant point, but is part of our whole approach to the European Community. The Community is not a very democratic entity.  Its manner of legislating is not really very democratic.  Although it allows participation by a representative of the Government, or a senior civil servant at meetings of the Council of Ministers, these are private sessions and we are not privy to precisely what was discussed. They are complex negotiating sessions, where there are trade offs on one issue in favour of gaining support on another issue, and a balancing of the national interests of member states.  The Parliament, although it has an increasing and now quite significant budgetary role, does not have an actual legislative role as such.  It has a much weaker position in the context of the European Community than the Oireachtas has in the context of legislation and the framework for control of the Government here.  Therefore, when the overall framework of the Community is not one which highlights democratic and representative principles, but is an enclosed and secret one, then it is all the more necessary to have strong and vigilant method of scrutiny here.  I believe that this is also necessary because of the nature of the decisions that are being discussed, the kinds of problems that are being confronted and the decisions that are being arrived at, whether it is in the area of support for dairy farming, or discussions of security issues, or whether it is in the area of the overall size and structure of the budget of the Communities.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would hope that the Minister can give some assurances in this area in his reply.  It would be helpful to have <Col N="73" /> more information available to members of the Oireachtas on the discussions which take place at meetings of the Council.  It is notable that when Ministers return to this country from meetings of the Council of Ministers they speak to the media.  Sometimes they speak to the media in Brussels and then speak to the media at Dublin Airport, or when they return to their offices, or on a television programme that evening in the RTE Studios. They do not report automatically on the record to either House of the Oireachtas.  In other countries they do this.  The Danish Minister would be obliged to report to the Danish Parliament, and there would be greater accountability because whatever was said would be said on the record and could be questioned and could even lead to a challenge to the Government itself if the Minister in his reply did not satisfy his parliamentary colleagues that he had secured the vital interests of Denmark in a particular negotiation.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to suggest that the Community can only go down the road of member states protecting at all costs their national self-interest.  However, the present debates at Community level show quite clearly that this is the primary concern of the representatives of larger countries, so in the short term it must be our concern to ensure that Ireland's vital interests are also preserved.  It must also be our concern to ensure that the Ministers who attend meetings of the Council of Ministers and who represent the country there and enter into these very difficult and very sophisticated negotiations, are accountable back to the Oireachtas. That is something which has never been fully established, but is imperative now, in particular because of the significance for our whole economic and social development of the current issues that are discussed at Community level.</P>
    <P>It is vital that this direct accountability to the Oireachtas be reinforced and secured.  It would be a welcome move if the Minister introduced the practice of reporting regularly on the record following a meeting of the Council of Ministers, and not just communicating with the media or by a statement from the Government <Col N="74" /> Information Service following such a meeting.</P>
    <P>I again welcome the opportunity for debate which this report gives, even though it covers a very wide area.  Also it was published in July 1981 and therefore had to be completed and finalised before that date, so it is to some extent out of date.  It gives us the opportunity to step back a little and have an overview of developments in the Community.  I hope we will have regular debates of this kind on future reports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House with my contribution on this report.  It is not very heartening to read in the Eighteenth Report the same thing which was said in the Seventeenth Report.  It would appear as if the report is taken up with a number of pious platitudes, wishes for the future and concern within the Community for the problems which exist in member states.  Unfortunately the report does not spell out many answers to the problems.  It goes through the problems that are discussed here daily &mdash; the problems of unemployment, inflation, the Third World and so on.  On a day when it was stated that Irish farmers are now worse off than they were before going into the Community, it is right that we should discuss this document.</P>
      <P>One of the main planks on which our entry into the Community was based was that there would be excellent returns for our basic economic entity, namely the farming entity.  Now, ten years later, farmers within the Community in general and Ireland in particular are worse off than they were before we entered.  That is something which we must have a very hard look at.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson mentioned discussions taking place regarding our neutrality or our place in the international community. Over the past number of months certain things have occurred which would suggest that the Community in general is not of the one opinion regarding the power structure or where power will lie in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European position on Poland over the past few weeks has been deplorable. It would appear to the person in the street <Col N="75" /> that the EEC as a whole has not taken up a stand with the people of Poland in their plight.  The only country which did come out strongly on the issue was Germany and the reason for this is because of the commitment of the Poles to the German banks.  It would appear as if the Germans have taken a line independent of the EEC because of the economic implications to the German banking system. There is a situation where four countries in the EEC have agreed to join a peace-keeping force when there is a return of the Sinai from Israel to Egypt.  There should be a general line taken on this peace-keeping force because we, as members of the EEC, might appear to be connected with it and I do not think we should have anything to do with it.</P>
    <P>Even though this is not directly concerned with the EEC, the Council of Europe have suggested that they hold their next Council meeting in Jerusalem. The holding of a Council of Europe meeting in Jerusalem, in the heart of an area which is not the most peaceful in the world, might give the impression that the EEC are giving to the Israeli State the rights over the city of Jerusalem.  That would have serious implications for our position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Middle East.</P>
    <P>The benefits which we are getting from Europe at present cannot be quantified. We are told that we are net beneficiaries. The public impression of our situation in Europe would be contrary to that.  There is a general impression that we are not gaining from being members of the European Economic Community.  If there was a referendum at present on the same basis as it was held for our entry there would not be a consensus for joining; the people would reject entry because of what has happened over the last ten years.  The items which should have been of most benefit to us have not come up to scratch. We got benefits from the social fund and CAP but not enough to persuade the people that we are getting a fair crack of the whip.  It would seem that since there was a downturn in the economies of the bigger countries, less care is being taken of the smaller and weaker sections of the <Col N="76" /> Community.  The wealthier nations are trying to protect themselves.  They have withdrawn their support from the social fund and, in doing so, as has been pointed out not so very long ago, the Irish standard of living <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of the European Economic Community partners has deteriorated to an enormous degree.  It would appear to the generality of our people that as long as we have a bad economic situation in the Community it is every man for himself and the weaker ones are ignored.</P>
    <P>We are being swamped by bureaucracy. There has been a tremendous amount of talk about the cost of the public service over the past number of months but nobody has stood up and queried the cost of the bureaucracy that runs the EEC, a three-capital bureaucracy which in no way could be regarded as efficient.</P>
    <P>We have to abide by decisions made in Europe and many of these decisions are costing Irish industry an enormous amount of money.  We, being on the periphery of the EEC and of Europe, have to bear the transportation costs of our exports which are huge in comparison with transport costs of our European partners.  Still the legislation on transport that comes from Europe is the very same for Ireland as it is for Germany.  We had a tachograph system introduced recently which is adding enormously to the cost of transporting finished exportable goods.  Our insurance rates are double those within the EEC.  There is a 37½ per cent difference between Ireland and Britain in the price of a spare part for a motor vehicle because there is a 37½ per cent duty.  Also we have a higher rate of VAT which means that Irish exporters are working at a tremendous disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The tachograph legislation was obviously laid down by people who were looking at the transport system on the Continent where they can travel on motorways through the seven member countries on mainland Europe.  Between Dublin and Cork, Waterford, Limerick or Kilkenny there are no more than 22 miles of dual-carriageway and still the Irish haulier transporting manufactured <Col N="77" /> goods has to work within the same hours as his European counterpart who can travel three times the distance.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson mentioned the fact that we have not yet agreed to the new EEC company law legislation.  The cost to small companies in Ireland of enforcing the legislation on company law will be enormous and it will drive them out of business.  It will do much for the business of accountants and solicitors but it will do nothing to make business more efficient.  It will not result in private companies having to produce audited accounts, no matter how small they are. It may be that the size of companies in Europe is much bigger and more financially sound than the generality of companies in Ireland but I do not think so.  It would appear that the restraint that will be placed on small Irish companies is being brought about by a collusion between the accountants and the legal profession in Europe.  If we look at what has happened to farmers over the past few years since they came into the tax net we see that even at present it costs the farmer £300 to prove that he should not be paying tax.  He has to pay his accountant to prove that he should not be paying tax.  This is a restraint on farming and if the secondary legislation is put into force in Ireland the very same thing will apply.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the EEC Ministers have not been able to agree on farm prices.  The longer these negotiations go on the worse the situation will be for Irish farmers.  I sincerely hope there will be no backing down by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture on the grave needs of Irish agriculture at present and that they will do their utmost to ensure that the farm package will come out within the next week or two rather than in May, June or July which now appears to be the situation.</P>
    <P>It was stated today by the ESB that they have saved already £147 million by being able to use natural gas.  Is there any way we would have more money from the EEC to speed up the work to find out whether it is feasible to produce oil in a profitable manner from the Continental Shelf or whether, if there is natural gas, we get it sooner rather than later?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> The question of North-South relationships and the support that should be given from the wealthy countries to the poorer countries is not being handled at all well within the EEC.  At the North-South Conference in Mexico everybody agreed that the Third World countries were not getting enough help from the more developed countries.  A junket was held in Mexico City which everybody enjoyed, according to reports in international magazines, but no conclusions were forthcoming that would be of any help to the countries of the Third World.  In the report it states that investments should be increased and the competitiveness of Community businesses improved, which anybody in this House or anybody in this country would agree with.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely nothing in the document to show how investment can be increased or competitiveness be improved.  It states quite categorically that there is a need to increase public expenditure in job creation with particular reference to sectoral restructuring. That is something that many people have given much thought to over the past number of months.</P>
    <P>It would appear there is a divergence of opinion as to what public expenditure needs to be made.  The investment programme for the 1980s which was produced last May laid down pretty well the needs of this country with regard to public expenditure on capital projects but it appears now that the money will not be forthcoming for these projects.  Whether we can get more from the regional policy will depend on the fighting spirit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the other Ministers in their discussions in Europe.  I sincerely hope that what has been stated categorically in this report will happen, that the money will be made available to increase public expenditure in job creating rather than stating it and restating it in each report that comes out.</P>
    <P>It also states in the document that the Community provides that as far as priority regions are concerned, of which Ireland is one, the fund may contribute to the financing of any category of infrastructure with a more limited approach in the case of intermediate regions.  It would <Col N="79" /> seem from that statement that money is available for Ireland for infrastructural investment in economic, educational, medical and cultural sectors, protection of the environment and public sector housing and ancillary installations.  Could the Minister let the House know how much money has come from the Community for public sector housing over the past 10 years or is it one of these pious platitudes that run right through the report?  I am trying to find the reference.</P>

      <P>I cannot find it.  Of the moneys allocated for 1980-81 it would appear that only £5.94 million was paid by the Community on commitments which were far in excess of that.  Why were the allocations not paid over?  Were the EEC to blame or has it something to do with our own situation?  If money is allocated to Ireland from the EEC budget is there any reason why that money is not paid over?  It states on page 63, approved to 30 June 1981, £31.08 million, and only £5.94 million was paid.</P>

This gives a total of £31.08 million and in the payments during the period under review Ireland received Fund payments of £5.94 million.  Where did the rest of the money go?  Can it carry forward from one budgetary period to another?  If money, which is allocated during a budgetary period is not used within that period can it be carried forward into the next budgetary period or is it lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we get these reports but I would like to see more answers in the report.  It makes very little difference to the Irish people that we lost the right to hallmark goods which had been imported from third countries and then re-exported.  I do not think that will <Col N="80" /> make that much difference to whether we stay in the EEC.  Like Senator Robinson, I would like to see more contact between the members of the EEC and this House. The protocol should allow members of the European Parliament to come in here when a debate is going on on anything that happens within Europe.  The members of the European Parliament should be allowed in and be questioned on the aspects which are relevant to Ireland and possibly make contributions in the House towards a debate such as this one.  Again, I welcome the report with those few comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members, I welcome the opportunity which this report gives us to discuss some of the developments in the European Community over the past number of months.  I find myself in general but very strong agreement with Senator Robinson on a number of points, particularly the fact that the Houses have not had the opportunity to scrutinise European legislation for a very long period of time, seven or eight months, and it may be another month or two before the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation is established. It is little short of a scandal that the Houses of the Oireachtas should for so long have been deprived of this opportunity. It is not my intention this evening to place the blame, which could be distributed in a number of directions, but in the interests of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the role we have with regard to Community legislation, it is imperative that the Joint Committee be set up as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support the view put forward by Senator Robinson that it would be desirable that Ministers would report on a more regular basis to the Houses of Parliament on developments in the Communities. I know it is customary at the end of each Summit for the Taoiseach of the day to give a full account of what has happened.  I understand that Ministers coming back, especially if they are coming back with some good news, will want to hold a Press conference.  It is wise that they do so.  They will be questioned by the media on what has happened.  I know <Col N="81" /> that is true and I understand the reason for it.  Nevertheless, not just as a courtesy to Parliament but also to enable Members to go into more detail on what is happening and what has happened, it would be a very good idea if some sort of regular European forum within both Houses of Parliament could be established where Ministers and Members could avail of this opportunity.</P>
    <P>I intend to confine myself to two of three specific areas in the report and especially to the reference in the speech of the Minister of State on the role of the European Parliament which he touched on under the heading of institutional growth within the Communities.  He mentioned that he hoped that soon there would be growing links between the European Parliament and the various national parliaments.  Anybody looking at the role of the European Parliament over the past two-and-a-half years since direct elections must conclude that this has been one of the most disappointing areas in the entire institutional development of the Communities because developments have been so slow as to be almost non-existent.  That is true in the case of the relationships between the European Parliament and the national parliaments and between members of the European Parliament and the national parliaments in the countries which they represent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the role of the European Parliament since direct elections, it was very clear during the election campaign and in the period before that campaign that expectations about the future of the Parliament were raised beyond any level which could be sustained in reality. I have certain sympathy for the position in which the Parliament found itself.  It was a catch-22 situation.  In order to increase interest the Parliament had to make claims about its significance, influence and its future role, which even at the time were somewhat dubious.  It was not always easy for those who were trying to educate the public of Europe about the Parliament.  It was not easy to get across sophisticated notions about the Parliament having influence rather than power or about the detailed workings of <Col N="82" /> the very elaborate committees of the Parliament. It was not easy to get across ideas about the Parliament being involved in a very elaborate timely consultative process which is at the basis of European legislation.  All that is true and the Parliament had to try to engage in a process of education.  It was not always easy to simplify these notions, especially when talking about a Parliament which was based much more on the unfamiliar continental model of Parliament than on the more familiar Westminister or Kildare Street model.  The result was that there was a considerable degree of over-sell, especially in the period prior to the elections and in the advertisements paid for by the Parliament.  The impression was given that the Parliament would have more influence on the day-to-day life of the European Community than could possibly be the case.</P>
    <P>The position of the Parliament and of the candidates &mdash; I was one and I am as guilty as anybody else in this regard &mdash; was understandable.  The candidates wanted to get the voters out.  We wanted to excite them about the possibly of a European Parliament.  We wanted to engage their interest.  We wanted to show to them that it was worthwhile coming out to vote.  So perhaps we did over-sell. The Parliament obviously wanted the mandate of a very high poll.  In the event, the Parliament got that mandate; but unfortunately the very thing many of us feared at the time &mdash; and I said so then &mdash; has come to pass.  The Parliament has faded from public view.  It appears to very many people to be irrelevant to the politics of the individual countries.  The achievements of the Parliament are not easily conveyed to the vast majority of the population.  The publicity which the Parliament now gets is invariably unfavourable and frivolous, centring on such things as salaries &mdash; salaries are too high and provide a focal point for criticism, detracting from some of the substantial achievements of the Parliament &mdash; expenses and allowances paid to members and on the extravagant idiocies of some of the activities of the Parliament and of the officials of the Parliament, and there have been far too many of these.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> To most people I suspect the Parliament is seen as an expensive insensitive and largely irrelevant institution. I have great sympathy for the present members of the European Parliament who will be seeking re-election in 1984 &mdash; I am talking in terms of Ireland, I cannot speak for other countries &mdash; because they have worked in the interests of their constituents over the past two-and-a-half years. Most of our Members have been hardworking. In the case of the three Members from Northern Ireland, the European Parliament has been an invaluable forum at this period of political vacuum in the history of Northern Ireland.  I feel sympathetic because it is going to be very difficult for the present Members of the European Parliament to justify to the electorate reasons for their re-election. This will be based on their preceived performance over the last two-and-a-half years to date.  I suspect that the future elections to the European Parliament will become an occasion for the electorate to vent their spleen against the Government of the day or against politicians as a class by electing the frivolous, extremist or gimmicky type candidates.  Members of both Houses realise that there is a groundswell of disillusionment against politicians as a group.  There is a feeling that we do not tell things as they are, that we have engaged in auctioneering type of politics for too long and that it is about time politicians faced up to the realities and told the story as it is.  It is certain that this exists, but I have reservations about whether it is justified.  Many of our politicians try to tell the truth, but when they do so they are accused of being merchants of gloom.  When they try to list the hard options facing the population they are dismissed as being Cassandras, as being prophets of doom and gloom.  In many ways the electorate are as responsible for our present woes as are our politicians as a class.  Nevertheless, I can see the future European elections being seen as sufficiently irrelevant to what really happens in politics to be used in the way I am referring to.  In a sense the European Parliament may serve as a lightning conductor, <Col N="84" /> or as a safety valve where people can let off steam against politicians as a group, but that is not what the European Parliament was meant to be or the purpose for which the elections were first intended.  For that reason I feel a great disappointment that things have turned out as they did.  I feel this disappointment because the idea of a strong European Parliament was and is a highly attractive one.  It provides one of the best possibilities of real integration at the political level, the possibility of greater understanding between the politicians of the ten countries and, most of all, for us as parliamentarians it provides one of the places where we can begin to fight back to re-establish Parliament's place within the whole process of Government and legislation, the fight back against the encroaching power of the Executive over the past 30 or 40 years, the fight back against the growing influence of interest groups in the countries of the Community.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament still offers the possibility for Parliament to fight back to reassert its rightful place within the whole process of government.  For those reasons, and many others, I am sorry that the promise held out a few years ago has not been fulfilled.  The blame for this lies in many areas.  First of all, it lies with the Parliament.  Once the principle of direct elections had been established, once the first elections were over the Parliament seemed to relax.  It is not so conscious of its public relations, of its need to talk to the people of the ten countries &mdash; I speak specifically for this country because I cannot speak for the others.  Perhaps this is a question of money or perhaps it is a question of complacency but for whatever reason the impact of the Parliament is not nearly so great as it should be at this stage.</P>
    <P>Blame here must lie with the parliamentarians from other countries &mdash; our people have been fairly sensitive &mdash; and officials who have shown themselves insensitive especially on issues which give very easy headlines to journalists who are often less than scrupulous in this regard. The responsibility lies with the politicians and the officials.  Parliament must show <Col N="85" /> greater sensitivity, greater commonsense. It must prevent the abuses and the idiocies which have characterised some of its activities over the past number of years.  Is all the globe-trotting &mdash; maybe there is not much of it &mdash; necessary?  Are the high expenses necessary?  Are the high costs necessary?  These are questions Parliament must ask itself and where it must show itself more vigilant in ensuring that there are no abuses or that those which exist are stamped out.  Parliament as a new institution must be conscious of giving example of grafting on from each of the ten countries the best in the parliamentary traditions of those countries, not, as happened in some cases, the very worst traditions.  Some of the fault must also lie with the Council of Ministers which has to some large extent once elections were over regarded the Parliament as being irrelevant.  The Council has not taken it seriously, has treated it to some extent as a cosmetic.  I urge our Minister, who is deeply rooted in the traditions of Parliament and has a respect which one does not often find in Ministers for Parliament in the Council of Ministers to try to focus attention on strengthening the position of the Europeam Parliament within the Community.</P>
    <P>I do not want to talk at inordinate length about the European Parliament but I feel that the enthusiasm and the hopes which preceded the direct elections have not been fulfilled.  The work of Parliament is not getting across and the Parliament is in danger of being dismissed by the public as derisory and unnecessary. A new effort is needed.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the topic of the Parliament I should like to speak on two further issues.  The first is the question of the dual mandate.  I feel unequivocally that the dual mandate has not worked.  It creates serious strains and makes impossible demands on those who are saddled with this mandate.  It is not fair to the members of the European Parliament who carry the burden of the dual mandate.  Nor do I feel it is fair to the national parliaments or to the European Assembly that neither is getting the best out of those who carry the dual mandate.  It is a problem which must be resolved quickly and it is in the <Col N="86" /> interests of all parties that it be done quickly.  I freely admit that Fianna Fáil have been more successful in facing up to this problem than have the parties on this side of the House.  However, at this time when the strength of Parliament and its relevance are under daily attack from some sections of the media it is a question which straddles party divisions.  As Members of this House we have a common interest in seeing that the strength, dignity and effectiveness of Parliament are strengthened.  I would like to see an all-party approach to the question of resolving the dual mandate and I suspect that those who are carrying this dual burden will welcome such an approach.</P>
    <P>I should now like to take up the question raised by Senator Lanigan, the question of the relationship between members of the European Parliament and their national parliaments.  Obviously, it is a question for each national parliament to resolve but there must be some organic link between the members of the European Parliament and their national parliaments. It is important that there should be uncluttered communication and constant feedback between national parliaments and the European Parliament.  It is important that we should not be cut off from ideas and developments taking place in the European Parliament where there is a cross-fertilisation from the political processes of ten democratic countries with very different traditions. This should not happen.  Members of the European Parliament any more than Ministers, should not grow away from their political roots.  They too should be kept in constant touch with the people who sent them there, the people who share the political process in their own countries.  In our case there is a very easy way out of the problem.  Very simply, there is a way in which members of the European Parliament could, through agreement, consultation and discussion, be incorporated into our national parliament without any greater upheaval.  If at the same time as we outlawed or banned the dual mandate we gave our 15 members of the European Parliament the right to attend and the right to speak in this House, then we would be resolving the <Col N="87" /> problem.  The members of the European Parliament could attend debates in the Seanad, speak in the debates and have all the normal privileges of Members of this House without the right to vote.  That would be the only way in which they would differ from Members of the Seanad.  Obviously, I take it for granted that they would not be paid the salary which members of the Seanad are paid. They are well enough looked after as things are.</P>

      <P>This would ensure the most direct of links between the national and the European parliaments.  It would enrich the quality of debate in the House and would prevent members of the European Parliament from feeling cut off and isolated in an unreal political world.  It is an idea which is not new but it is one which would enhance the standing of this House, enrich the quality of debate here and would also solve the problem of ensuring that members of the European Parliament are not cut off from the political process here.  It is an idea I recommend for discussion to members of all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to turn briefly to one other aspect of the report.  The Minister of State spoke warmly of the accession of Greece as the tenth member of the European Community.  I, in common with every Member of this House, welcome the membership of a democratic Greece in the European Community, welcome all that Greece brings in terms of culture and tradition and welcome the strengthening of Greek democracy which disappeared during that dramatic period of the colonels in the seventies.  I welcome everything membership of the EEC brings to Greece.  I do not want to trespass on domestic Greek politics but there is the fact that shortly after Greek accession a general election took place there. From a European point of view, the new Prime Minister announced he was totally and utterly committed &mdash; certainly in the election campaign he was but he may <Col N="88" /> have changed since then &mdash; to withdrawing Greece from the Community.  That is a matter for the Greeks.  If the Greek people decide, as we might decide at some stage in our future history, to withdraw from the European Community that is the right and the privilege of the individual nation.  It may well be that the Greek Prime Minister has softened his approach, that he has slackened down somewhat, but my information is that he has not.  He is not rushing but the fundamental aim of the Government &mdash; that policy which got the strong mandate in the election &mdash; is to withdraw Greece from the European Community.  We must be mindful of the disruption which was caused to the European Community by the British renegotiation of 1974.  I would fear very strongly the consequences of the Greeks entering into a long process of renegotiation which would result in delays, uncertainties and irritations being caused to the other members.</P>
    <P>The Community may have a very strong desire to persuade the Greeks to stay in.  They can see the benefit which comes to Europe as a whole from having a strong democratic Greece integrated into a greater European Community. They can see this especially in terms of strategy and in terms of the Greek experience of the seventies.  Therefore, I hope this question will be treated with sensitivity and with firmness.  The work of the Community cannot be allowed to be held up or disrupted during the long period of renegotiation.  On the other hand, I do not think anybody here would like to see Greece leaving the Community in a precipitate way.  I do not know the answer and I am sure the Minister may have some comments to make on the current situation with regard to Greece and the Greek situation if it is not an intrusion into Greek domestic politics to do so.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of the report which I should like to deal with, but I shall not delay the House further except to mention what has been one of the successes of the Community in the past number of years, that is the question of European political co-operation.  The <Col N="89" /> process so far has respected the individual traditions and interests of the individual countries.  The pace has not been too fast.  Skill has been shown in reaching agreed positions on sensitive issues so that the appearance of a unified Europe to the outside world, though not always successful in this context, has been more coherent and more consistent in the past year or two because of the comparatively successful operations of the process of European political co-operation.  From our point of view I believe that this is a process in which our Ministers &mdash; not only the present Minister but previous Ministers &mdash; have played a constructive role.  The officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs have had a stage big enough to accommodate the very great degree of talent that exists in that Department. In all of these cases the working of political co-operation has enhanced our position.  In terms of foreign affairs, it has given our neutrality a new and deeper meaning.  We have not been forced into positions that we do not want to take. Nevertheless, we have had influence where in the past we might not have had it.  I hope that the sensitivity shown in the development of the concept of political co-operation will be continued in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister again for giving us this opportunity of discussing the workings of the Community.  In looking back over the history of the Community in the past 30 years we see it in terms of large advances followed by major retreats, followed by a reassessment in which a more realistic, forward-looking stance was adopted.  We think in terms of the great advances of the Coal and Steel Communities followed by the great defeat and failures of the Defence Community and the European Political Community of the fifties, this in turn leading to the big conference at Messina which fixed the foundations for the Treaty of Rome.  Then we saw in the sixties the attempt at great advances followed by further failures.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we are now at one of those slow-moving realistic phases in the development of the Community where looking back, much of the real progress has been made in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to listen to Senator Manning who had the privilege of receiving my first preference vote in the European election and have agreed with very much of what he has said.  I hope he will be a candidate again but given the present political atmosphere, that is unlikely.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity and it is probably a reflection of the interest in the European Community that for a great period of this Debate, there have been only three Senators present.  I do not wish to chastise them or blame them for this, but the European Community has an enormous public relations job to do not only on the people of this country generally but on our parliamentarians.</P>
      <P>When I asked people's opinions about Europe in the last week there was either a massive yawn or howls of cynicism in reaction to one's asking people what they thought European parliamentarians and people who worked for the European ideal were doing.  The problem the European Parliament has is one of public relations, one of communications and of getting over the message that it is not just a monumental bore which the words &ldquo;European Economic Community&rdquo; seem to conjure up for most of the people.  There really have been real benefits in the European Community although it is very difficult for the average individual to actually touch on them.  The EMS has been of great benefit to most countries and has been a notable success in the last few years.  But, on the other hand, if you ask the average person in this country what the EMS is he will not be able to tell you and he will not be able to tell you how it works.  You will find the same with MCAs, CAP and all the other groups of initials used in relation to the EEC.  They are utterly meaningless to people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the implications of this was the European election itself in which, on the whole, people voted not on European issues, but on local and personality issues.  Traditional patterns of voting were very obvious in those elections.  On the whole, people voted for those parties for which they had always voted.  That is exactly what the European Community <Col N="91" /> should not be educating people to do. People were not voting for the groups &mdash; the Gaullist Group or for the Christian Democratic Group or for the Socialist Group in Europe.  They were voting for the people for whom they had always voted because they felt safer with them.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the dual mandate would probably help to solve that problem. Part of the problem lies with the media.  The media refuse, on the whole, to give the EEC the coverage which it deserves and it is the media presumably in the end that must lead the people along this road, that must create the interest. The EEC Parliament does not get the coverage because we are in a catch-22 situation in which the people are not interested and, consequently, such news does not sell newspapers.</P>
    <P>The so-called gravy train in which people are involved is the most common complaint we hear.  It is supposed to be a somewhat taboo subject in parliamentary circles.  This is what people associate with the EEC more than anything else.  It is impossible for anybody to understand people being paid these vast salaries when everybody here and abroad is being asked to tighten his belt in the middle of a recession.  It is absolutely impossible for people to understand why EEC conferences always appear to be held in climates where there is sun in the middle of winter and why there are junkets to unnecessary interparliamentary unions which seem to achieve very little. They always stay in the most expensive hotels.  There are endless dinners and receptions, duty free shops and massive hotel allowances.  I do not know the details of the recent situation we had, but it looked extremely bad when the newspapers said that people were getting large allowances for staying in hotels when in fact they did not stay in those hotels at all.  Yet, according to these allegations, they were keeping the money.  The inquiry into that appears for some reason to have been stopped.  That may or may not mean that they are guilty, but it looks very bad.  That is the sort of thing people remember.  I know of people who have come back from the gravy train to Brussels <Col N="92" /> and beyond with voracious appetites for Dom Perignon and Krug, people who did not know the difference between burgundy and claret when they embarked on that.  We cannot justify this sort of publicity in a time of restraint.  We cannot allow massive bureaucratic scandals of this sort to be flaunted before the public when we are being asked by Ministers to tighten our belts.  It means they lose their credibility, the European parliamentarians lose their credibility and in the end the European Parliament suffers in the eyes of the people.</P>
    <P>The dual mandate does the European Community a great deal of harm in the public eye, because people see these parliamentarians getting enormous salaries, flying backwards and forwards, being paid too much, and not being able to do the work in either parliament.  While I accept that the European Community has done a lot of good work, it has to do a great deal in terms of public relations to convince people it is even necessary.  Senator Lanigan's point was interesting when he said that perhaps if there was another referendum people would not vote so convincingly for the EEC because they could not see any tangible benefits.  There would not be a very high poll, I suspect, because people are not interested any more.  It is up to the Government and the EEC to do something about this and to explain to the people of all these countries, especially Ireland, where the benefits are and to dispel the real fears and cynicism felt about the EEC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start with a small detail in the report and then briefly to look at some of the principles underlying what I consider the European Community to be.  There is in the report a small section &mdash; I believe far too small a section &mdash; dealing with education.  It is a pity that in that area, where there are certain important practical problems, the Community seems to have made a decision, whether conscious or not, to regard education as a necessary detail to be added on to the really important matters of economics, political co-operation and so forth.  In the practical field of examinations I believe the Community could <Col N="93" /> have done a great deal more.  There is a problem that is known in French as <i>equivalence des diplomes</i> which is a very technical and complex area.  It is not just a question of comparing pieces of paper and regulations.  It brings into its scope all sorts of attitudes towards examinations, education and all sorts of matters of comparability.  Precisely because it is so complex an area which no one country could handle on its own, it seems to me that the Community could have tackled this, and the whole area of education, with a little more vigour and determination. There is, for example, a European University or a university in gestation in Florence, but again one has the impression that this is a sop thrown out to the educational community, that it is perhaps another aspect of the gravy train where academics and a few promising post-graduate students may be shunted off so that the Community appears to be doing something, so that there is an item on the balance sheet and in a report such as this.  The next point with which I would like to deal is to be found on page 107 of the report, subparagraph (c), delegation of powers to the Commission.  It says:</P>
      <P>It is desirable that powers should be delegated more frequently to the Commission, with the latter being asked to submit stock formulae or formula [as the &ldquo;Wise Men&rdquo; suggested] for the principal eventualities, on the understanding that it remains for the Council to decide, on a case-by-case basis, when the appropriate conditions are fulfilled for recourse to such delegation of powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I wish to discuss here is not so much the content of this paragraph as the way in which it is expressed.  Having, in my comparative youth, undertaken a certain amount of research in the area of Community co-operation in education, one of the things I found was the difficulty which people had in understanding each other, not so much in understanding individual words and phrases, sentences and so forth but in understanding the concepts behind the languages and in understanding the quite important and fundamental <Col N="94" /> differences and attitudes which were reflected in linguistic differences. The reason I begin with this paragraph is that it seems to reflect certain aspects of the Community which might be important when we come to consider the attitude of the public and others to the Community as a whole.  That paragraph is not really English; it sounds like a translation from French or some Latin or Romance language into English.  Many of the phrases used and the way it is constructed reflect more a French attitude rather than the kind of attitude with which we would be familiar in the English language.</P>
    <P>There are two points which I should like to make in respect of this paragraph. They are related very much to the main burden of what I want to say.  The first is that this paragraph is couched in language which is not the common English that the not so common ordinary people of this country, or any other English speaking country, might be able to understand and, indeed, want to read.  This touches upon the whole area of the way the Community operates, the way the Community presents itself to people.  It touches on the public relations aspects of it in that many of the most important expressions of what the Community is doing are put in a language which people look at and turn away from.</P>
    <P>When one considers a paragraph of this kind, which is not the worst that I have ever seen, one understands what Senator Ross means when he says that the Community, to many people, is nothing more than a monumental bore.  This is unfortunate in that, confronted with this kind of language, confronted with this kind of approach to communicating what is going on in the Community, a great many people switch off and turn away from what the Community is doing, and miss not only the important practical aspects, which in many cases affect them directly, but also affect the more fundamental aspects of what the Community is, and what it is doing in the world at large.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent this reflects the tendency of the Community to develop into a bureaucracy remote from the ordinary life of the people.  This bureaucracy <Col N="95" /> to a certain extent is reflected in the flood of secondary legislation which is incredibly boring to most people but, in fact, when we look at it more closely and chip or batter our way into the substance of what it is saying, it is of direct importance to them.</P>
    <P>The second aspect &mdash; and it is an aspect to which I wish to return &mdash; is the interpretation which might possibly be taken out of my reaction to this paragraph.  It might well be said that my reaction to that paragraph is a chauvinistic one, in other words that I am reacting to something from a foreign country which is in some way alien or unintelligible to me, and that consequently I am rejecting it. This leads to one of the important things we must say here and try to keep in our minds.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan used the phrase &ldquo;a fair crack of the whip&rdquo; and there are other phrases which could be used.  What are we getting out of the EEC?  What are we gaining from it?  What comes out in the balance sheet of our relationship with the EEC and with the other countries in the Community?  Are we gaining from it or are we losing from it overall?  These are definitely very valid questions.  The more we concentrate upon that aspect of it, the more we are pushed into a situation in which this becomes a kind of trading operation.  We look at balances and we look at debits and credits, and so forth, and if it were to turn out that in any particular year, or at any particular time when we were under pressure &mdash; as might well be the case now &mdash; we appeared to be losing from it, there would be a valid temptation to say: &ldquo;This is not a success. This is a company which is trading at a loss, or which is not paying its way.  The sooner we get out of it and cut our losses the better&rdquo;.  That is an attitude which many people would have as Senator Lanigan suggested and Senator Ross also took up the point.</P>
    <P>It is important, therefore, without going into deep or too lengthy a historical analysis or treatment of the Community, to remind ourselves of what the Community was.  It was an act of faith basically when we come down to it.  It <Col N="96" /> was an act of faith in a future markedly different from the past which European countries enjoyed.  The genesis of the Community, as we know, was largely in the Second World War, an experience which most of us in this House did not encounter personally due either to age or to geographical location.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless it was an experience of great importance to the mainland countries of Europe in that it brought home to them, and to many important influential people, and to many not so important or influential, the necessity for a new departure, a new approach to the relationship between countries and peoples. The Community was an attempt to cope with the problems which had been created by nationalism.  I differentiate very clearly between nationalism and patriotism. It was an attempt to cope with the fact that, ironically, nationalism had brought about almost the suicide of nations.  It was an attempt to approach the problem of the relationships of countries with something of a more positive and a more constructive nature.  There has always been a certain tendency to regard the Community as a shelter, an escape, a means of defence against a wicked, uncomfortable world.  This approach has often been characterised by the phrase &ldquo;little Europe&rdquo;.  People have even made reference to another concept which preceded it, namely, the concept of Festung Europa.</P>
    <P>It has always seemed to me &mdash; and I can claim to have had an interest in European integration for some time &mdash; that the integration of Europe, the development of the European Community, must not be restricted to Europe.  It must not be seen in a purely European context. It must be seen in a global context.  It must be seen in a context of the global community, of a world characterised by disorder, and not only that but a world which, despite appearances, for a long time has been operated upon and permeated by forces, by organisations, by aspects which ignored national frontiers.</P>
    <P>National frontiers are extremely important in the economic world, but the reality behind the national frontiers has been a world economic community.  It is <Col N="97" /> not organised.  It does not have institutions, or only peripheral, superficial institutions, but it is the reality.  One of the factors we must take into account is that, alone in that Community, even the greatest and the most powerful of nations cannot isolate themselves.  This is a reality with which we have to come to terms and with which the founders of the Community tried to come to terms.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the aspect of the bureaucracy, the aspect of the secondary legislation: one of the decisions or principles taken into account by the founders of the Community was the realisation that international co-operation, or European co-operation, that was founded upon abstract principles or founded upon idealistic and romantic aspirations, had rarely, if ever, worked, and that, for there to be success, the Community that they hoped to see must start with the fundamental economic realities, must start with the practical.  That is why, for example, they started with the European Coal and Steel Community which were the key industries, the key sources of power, the key sources of conflict on mainland Europe.  But that emphasis on practicalities was always balanced or was always set within a context of aspiration of an ideal, of political objectives that went far beyond the details of the practicalities. One of the things that has happened or could have happened in the Community is that those practicalities, upon which the Community was founded, in many cases, have tended to drown, smother, or by-pass the aspirations. In our attitude to the EEC and to the Community we forget that the European Community was an act of faith in a broader future markedly different from and better than the past which brought Europe nearly to disaster.</P>
    <P>I believe that in our approach to the Community we must do what we can to bring back to the people at this time &mdash; particularly in the context of these doubts, this anxiety, this certain cynicism and disillusion with the Community &mdash; the realisation of the fundamental aspirations behind it and also a clearer understanding of the practicalities.  We must find some way of presenting the practicalities <Col N="98" /> in a way which are intelligible, in a way which will show how European co-operation and European integration are realities.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the concept of a little Europe.  It seems to me that the only way eventually we can bring about some kind of order in the affairs of the human race, some kind of basic justice, some kind of democratic order in the affairs of the human race, is by eventually extending to the world community the better aspects of what we in western Europe have tried to do over the last 30 years or so.  That is why I believe in the Community, that is why I believe we must do our best to revive the faith in the Community which our people had in 1972 and 1973. That is why we must back up and support the Minister, the Minister for Agriculture and all the other Ministers who are fighting our corner for us in Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg.  At the same time we must remember that there is something bigger, more important and more fundamental to our long-term interests than the balance sheet which might at a particular time seem to be a little bit in the red.</P>

      <P>The European Community impinges to such an extent on all of our affairs today that the scope of a debate such as this is virtually unlimited.  There were in the the report which we are discussing references to every aspect of our own domestic policy as well as to Community policy and there naturally therefore arose in this debate a large variety of topics, a large number of questions, some of them dealing with broad issues, some of them dealing with particular points but together covering a great deal of ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In replying to the debate I hope that I can manage adequately to advert to the principal points that were raised.  If I fail to do so I ask pardon in advance of Senators for whom I will not provide an answer to some query or point they have raised.  I wish to apologise to the Seanad for the fact that I was not able to be here when the House first discussed this motion on December 17.  I read that <Col N="99" /> debate with great interest and I have listened with interest to the conclusion of the debate today.</P>
    <P>I should like first of all to deal with some of the more general issues that were raised.  One point that was raised by Senator Robinson and echoed by Senator Manning is something that I know has exercised the minds of many Senators. This is that the committee on secondary legislation &mdash; which is, of course, an important part of our whole system of participation in the Community &mdash; remained in abeyance for so long due to the occurrence of a general election.  As was pointed out, this was not just on the occasion of this particular election, it had happened previously.  We can all accept the point that some provision should be made to ensure that it does not happen in the future.  The difficulty is that when the new Parliament assembles, and the full two Houses are finally together, there is so much to be done before the committees can get going properly.  But certainly for a lapse of some six months to have occurred on those two successive occasions in regard to this very important committee is something that we should not allow to occur again.  I am sorry if any delays in my Department contributed to this delay.  It is necessary for the Departments concerned and also for the House to make sure that we can avoid this.</P>
    <P>Other general points about the link between the Community and ourselves were raised by Senator Robinson and Senator Manning.  The suggestion was made that after each Council meeting there might be some form of report to Parliament, I think this might be going a bit too far.  This month alone I have already had two Council meetings and I will have another one next Monday and Tuesday.  I would not like to have to come in three times a month to report on such Council meetings.</P>
    <P>I feel that we might be able to do more in regard to the discussions in this House, however.  We have not done too badly here in the Seanad; we had a debate on neutrality in the context of European Political Co-operation in December and we are now discussing this report.  But, <Col N="100" /> after all, we are discussing this report which was issued in July.  We only started to discuss it in December.  It may well be that we should try to find time when the next report is out to get at it a little more quickly, get down and discuss it while these things are still relevant.</P>
    <P>This brings me to remarks of Senator Lanigan who said one of the things he noticed about the Eighteenth Report is that the problems that were there for solution were the same as in the Seventeenth Report.  This is because they are truthful reports and I think we have got to face the reality.  The probability is that in the Nineteenth Report we will still be talking about the question of unemployment, we will still be talking about the problem of inflation; we will still be talking of trying to find a way to relaunch the Community because these are the things we have been at for years trying to look for solutions.  We have solved some minor problems all right but the big ones have eluded us and I think they will continue to elude us.</P>
    <P>While I am talking about the debate on this report I would like to thank Senator Robinson for the tribute she paid to those who were responsible for compiling the report.  This is a tribute which is well due. I would like to say that if any Senator has any ideas for the improvement of the report I should be very glad to know of them.  What we want to do in the Department is to make this report as useful as possible to Members of the Oireachtas and to anybody else who is concerned with the question of development in the Community and our part there.  I noticed one point which Senator Robinson made, that perhaps there were cases where we could follow through by giving the exact details of the implementation.  She mentioned the particular point of the Irish instrument in regard to wildlife mentioned on page 53 of the report.</P>
    <P>Another general point that was mentioned by several Senators was relations between the members of the European Parliament and the Oireachtas.  Senator Lanigan suggested that members of the European Parliament should be allowed to attend discussions in the Oireachtas, <Col N="101" /> take part in debates and give some account of their stewardship.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning and Senator Ross also raised this and mentioned that they thought it would be a good idea if they were able to attend the Seanad.  I think that the question of the disappearance of the dual mandate, whether that will be rapid or slow, raises this point of relationship in a very acute form.  If we are to reach the position in which our parliamentarians in the European Parliament are not members of the Oireachtas, and few of them are, then I think we must make arrangements.  That is why in setting up the joint committee it was instructed as part of the terms of reference which were passed here in the Seanad to look at this question of the dual mandate.  There was the suggestion that such members might be given right of audience here in the Seanad.  Perhaps this is something that the Constitutional Review Committee could look at.  In talking of possible forms of a new Seanad it might be able to look at whether there should be a particular relationship between the 15 Members of the European Parliament and the Seanad.  This is a matter that could well be studied in the coming months before we come back to this topic again both in the joint committee, the two Houses and possibly in the Constitutional Review Committee.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning mentioned that he thought the Council of Ministers tended to neglect the European Parliament and not pay very much attention to it.  I am happy to be able to tell him that a few months ago the Foreign Ministers &mdash; and the ten Foreign Ministers were present &mdash; met the extended Bureau of the Parliament in Strasbourg.  We had a meeting of several hours during which we discussed the relationship between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament as an institution and made arrangements for meetings to be held in the future so that we could review the relationship.  That gap there has been recognised.  Instead of writing memoranda to one another we have got into the position in which we have come together in one room, probably still in the stage of talking to one another across <Col N="102" /> the room, but we will get around a smaller table eventually and get real co-operation going.</P>
    <P>Senators Manning and Ross both mentioned that there was a real PR job to be done for the Community and for the European Parliament.  This is one of those things that seems to come in phases also.  There is no denying the good public relations work which is done by the very excellent offices of the Community and the Parliament here in Dublin and by the Irish Council of the European Movement. At times they seem to be in full flood so that there is excellent information available and at other times not. Maybe we should ask ourselves whether we avail of these institutions that we have here in Dublin as much as we might.  I would suggest that excellent information is there and perhaps we should take time to go looking for it rather than waiting for it to come to us.  Senator Ross mentioned the bad image.  I hope he was talking of Members of the European Parliament rather than Members of the Council of Ministers when he was talking about junkets to the sun in winter.  I have been to Brussels twice this month already and all I found was that the snow clearance was worse than in Dublin.  My feet got wetter walking the streets there than they did in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell brought up another quite fundamental point.  Picking on a particular paragraph on page 109 of the report he used this to illustrate the difficulties of communication, the semantic problem that we have in a community such as this European Community of ours.  It is not just a problem of translation, a question of changing word for word, or even of trying to parallel concept with concept.  It is our common attempt to try to understand the whole context of the background of thought of our colleagues from other countries.  We may think that the technical problems of trying to operate in six languages are difficult and expensive, but there is the deeper cultural problem of trying to get people from ten countries to think along uniform lines, not just to reach agreed texts but to get a unity of approach, and <Col N="103" /> that fusion which will result ultimately in the creation of a <i>new Europe.</i> This is a problem of immensity far beyond that of the technical problem of translation.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators mentioned the present discussions in regard to the mandate of 30 May, as it is called, which relates to the whole future of the Community. Earlier, Senator Willie Ryan and Senator Staunton were concerned about Ireland's interest in the maintenance of the CAP in the context of these discussions, which are now at a fairly advanced stage.  Indeed, they are at a difficult and a delicate stage.  Senators will be aware of the number and frequency of ministerial meetings which have been held on this topic.  This is a measure of the tenacity with which the views of the various delegations, including our own, are being held.  In spite of the difficulties, I hope that what will emerge from these negotiations will be a balanced package which will reconcile the legitimate &mdash; and I emphasise the legitimate &mdash; interests of all delegations, without undermining the Community's achievements, in particular those concerned with the common agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson reminds us that when we are talking of the problems of the limitation and manner of division of the Community's resources, we are talking of resources that are less than 3 per cent of the gross domestic product of the Community.  She mentioned that what we really should be concerned with here is the political will to go beyond this. Senator Robinson rightly emphasised that we must see the common agricultural policy as part of the <i>acquis communitaire</i>, the common achievement, the common development which was central to the Community when we joined it.  She suggested that perhaps it would be better for us if there were a change in the nature of the support which we in this country received if we moved over to income support rather than price support.  There are certain advantages if we were to follow this line, but there are also disadvantages. If we did follow strongly the line of income support as against price support, we would possibly be turning our <Col N="104" /> faces against the system which would allow our agriculture, which is still relatively undeveloped, to increase its productivity. That would be its main strength, that under the guidance of the common agricultural policy, its productivity would be increased.  Our farmers would then be truly competitive.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned that our farmers have suffered in recent years really serious falls in incomes.  This is true, but let us not forget that one of the reasons for this great loss is something for which we all, as the Irish community, are responsible, namely, the level of our inflation as against the general inflation level of the Community.  This is where we find ourselves in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>Senator Willie Ryan also asked whether, in the present difficult economic situation, we should not consider strict limits on imports from certain non-EEC countries, thereby stimulating a demand for Irish-made goods and creating employment.  He mentioned, in particular, the possible limitation of imports from Japan.  I am sure that Senator Willie Ryan and others will appreciate that the small open economy like ours depends for its livelihood and its recovery from its present difficulties on its ability to export and to maintain exports at a high level. We cannot expect to export if we say that we are not prepared to allow others to export to us.  This is not just true of us as a country, it is true of the Community as a whole that it is highly dependent on exports.  We have a large deficit in our balance of trade with Japan, as has Europe as a whole.  The greatest part of Ireland's imports from Japan consists of motor vehicles, parts for motor vehicles and technical products, many of these for incorporation in further manufacture in Ireland.  I would hope that the efforts of the European Community to achieve an opening of Japanese markets &mdash; and this is being discussed with Japan at the moment &mdash; will in time lead to a better balance in Irish-Japanese trade by increasing our exports rather than by reducing Japanese imports.  There is a further factor that we should not forget. Japanese investment in Ireland is high and is a very postitive factor to be set off, <Col N="105" /> to some extent, against the negative trade balance.  Not only is that investment high but it is an investment in high technology industry which allows us to compete with success on many difficult export markets.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also raised the question of the availability of EEC funds for arterial drainage schemes and for the improvement of roads.  We take every opportunity to press for increased structural aid under FEOGA's guidance system for drainage.  It was mentioned in the introduction to this debate on 17 December last that the July 1981 Council approved an additional £10 million for arterial drainage under the acceleration of drainage works in the west.  This brings the total EEC commitment for arterial drainage purposes to £15 million for the period from January 1979 up to December 1986.  To date almost £8 million has been spent on the <i>Corrib-Mask-Robe</i> scheme and £3.5 million of this has so far been recouped from FEOGA.  Senator Willie Ryan raised the particular point as regards the River Suir.  I am sorry that I do not have the answer for that.  I suggest he go to the horse's mouth, the Office of Public Works, who determine the priority for arterial drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>On the question of EEC funds for the improvement of roads, the annual Irish quota of aid received from the regional fund for roads is a fixed percentage of just under 6 per cent.  We have consistently over the years pressed for an increase in the resources allocated to the regional fund which would give more money to be spent on infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan asked this evening in regard to the provision of regional fund money for houses.  My understanding is that in fact housing is not regularly supported out of the fund although houses for miners can be supported under the Coal and Steel Treaty and we have indeed received some money in this regard for the Arigna area.  When the money can be got we have managed to get it.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton spoke the last day on the size of the regional fund and the lack of development of a comprehensive Community regional policy.  It is a fact that Ireland, Greece and the Mezzogiorno <Col N="106" /> area of Southern Italy are the poorest and least developed regions of the Community and that the income disparities between these areas and the richer areas of the Community have widened since our entry.  Here is a very real difficulty.  The Community proclaims that it aims at convergence and, rather than convergence we have in fact seen divergence. In our case there are some reasons for this.  For most of that period our national income per head has grown at or above the Community average.  But also through those years our population, and in particular our dependent population, the young and the old, has grown even more rapidly.  So we have difficulties not only of development but of demography that have hindered us during those years.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is sometimes made that if we designated only the west for regional fund purposes then we would manage to get more money for these areas which definitely need this structural support more than anywhere else.  In fact, the division of most of the quota of money under the regional fund is based on population.  We gain in regard to our share of the regional fund by having the whole population of Ireland included in the sum which has to be got.  If we were to say that only the west was a special area for regional purposes it would have a very severe impact on our share of the fund.  The regional fund is used to increase the resources of our capital programme. It is for us, then, within that programme to establish our own regional policy and to give particular attention to the designated areas, which are largely in the western part of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the specific query in regard to some figures on page 63 of the report where there was only £6 million being received where some £30 million had in fact been approved.  These grants are largely for infrastructure.  Anyone who is a member of a local authority knows the many years it takes to discuss, to plan, to approve and finally to construct many of these public works.  As I understand it, this is why these figures appeared in this particular way.  If we were to see this happen on a static fund year after year, we would think that the <Col N="107" /> figures were seriously wrong.  I hope they will be closer when we come to examine the next report.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised the point, in regard to the social fund, that it would be informative and helpful if Members of the Oireachtas and the public could have made available to them the information which is contained in the reports which we make to the Community in regard to our compliance with Community directives and decisions.  She mentioned in particular measures to control discrimination. This is something I will certainly undertake to look into and see whether this can be done.</P>
    <P>On an issue closely related to social policy, Senator O'Connell spoke this evening of education policy, and he was rather critical of the Community's work in regard to the academic recognition of diplomas.  But he almost excused them when he went on to say how difficult and what a tremendously complex job this is, that it was just a matter of an EEC comparison. Perhaps this is an area in which the Community could do more.  If we look at any area we can say the Community should have been able to do more.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell spoke also of the European University institute in Florence and seemed to suggest that this is only a gesture, only part of the gravy train.  I would like to assure him it is much more than this.  The European university has been established now for five or six years.  It is an on-going institution.  It is an institution which is devoted towards co-operation in Europe.  Its staff and its students are extremely carefully chosen. It is aimed at the diffusion of ideas throughout Europe.  Even the staff are not allowed more than a limited amount of time so that as many fresh ideas as possible be brought into this academic body.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken about the question of convergence.  I would just like to mention here the point made by Senator Murphy on the last occasion.  As I mentioned already, we have to be frank.  The Treaty objective of convergence of the EEC economy is not being achieved. <Col N="108" /> Nonetheless Europe is still a valid ideal in a world that has become interdependent, and I refer to the particular point that Senator Murphy made about the difficulties of controlling interest rates.  It is a point which was echoed by Senator Ross this evening when he talked about the significance and the relative success of the EMS.  Greater economic and monetary co-ordination between countries can reduce sensitivity to external monetary changes.  This is something we are constantly striving for within the Community.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson turned to another area and mentioned that we were in danger of being hauled before the European Court in regard to a directive on company law.  This is so.  It may not be a very good plea but we are not the only ones outstanding in this regard &mdash; we are, in fact, one of six.  And why is it that six of the ten have not found themselves able to meet the time schedule?  There have been about seven directives in regard to company law.  Some of these have been adopted.  They are all highly technical. They require a very careful consideration, and in many cases require legislation, and we have found it very difficult to complete this examination and to draft the legislation within the time schedule. Some of the difficulty is reflected by something that Senator Lanigan said about the same directive on company law.  The Senator was not worried that we had not brought them in long ago.  He said he never wanted to see them enforced at all because he thought of the dangers of these proposals to our small companies and people operating on a small scale.  The criticism which Senator Lanigan made of these directives is an indication of how careful we must be in looking at these from the point of view of our own position.  We were supposed to implement this directive on company law before December 1978, so we are three years overdue.  I hope the work will be completed soon.</P>
    <P>There was some reference to the accessions of new member states.  Senator Manning welcomed the accession of Greece and expressed some concern about the effects if the newly elected <Col N="109" /> Government of Greece were to withdraw from the Community or were the discussion of this topic to interfere with the work of the Community.  We would like to see Greece remain a member of the Community, but the entry of Greece has made things more difficult for every one of the other nine.  The entry of Spain and Portugal will make things more difficult for every one of the ten.  There is a new adjustment to go on and a new equilibrium has to be found.  As happened on the accession of Greece, the percentage of Community funds received by us was naturally reduced.  When Spain and Portugal enter the same will happen again. Whether this percentage reduction will constitute a decrease in actual funds will depend on the growth of the Community's own resources and the decisions taken by the Community in regard to their use.  We are pressing for an increase in the 1 per cent VAT limit which Senator Robinson mentioned today and we have a voice in the use of the resources, whether under that 1 per cent limit or after it being raised.  We will defend our interest and have consistently been pressing for increases in Community resources to take account of the effects of enlargement.</P>
    <P>I turn now from economic matters, which are governed almost entirely by the Treaties, to the questions of European Political Co-operation which lie outside the Treaty frameworks.  These were touched on by a number of Senators in this debate.  Senator Robinson mentioned the question of neutrality in the debate held here on 2 December last and the Senator also mentioned the seminar on European Political Co-operation which was held by the International Affairs Committee of the Royal Irish Academy, also, I think, in December. The Senator said that this RIA seminar had given a clearer view of the problem of neutrality and she asked me if I would in my reply repeat these clarifications.  It is getting rather late and I do not think I will repeat them now.  I will refer Senator Robinson to her own references, to the debate of 2 December 1981 in this House and to the papers that were presented at the Royal Irish Academy.  These will be <Col N="110" /> published in due course and I am sure that Senators who are interested would in the meantime be able to get copies of the papers presented from the secretary of the International Affairs Committee of the academy.  I think that, rather than go into a long discussion now, it is preferable to do this.  Neutrality discussions seem to come up at regular intervals of about three weeks.  There was one occasion when a radio interviewer said: &ldquo;I know, Minister, that you did this interview on neutrality three weeks ago but would you mind doing it again?&rdquo; So I would be grateful if I could be forgiven this evening.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning characterised European Political Co-operation as a success and I agree with him.  He also characterised it as a matter that needs careful handling.  I certainly agree with him.  It is a delicate area and we must operate skillfully in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the actual items of European Political Co-operation Senator Lanigan raised here the question of Poland.  He was very critical of the Community.  He said that they had done nothing for Poland and that the only country with an expressed view was Germany which was worried about the debts of the Polish people. Both of those charges are unfair and I think both of them are wrong.  We in the Community among the Ten have been considering the question of Poland with great care.  If we wish to concentrate on only taking actions that will not damage the interests of the Polish people, that will not damage Europe as a whole, then we must be very careful indeed.  The situation in Poland continues to be a major preoccupation of the European Community member states.  The response of the Ten to the imposition of martial law and subsequent developments is being closely co-ordinated within the EPC and the Community framework.  Members of the House will already be familiar with the statement issued by the Foreign Ministers of the Ten on 15 December.  It was quoted in this House when we had a short debate on Poland on the last sitting day before Christmas.  Subsequently, on 4 January, the Foreign Ministers met in special session to discuss the Polish problem <Col N="111" /> in all its aspects and agreed on a detailed communique which called for the release of those interned, the suspension of martial law and a resumption of the dialogue under which Poland had been moving forward.</P>
    <P>I reported on this meeting of 4 January to my Cabinet colleagues on the following day and the Government issued a statement condemning the repression of human rights in Poland and reiterating the main element of the communique of the Ten.  Intensive contacts are continuing among the Ten in order to ensure a full exchange of information and the working out and implementation of a common approach to the Polish situation. The Foreign Ministers of the Ten have agreed that they will travel to the opening of the Madrid Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in order to make statements on the Polish situation at that conference which, of course, is part of the follow-up to the Helsinki process.  We agree this is something we should do in order that we shall, in front of all the countries of Europe who will be present, countries of eastern Europe, the neutrals and the nonaligned, make clear to them our serious concern regarding the polish situation.</P>
    <P>Exactly how events will develop in poland in the coming weeks and months is by no means clear.  We have indicated in our communique that we look forward to the removal of those measures which were taken in December and to the resumption of a general dialogue between the Polish Government and Solidarity and the Church in Poland.  We shall continue to press these appeals on the Polish authorities in the most effective ways open to us.  These will include the discussions which we will have in preparation for the Madrid meeting where the President of the Council will speak on our behalf and each of us will follow up with our own contribution.  We will continue also the discussions within the United Nations and its specialised agencies.  We will, as time goes on, consider whether other measures would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Middle East was raised also.  Senator <Col N="112" /> Murphy raised particularly the question of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation and the possibility of this organisation setting up an office in Dublin.  We are not aware of a PLO intention to open an office in Dublin. With regard to our attitude to the PLO, we support the Venice Declaration of the Ten which is based on security in the Middle East for all States including Israel and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination in the context of a comprehensive peace settlement.  We recognise the PLO as a representative body of the Palestinian people but not necessarily the only representative body of all the Palestinian people.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned the multilateral force on the Sinai in which four countries who are members of the Ten are contributing towards this peace-keeping operation for the evacuation of the Sinai area in accordance with the Camp David Agreement.  When we spoke on neutrality on 2 December Senator Lanigan was critical of that force at that time. I indicated in my reply on that occasion the reasons why we as one of the Ten had no objection to some of our colleagues engaging in such a peace-keeping operation.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan talked also of the Golan Heights in this context but this is a separate issue.  The matter of the Golan Heights is being discussed at the United Nations at the moment.  We condemn the attempts of the Israeli Government to legitimise the <i>de facto</i> occupation of the Golan Heights.  Our attitude was made absolutely clear in the United Nations. Senator Lanigan further criticised the holding by the Council of Europe of a meeting in Jerusalem.  All I can say on that is that we have a lot to look after in the Council of Ministers but we will leave the Council of Europe to look after itself, it is not our concern.</P>
    <P>The question of trade relations with South Africa was also raised.  I appreciate the concern expressed on this issue.  I would like to explain to the Senators who raised this on the occasion of the last debate that it is Government policy not to encourage trade between Ireland and South Africa.  Irish semi-State bodies do <Col N="113" /> not maintain offices in South Africa.  So far as the European Community is concerned, a substantial level of trade between certain member states and South Africa undoubtedly does exist. However, the Ten have undertaken to consider how the collective weight of the European Community can be used in order to influence South Africa to abandon the apartheid system.  We, for our part, will continue to press for firm action to this end.  The Community and the member states are naturally concerned to continue to foster relations with other African states in the framework of the Lomé Convention and with States such as Angola and Mozambique which do not currently adhere to Lomé but which may nevertheless be eligible for benefit to some extent from Community assistance. We have supported the giving of such assistance.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to turn to a point raised by Senator Robinson.  She made reference to the Genscher-Colombo initiative, the so-called European Act, and she asked what is the nature of this Act. To that I give a simple answer: I do not know.  One of the questions we have to discuss and one of the questions that is being discussed at official level, I think today, is the question of what is the nature of this European Act.  Is it a political <Col N="114" /> instrument?  Is it a legal instrument? To what extent is it treaty, to what extent is it not treaty?  I made reference to this Genscher-Colombo initiative on 2 December and there have been no developments since.  I have nothing else to add.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for the debate that took place on 17 December and again here this evening.  It is good for us that we should have this report and that we should take it seriously in the way in which the Seanad has taken it on these two days.  I hope I have answered most of the points raised.  We have taken note of the points raised by Senators and we will look into them.  There is no need to wait for the six-monthly debate in the House here in regard to the working of the Community.  If at any time Senators wish for information about our attitude to any Community matter or about what the developments have been in regard to any Community matters, I and the officials of my Department will be only too happy to provide any information which we have.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 20 January 1982.</P>
