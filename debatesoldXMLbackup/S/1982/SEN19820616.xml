      <P>I have notice from Senator Denis Cregan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The publication in the media, for the benefit of tenants, of the details of the provisions of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellintgs) Act, 1982.</P>
      <P>I regard this matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, in that order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the Order of Business as being unsatisfactory and inadequate.  There are at least eight or nine motions on the Order Paper, two of them surviving from the last Seanad, several of them highly significant, and we are making miserably slow progress.  This is the fourth meeting of the Seanad in the present session and we have not even begun to discuss a single motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the agreement indicated by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, <Col N="288" /> the transaction of Seanad business at the moment depends on the availability of Government business, and last week the Leader of the House used this reason precisely for our not meeting between 19 May and 9 June.  Senator Eoin Ryan overlooked the fact that the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1981 had gone through all Stages in the Dáil by 26 May.  So, even given our present restricted arrangements, we should have met on 2 June.</P>
    <P>When Senator Ryan presents us today with a patently inadequate Order of Business we know that it is not really his fault personally, because he declared his desire on numerous occasions that the Seanad should be taken seriously and he expressed this no later than the initial sitting of this session on 13 May.  But much as we respect his sincerity, his declarations of intent can no longer be taken seriously in the light of the emphatic assertion at Question Time in the Dáil last week of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment when he said that the Government are totally satisfied with the Seanad system as it is, that they have no intention of reviewing its constitution and procedure.</P>
    <P>In the light of this complacent, if not cynical perception by the Government of the role of the Seanad in Parliament, it behoves us to wake up and to decide that if the Government have no intention of reforming this House, the present state of which is a matter for continual comment by public commentators, then it is time for us to decide that we will do our bit to reform this House.</P>
    <P>So for starters I propose that in addition to the suggested Order of Business we add No. 14 which is standing in the names of Senator Shane Ross and myself and which asks &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann is of the opinion that the powers and functions of the Seanad and the methods of election of its members are in need of urgent review&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Murphy has said and I second his proposal that we add that to the Order of Business. I am beginning to feel very frustrated, as are a large number of my constituents, <Col N="289" /> because they feel, rightly or wrongly, that the Government are ducking debating motions in the House here.  There are several motions, including No. 14, which are matters of great public interest, including a motion in my name on extradition which should be debated before the summer recess.  A Fine Gael motion was ordered last week, which is supposed to be taken today, on agriculture.  It appears that there was no time for this to be taken.  I have no guarantee that there will be time for it to be taken this week &mdash; it is the last thing on the Order of Business which means that we are going to have to put off all other motions until another time.</P>
      <P>On the whole matter of Seanad reform, I do not know whether the Government feel that this is a perfect House, but I have found from a statement in the Dáil last week that they have no intention of making any amendments to the procedures of this House and that they have no intention of actually looking at the procedures and the methods by which this House operates.  It is very depressing indeed because there are all sorts of improvements which could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree to include motion No. 14 this afternoon.  We have included a motion for today and if we conclude that we will be taking another <Col N="290" /> motion at the next sitting.  That is the procedure that has been operated in this House for many years past.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to what was said in the other House.  The procedure in this House is a matter for this House: anything to do with procedure and privileges is a matter for this House, though initially for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges are sitting this afternoon and, among other things, will be considering the question of when motions should be taken.  The committee should be allowed to deliberate on this question and to report to the House.  If the House is not satisfied with the conclusions and recommendations of the committee then, of course, the House will be free to make its views clear.  For the moment it would be departing very far from the practice of this House to attempt to take two motions on one day.  In these circumstances, and particularly in view of the fact that the committee are meeting this afternoon, I would ask the House not to agree to this amendment of the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first opportunity to congratulate your good self on your elevation to the very prestigious position of Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>In relation to item No. 1, I would like to welcome the setting up of the committee and to say a few words in relation to the responsibilities which I feel fall on those Members who are selected to act on that committee.  At this time, whether it is State-sponsored bodies or private companies, it is essential that the greatest possible emphasis be placed on the necessity, on the one hand, to ensure in this instance the highest possible standard of public accountability and, on the other hand, to be able to differentiate between State-sponsored companies that are there purely for commercial reasons and those that are there to provide social services. This comes to mind particularly in relation to a number of the companies referred to in Schedule A.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to go through the entire list.  I am sure other Members will wish to do so.  I will refer to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It is a very important body and has a very important function particularly in these times of depression.  It is essential that Senators, when considering the report in relation to that body have due regard to the fact that it is the ACC which will provide finance for that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another one I will mention, and it should be borne in mind by the committee, is Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna is a very healthy company and has been healthy for a number of years, but there are a number of things which should be brought to their attention.  It applies particularly in my own county where over the last number of years it has become almost impossible to obtain domestic supplies in winter of fuel produced by that firm.  It is unfortunate in these times <Col N="297" /> when energy plays a very important part in all our lives that this should occur.  I would ask the members of the committee, when reviewing the activities of that company, to bear in mind the necessity to impress upon the board that we should at least be able to provide for our national consumption in that area.  Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann is another semi-State body which has been in the news very much in the past.  I contend that that company provide a degree of a social service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the concurrence of this House is required in relation to the setting up of the committee I feel, as the previous speaker has suggested, that if we do not at this stage have some input as to how the committee goes about its job it will be too late for us to have any realistic input at a later stage.  I do not propose to delay the business of the House but I think, as already said, that it is relevant.</P>
      <P>I was speaking in relation to Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann, which firm has been in the news quite recently.  It is also an area where careful account will have to be taken of the social element of the firm concerned in that the part of the country that gets most benefit from the activities of the firm.  It can be argued that it provides a valuable social service. An assessment purely on an economic or accountancy basis would not to my mind be fair in all cases in relation to Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other company is the Industrial Credit Company.  I specifically ask that the members of the committee take very careful account of the activities of this company with particular reference to ensuring that every possible opportunity to assist investment and industrial growth is taken advantage of because at this time <Col N="299" /> industry generally in the country is somewhat under siege.  There is a grave danger that confidence may be shaken in the ability of various companies, and particularly this one, to provide the wherewithal for the country to maintain a reasonable number of jobs in the years ahead.  By a reasonable number I mean be able to provide more jobs than we have been losing and hence ensure that young people leaving our schools each year at least have reasonable prospects of a future.</P>
    <P>Particular reference should be made, in relation to that company, to the provision of finance for small industries and craft industries.  Because of the increasing number of firms who have closed in the recent past it is absolutely vital that we make provision immediately for the return of some of those jobs.  Every possible avenue must be explored and every source utilised and the Industrial Credit Company is the company that has the wherewithal to do that.  I particularly ask that the committee in examining the activities of that company ensures that no opportunities are lost to increase investment and to provide jobs.</P>
    <P>The Irish Gas Board is another company which again relates to energy.  In these times of rising costs in the energy area we are very aware of the necessity to ensure that that company functions satisfactorily and the members of the committee, I am sure, will be more than capable of ensuring that.</P>
    <P>The Irish Life Assurance Company is another company which I feel must also be examined carefully.  One thing that has come to mind and which has oft been repeated to those of us in public life is that assurance companies generally do not have a cash flow problem.  That is resolved by way of premiums and so on. They appear to have a surplus of finances which they can invest in many areas.  I refer to what I said in relation to the previous company, that it is absolutely essential that whatever surplus finances this company has be channelled in a direction which will bring about as soon as possible a reduction in the number of <Col N="300" /> people unemployed or an increase in the number of people in employment.</P>

      <P>The last company to which I will refer is the Irish National Stud Company and that has particular reference to my own county of Kildare. There have been a number of articles in the press of late wherein it was felt that that firm was suffering from financial strangulation, and those were the words used.  I ask that some effort be made to impress upon the members of the board and also on the people who are dealing directly with the Department of Finance to ensure that whenever a plea for finance emanates from that company it will be dealt with expeditiously so that the firm can continue to operate as it should.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the views of the previous speaker.  This is a very important committee.  We are investigating not alone business enterprises but possibly the whole ideology of the involvement of the State bodies in industry.  Certainly we cannot underestimate the role that they have played up to now.  That does not mean that they should be above criticism or that their management and the schemes in which they have become involved should not be open to the most severe scrutiny of this House.  Many of us have first-hand experience of the various State bodies and we should all have an input, to advise <Col N="301" /> from a layman's point of view how best they can serve the people.  I do not want to go into detail about any of the particular companies.  Generally, we must view very strictly the granting of unlimited funds to the various semi-State enterprises. Regardless of the employment content that is involved we must also look for efficiency and make sure that the taxpayers' money is spent efficiently.  The committee should have that as a broad outline.</P>

      <P>It may surprise Senator Crowley to hear that I agree fully with what he has said.  The State-sponsored bodies in this country are in part a reflection of this State.  They are a unique feature of the State as it has developed but that is no reason why, as he has said, we should give them their head without a constant, critical appraisal of their activities. I am aware that the composition of joint committees is jealously scrutinised and that the party composition both in the Dáil and Seanad is vigilantly watched. May I suggest that when this committee comes to be constituted that four Members of the Seanad may, perhaps, include one from the Independent section?  I know that our numbers do not warrant this but I suggest that our commitment does.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMallon" hpid="Mr. Mallon Mr. Mallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity of congratulating you on your appointment to the position of Cathaoirleach. This is my first opportunity to thank the Members of this House for the welcome which they gave to myself and to my fellow-Senator from the North of Ireland and to put on record the fact that I regard it as a very great honour and, indeed, as more than an honour, as something that will be of value both in our deliberations in the North of Ireland and hopefully in deliberations within this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to thank Senator Durkan for establishing a certain amount of poetic licence in relation to this first item in so far as I would regard it as something which has very important aspects in relation to State bodies as they relate to the <Col N="302" /> North of Ireland.  Indeed, it has been very heartening coming from an area of very, very substantial unemployment to see the way in which a certain amount of hope has been given in relation to State bodies in the South of Ireland in their communications with Harland and Wolff and with Mackies.  I would ask that in this committee consideration be given to that type of development.  I think of Bord na Móna, the aeronautical industry, the heavy industry in the South especially and the way in which it can help economically in integration in this island which must surely be the desire of all of us.  I would like to take this opportunity of asking that that be kept very much in mind during the deliberations of this body.</P>
    <P>Two other items come to mind.  First of all, there is the gas industry which was referred to by Senator Durkan.  It seems to me that the relationship in that area between Government here and the North of Ireland is something which would be of enormous benefit not just in terms of the gas which would be supplied, hopefully, to the North of Ireland, but in the social and political effects, because it would be an unspoken indication of the consideration that exists within the southern part of this island for the problems in the North.  I would like to see that and, indeed, the transfer of electricity from the North of Ireland proceeding as rapidly as possible.  I know that is straining it a little but it comes under the heading of semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to Irish Life and to development by insurance companies. It is a matter of great pride to see the way in which a company such as this has developed in Holland, the USA and in the Far East.  Would it be too much to ask for a city like Belfast, which has been deemed by the EEC, along with Naples, to be an area of special consideration and special deprivation and poverty, that some of that cashflow could find its way into the construction of buildings in Belfast which are very much needed, and also in places such as Derry, Newry and Strabane?  It would be psychologically very important if we were to see that type <Col N="303" /> of money flowing into construction in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are two other points to which I would like to refer.  We had, as I am sure other Senators have had, communications from the Trades Council in the North of Ireland in relation to free transport for senior citizens from the North of Ireland who travel in the South.  That communication was delivered from a Mr. Joe Cooper of the Trades Council in Belfast. Would it not be a nice gesture in practical terms if senior citizens, old age pensioners, people over the age of 65 from the North of Ireland, were able to avail of the free transport which exists within the South of Ireland?  I think it would be a very positive gesture.  It is something which would be much appreciated and indeed it would be the type of thing that we should be looking at in these committees to see how in those practical ways we can blur the edges of the divisions that exist within this country.</P>
    <P>Finally, I see Aer Lingus is one of the semi-State companies listed here.  I find it rather strange when I come to Dublin Airport to see an Irish company advertising flights to Londonderry.  I wonder would it be too much if that Irish company would fly their aeroplanes to Derry?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Member who is indeed very deeply committed to the committee system in the administration and the carrying out of our work in the Houses of the Oireachtas, I warmly welcome the reconstituting of this joint committee. I regret that we do not have the Minister present but perhaps the Leader of the House who moved the motion may be able to answer a few questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that this joint committee is one of the more important organs of the Oireachtas.  It is something which should have been more fully developed in years past.  I am surprised and a little disappointed that only one-fifth or one-sixth of the total number of State-sponsored bodies are included in the first and second schedules to this motion.  I think that all of these State-sponsored bodies should be subject to <Col N="304" /> the critical eye of the members of the joint committee of these Houses.  I believe that the Houses of the Oireachtas should have not only access to and an opportunity to discuss the annual reports of all our semi-State bodies but should also have the opportunity of reviewing their policy and their development.  One must remember that the State has tremendous control over such a great percentage of the economic activity of the State and that is the reason I think there should be more public accountability.  I do not doubt that the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Oireachtas are doing an excellent job, but nevertheless I think there should be public scrutiny of the affairs of these public bodies who were founded by Acts of the Oireachtas and set up with the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>I hope that it will be possible for the appropriate Minister to add significantly to the schedule of the motion to include all the companies.  I do not suggest that it would be possible for the joint committee to have an in-depth review of the work of all the companies in the one quarter or the one-half year but nevertheless it is a job that should be done because we must get development going. We must be able to see, in advance as it were, where these developments need extra input or extra capitalisation.  It was too bad, as happened in the past couple of years, when a few of our larger State companies found that their machinery was almost obsolete and that they needed huge cash inputs which were almost outside the resources of the State.  If there was an on-going review Ministers for Finance might be encouraged by the joint committee to re-finance some of these bodies before the problem becomes too acute.</P>
    <P>The last speaker made a point about the possibility of extending the free transport schemes to senior citizens from the northern counties.  I recall that the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, had such a proposal but I cannot recall if it was implemented. It was an excellent idea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity to endorse what Senator Mallon has said.  Having regard at this <Col N="305" /> time to the social conditions of Northern Ireland as well as the rest of this island, all semi-State bodies should be encouraged to have a sub-committee or have a special interest to see how it would be possible to liaise with what is going on in Northern Ireland and to see how they and similar bodies in Northern Ireland might gain from each other.  I will take my own profession as one example.  If the house officers of this country &mdash; the newly qualified graduates who are responsible to the Department of Health in the North and to Comhairle na nOspidéal in the Republic &mdash; had an exchange scheme much could be done to break many of the shibboleths we have suffered from for so long.  These house officers meet about 5,000 people during the year when they serve their hospitals and about 20,000 people indirectly.</P>
      <P>There is a great need in Ireland to consider what we are going to do with the time that will become available as employment in the traditional sense becomes less and less.  I ask the committee to consider, much more imaginatively, ideas that the semi-State bodies might explore with a view to involving not only the operatives and the institutions but also the consumer.  We need to re-think industrially in terms not so much of decentralisation, which is giving from the centre as little as possible to keep the natives happy on the periphery, but in terms of autonomy, giving back to the communities much greater say in how they will order their affairs so that they in turn can put pressure on semi-State bodies to meet needs defined by the people rather than to have those needs dictated centrally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, I would like to endorse what has already been said about the old age pensioners and Mr. Joe Cooper of the Trades Council in Belfast who has appealed that this consideration should be given.  There is a need to co-ordinate what is happening in both parts of the country.  There is a need to consider the question of how decisions are taken. There is a need to involve the consumer as well as the operative and the institutions. I hope that the joint committee will introduce some new thinking in all these <Col N="306" /> areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief because many of the points I wished to make have been made by other speakers. Consideration should be given to the changes new technology will bring about and to the work structures that should change to accommodate such developments. For instance, State and semi-State bodies should be the first to offer us models with regard to flexi-time, perhaps even &mdash; I know I am entering into a very muddy pool &mdash; work-sharing.  This whole area has to open up and I expect the State and semi-State bodies to set an example.</P>
      <P>I hope it will come within the terms of reference of this committee that they look, for instance, at the membership of the boards of State and semi-State bodies. It is quite appalling in 1982, despite ten years of working towards equality and even having equality legislation, that it is not reflected at all in the membership of such boards.  The contributions of women in particular areas are not reflected on such bodies.  I see it as a total deprivation and impoverishment of the whole State and semi-State system and some of the unfortunate results of that can be seen by perhaps not having a more balanced contribution.  I would also like to endorse what Senator Robb said, that not alone should there be equal representation of males and females but also the point he made regarding rural and urban representation.  I hope this will be taken into consideration by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few comments on this motion and on the importance of the committee which is described therein.  I have spoken on this before.  I believe that our State-sponsored bodies deserve our fullest attention in a benevolent sense.  The work that the committee have done over the past years under Senator Ryan has been extremely important. It was done in a constructive spirit and it is very important that it should be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, I hope that when the committee are set up there will be Independent representation on the committee. <Col N="307" /> There are among the Independent Members people who could give their time and would put a great deal of work into such a committee.  A great deal of work is needed if the Committee are to function properly.  To paraphrase Senator Robb in one of his many erudite pieces to the press, economic development is too important to be left to the economists.  Having regard to the role that State-sponsored bodies play in our whole life it is important these bodies should be examined from every angle. Ultimately the politicians have to make decisions which will affect the organisation and the running of these bodies.  This is a very important committee.  I hope Senator Ryan will see his way to giving the Independents representation on this committee when they are set up.  I fully support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with a few points that were raised.  I must accept responsibility for the fact that there was not a Minister present.  The Minister concerned asked me if it was necessary to be present and I took the view that it was not necessary, but perhaps I was wrong in that.  What is before the House is simply whether the House considers that this joint committee should be set up.  I took the view that that was entirely a matter for the Members of the House and that the Minister had no particular function to play.  If I was wrong in that, I apologise.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald regretted that there were not more State-sponsored bodies on the list.  On the last occasion, and on this occasion, it is confined to State-sponsored bodies engaged in trading or commercial activities, and that is a definition.  All bodies which are engaged in trading or commercial activities are included in the list.  That is what distinguishes them from those who are not on the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that a case could be made for examining other State-sponsored bodies as well.  But if we are to do this it should be done by a separate committee because I do not think any committee could possibly examine all the <Col N="308" /> State-sponsored bodies even if the House were to last for a full five years.  On the last occasion we managed to examine 20 out of the 25 bodies.  That was a very hard-working joint committee.  It was not possible to get to the end even of the 25 who are on the list.  There are something like 100 State-sponsored bodies altogether. So there is no possibility of one joint committee dealing with all of them. That is one good reason for confining the work of a joint committee to the ones which are on the list.</P>
    <P>In that respect I would like to say that it is a small committee and one reason why we got through so much work was that it was a small committee.  On the other hand, it meant that there was no possiblity at all of the work being done unless the members were very committed and turned up at practically every meeting.  I would urge the various groups when they are putting forward members for this joint committee to put forward people who will be prepared to work very hard and to attend virtually every meeting because otherwise the joint committee just cannot carry on.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points made by Senators Mallon and Robb about the joint committee having regard to possible liaison and so on with the North, certainly the last committee had regard to this, perhaps not in respect of every State-sponsored body but certainly in respect of any State-sponsored body which appeared to have any possibility of liaison with the North.  That was dealt with on many occasions and I have no doubt that the incoming joint committee will also approach the work of the State-sponsored bodies from that point of view as well as the point of view of this part of the country.</P>

      <P>I presume there will be a Minister present for this debate.  I <Col N="316" /> should like to make a few comments on this Bill which I welcome.  There is no doubt that we need to make stringent efforts to conserve our environment right across the country.  The only doubt I have is in regard to whether this is going to be another piece of legislation that will be left unenforced right across the country. When I see additional powers being given to local authorities I look fairly seriously at the powers the same local authorities acquired over the last couple of years.  I am thinking of the Anti-Pollution Act and the Occasional Trading Act.  Neither of those Acts is being adequately enforced throughout this country.</P>
      <P>As one travels along some roads one is ashamed to see these occasional traders either selling from barrels or selling from ordinary stalls and one never sees the licences they are supposed to display. They have music playing which contravenes another Act as well.  I hope that local authorities will be financed by the appropriate Department to carry out their functions.  Indeed, in the Litter Bill there are some costly items for which money will have to be found.  I hope the Minister will give the House an indication of how it is proposed to finance the additional responsibilities that local authorities will be asked to undertake.  For instance, there is the introduction of litter wardens and the entire scheme that goes with them.  Indeed, the provisions of section 2 will increase the costs of the local authorities who are at present working on very strained budgets right across the country.  Will they have the finance to implement this Bill when enacted by both Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the anti-pollution legislation nor the Occasional Trading Act is being implemented in many parts of the country at present.  As a matter of fact, the menace would appear to be growing. These go hand in hand because where occasional trading is carried on, the hallmark is certainly pollution and litter; places are usually left in a dreadful state. I very much regret that no effort has been made to improve the situation.  In all market towns you have people in the private sector, the small shopkeepers, trying to carry on a trade with ever-increasing <Col N="317" /> overheads and these occasional traders come in and take a fair slice of the spending power in an area and thumb their noses at the law.  Even after last year's legislation on which we spent hours here last summer, there is no sign of a check on these people.  They, I presume, are trading without the disability of having to pay either VAT or tax and obviously have no licences either.</P>
    <P>I hope that this legislation will be taken seriously because we certainly need it across the country.  In recent years local authorities have put on a comprehensive and fairly good service in most counties. Practically every hamlet or village has at least a weekly refuse collection which is of great benefit.  It is such a shame to find our sylvan settings and pastoral scenes marred by discarded plastic and tin cans and bottles.  Tough measures must be taken.  Something can also be done through our educational system.  There must be something seriously wrong with the civics curriculum in our schools when it obviously has no effect on the youth of the country.  If one goes through any town, especially on Sunday mornings one will find that in the vicinity of every fast food outlet one is almost ankle deep in litter.  The educational system could make a contribution here.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  There is much that will require greater elucidation on Committee Stage.  I would like the Minister to guarantee that councils will be given the extra finance to ensure that this Bill when it becomes an Act will be implemented. I would like to know what steps will be taken to ensure that it is not left lying on the shelf and ignored by all.  It is absolutely useless having legislation in a democracy unless the public respect the legislation and make a genuine effort.  In regard to the vast majority of our people it is not necessary to have such legislation because they have a pride and joy and respect for both private and public property. There is a small percentage of thoughtless persons for whom unfortunately we have to have this legislation, and that legislation will have to be made tougher so that the penalties will sting and people will know that they have offended against the public decency.  I <Col N="318" /> wish the Minister success with this Bill and hope he will indicate how finance will be made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill because previous speakers have covered it fairly well.  But coming in here today my attention was drawn to something that is worth mentioning.  The area around this House could be regarded as probably the most important part of the city of Dublin.  We have some very fine buildings here, this one in particular, and a number of others in Merrion Street, Kildare Street and Merrion Square.  If one walks over to Merrion Square one will see plates on a number of houses where famous people were either born or lived during their time.  I would imagine when tourists come to this country from outside that this is one of the first parts of the city that they come to.  I am very disappointed to have to say that it is, like many other parts of the city, sadly neglected.</P>
      <P>Across the road we have a park.  I do not know who is responsible for the park, the Board of Works or the Corporation. But that park is definitely a credit to whoever is in charge.  It was not always like that.  I can remember a time when it was overgrown with weeds.  But in recent years that park has been considerably inproved.  I have to stop there as far as praise in concerned.  It is often said that &ldquo;you judge the book by the cover.&rdquo;  One could not judge that park by the cover, because if one walks around the park on the outside it is a disgrace.  First of all there is a footpath there which is completely broken up and is even worse than a mountain trail.  On that roadway there is an abandoned car which has been there for about two months.  When I first noticed that car it was in good condition. But every day some little thing was gone from the car.  Today I noticed that there is only one wheel, and probably tomorrow there will be none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why whoever is responsible for the upkeep of the city should leave a car like that there all this time.  Friends of mine have complained that they have parked their cars, perhaps in an area where they should not have <Col N="319" /> parked, and when they came back the car was gone; it was not stolen but it was taken away by the Corporation.  It is a mystery to me why that car cannot be taken away.  Around the country and in Dublin there are piles of crocks of cars. We must remember that they all started with one car.  If that one car was removed when it was dumped, that dump might not be there today.  I say this in the hope that some action will be taken to remove that crock of a car from Merrion Street in order that others will not be dumped there in the near future.</P>
    <P>The park is perfect inside, but no attention has been paid to trees, bushes and weeds growing out from the park onto the roadway.  We are passing a Bill today on litter and we should start cleaning up in the vicinity of this area first.  I am not too sure what constituency it is in but I think that it is in the Minister's own constituency, and I would like him to take action if it is.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the Bill in general.  Every year there is a competition sponsored by Bord Fáilte, The Tidy Towns Competition.  While many of those towns and villages and smaller places have done quite a lot of good work as far as that competition is concerned, they cannot all win prizes.  A lot of credit is due to those who have never won a prize but have still kept up the good work down through the years.</P>
    <P>The local authorities, particularly the county councils, are helping those community councils in a small way.  But they should get greater aid.  All this work is done voluntarily.  But to make a success of the work one has to hire or purchase machines for cutting grass and so on.  It is only right that a grant of some kind should be made available to those communities who are doing their utmost to keep this country a tidy one and a better place to live in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few brief references.  First of all I would like to welcome the Bill and to congratulate the Minister on its introduction, on the basis that it might engender in our population a greater sense of civic pride <Col N="320" /> and civic responsibility.  This has already been referred to by a number of speakers both today and during the last sitting of this House.</P>
      <P>It was suggested on one occasion that if one gets off a plane and travels from our international airport towards the city centre one's eyes are immediately assaulted with evidence of a lack of caring on the part of the general population in the manner in which they dispose of litter indiscriminately.  For far too long we have allowed a situation to develop whereby litter of all descriptions is dumped indiscriminately. Let me point out that there are the new types of litter, the disposable packs and other new kinds of materials. In the past we were dealing entirely with glass and paper but now we have a number of synthetic substances, many of which are quite dangerous and are, unfortunately, being indiscriminately dumped everywhere at present.</P>
      <P>The penalties relating to offences under this Act, when it becomes law, will be very important to the success of the Bill because, as has already been stated, unless the Bill can be enforced there will be absolutely no improvement in the appearance of our public parks, our roads, our towns and our cities.  That must be the objective in bringing this Bill into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to underline the remarks of a number of other speakers in relation to its operation and its cost to the local authorities concerned.  Over the past couple of years a number of new Bills were introduced imposing obligations on local authorities which require extra finance but unfortunately extra finance has not been specifically provided to allow those local authorities to operate the provisions of particular Bills.  This is very important in relation to this Bill, because in section 1 there is reference to wardens.  Unless finance is provided to the local authorities to employ wardens local authorities will have to let go some of their staff or deploy some of their existing staff from other areas, which will then be operating at a disadvantage.  In section 2 there is also reference to measures which the local authorities can take. We have to be realistic and accept that <Col N="321" /> any of the measures referred to will also require extra expenditure.</P>
    <P>Section 3(2) and 3(4) provide that nothing in this section or in section 4 of this Act shall be construed as prohibiting the disposal of waste in a place provided by the local authority for the purpose, and the section goes on to list a number of different Acts including the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations (1982) Act.  This is an area that has not obviously been covered by the Bill and which needs urgent attention, because there are a number of substances already being dumped in places provided by the local authorities and the nature of these materials and the substances concerned are totally unsuitable for dumping in such areas.  Perhaps the Minister might, even at this late stage consider whether or not it would be possible to ensure that some provision is made for the dumping of these dangerous and toxic substances. We have allowed a situation to persist for too long where firms which must dump such substances have done so sometimes surreptitiously sometimes with the approval of local authorities who can provide no other area except ordinary tip-heads for dumping, and that is unfortunate. Sufficient investigation has not already been undertaken in relation to the possible effects on water or exposure in relation to some of these substances.</P>
    <P>Other than that, I welcome the Bill.  It is a positive step towards trying to ensure that we present the best possible appearance to the visitor and also to ourselves and to our children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I welcome the Bill.  I know that it is a matter that is dear to the Minister's heart.  He certainly would prefer a cleaner and healthier environment, and that is something he is aiming at in this Bill.  It is fair to say that we should regret that it is necessary because we have not a greater awareness of civic pride within ourselves. That is lacking, unfortunately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose, as I mentioned, is to create and to give us a cleaner and healthier environment, to improve the appearance of our towns, of our villages, of our <Col N="322" /> cities.  It is not the first time that we have had a Bill of this type.  We had one when Deputy Tully was Minister for Local Government, as the Department was called then, dealing with indiscriminate dumping.  We had then fines and penalties of sizeable proportions.  But unfortunately that did not work.  Indiscriminate dumping continued and very few people, as far as I know, were brought to court and fined the maximum fines.  I felt all along that the Bill was strong enough; if we could have brought people to court and highlighted the fact that there were fines and the cases were generally suitably mentioned in the various local presses of Ireland, then it might have had some impact.  But that was not the way.  I hope that under this Bill, with the fines available, with the penalties available, that many people will be brought to court and fined, and this may well be the answer to this problem.</P>
    <P>Many Members have mentioned the role of the community.  The role of the community in this problem is very important indeed.  Praise must certainly be given to the Bord Fáilte &ldquo;Tidy Towns Competition&rdquo;.  I think it is a bit unfair for the larger towns to have to compete for the same pool of votes as a smaller village or a smaller town competes for.  The Minister last week made it quite clear that conditions are especially bad in the urban areas &mdash; the bigger the area the worse the conditions generally.  That is true.  It is far easier to win a tidy towns competition if the area is small.  The proof is there. Mountshannon won it last year.  New-townforbes has won it.  These are beautiful tiny villages where a good small active committee can do wonders, where the parish priest can be vital, as we have seen in the past, where maybe the local sergeant can whip up the support necessary. To put them on the same plain as, say, a town like Athlone which is a growing, straggling town, is very unfair.</P>
    <P>Something I would like to see introduced in some way in the Bill if at all possible is the role of dumps in our society. They can be very damaging indeed to our environment and damaging to our health.  Unfortunately in many towns in Ireland they are placed right in the centre <Col N="323" /> of the towns.  Certainly I would like to think that the dumps of the future will be placed well away from the towns and villages of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The role of the local authority is vital in this Bill, as it has been in other Bills. The Leas-Chathaoirleach mentioned the Casual Trading Act, which will cost local authorities money to implement.  There has been a series of legislation dealing with the powers of local authorities &mdash; the Housing (Rented Dwellings) Act and the Water Pollution Act, 1977 and so on. We have all been talking about the erosion of powers of the local authorities and it is fair to say that they would welcome extra powers, but extra work brings problems of additional staffing and we are not getting additional staffing.  The financial base of the local authorities seems to be diminishing and at the same time extra work is being given to them. This is not fair.  Maybe the Minister will explain what section 14 means.  It says: &ldquo;Money accruing to a local authority under this Act shall be disposed of in accordance with regulations made by the Minister&rdquo;.  Can I assume that all penalties and all fines collected will go automatically to the local authority in question?  If this Bill is to be totally successful &mdash; and I am sure it will be &mdash; it needs more finance.</P>
    <P>We mentioned the Water Pollution Act, 1977.  Ireland's reputation as one of the last clean and relatively pollution-free areas of Europe has taken a battering in recent weeks and it has been savagely hit by pollution.  Many areas of pollution have affected us &mdash; pollution of our rivers is becoming a problem; fish life is affected.  For example the international angling press and angling magazines are highlighting, and have highlighted in the past, that pig slurry is going into Lough Sheelin.</P>
    <P>I am making this point because under the Water Pollution Act the local authority could have tackled this problem if they had more money.  I read recently about the contamination of water supplies in two towns in County Meath where farm effluent entered the water.  I am making <Col N="324" /> the point that because we had not sufficient funds to implement the Water Pollution Act we have this terrible situation. I am hoping that enough finance will be given to the local authorities to enable them to deal with this important Litter Bill.</P>
    <P>The image of the local authority must be considered in this Bill.  We might forget that millions of pounds have been spent on various projects &mdash; sewerage, water schemes and in many other areas &mdash; yet the streets are littered.  If our towns seem untidy, that is the image that is taken away by the tourist.  It is important that we have tidy towns and streets and this area will, I hope, be dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Someone mentioned the role of education. Greater emphasis should be put on civics in the curriculae of the various schools, teaching our young children the importance of keeping our streets tidy, getting them out collecting papers and so on.  That is important work and should be expanded in every way possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister for bringing forward the Bill.  I know he will endeavour to implement it as best he can.  It is a Bill that I welcome and wish it every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Minister said that the Litter Bill cannot cover some of the other emergency and modernising legislation we need with regard to the whole environment.  I do not think that we can allow the Second Stage of this Bill to pass without remarking on the implications of litter for the environment.  The most deadly litter of all arises from the transporting in open lorries of offal and other revolting, unhealthy and unhygienic loads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another kind of transporting that must be the concern of all local authorities, that is the transporting of very dangerous chemicals which are needed for some of our industries.  We must demand that proper safeguards be introduced to control the transporting of such chemicals and materials.  In case of accidents each local authority should have an emergency area and provide an <Col N="325" /> emergency service that would be aware of the substances passing through their areas and would know how to cope with an accident if it should happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am slow to interrupt the Senator but that would appear to be outside the scope of the Bill which deals with anything related to litter. Dangerous substances were covered in an Act we discussed last year.  The Chair would appreciate it if you could relate your remarks to litter and to the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling. However, I could not let this opportunity pass without raising once again a matter which I consider to be absolutely urgent.  We have not attended to it yet and I do not think we could look ourselves in the face if a castastrophe occurred because we did not bring in legislation to cover this matter.</P>
      <P>I see litter as being related in great part to the protection of the environment as a whole.  While I am constrained to remain within the scope of the Bill, I think that we must all have a commitment to safeguard the environment.  Sometimes the repulsively visual evidence of the little care we give to our environment can be seen in our streets.  If we do not care on a litter level we certainly will not care on other levels.</P>
      <P>The implications of introducing what might be considered an advantage in one area can also lead to litter problems.  I particularly mention the new problem that has arisen in the primary school playgrounds. With the free distribution of milk there is also the big problem of dealing in a clean, healthy and hygienic way with the milk cartons.  Certain schools in my own area, and in other areas, need extra receptacles to ensure that such cartons are dealt with quickly and do not increase the litter already polluting the school yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, and this is by way of a passionate plea, I believe that there is a negative and positive way of dealing with everything. One of the most positive ways we can deal with litter is by not alone creating an attitude that will not allow us to <Col N="326" /> pollute our environment, but also by constructively using waste and litter to improve another part of the environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister or other Members of either House may have had an opportunity to travel to Europe where certain cities through the constructive use of the recycling of their waste, have managed to meet their heating and energy needs. I welcome the measures introduced to facilitate and encourage the recycling of waste.  I would like positive measures to be taken and research might be done to positively channel such waste and litter to produce energy.  Again we come back to protecting the environment so that we need not use the same amount of energy from other polluting agencies.  Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister might be able to elaborate on the recycling of such waste.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Members I welcome the Minister to this House and also welcome the introduction of this Bill. It might seem that this Bill is not of grave importance when we think of all the problems we have on the national scale, but I think it is one of the most important Bills that has been presented to the House, and I sincerely hope that on the passing of it we will see improvements throughout the country.</P>
      <P>We heard in the past about how dirty Ireland is when compared with other countries, and we heard of dirty Dublin, dirty Limerick and dirty Kilkenny. Unfortunately, the image has gone out that we are a dirty nation.  I do not totally agree with the remarks by people who come in here and say we are a dirty nation, because having travelled reasonably extensively I know there are countries which are better than us in terms of hygiene and there are many countries which are a lot worse.  I do not want to deal with the countries which are worse; what I want to do is ensure nobody can come in here after the introduction of this Bill and say that we as a nation are dirty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill and the increase of penalties is not going to change the situation.  The only way <Col N="327" /> changes will come about is if there is an implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  There is one thing that we have in Ireland and in the EEC, at present that is, a proliferation of laws and a proliferation of legal responsibilities, but as yet we have not got the means to attend them.  We are full of good ideas, but we are not dealing with the problems.  We have not got enough policemen, we have not got enough litter wardens or traffic wardens.  We are introducing legislation without introducing the means of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest polluters is the Department of the Environment, not directly, but through their local authorities. As members of a local authority, we come across each week cases where people are looking for an extension of refuse collection.  We cannot extend the refuse collection to each house in our area because we in Kilkenny have not got the money to buy a new refuse collection vehicle.  At present we rent refuse collection vehicles.  The system of renting refuse collection vehicles is not totally successful because these people are working for hire and they are not as responsible as the people who drive the refuse collection vehicles owned by the council.</P>
    <P>In many parts of the country we have refuse collection points, where people living in a broad area bring refuse and leave it there for collection, maybe once or twice a week.  What happens is that the area around the refuse collection point becomes polluted.  The refuse truck collects from the points at which it is supposed to collect, but there could be an area of a quarter of a mile each side of the collection point which is totally polluted. If it is a wet day the water brings the muck and dirt from the refuse collection point down the road or up the road, if it is a breezy day the refuse is scattered all over the countryside.  It depends on the type of receptacle the people use to bring their refuse to the point whether we have a tidy collection point.  It should be essential, as is done in other countries, that if you have a refuse collection point, it should be defined not just by a sign, <Col N="328" /> but by having an actual refuse collection unit that people can put the refuse into and that the refuse will remain in until the refuse collection vehicle comes along.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the vehicles travelling throughout the country with animal offals.  There is nothing so despicable as to be in the city of Kilkenny four or five days a week and having open offal trucks pass through.  If people do not know a truck with offal has gone through the city of Kilkenny they might think that the city was back in the sixteenth century with open sewers, because the effect is the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have got my point across, and you will agree that if offal falls off a truck it is litter.</P>
      <P>I wonder why in section 3 (5) (b) if the vehicle is the subject of a hire purchase agreement it should not come under the aegis of the Bill.  If a person hires a vehicle for the purpose of the Road Traffic Act he is responsible for anything that happens to that vehicle.  Why under the Litter Bill is he not responsible for littering?  It seems peculiar that if a person is responsible under the Road Traffic Act, he is not responsible under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will money be provided to the local authorities to employ litter wardens, or do we have occasional litter wardens in the countryside?  The fines have been extended from £10 to £800.  There is a <Col N="329" /> certain vagueness in this, in the sense that it does state that we can have a system of on-the-spot fines.  I did not read that these on-the-spot fines were defined as being £10, £20 or £100.</P>

      <P>Does this mean if a child drops a lollipop paper on the ground he can be fined £5, or if somebody drops offal off the load, he will only be fined a fiver?  There is a certain vagueness about this.</P>
      <P>In Kilkenny, going back to the thirteenth century, every person who had a premises in a street, under the by-laws had to clean outside his premises every day or he was fined.  The fine in 1290 was sixpence.  I would not like to relate the value of money in terms of sixpence in that day to £800 today, but I would like to have the interest on the sixpence over the intervening centuries.  I ask the Minister to incorporate into the Bill a suggestion that each individual householder, or each individual businessman, be forced to clean outside his premises each day.  This is done on the continent, and in various places in America.  Before people close their shops at night they wash the pavement and clean outside their own premises.  We might be able to incorporate this into the Bill without a tremendous amount of difficulty.</P>
      <P>Who is the litter lout?  I have seen people who would not consider themselves louts by any stretch of their own imagination throwing cigarette cartons out the windows of their cars, cleaning out their cars in public car parks, going for a drive to the seaside in the summertime, sending the wife and the children down to the beach and they clean out the car in front of the beach.  These people would not consider themselves litter louts, but they are as big louts as the person who goes through the countryside breaking windows, because they are doing as much damage as the vandals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities put up signs in various places saying &ldquo;Do not dump&rdquo;. Invariably where people see such a sign they converge on it.  They find out that <Col N="330" /> there is a nice little place for dumping. The local authorities are merely creating dumps by putting up &ldquo;No dumping&rdquo; signs.  They are showing people that there is an old quarry or some place that can be used for dumping.</P>
    <P>On the elimination of litter from our countryside, we seem to be hung up with quarries or old sandpits to put our litter into.  I do not think enough care has been taken to look into the modern ways of disposing of litter.  The energy content of what we dump must be enormous if it could be recycled.  It has been stated that the cost of putting up a recycling plant would be enormous in certain areas, but if one takes the amount of energy that could be got from recycling I think the initial costs could be recovered very smartly.  In other countries quarries and old sand pits are used for environmental purposes.  They can be used as ornamental lakes, as places where people can converge and boat, or they can be turned into picnic areas, but we are turning them into dumps.</P>
    <P>The dump for Kilkenny city is seven miles away on one side.  If you wanted to bring litter to a dump in Kilkenny you could have to travel up to 28 miles. People, environmentally are getting conscious of the fact that they do not want the dumps near their own houses.  Therefore it is going to become increasing more difficult to get places for local authorities to use as dumps.  We will have to do a lot more research into the disposal of the litter we are now dumping into quarries.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the maximum penalties will be imposed and that local authorities particularly will get the finance to employ enough people to ensure that the penalties can be imposed. This is a very important Bill and I am glad that it has come into the House.  I know from what the Minister has said that he is well disposed towards it, and I hope that the powers in this Bill will be used at all times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I congratulate the Leas-Chathaoirleach on his appointment, and may I especially welcome the Minister.  I suppose I am the only Senator here &mdash; Senator Robinson is not here at <Col N="331" /> the moment &mdash; who has spent a considerable time with the Minister on a local authority.  We are particularly fortunate that he is dealing with this Bill, because I am fully aware of his dedication and his sincerity to make the city and the county a more pleasant place for everyone to live in.</P>
      <P>In the first sentence he says that the main purpose of the Bill was to improve the law relating to littering, and in particular to strengthen the hand of local authorities in dealing with litter offences and indiscriminate fly-post and graffiti and slogan writing.  He said the Bill also contained new provisions relating to abandoned vehicles.  These are very laudable and desirable objectives.  We all agree that there is great need for improvement in our standards, and to achieve this it is not necessary for us to have any great skill, or any special degrees, to pass laws relating to it, nor is it necessary to go to any great expense. It is true that we can pass laws here and that we can make regulations governing indiscriminate littering, but this will only have limited success.  I agree with the Minister when he said that when people decide they prefer clean surroundings to littered and untidy conditions, and when they are prepared to make the small effort required to solve this problem, then the problem will be well on the road to being solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite an amount of littering is caused by carelessness and indifference.  People do not realise the harm they are doing and the unsavoury conditions they are creating for others in the area.  As a member of the Dublin City Council, as the Minister was too until recently, I intend to confine my remarks mainly to the urban areas but I will make a passing reference to rural areas.  Passing through rural areas we can see posters advertising carnivals, sports fixtures, auctions and so on.  Those are all a necessary part of our day to day living.  In this regard, political parties are fairly well to the fore.  In many cases their posters remain long after the event has passed.  I did not notice it until the last few years, but in certain rural areas there is a practice of dividing <Col N="332" /> the areas between different candidates, each candidate confining himself to a special area.  They seem to take special pride in putting up posters with photographs of themselves, sometimes covered with cellophane to protect them from the weather.  I notice cases where there were rather&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;rough frames on those posters, to guarantee that they would stay.  I mentioned to a certain Member of the other House that I happened to see his photograph prominently displayed during the Seanad election in a part of the country.  I asked would he not think of taking it down.  He said &ldquo;Well, I would take it down if I was guaranteed that I would not have to put it up again in six months.  After all, they are fairly expensive and it costs a bit to put them up&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, it is true that this problem is more prevalent and more conspicuous in the urban areas.  The greater the urban area, the greater the problem. Dublin, as the capital city, poses the greatest problem of any local authority in this regard.  It is a common sight to see posters.  I am sure that everybody here has seen them stuck on important places and vantage points.  Hoardings on a public building in Dame Street &mdash; in past years owned by Hely's &mdash; are completely covered in posters advertising all sorts of events.  One that caught my fancy there was advertising Meat Loaf.  I thought it was some form of food, but discovered it is some performer who is to come to the National Stadium or somewhere else.</P>

      <P>Fly-posting, graffiti, abandoned cars and offensive slogans are the main problems in the Dublin area.  All of those damage both trade and tourism. Our Ministers travel to different countries, quite rightly, trying to get extra trade.  It does not make good sense or good economics for Ministers to travel to our neighbouring country and spend time <Col N="333" /> and money trying to promote trade, although I agree with this, when those people on coming here see offensive slogans: It will not encourage them to trade with us and will also damage our tourist trade.  We have been told on many occasions that our tourist trade is our second major industry.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that in Dublin we have established a Keep Dublin Tidy committee in the last 12 months.  This committee consists of members of the city council, some members from the city traders, representatives of Dublin Tourism, of the Combined Residents' Association and the Tenants' Association and An Taisce.  They have all come together to try to formulate ways and means of making Dublin a more attractive and tidier city and a city that will attract tourists, rather than discourage them from coming here.  They intend, in the not too distant future, to establish a certain pilot area.  They are promised the assistance and co-operation of all those organisations in trying to show what can and should be done to make the city what we all would like it to be.  I am sure that the Minister, as a Dubliner, taking pride in his own city, is fully aware of the formidable task that they face in this respect.</P>
      <P>There are a few things I would ask the Minister to take note of.  I am not sure if they are fully covered in the Bill.  He should make provision in the new Act for dealing with abandoned refuse containers and skips.  These are not necessarily vehicles but are abandoned on the streets and there should be some powers for dealing with those.  The local authorities as the people carrying out this task, should have powers to declare that car wrecks or parts of wrecks are classed as litter and not as parts of vehicles.  This would make it much easier, because trying to deal with abandoned cars has been a very long drawn-out process.  We do not know when we can say that they are completely abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister include some provision in the Bill in respect of litter bins and plastic sacks which are used quite a lot now &mdash; I do not know if they are going <Col N="334" /> to be allowed under the new Bill?  These are sometimes put out a day or two before the bin collection day.  Could he make it a rule that they can be put out only on the day of collection?  When interfered with by stray dogs they create a horrible mess on the streets.  I am sure everybody has seen this happening.</P>
    <P>I join with several others here who have asked for a guarantee that when this Bill is passed the local authorities will have adequate finances to employ the necessary number of wardens.  We can pass Bills, make laws and regulations, but if we are not allowed or have not the necessary finance to employ wardens to enforce those rules and regulations, then a lot will go for nought.</P>
    <P>I am sure that other local authorities are in the same position as Dublin City Council.  Today they are before the Labour Court, trying to come to a settlement in a situation where a strike has been voted for by practically every section of the workers.  The strike is imminent because the City Manager has told them that he has not the necessary money to give them the increase they are looking for.  Were it not for the fact that we got some extra money this year due to certain happenings and events in the Dublin area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was one of the main reasons.  Were it not for that, I am reliably informed that there would be quite an amount of redundancies for Dublin City Council workers.  Unless the Minister can give us a guarantee that the necessary funds will be made available, I do not see how the council are going to employ those people.</P>
      <P>I would also like him to tell us what will happen to the on-the-spot fines.  The local authorities are empowered to impose on-the-spot fines.  When they collect those fines, what will happen to them?  Will they be left with the local authority, or will they be given into the Central Fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the Bill depends a lot on the litter wardens.  Unless the Minister can use his influence to have moneys <Col N="335" /> allocated for the employment of these wardens I can see the Bill running into many difficulties.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am glad to see the Minister here.  I know that he will do everything in his power to see that this Bill, when passed, will become effective. From this side of the House we thoroughly endorse the Bill.  As the Cathaoirleach has arrived, may I congratulate her on her appointment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of great interest to Senator Mallon and myself to see that there has been this renewed attempt to deal with the litter problem in Ireland.  I can well remember my six year old boy going for his first holiday to Donegal &mdash; I will not mention the town.  He said: &ldquo;Isn't that funny, Daddy.  They say &lsquo;Keep Ireland tidy.&rsquo;  Why are my lolly papers down their street?&rdquo;  I thought that was a good subject for his first letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
      <P>The point I would like to make is this. While we must welcome this attempt by legislation to prevent the extension of the litter problem and while we must consider very strongly the need for effective penalties, I do not subscribe to the idea that finance, or penalties, will, in the long run, cope with the very deep problem of litter.  Litter is symptomatic of a deep <i>malaise</i> in the society in which we exist. At its worst, the biggest eyesore in the town in which I live are not the bottles and the rubbish one sees scattered around the streets, but the boarded-up seedy side of capitalism down that street, where property which has been disused for a number of years is awaiting an appropriate moment for a speculative buyer to take it over.  I would like to put forward the viewpoint that litter is, in fact, symptomatic of a social sickness and a lack of pride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard it expressed earlier that the worst problem is the urban areas.  I would ask the House to consider the difficulties that a warden or a garda will have where there is overcrowding, high-rise tenement dwellings and social deprivation compared with the similar garda <Col N="336" /> or warden exercising his activities in a rural town in Ireland.  They are in totally different circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister &mdash; and apologise if it was dealt with during the last day's discussion, when I was not here &mdash; has he considered how we are going to mobilise the goodwill that exists, so that we can re-establish pride in community living?  How, in effect, are we going to create the social space where people feel they belong, are welcomed as participants and have the way of finding self-expression in their lives so that they become proud of the community in which they exist?  There are far too many communities in Ireland where one cannot feel proud.</P>
    <P>I maintain that in the long run it will be very difficult to enforce what seems to be so desirable legislation but I also suspect that it will be seen as another outreach of central State forces dealing with people who, perhaps, are living in less than socially acceptable surroundings.  To overcome that danger, must we not, in litter as in everything else, stimulate ideas for the community forum?  Those ideas should invite consideration of some way of rewarding the citizen who attends the forum, should it be a quarterly attendance or whatever, to discuss matters such as litter, such as the offal being offloaded down the main street of Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>As an aside, I am grateful to Senator Lanigan for explaining to me why it was that Miss Kettle's establishment has remained so clean throughout the centuries. Sixpence was, indeed, a very high penalty in the days when she was living.</P>
    <P>To get back to my main point, it will be very difficult to enforce this legislation. We must look at the other side of the coin and ask how we can re-establish pride and increase awareness of the problem. That will be done through a community forum, but is there not a need in our whole philosophy of education to give the Irish children of the future a much more locally orientated education and locally orientated experience?  They will then know what is involved; they will know what it is like to run a refuse collection department; they will know where the refuse tips are, they will know the <Col N="337" /> dangers; they will have, in fact, through experience as well as education, come to terms with the problems of living as mature citizens in their own community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Brady,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-East):</i> Firstly, I would like to express a sense of appreciation to all the Senators for the very fine contributions they have made during this debate.  We had 20 Senators speaking, which is a very high percentage of the House.  All the contributions were very thought provoking, constructive and meaningful, many of which I have taken note of and many of which I will firmly endeavour to implement when this legislation takes effect.</P>
      <P>The legislation has, indeed, been recognised as an important step in our efforts to bring about an improvement in our surroundings.  As Senator Robb rightly indicated, litter, apart from its historical connotations, is also a symptom of affluence.  In countries that, perhaps, are more deprived than our own, it is quite extraordinary that littering is not a problem.  In a nation as vast as India, there is no littering at all, because people are fighting for the very essence of survival. They will pick up pieces of string, twine, bottle ends and so on, in an endeavour to see if these items can serve any useful purpose.</P>
      <P>We are, indeed, living in a throw-away, uncaring society that is damaging perhaps its most valuable resource, its environment. This legislation is a definite attempt to try to stem the tide.  Regrettably, penalties have to be imposed.  It would be ideal to appeal to the national spirit to co-operate in protecting our environment, but my experience at local government level has proved without any doubt that this will not work and that fines are necessary, penal fines and the heaviest possible fines for perpetrators of the awful offences to which many Senators referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities will be responsible for implementing the provisions of the Bill.  As I said in my opening statement, this is giving the local authorities the power to implement on-the-spot fines and, indeed, to prosecute very severely. <Col N="338" /> What is needed, of course, is a spirit of co-operation between all citizens and public elected representatives to try to instil this need for a change in our attitude to litter.  I am investigating ways and means of trying to engage in a nationwide clean-up of cities and towns in order that, when the legislation becomes effective, we will be starting afresh.  It is very important that, in the earlier stages, justices impose heavy fines.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the question of waste disposal and matters relating to illegal dumping.  The Bill, of course, is not designed to deal with waste disposal as such.  Other regulations cover that area.  Toxic and hazardous waste disposal comes under separate legislation. However, the point made by many Senators is taken.  The importance of adequate provisions by local authorities for waste disposal is fully recognised by my Department.  Local authorities are making continuing waste disposal plans to cope with these problems.</P>
    <P>Senators Cregan and Barnes referred to the question of incineration and general recycling and I subscribe to this view. It is a misguided belief that recycling is not an economic proposition.  Recycling is a very useful habit to inculcate into the minds of people because, at least if that habit is developed, it can be used in a time of want as well as in a time of affluence or apparent affluence.  Someone referred to the possible recycling of waste materials for heating purposes.  This is done to great effect in Ireland, not necessarily from the actual incineration of waste material, but using a resource to reheat.  Senator Belton will be familiar with an experiment in Ballymun where they are endeavouring to put this proposition forward.  I will give every possible consideration to seeing if incineration schemes can be developed further.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators, Senator Lanigan principally, referred to various nuisance type problems associated with the transportation of waste and other materials. That is covered in the Bill in section 3, which will make it an offence for any goods to be carried uncovered in such a way as to cause litter.  I agree with the emphasis which many Senators placed on <Col N="339" /> education and community effort.  In this area, people often refer to the question of civics being taught in schools and so on.  The lesson here can be learned from children, if we listen to them.  Again, I am coming back to what Senator Robb said about when he brought his son to Donegal.  That is a lesson where the child can make the parent aware of the enormity of this problem.  Every possible effort will be taken in my Department to try to give a new impact to education at every level to implement this legislation.  We need, of course, the voluntary effort, as well as education.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy referred to the problem of political slogans, black flags and slogans offensive to tourists.  I would like to give the Senator an assurance that these are dealt with under sections 7 and 8.  Local authorities will be able to take direct action to remove offending material, or to have it removed.  They will be enabled to employ a specialist service to remove grafitti, fly posting or anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>Senators Wright and Seán Conway were concerned about the banning of bill-posting &mdash; such as posting advertising a carnival or a circus coming to a town. This is certainly not intended.  A number of types of advertising will not be liable to prosecution and the House would agree rightly so.  These would include advertisements which are exempt under the Local Government Planning Act of 1977.  This would include advertisements for a circus or some such function coming to a town.</P>
    <P>Senator Dowling raised the question of banning all election posters, or confining them to specified forms of locations.  I am not sure that the House would welcome a radical interference with the traditional forms of advertising at election time. However, there is provision in the Bill that election posters have to be removed within seven days of an election.  That is a very satisfactory position.</P>
    <P>Senators Cregan and O'Toole referred to the problem of abandoned vehicles. This is a very vexed question which is dealt with in section 16.  Senators raised the question of whether the land occupier, as well as the local authority, will <Col N="340" /> be empowered to prosecute.  Sections 11 and 13 make provision for the removal of such abandoned vehicles by the local authority, with the occupier's agreement. It is one thing to get legislation of this kind enacted but that, in itself, will achieve nothing.  A number of Senators rightly stressed the importance of the implementation.  It is very clear from the discussion of this Bill in this House and in the Dáil that widespread support is needed from every sector of the community. It is going to be a long haul. There is no doubt whatever in my mind about that.</P>
    <P>The historical background to which Senator Murphy referred may be due to our nation not having the privilege of large ownership of land, and thereby not having an inherent investment in the enforcement of law and order.  We find ourselves just a little bit ill-concerned about problems of maintaining law and order.  A start has to be made.  The powers which this Bill give to local authorities will go a long way towards provoking a new attitude.  Many Senators gave examples in their contributions of opportunities where local authorities can give the finest example to citizens.  Every possible opportunity must be taken to instill this new attitude.  Section 14 provides for on-the-spot fines.</P>
    <P>Some Senators referred to the question of finance and how the whole system will be financed.  It would be my intention that the actual moneys collected, although this will come under a regulation by the Department of Finance, would go back to the local authorities to give them the incentive to make this legislation effective.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton referred to skips.  They have been covered by an amendment to the legislation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I thank all Senators who contributed.  Coming into the summer season, I am anxious, as I am sure all Members are, to have the legislation passed, and I appeal to all local authorities to take note that the legislation is coming before them, though there will be an interim period when they can take <Col N="341" /> stock and get involved in a clean-up campaign with a view to making a fresh start.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the 1981 Report of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and of the general situation in relation to credit for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In proposing the motion I will emphasise that there are a number of aspects of the entire agricultural and farming industries which need to be taken into account.  We <Col N="342" /> cannot simply take the ACC report in isolation.  We must also take full and complete account of the various problems that relate to agriculture.  Of course, at present, as in other businesses credit is the central issue with regard to farming and agriculture itself.  However, before moving on specifically to the report of the ACC for 1981, there are a number of other issues which need in my view to be highlighted.</P>
    <P>Very briefly I will emphasise the important part agriculture plays in our economy.  I do not think it can be ever over-stated, or repeated too often, that agricultural exports represent 35 per cent of our total.  This is not in my view at all times acknowledged by people either within the industry or outside it.  We must make certain that in so far as it is possible our agricultural exports will be expanded, assisted, improved and perfected in the fullest way.  In that way we will maximise the return to our country and help our balance of payments quite significantly.</P>
    <P>In relation to the industry at present in my view there is an urgent need for an overall comprehensive plan to be brought into being.  Such a plan ought to take account of the various facets in the production, processing and marketing areas. There is little point in taking any aspect of the agricultural sector in isolation and attending to it: we need now an overall agricultural plan and the Government, in co-operation with the different agencies involved, such as the lending institutions, the advisory services, the co-operative societies, marketing boards, semi-State bodies, farming organisations and others, should evolve a meaningful policy for this vital industry.</P>
    <P>As I see it, at present there is need for the introduction of a national agricultural programme under a national agricultural development authority.  Many of us have referred in the past to the need for such an authority: indeed it is urgent, if we are to get the best results possible from this vital industry.  I do not think we can any longer afford a piecemeal approach to agriculture, as unfortunately has been the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> May I at this stage welcome the Minister to our discussion?  I would say to him that the Government should without delay set about the implementation of an overall plan for farming.</P>
    <P>It is good for us to recap on how agriculture fits into the scene of things, because otherwise we might lose perspective and it may get lost.  It has been stated on many occasions by many persons that 20 per cent of our population are directly engaged in farming &mdash; if one takes it in terms of numbers of persons, 3 per cent of the workforce.  We are therefore talking about a great many people. We have between 7 and 8 per cent of the working population also involved in what is known as the food and drink sector, and this embodies meat processing plants, bacon factories, meat plants and various other processing agencies. Added to this we have a wide range of activities, which are very important, in which persons are one way or another involved in servicing the agricultural industry, which accounts for 18 per cent. Therefore, more than 45 per cent of our total population are engaged in agriculture in one form or another.  I make these points to bring home to the House the enormity of the situation and the importance of a vibrant and thriving agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, agriculture has been in very serious decline since 1979.  Agricultural land prices were buoyant in 1978, but since 1979 we have seen a steady slipping down the hill.  The years 1979, 1980 and 1981 were three bad years in the farming world which resulted in the halving of incomes of farmers, or a reduction of 50 per cent.  I do not wish to make political capital of this because in the middle of that time, 1979, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, introduced 2 per cent turnover or resource tax.  Apart from the effect it had directly, it had the indirect effect of breaking confidence of people in the industry.  That tax was removed after it had done a great deal of harm, but little was done subsequently to correct a decline in the agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> I give the example of the resource tax to show the lack of positive planning and programming, displayed by the introduction of the resource tax.  Anybody with business acumen would not think of introducing a 2 per cent tax on agricultural turnover because turnover bears little or no relationship with profitability or how a business is going.  That tax eroded farmers' confidence.  We are still left with that situation.</P>
    <P>While inflation and high interest rates have contributed in a very major way to the difficulties in farming, it must be acknowledged that the Government did not do much to cushion the agricultural industry against these serious problems. During 1979, 1980 and 1981 the problem became extremely acute.  The evidence is there to show that.  We are still awaiting a recovery of confidence.</P>
    <P>I come to areas in respect of which I hope I can make suggestions which might restore confidence.  I hope that in 1982 farmers' income will keep abreast of inflation, assuming that certain optimistic forecasts will take place, for example, good yields and good production from animals and so on.</P>
    <P>Cost increases have hit agriculture very seriously.  One can say that this has hit all businesses, and I acknowledge that, but the very nature of the agricultural business is such that it is not able to withstand this cost price situation.  For that reason, the position in agriculture is very serious. We know, and unfortunately we hear it day after day, that one industry after another is in serious financial difficulties or is going out of business.  This is extremely regretful.</P>
    <P>I would contend that if we had had a more vibrant agriculture in the last couple of years we might not have been able to eliminate that unfortunate development, but we could have reduced it. We have a number of industries that are agriculture-linked that have suffered serious financial difficulties in the last few years.  A greater contribution from a more dynamic agriculture this year and in the years to come we hope will create an atmosphere in which we will be hearing of fewer of these industries going to the wall.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> Coming specifically to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and their report, I would like first of all to compliment the ACC for doing a good job for farmers and the agricultural sector over the years. Like other Senators, I have studied the 1981 report from the ACC.  It is obvious that there are certain constraints on the ACC which prevent them from doing an even better job for farming in the future. In so far as it is possible we must enable the ACC to do the very best job possible. By and large, it has helped many problem areas in the agricultural sector.  We must bear in mind that the Agricultural Credit Corporation accounts for approximately one-third of total farm borrowings at present.  We have, unfortunately, an all-time record of farm borrowings of £1,300 million, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation would have provided roughly one-third of that to farmers and to the agri-business sector.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the ACC should remain competitive in the area of small deposits.  From reading the report, this must be a matter of concern and of some contention.  The ACC also remain competitive in this area and it is obvious from the report that with the impressive network of offices which the ACC have set up throughout the country and the personnel in those offices the corporation are capable and competent to deal with these small deposits.</P>
    <P>One might ask why do the ACC not engage in getting more small deposits. Frankly, the corporation at present are at a distinct disadvantage with their competitors in relation to taxation of small deposit yields.  The associated banks at present enjoy tax concession of £70 per person and £140 per couple on a joint account.  The trustee savings bank have a concession of £150 per individual account or £300 per joint account.  What I am suggesting is that the ACC should be put on a par with the trustee savings bank.  It can be argued that the ACC funds go directly into the more productive sector of the economy.  That is one point that would help enormously because vast sums of money would <Col N="346" /> become available for our agricultural industry as a result.</P>
    <P>During 1981, the year that we are considering and which the motion relates to, the profit margin from the ACC was 3.2 per cent compared with a profit margin of 3.1 per cent in 1980.  I do not think anybody will disagree that these margins are inadequate for the corporation from the point of view of capital.  However, and this is the nub of the problem, since the ACC lends almost exclusively to a single sector of our economy, it is expected that the profit margin will reflect the general pattern of lack of profitability in that sector.  I have already referred to the lack of profitability in the farming sector, so that accounts for the lack of profitability in the ACC world.</P>
    <P>To enable the ACC to do a better job, I believe consideration might be given to allowing the ACC to expand its business base.  I have already referred to it as having offices and personnel to engage in various activities but I think it could perhaps engage in further activity, for example, loans for farmers for houses and loans for houses perhaps in rural towns, and it could utilise its manpower or its workforce to a better degree and then would be in a position to have more moneys available for the agricultural sector. I would qualify that by stating that definite provision would have to be made to ensure that the ACC would not find itself with less funds for investment in agriculture for productive and other purposes if it was to engage in this type of activity. My suggestion would be to enable the corporation to be more viable as an agency or as a unit.</P>
    <P>The report indicates that the profit of the corporation in 1981, before providing for taxation, amounted to £1.91 million. This was a reduction in the corresponding figure of £2.32 million in the 1980 accounts.  This figure, however, is arrived at after making provision for bad and doubtful debts, and regrettably this is now an ever-increasing feature and is likely, unfortunately, to continue.  This is a very sad and serious situation: bad debts are becoming a reality, a fact of life, and it is not easy to find the absolute answer for it.  The balance sheet in the <Col N="347" /> report at 31 December 1981 showed the assets of the ACC to be £574 million. This was an increase of 11 per cent on the corresponding figure for 1980.</P>
    <P>During the year in question, the ACC advances of loans to agriculture, separate from hire purchase agreements, totalled £114.4 million as compared with £131 million in 1980.  That represents a decrease of 13.2 per cent.  This is a clear illustration unfortunately, of the erosion of farmers' confidence which commenced away back, as I have said already, in 1979.  This is important because agriculture, like all other businesses, now operates on the basis of credit, so obviously possible developments are being shelved.</P>
    <P>Moving on to the current interest rates and the general difficulties in the farming sector, a further reduction for 1982 in lending requirements is forecast by the ACC in its report.  This also is something we must be concerned about.  If one looks at Table 2 in the report it is obvious that there is a very significant swing from development loans to short-term finance. This is a very bad sign because the country needs development and the potential remains great in many of our farms.</P>
    <P>However, this development will not take place until confidence has been restored at farmer level.  With interest rates at 20 per cent plus, and inflation at 19 to 20 per cent, there cannot be any worthwhile development.  There is, therefore, a very urgent need for low cost finance over a period suitable to the industry.  Serious difficulties are created by advocating borrowing at 20 per cent. I believe honestly and earnestly that people today borrowing money at the cost of 20 per cent are getting themselves into very serious difficulties, particularly in the agricultural sector where turnover is slow and a long drawn out process.</P>
    <P>We also see from the same table in the ACC report that borrowing for livestock decreased from £25.5 million in 1978 to £12.3 million in 1981.  This again is something to be concerned about, because increasing the national herd is a priority and must remain a priority, but above all we must do something about it because if we do not increase our stock numbers <Col N="348" /> no progress can be made.  We must bear in mind that total stock numbers in fact are now less than they were in 1972, ten years ago.  This is something that, needless to remark, cannot be allowed to continue, particularly if we bear in mind that our estimated reduction in cereal acreage for the current year is something of the order of 100,000 acres.  We are heading straight for a position of gross and utter and dire inefficiency in our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>In regard to our livestock industry and the fact that we have had this serious situation where our numbers now are fewer than they were in 1972, we must reflect and realise that our exports in 1981 were worth £700 million.  That is something that we cannot and must not take too lightly.  However, during 1981 the volume of cattle disposals was down by 25 per cent to 1.55 million.  This is a very alarming decline in the output of cattle, or cattle disposals, and it clearly affects our balance of payments position.  It is true to say, and few will contradict it, that it is largely due to a very massive and serious destocking in our herds in 1980 used almost exclusively to provide incomes for people who would otherwise have no income at all.  This money was used not for luxury living but to provide bread and butter for many farmers throughout this country, and this has had very serious ramifications for us and will have more serious ramifications as we proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture has indicated that he wants to increase the numbers.  I suggest very strongly to him that there must be central incentive schemes and that these must be coupled with low-cost funds at a fixed rate with an appropriate repayment period.  Again, I suggest that the ACC should have a fixed interest rate as obtained in the past.  Also we must have simple schemes such as the calf scheme without as much red tape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose that the Government allow the ACC to bring in low-cost foreign <Col N="349" /> funds with the Government covering the exchange risk, as has been done with other ACC loans.  Due to the capital-intensive nature of agriculture, borrowing must be long-term at a reasonable rate and that rate must be fixed for the duration of the loan so that a farmer will know what he has to pay each year and can, therefore, plan.  The rate of interest should not be more than 10 to 12 per cent and at least £150 million will be required to make any dent on agriculture at this time.</P>
    <P>With variable interest rates as applied at the present time with ACC and the banks, there is no way a person can plan with confidence and certainty.  ACC had interest rates on a fixed basis up to about five or six years ago and let us hope we can return to that position again.  The European Investment Bank loan which applies and operates on the level of 14 per cent is to be welcomed.  It is a step in the right direction, particularly since the European Investment Bank has not formerly engaged in agricultural investment and has confined its activities to the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>The inter-dependence of agriculture on the industrial sector is something that cannot be over-emphasised.  We have a situation now in 1982 &mdash; it obtained in 1981 as well &mdash; where there is a serious cut-back in fertiliser usage and much lower levels of animal feeding, all of which reduces efficiency and is costing us thousands of jobs in the agricultural and related sectors.  I talked about our land carrying less stock than it did heretofore. A very vital area is that of machinery. Machinery is not being purchased and we are heading for a situation where we could have an almost collapse of our existing machinery where the basic machines would not be there to do the jobs that need doing.  It is encouraging to learn from the ACC report that they are going to adopt a sympathetic approach to the problems of many farmers, and I urge all lending agencies to take account of this.  We must make certain that there is a sympathetic approach to all problems in agriculture.</P>
    <P>We have now a very fine infrastructure in agriculture.  Since we joined the EEC <Col N="350" /> a great deal of our investment has taken place in land reclamation, drainage and land restructuring and the erection of farm buildings.  This investment can only be fully realised with a much higher stocking level and the provision of low-cost funds to increase the size of the cattle breeding herd much be a major priority at this time.  Because of the effect of the high inflation rate and its major impact on agriculture the general level of indebtedness and exorbitant interest rates confidence in agriculture is at a very low ebb. The reality of the situation at this time, and the ACC acknowledge this very fully in their report, is that the continuation of high inflation and high interest rates has eliminated most of the profit from many farming activities.  It has to be stressed that it is the prospect of profit that encourages investment and risk-taking. Without the prospects of profit or a reasonable margin from farming activity there will not be investment, and this is an indispensable condition for growth.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I say there must be a radical look at agriculture and agricultural credit in particular. Credit is freely available but the price of credit is wrong.

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  As we are all aware, we are in the midst of a recession which affects both industry in all its aspects and agriculture.  If we compare this recession with that experienced in the mid-seventies, the one factor which is immediately discernible is the fact that then the agricultural sector was in a healthy state and, consequently, the general recession did not bite so deeply into <Col N="351" /> the heart of our economy.  Unfortunately, on this occasion agriculture has taken a hammering also, and for a number of reasons outlined by the previous speaker.  I do not propose to go into them, but suffice it to say that unless growth in agriculture is continued and increased and unless there is some recompense for farmers for their efforts, there will be a general decline in confidence in that particular sector and we will have an even greater recession.  This confidence can only be restored in a number of ways.</P>
      <P>While I accept that the Minister's scheme to help farmers who are in severe financial difficulty has great merit I feel that it does not go far enough.  It is too short-term.  For the kind of difficulties into which the agricultural sector has fallen at present there is a great need for a long-term interest subsidy which would carry the agricultural sector through a period of five or six years and incorporated in that should be lower interest rates even than those already proposed. That would be more than repaid in the increased productivity which would accrue in the next couple of years.  In addition to increased interest rates coupled with inflation we must also take into account lower returns from grain and beef production and increased costs in machinery, which has already been highlighted in another area in the past couple of days.  Unless greater emphasis is placed on the importance of resolving those difficulties we will experience a further recession in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise one point made by the previous speaker, that is, in relation to ensuring that the ACC can offer the same facilities to investors, and particularly those who wish to make small deposits with the corporation, by way of eliminating the anomalies in relation to taxation.  The ACC have given a sterling service to agriculture and to the economy and it is absolutely essential that they should be in a position to operate on an equitable basis with what one could call their competitors.  If they do not, the Departments will be hampered and their ability to help the agricultural sector will also be restricted.  That would be very <Col N="352" /> unfortunate.  I feel also that the corporation should be allowed to extend their scope and provide current banking facilities in order to capitalise on short-term cash that may be available in the agricultural sector.  Other lending agencies are in a position to avail of this cash but the ACC are not, except through deposit accounts.  They are not in a position to compete with the other agencies in that area.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to commend the chairman and board of the ACC for standing by agriculture in these very difficult times.  Over the past five or six years there has been considerable lending by a number of agencies to the agricultural arena.  Many of them have had second thoughts but it is to the credit of the ACC that they continued to make further finances available when necessary.  In these difficult times we should all be very wary about making any public statement which would in any way affect our exports.  If there is any evidence to suggest that we have done so, we should try to ensure that we can retract it.  Our economy is very dependent on the success of our exports, particularly in the agricultural area.  The consequences of any damage done in relation to our markets abroad, particularly in relation to our close neighbours should be carefully examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett, Clare) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett, Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Clare</i>): I should like first of all to make some comments on the first part of the motion &mdash; the 1981 report of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. While the report has been before the House for some weeks now and Senators are obviously familiar with its contents, it is, I think, worth while to draw attention to some of the salient features.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation's profits, before tax, showed a reduction from £2.32 million in 1980 to £1.91 million in 1981.  A factor in this reduction was an increase in the provision for bad and doubtful debts.  The current cost accounts, as with other banks, show a less favourable position on profits as compared with the conventional accounts.  However, the increase in the value of property assets under current <Col N="353" /> cost accounting has compensated for the deterioration in the value of monetary assets, leaving the shareholders' funds virtually the same under both accounting methods.</P>
    <P>Total advances by the corporation under loans and hire-purchase contracts increased by £33.5 million to £455.8 million, an increase of just under 8 per cent, while the amount of new advances fell from £131.8 million in 1980 to £114.4 million in 1981, a drop of over 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>Total deposits stood at £376.4 million at 31 December 1981, an increase of £48.4 million or under 15 per cent.  Within this overall growth, the growth of small deposits was disappointing.</P>
    <P>It is clear that 1981 was not a good year for the ACC.  This of course is not surprising. The ACC are confined to the agricultural and fishing sectors in so far as their lending is concerned.  The difficulties experienced by farmers and by agri-businesses in recent years have, therefore, affected the ACC's activities more than those of other financial institutions with a broader customer base. Faced with a substantial decline in income, farmers have been slow to borrow. Confidence in agri-businesses has been adversely affected by the difficulties confronting farmers and, consequently, such businesses have also been reluctant to borrow.  The farm income situation has also had its effect on the ACC's deposit intake, although I should emphasise that, in the matter of deposits, the ACC are open to everybody, farmer and non-farmer alike.  When all the adverse conditions under which the ACC have operated in 1981 are taken into consideration, the corporation's performance must be regarded as creditable.</P>
    <P>I should like at this point to refer to the second part of the motion &mdash; the general situation in relation to credit for farmers. The Central Bank's credit guidelines for the year to mid-February 1983 allow the banks to increase their total lending by 14 per cent.  Within this overall total credit expansion, the Central Bank have laid down a specific guideline for personal loans and hire purchase finance whereby these two categories are being limited to <Col N="354" /> an increase of 7 per cent.  Thus, lending for productive purposes, including agriculture, will be allowed to grow by 15 per cent.  In addition to lending by the banks, a provision of £100 million is included in the Public Capital Programme for 1982 to meet the expected level of demand on the ACC for credit by farmers.  As a result, I do not expect that any farmer with a worth-while project for the expansion of the productive capacity of his farm will be denied access to credit.</P>
    <P>I recognise, however, that current interest rates may deter many farmers from borrowing even for highly productive projects.  The Government are most anxious to secure a reduction in interest rates as soon as economic circumstances at home and abroad permit.  However, I should point out that a number of schemes are at present in operation which reduce interest charges to farmers.</P>
    <P>Under a scheme included in one of the special packages of measures secured as part of the 1981 EEC price negotiations, farmers in the development category under the farm modernisation scheme or farmers following improvement plans under the western package receive a 5 per cent interest subsidy in respect of borrowing for grant-aided investment. This subsidy is payable for a period not exceeding two years commencing on or after 1 January 1981 and ending on 31 December 1983.</P>
    <P>A loan facility of £5 million provided to the ACC by the European Investment Bank is being on-lent to farmers at a fixed rate of 14 per cent for loans of up to 12 years.  This reduced rate of interest has been made possible by the assumption by the Exchequer of liability for the exchange risk involved.  The maximum loan is £30,000 and is available for up to half the cost of a particular investment. So far, applications have been received for all of the first <i>tranche</i>, amounting to £2.5 million of this facility.</P>
    <P>In addition, the associated banks have a facility of £50 million provided through foreign borrowing, from which loans are granted to finance development under a farm plan or to small and medium-sized agri-businesses.  An exchange risk premium of 2 per cent is charged to the <Col N="355" /> borrower and the Exchequer assumes the residual exchange risk, thus enabling an interest rate substantially below general domestic interest rates to be charged. This interest rate, which varies with interest rates abroad, is currently around 13 per cent.  The ACC have a similar facility and while all of the original £50 million has been lent, some of the loans are short-term, and as these are repaid more funds become available for future lending.</P>
    <P>I think it would be appropriate at this stage to strike an optimistic note in relation to agricultural production and incomes.  In 1981 the downward trend in farm incomes was halted.  This was brought about by a number of factors. The EEC price negotiations that year resulted in an increase of the order of 14 per cent for our main agricultural products.  In addition, agreement was reached on two sets of special measures for Irish farmers which are worth an estimated £110 million, financed jointly by the EEC and the Irish Exchequer.  Also, in the budget of 1981, the Government provided financial assistance and incentives worth £35 million for our farmers.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that we have also come out of the 1982 EEC price negotiations with substantial price increases &mdash; 10½ per cent for milk and 11 per cent for beef &mdash; as well as a calf premium worth £37 million a year to Irish farmers, and there is to be a national grant of £70 for each additional calved heifer.  It is estimated that the overall result is worth £235 million to the Irish farm sector in a full year.  The additional expenditure allocations and tax changes incorporated in the budget introduced in March 1982 provided a further £9 million for farmers, in addition to rates relief of £18 million provided for earlier in the Estimates.  As a result of all these favourable developments I am hopeful that 1982 will be the year in which farmers' incomes will start rising again.  It is obviously too early yet to make predictions, particularly in agriculture where so much depends on the weather.  However, it is comforting to note that one prominent <Col N="356" /> agricultural economist has forecast an increase in farmers' incomes of 5 per cent in real terms in 1982.</P>
    <P>One of the more undesirable features of the agricultural situation in recent years has been the fall in cattle numbers. Present circumstances are now especially favourable for a major reversal of that trend.  As I already mentioned, the EEC is providing a calf premium of about £22 for each calf that is calved in the current marketing year.  Taken together with the beef suckler grant, the national aid on calved heifers and the headage payments for beef and dairy cows in the disadvantaged areas, farmers have now got a strong financial incentive to expand their herds.  The benefits of such expansion will be felt not just in the farmer's pocket but in beef, dairy and other processing activities which depend on agriculture for their raw materials and which have in recent years suffered from inadequate supplies of such raw materials. Indeed, the inadequacy of cattle supplies and of raw materials for the food-processing industries has been a major factor in the deterioration of our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest wish, therefore, that farmers will help themselves and the economy as a whole by availing of the unprecedented level of financial incentives to expand their herds.  To the extent that farmers need credit to expand their herds, I am confident that sufficient funds will be available and that the special credit schemes, as well as the direct financial incentives which I have outlined, are such as to offset the deterrent of high interest rates.  For these reasons, I look forward to renewed expansion in agriculture to the direct benefit of farmers and the indirect benefit of the rest of the economy.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan mentioned an agricultural plan.  The position is that the Government have established a group which is representative of many agricultural interests to draw up by October 1982 a four-year development plan for Irish agriculture.  The Senator also mentioned savings problems with regard to small savers and small depositors.  The ACC have made a case to the Department <Col N="357" /> of Finance with regard to this problem and it is being examined at the moment by the Minister for Finance. With regard to the loans being confined to agriculture and fisheries, under statute the ACC are confined to giving loans only under these two headings.  To do otherwise it would be necessary to have an amendment of the statute.  I thank the Senators for their contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for instilling a bit of boom and bloom into this particular sector because all of us agree that it really needs some confidence to be injected into it.</P>
      <P>For a number of years the agricultural sector has been suffering from a continuing loss of income.  Any Government sponsorship or scheme or indeed the working party of which I have the honour to be a member, that can do something to instil confidence in the farming community must be welcomed.  Unfortunately, in spite of the efforts of various Governments &mdash; the past and the present one &mdash; we are still faced with many dilemmas in trying to increase production and getting the industry moving again so that people will have confidence.  We must realise that many of the schemes we initiated are having a very poor response.</P>
      <P>Doctor Ryan, Director of An Foras Talúntais, when he wrote an article in a recent publication <i>Farm and Food Research</i> pointed to the fact that over the previous decade every £100 of gross farm output generated could only produce £31 which could be retained by the family farm income.  The other £69 of this gross figure went to pay expenses and farmers had to have family farm purchases which involved a very high rate of inflation.  In addition he said many farmers increased their borrowings at rising interest rates and many factors in domestic and external economic markets worked against the interests of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers are progressing and have to survive on the land in all kinds of weather.  In spite of that, even with the best advice available to them through ACOT and other institutions &mdash; in which we are all directly or indirectly involved &mdash; all their efforts seem to have come to <Col N="358" /> nil over the past four or five years when their incomes dropped between 50 per cent and slightly less.</P>
    <P>Taking that into consideration the impact of a falling income on the farming community had a direct effect on farm output and also on employment in agriculture, which has continued to decline by 2,000 or 3,000 people over the past decade.  These are people that we can ill afford to lose because there are no jobs in any other sector, as can be proved by the continuing rise in unemployment figures. If we are to make a contribution to the farming community and their programme we must use the information available to us and implement the plan at the farm gates.  The modest growth rate over the next four years which the plan would cover is about 2½ to 3 per cent.  To achieve that we would have to increase our cow numbers, which have continued to drop for a number of reasons, most of them economic.  If we are to increase our cow numbers by 300,000 which is the possible figure over the next four years, increase our output of milk and beef production, reduce our calf mortality rates where we lose a quarter of a million livestock per year because of disease and avail of this calf heifer incentive scheme, we would have to ensure that low cost funds would be available to farmers.</P>
    <P>In this regard we would like to compliment the chairman and the board of the ACC and indeed the chief executive officer, who comes from the same county as the Minister.  They realise how difficult it is to live on small farms in the west.  I would ask them to do away with as much of the red tape or bureaucracy as possible and still satisfy the European bureaucrats in trying to ensure that farming credit is available.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned at the low number of people who have applied to date &mdash; and the closing date is quite soon &mdash; for the various interest subsidies from the EEC and the lending institutions, including the ACC.  We are aware from statistics that over 10,000 farmers are in dire financial difficulty.  If the applications do not match that we must seriously look at how we have applied the scheme. <Col N="359" /> Is there sufficient confidentiality?  Is there sufficient lack of red tape?  Do farmers have to go and bare their souls to peace commissioners throughout the country to benefit under these schemes?  Farmers are a very proud race.  They do not want handouts.  They want assistance to increase production, assistance to implement schemes that they have been advised on.  We must make sure that these low cost funds are easily available to enable them to do that.  If the applications do not increase to a significant number something must be wrong and the ACC, the body with direct responsibility will have to have increased capital made available to them.  The ACC will have to look at where the scheme has fallen down, because the necessity for it is beyond doubt.  I notice that a previous Minister's budget included a figure which would allow the ACC to lend something like £70 million.  That kind of injection of capital would increase production and help to put agriculture back on a good footing.</P>
    <P>There are just a few other comments I want to make regarding help to farmers. One of them is in connection with the eradication of tuberculosis and brucellosis. We are now recommending through the Animal Health Council to the Minister that a realistic form of compensation be made available to farmers who find themselves in the dilemma of having their cattle locked up.  There is an EEC scheme available to our own Exchequer in the sum of £4 million this year and it worries me that because of an embargo on employment in the public sector we are unable to implement this scheme, and it would only take about 70 or 80 clerical officers throughout the country to implement it.  It would be a tremendous saving to farmers if this fund could be administered.  I do not need to go into details about it because I am sure every farmer representative, and indeed the Minister, is aware of the terms of the directive of 21 April setting this up.  If an exception could be made in the public sector in agriculture, which has always taken second place to most other industries in this country in spite of its importance <Col N="360" /> to the community, this scheme of £4 million could be of direct benefit to the farmers in assisting them in disposing of animals at the appropriate time without fear of them being locked up and without fear of missing a market.  This is something that the Minister, and the Minister for Finance, who is part of the team that negotiated the package, should look at.  The Minister who now controls the purse strings was part of that team that negotiated the package and we cannot implement it because that Minister has now put an embargo on recruitment in the public sector.  As it is a new unit, as it is a new scheme being funded by the Community and has nothing to do with our national Exchequer what we are doing is reneging on our responsibilities to eradicate disease and our responsibility to reimburse the farming community the expense which they must incur now if they are to survive.  I would ask the Minister to look particularly at that.  I commend the ACC for their performance to date.  But I would say that if the scheme initiated recently does not attract an appropriate response from the farming community then something must be wrong in the implementation of it and we have responsibility to look at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister this evening.  He has made a very worthwhile contribution on the accounts and the programme of the ACC.  I would like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the staff of the Agricultural Credit Corporation for the great work they have done in developing agriculture.  Over the last four to five years the turnover of the Agricultural Credit Corporation has doubled.  That is a measure of the confidence that the staff of that organisation have placed in the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACC is often expected to fund agriculture when other institutions have failed to do so.  That puts it in the area of providing risk capital to develop the very industry which is the basis of our whole economy.  They have an excellent network of branches throughout rural Ireland which are well staffed and quite capable of looking after the financial <Col N="361" /> needs of Irish farmers.  They have an excellent chief executive who knows the problems.  They have a deputy chief executive who is known throughout the length and breadth of the agricultural community of rural Ireland in the homes of farmers for the great work and the great knowledge he has of the problems of Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>I would like to broaden the thing and say a few other things here this evening. One of the areas I would like to refer to is our farm modernisation scheme.  There are a number of categories in that scheme as some farmers who were classified over the past few years are now reaching their term in the categories they were in.  One of the categories which was brought to my attention since my elevation to this House was the one relating to a farmer in the high transition category who had done a good job in farming, had improved his milk yield from 600 to 900 gallons, who did everything right but when he went for reclassification found himself in the commercial category.  We must, whether at home in Dublin or in Brussels, correct that situation because that farmer was being categorised, on the farm accounts that he had kept himself, because he had done a good job, and not on the comparable income under which he should have been classified.</P>
    <P>The real problem facing agriculture today is farming.  According to statistics we have 150,000 farmers and 50,000 of those farmers are depending on an income outside of farming; they are really part-time farmers.  We have another 50,000 farmers who are barely earning a subsistence income, and we have 50,000 farmers in the bigger category.  Our smaller farmers have been the backbone of our country for generations.  Many of our rural towns and villages have suffered from the downturn in agriculture &mdash; the service sector, the garages, the hardware shops.  All of these have suffered because the small farmer was so hard hit in the economic situation.  I know it is outside the control of the Government to correct the agricultural problem, because it rests with Europe.  But let us go back to 1974, the year when we were entering the EEC when we were gaining handouts.  It was <Col N="362" /> quite easy to negotiate in Brussels, when anything one brought home was a handout and one did not have to fight as one does today, when one did not have to face the Maggie Thatchers or any other hard government in Europe.  We saw agriculture slip in that year.  That was the year when the rot set in in Irish agriculture, when we saw our national herd substantially reduced, having been built up in the previous term by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Gibbons.  We have never recovered from that.  We were advised in certain sectors in agriculture that we would be better off to get out and close down than to continue.</P>
    <P>The small farmers put in 50 per cent of our total milk supply.  They are the basis of our whole cattle industry and we must look after those people.  They must get incentives to improve their income and those incentives must be production incentives.  There is no point in giving hand-outs for doing nothing.  Farmers do not want that.  If a farmer produces 600 gallons of milk and increases that to 800 he should get something to compensate him for doing that.  That is how we are going to keep our people on the land.  If we continue to go in the direction we are going we will see a rural Ireland denuded of farming and of farmers.  That would be tragic for this country.  We cannot afford to have another 10,000 or 20,000 people a year on our dole queues.  That is not the way we must do it.  We must keep those people where they naturally belong.</P>
    <P>Referring to the area of credits, I would like to go back to the years 1979-80. We will see a very realistic approach made by our Ministers for Agriculture and Finance at that time, Deputies O'Kennedy and MacSharry, when they went about negotiating credit in Europe. The exchange under-written by the Government introduced £50 million into the Agricultural Credit Corporation which was lent out at that time at approximately 12½ per cent.  Due to currency fluctuations the interest rates crept up to about 15 per cent and settled at about 14 or 13½ per cent.  We must have a further injection of this sort of capital into agriculture.  We must have something <Col N="363" /> similar again for the purpose of a productive investment scheme.  The restrictions that have been placed on the European Investment Bank money which have been in the hands of the corporation for quite a while are too restrictive, and I believe we must look at a broader area of finance, something like the productive investment scheme that was introduced in 1979-80.</P>
    <P>The other area to which I would like to refer is the area of deposits within the corporation.  Depositors are the life blood of the corporation, particularly the small depositor and he must get concessions. The corporation must have equity with other institutions who take in money in deposits, so as to have a very strong and useful source of funds to develop agriculture.  As things stand at the moment they are restricted because of taxation restrictions against the banking institutions and the trustee savings banks.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the Central Bank report which stated recently that farming incomes would increase by 28 per cent.  Taking that as starting at a very low base and looking back over the period of years it is some time since agriculture slipped to such a low level.  I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating our Minister for Agriculture on the great work he did in Brussels this year under the greatest difficulties ever faced by an Irish Minister in the introduction of the calf subsidy, which is a substantial means of income to Irish farmers.  I would also like to say that the interest subsidy which was introduced at 5 per cent is indeed a substantial help with the rescue package which has been referred to by Senator Ferris.  It is the approach of some of our financial institutions which is frightening people away from applying for that package.  There is quite a substantial amount of paper work involved.  I would like to see the banking institutions being more co-operative with clients than they have been.  It is in the interest of the institutions to fully participate in that package.  It is a good package. We have waited quite a long time for it.  But for the change of Government and having a new Minister for Finance <Col N="364" /> we would probably never have seen it.</P>
    <P>We have seen quite good packages introduced by Deputy MacSharry when Minister for Agriculture.  There was the lime subsidy.  We had seen a substantial drop in the use of lime in the country, which was very serious from the agricultural point of view.  I am glad to say that the conscientious farmers have purchased substantial quantities of ground limestone and employment is increasing at some of our limestone quarries.  This is a good result of an incentive which was brought in from Brussels.</P>
    <P>We have other incentives, the subsidy in regard to the animal breeding programme which resulted in a substantial swing back to artificial insemination which was in the interest of the national economy because we are going to see a very substantial increase in breeding of female cattle, namely, friesians which are so badly needed for the dairy industry and for the national herd.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris referred to the embargo on the public service.  It was not Deputy MacSharry who put that embargo on the public service.  Farmers are asking why the animal disease moneys that were available from Europe were not made available to the Irish agricultural community. We all know that it was for a different reason.  It was like the budget we had in July 1981 when agricultural grants were substantially reduced, when we had a reduction of 5 per cent, when incentives which were so badly needed by the farming community were removed.  We have seen the standard of farm yards.  We have seen that high standards are so necessary that we should have the incentive to develop them and bring them up to the right standard.  One very important point was that grant aid was totally removed in the area of concrete yards.  That was a retrograde step.  This must be reintroduced.  We must continue with the development in that area if agriculture is to be modernised at farmyard level.</P>
    <P>I have said all I wanted to say.  The staff of the Agricultural Credit Corporation are the most dedicated and sincere people; they are basically agricultural people who qualified and who know the <Col N="365" /> problems of Irish farmers.  I would have no fear for the agricultural industry while we have a State institution staffed by such good and dedicated people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go over the ground which has already been well covered by the other Senators.  Being a farmer myself and coming from what I believe is a very good part of the country, I am sorry that the position is not as Senator O'Keeffe sees it.  I do not know what county he is from.  I am not talking politically, but I do not see it that way.</P>
      <P>First I want to congratulate the ACC. From my experience of them &mdash; I have been involved in farming and all types of committees for a very long time &mdash; they are doing a very good job.  One of the crippling things is the interest.  That is something they can do very little about. But as far as the farming community is concerned interest and the inflation are crippling blows.  Everyone would agree with that.  I have heard it said here &mdash; and quite rightly so &mdash; that the confidence in farming at the moment is very low.  It is also true that farmers' incomes have fallen dramatically over the last few years.  This is part of the problem at the moment.  It is a question of confidence.</P>
      <P>No doubt it is a question of money. Farmers borrowed, perhaps too heavily. I am not sure of that, and they would be the best judges of that themselves.  But when they borrowed they were then caught in the situation that times got bad and between inflation and interest it was extremely difficult for them to meet their commitments.  We would all concede that point.  Their incomes fell dramatically. Nobody in this House would dispute that.  Anybody with experience of farming could not dispute that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the ACC are very conscious of the fact that many farms and many of the agri-businesses have been in difficulty over the last 12 or 18 months.  Many of them have gone to the wall.  I am sure every effort was made by the ACC to try to keep those places in business.  I know they have sympathy for these businesses and I have been involved in some of the deputations to them in relation to some firms in trouble.  But sympathy is not <Col N="366" /> enough for anybody.  An ounce of help is worth a ton of sympathy.  For that reason I hope they will make every effort to keep farmers and agricultural businesses which are in difficulty going.  In this day and age the dole queues are long enough without adding to them.  I was involved quite recently in meeting a firm which had gone to the wall where a staff of 55 were possibly going to lose their jobs.  Fóir Teoranta, the ACC and the Minister should step in and see if anything can be done to keep these firms going.  I am not suggesting that good money should be poured in after bad in these situations. But with the dole queues so long at the moment we should be trying to keep these places going, because every effort is being made in most of these industries which have been in existence for a very long time and some of them have given a great service and employment.  For that reason I am appealing to all concerned to do everything they can in this regard.</P>
    <P>Confidence in farming is at a very low ebb at the moment.  The advisory staffs and the Government encouraged farmers to borrow money and produce more. They did this.  They were one section who produced more.  But unfortunately some of them found themselves in trouble.  A survey carried out by ACOT showed that about 10,000 farmers were in trouble.  I was on the board of ACOT at the time and I felt that the figure was on the low side, that it could be far greater.  The survey was carried out by the advisers of the ACOT board and they were not in touch with all the farmers in the country. Many farmers are not prepared to tell everybody if they are in financial difficulties. Nobody would dispute that.  If one has plenty of money one does not mind letting people know, but if one is in dire trouble most people would prefer people not to know it.</P>
    <P>The ACOT board had great problems. They were a new board, getting off the ground.  One of their greatest problems was that they had very little money to get started.  Most of the plans of the directors and the board for the development, advisory and education side of it are still on the shelf because the money was not there to do the type of things the ACOT <Col N="367" /> board had in mind.  Regional offices around the country remain nearly unstaffed at the moment.  I had an experience only the other day with my own ACOT committee in Louth where the number of scholarships is being reduced from possibly 16 to eight, the reason for that being that the allocation of money was reduced.  We are being told we must work within this allocation of money.  Then we talk about educational programmes.  In regard to educational programmes, reducing scholarships must be a step in the wrong direction.  It is a sad thing to have to say that this will have to be done.  That could be the position in other counties too.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the great deal made in Brussels in regard to cattle. I do not want to belittle the efforts of any Minister in Brussels.  I am sure all of them do their best.  But the Minister presents a false picture.  It always leads to problems and divisions between town and country, because when Ministers down through the years came back from Brussels with packages, they were met at the airport by bands and all the fanfare because they brought home millions for farmers.  When our friends in towns and cities read about it they think we are all marching up the steps of the bank with this money.  Does anybody realise the amount of money which reaches the farmers' pockets as a result of some of these deals?  In this speech we hear the farmers will receive an 11 per cent increase for cattle &mdash; I am sure that is over 1981.  I sold cattle in June 1981, and the price is lower today, in 1982, than this time last year.  How does that 11 per cent affect the situation?</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the calf subsidy.  If it is operated as it is intended I would look upon it as a real disaster.  Inspections were to have taken place at certain points, and I think that was called off because some people do not agree with the way it is being done, and I for one do not accept it either.  We have now a situation when people must take their calves to certain centres to be inspected every so often.  It is not a great arrangement; I think it is the worst arrangement <Col N="368" /> we could think of.  I have had many phone calls from farmers throughout the county about this.  They were dissatisfied with this arrangement.  They felt it was not workable.  They felt that there was a great danger from the disease eradication point of view in taking these animals to the inspection points.  Nobody can disagree with that.  Anyone who had suckler herds would find it almost impossible, or a very difficult job, to collect animals and keep them tied in a shed for a day, and bring the calves along as well.</P>
    <P>When it is an EEC scheme, we should try to get every farmer to benefit from it. We should be making everything as easy as possible.  I want Government Senators to tell the Minister involved to have a rethink on that, because as far as I am concerned &mdash; and I think I am speaking for a great number of farmers in my area &mdash; it is an arrangement that does not suit. I do not think it is very difficult for inspections to be carried out as they were some years ago and the cow scheme, or any other schemes, where animals were inspected or tagged in the man's farmyard. Because we have not made a lot of progress down the years with the disease eradication programme there is an additional risk now.  There are many people I know who will not take their small animals to an assembly point because of the risk of disease.  I would like the Minister of State to carry that message to the Minister responsible, because this is very important.</P>
    <P>I am not presenting a gloom and doom situation.  We would like to get away from that situation, but we cannot bury our heads in the sand and say everything is well, because nothing could be further from the truth.  There is no doubt that some farmers are in dire trouble.  Not everyone wants to admit this, but it is a fact.  We have gone through a few very bad years.  For that reason &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Lennon, you have two minutes left, and please relate your remarks to the motion, which deals with agricultural credits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to the motion, as I see it.  I hope what I am saying is <Col N="369" /> relevant at this stage because we are talking about agriculture and the problems that exist in agriculture at the moment.</P>
      <P>In relation to the borrowing of money and to the lending agencies, I want to congratulate all the lending agencies, particularly the ACC who have been kind to the farmers.  I do not disagree with this at all.  Maybe most of this money was lent when things looked good, but at the moment there is a reluctance on the part of many farmers to borrow.  This is indicated in the ACC report where the proposed borrowing for 1982 appears to be downwards.  Interest rates are such &mdash; and hopefully something will be done about them &mdash; that they prohibit anybody from borrowing because farmers simply cannot repay.  For that reason I consider that to be one of our greatest problems.</P>
      <P>Something has to be done about the cattle population.  While I welcome any scheme which will increase our cattle population, I felt this calf scheme could have helped, but I am sorry to say that at the moment this does not seem to be on. I would like the message carried back to the Minister that while I believe these millions are there on paper for a calf scheme, I do not think that is going to be taken up if it is operated as it is proposed to operate it at the moment.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I want to thank ACC who in my experience always have been very helpful and very co-operative.  They should take note of the few points I made in relation to people in dire trouble and I believe there are many of them, unfortunately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillaHannon" hpid="Mrs. Hannon Mrs. Hannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hourigan said it was very important that we have a plan for agriculture.  I am aware that the ACOT board produced a four-year plan for agriculture and this was presented to Deputy Dukes, who was Minister for Agriculture at the time.  The Minister of State stated that the Minister for Agriculture has set up a committee to produce a four-year plan for agriculture, and this is to be brought back to him in six months' time.  As far as I know, Senator Ferris is a member of that committee.  He is a representative of farming organisations and farming interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> We are all aware that agriculture is of major importance to Ireland in terms of employment and output.  The agricultural interest is of greater relative significance to the Irish economy than to any other EEC member state, except Greece.  Farm production accounts for 70 per cent of GNP and about 75 per cent of agriculture is exported.  Because of the low import content of agricultural produce, the industry's contribution to the country's balance of trade is indeed significant. Almost one-fifth of our work force is engaged in farming.  The EEC average is just 8 per cent.  However, the importance of agriculture as a source of employment extends well beyond the farmers' gate.</P>
    <P>The use of credit services by farmers has increased ten-fold in the decade of the seventies, and in cash flow terms is probably the biggest single input into agriculture accounting for a higher proportion of growth output than either feed or fertiliser.  Expertise in the use of credit and the associated tax accounting and financial management have not grown in the same proportion, unfortunately. Profit margin in farming has dropped dramatically in recent years so the management of finances is of prime importance at the moment.  The consequences of this drop in profitability are very serious, particularly for farmers who are in the early stages of development and are depending on surplus cash to reinvest in development or to service loans.  A survey carried out by ACOT in July 1981 identified 9,997 farmers in serious financial difficulty who could not meet their repayments.  I would say this situation has deteriorated since then, and in my own county of Meath I know of 100 farmers in such serious difficulty that their only option is to sell.</P>
    <P>A large proportion of finances for farming comes from the ACC, and the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies believe that the ACC are fulfilling a useful function by providing specialised credit to agriculture which would otherwise be unavailable, and by stimulating competition in agricultural banking.</P>
    <P>Again in that report it was pointed out that in recent years ACC's profitability has remained low in part because of the <Col N="371" /> predominance of fixed interest lending and substantial losses on foreign exchange borrowing.  In his report, the chairman of the ACC said that advances under loans during the year up to December 1981 amounted to £455.8 million.  However, advances for the year amounted to £114.4 million, a decrease of 13.2 per cent.  This drop in the level of lending activity reflects the continuing erosion of farmers' confidence which started back in 1979.  In arriving at the profit for the year of £1.9 million, the corporation took into account, and increased the provision for bad and doubtful debts, again, I feel, a sign of the times.</P>
    <P>The major contribution to the recurrent recession in farming and a most important deterrent to borrowing is the high level of interest rates.  Few, if any, farming projects taken in isolation can service loans of up to 20 per cent.  For a number of reasons Irish farmers pay a higher than average interest rate and higher repayments than other Irish borrowers. This is not because of any bias by the lending institutions, but because the credit system, as used by consumers and businesses, has a longer period over which to borrow and match their needs. The fact that home loans are often subsidised and are always long term, and that such a high proportion of credit to commercial sectors is either revolving overdraft, or tax-based, results in the anomaly of farmers paying more and repaying faster.</P>
    <P>A recent survey by the Agricultural Institute suggested that financial aids to farming should be more flexible.  The study showed that the setting up of a new dairy enterprise would need a term loan of 15 per cent over 50 years on borrowed capital, whereas the expansion of an existing enterprise would need only a five year loan repayment period.  The ACC report, however, points out that farmers are still prepared to borrow at reasonable interest rates, as evident by the interest in the loan negotiated by the ACC from the European Investment Bank at a rate of 14 per cent.  This was made possible because of the Government underwriting <Col N="372" /> the exchange risks.  These loans are available for up to 12 years and for most development purposes.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister say that in addition to lending by the banks a provision of £100 million is included in the Public Capital Programme for 1982 to meet the expected level of demand on the ACC for credit by farmers.  Hopefully as a result, no farmer with a worth-while project for the expansion of the productive capacity of his farm will be denied access to credit.</P>
    <P>Everybody has pointed out the need to increase the size of the national herd. This must be a top priority as our stock numbers are now at an all time low, in fact they are as low as they were in 1972. The provision of low cost funds to achieve this is essential.  The £22 calf premium and the £70 for each additional calf heifer will we hope, reverse these trends.  Foreign borrowing for this and other purposes is justified by the productive nature of the expenditure involved.  Looking to the future, the primary national economic objective as pointed out in the report must be to restore confidence and growth to Irish agriculture.  The potential for substantial and sustained growth still remains in the main section of agriculture. National economic and fiscal policies should be designed to encourage such growth.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the staff and the board of ACC for all they have done for the agricultural sector over the years, and hope they will continue to do so in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to this debate which I regard as very significant and important, but I am disappointed there are so few Senators in the House to listen to what we have to say about what we regard as our most important industry.  They do not have the time either to listen to what is going on or to make a contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to what the Minister said about the proposals and dissertations on our farming problems, and I think he covered almost all aspects.  I was disappointed to find that public representatives seek kudos for bringing back from <Col N="373" /> Brussels what they were sent out to get and for doing the job they are paid to do. I make no apologies to any Minister for saying that.  He is sent to Brussels to do a job and he has the necessary expertise and advice available to him.  This is what we expect from him.  I will compliment any Minister for coming back from Brussels with a package, be it big or small, although there is a division of opinion regarding the value such a package will bring to the farmer's pocket.  The Minister of State stated that the latest package will bring home something in the nature of £235 million, but that is disputed by the various farming organisations, and one feels it could be less than that.</P>
    <P>I have every respect for the politician's point of view, but equally I have respect for the non-political view, particularly the farming view, because it is in their interests to say exactly what is in this package for them.  We got an 11 per cent increase for beef.  These are sizeable figures. When we talk about a 14 per cent national pay agreement, or an even higher figure, which is adding fuel to an inflationary situation the 10 per cent to farmers is below what one could reasonably expect and is only half the inflation rate.  Consequently, I cannot see any improvement in real terms in farming incomes in the current year.  I have come across very few economists who predicted an increase of 5 per cent in real growth terms in farming incomes for 1982.</P>
    <P>Most of this ground has been covered. We came here to debate farming credit and the causes which brought about the lack of confidence in farming over the last few years.  While I am not directly involved in farming myself, nonetheless I have a deep interest in it because of the value it has for all of us.  When farmers' incomes are high, all sectors of Irish society benefit.  We have various processing factories closing down.  Meat factories and various other plants, garages and so on are experiencing what the farmer experienced over the years.  I hope we have reached the low point in the experience of the farmer because I am interested in the development and growth of the economy and in the prosperity <Col N="374" /> of the Irish people rather than in creating any division between the rural and urban dwellers.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed when I heard what Senator O'Keeffe had to offer &mdash; and he mentioned specific names.  The industry is far too important to be used to score political points.  I once had occasion to debate important farming issues with a previous Minister for Finance &mdash; he was not of my political persuasion &mdash; and we came to the conclusion that the industry was too important to be used for party political gain.  I hope we will refrain from that and get down to the important business of promoting growth in agriculture, which is vitally important to all sectors of our economy.  During the time of the high interest rates, over the period of 1979 to 1981-82 &mdash; and it took possibly a few years for the message to strike home to the respective Governments &mdash; farmers experienced difficulties, they had promoted and developed their farms for the purpose of increasing farming output, and that is to be commended.  In line with the advice given to them by the advisory service, an excellent service, they borrowed money at 10 per cent to 12 per cent and within a few years were paying as high as 20 per cent.  That is where the real problems arose.  I doubt very much if farmers who got caught in that web visualised a time when they would experience the awful trauma of having to face bank managers and various lending agencies.  I compliment the ACC for their patience, but like all lending agencies, they are paid for a specific purpose and we should not come in here to flatter them.  They are a State-sponsored body doing a fine job, and I congratulate them for it.  I hope they will continue to exercise prudence in offering moneys to particular types of farmers.  I say &ldquo;prudence&rdquo; because farmers sometimes have borrowed money recklessly and in anticipation of growth that never materialised.  It has been the experience of the farming sector that the high prices paid for land, in competition with people who may have deserved land, has created enormous problems, and in these circumstances they expect to be bailed out by the finances of the State.  The majority of <Col N="375" /> people who borrowed for productive purposes were caught in that web of high interest increases.  That was the problem. It will take time before we undo the damage that was done in that period.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the rescue package that was promoted by the banks, the IFA and the other agencies to try to provide some form of support and assistance in their dilemma.  It is bordering on the ridiculous that we should ask any farmer &mdash; and it was mentioned here that few people have come forward and it is estimated that 10,000 people are in severe financial difficulties &mdash; to disclose his innermost thoughts, so to speak, about his financial difficulties to an outsider &mdash; a peace commissioner.  While peace commissioners may sign documents, and may not wish to know what is written in them, nonetheless it should be their responsibility and their obligation to know exactly what is in a document before they sign it. We should dispense with that type of activity and allow the banks and the agricultural advisory service to do that job.  They have all the relevant knowledge. Let them do it.</P>
    <P>The £22 calf subsidy came very late in the year.  I do not think it will benefit farmers in the current session because most calves will have been born before the 20 May.  We are now arriving at a situation, again equally ridiculous, when we are asking to have the births of calves recorded &mdash; the issuing of birth certificates for calves.  Not only that, but we are expecting farmers to bring them to a central location point so that these certificates can be issued.  There are problems of disease attached to that.  We all know from experience &mdash; and I know from experience on my family farm &mdash; that when you go to the mart and bring home a few calves you may have a large number of uncontaminated animals and automatically they become disease prone.  That is the fear being expressed by many of my farming colleagues.</P>
    <P>There was a motion promoted at a committee of agriculture meeting recently where the Department were asked to dispense with that method of trying to find out what calves are available <Col N="376" /> for the subsidy in the current, or any future, years.  I suggest that the Minister of State carry back to the appropriate authority the suggestion that they carry out spot checks and make the penalties so severe that if a farmer wishes to deceive in this respect, he will refrain from doing so because if he is caught, he will lose far more than he could ever benefit.  That is the way to do it &mdash; spot checks.  Farmers are decent honest people in the main and very few of them would even attempt to deceive in that respect.  This would be the simplest way to do it, and it would be far less costly administratively and so forth.</P>
    <P>Many of the points I wished to raise have already been discussed.  This is a vitally important industry to our nation, and any attempt to bring cheap finance to it is most commendable.  I applaud it and support it fully.  I echo the sentiments expressed on numerous occasions by our European member, Mr. Maher, when he said that quite a large percentage of imported foreign agricultural produce is being sold in our supermarkets for the housewife.  While that situation obtains, if you go down the country on a May Saturday morning you will find most of the cauliflowers on display in the local supermarket have come in from Amsterdam. That is the situation we have to contend with.  Unless we face up to it we will have fewer and fewer farmers producing these commodities because there will be no profit in it for them.  Farmers will expand and develop their farms if they can be assured of a reasonable return for their investment.  We have ploughed a tremendous amount of money into various kinds of export-orientated industry and the return might be as high as 25 per cent to 30 per cent.  On a similar type of investment, farmers would be lucky to get 2 per cent to 5 per cent, and I am using figures liberally in that respect.  They are open to check.</P>
    <P>Again I would like to emphasise the importance of agriculture and the importance of investment.  A farmer should not be restricted from investing because he is afraid he will be putting a noose around his neck at some stage in the future. Marketing our produce is vitally important, <Col N="377" /> and I compliment the various marketing agencies for farming produce &mdash; An Bord Bainne, CBF and others.  Any incentive through State aids that can be given to them are worthwhile, and I support them.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity of speaking on this motion.  It was a worthwhile motion and, again, I would like to add my voice and congratulations to the ACC and hope they will continue to extend and expand their work in providing much needed finance for many hard-pressed farmers.  Equally I hope they will prudently apply their powers in the application of that finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one or two remarks about the special rescue package which the present Minister for Agriculture introduced some time ago and which has been referred to by quite a number of speakers here this afternoon. Perhaps, having discussed this package as we have done, we may have even further dampened its prospects of success. It is a very worth-while and necessary scheme, and one which took a very considerable time to bring to fruition.  Speaking as one who was involved in its initial stages and with the negotiations with the banks, the ACC and the farming organisations, many of us would have felt that this scheme could have gone into operation earlier.  However, now that it is in being and the numbers that have applied not being indicative of those in the farming sector known to be in financial difficulty, it behoves us to try to improve that situation in the remaining fortnight available for applications and to look for an extension of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a fear amongst some in the farming community who are in financial difficulties and who would be eligible for this scheme that the statement of their assets and liabilities could involve them at some time in the future in some problems with the Revenue Commissioners. It is important that these fears be allayed and that the Department of Agriculture and the agencies interested in this scheme aim at finding out those who are genuinely in difficulty, and making the scheme <Col N="378" /> available 100 per cent to them.  These farmers should be encouraged by their agricultural instructors and their lending agencies to complete application forms in full and on time.  Senator Ferris's earlier remarks that people may have to bare their souls to a peace commissioner is a gross exaggeration.  A peace commissioner has to sign those forms and be a witness to one's signature, but is in no way involved in the detailed analysis of what is on the form, and there may be a way around that difficulty.</P>
    <P>For far too long, we have exaggerated what can be done.  All the State can do in situations like this is deal with the genuine situation, and this is a fairly genuine attempt at doing that.  Therefore, as a farmer myself, I would encourage, in so far as I can, any farmer in financial difficulties to avail of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Regarding the overall situation, emphasis has been placed time and time again in the course of the debate on the importance of agriculture to our economy.  This could not be emphasised too much.  We in this economy are uniquely dependent on agriculture, with farmers making up virtually 25 per cent of our population and a further 25 per cent depending for employment on the processing of milk, beef, and other foods and on the service area.  A developing, prospering, growing agriculture is something which we all want to see at the earliest date.  Agricultural produce accounts for 40 per cent of our total exports and the buoyancy and growth in that sector help greatly our balance of payments.  Any rescue scheme or scheme to improve credit facilities, helps a sector which, as I have outlined, covers a very wide range of employment in exports and in our total economy.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years we have had two massive haemorrhages in the national herd.  We had the 1974-75 crisis when the best part of 750,000 cows were slaughtered.  We had again in the 1979-80 period a very significant drop in our cow population.  The reasons for these occurrences have been well outlined and there is not great need to re-emphasise them, but one or two points have to be made. With the amount of farm development in <Col N="379" /> the four years between 1977 and 1981, 500,000 acres were reclaimed in this country.  In-wintering facilities were provided for vast numbers of cattle and we had begun to reach the day when we could see most of our cattle being brought into adequate housing at some realisable date in the future.  The confidence that was there and the additional jobs in the service and other areas in agriculture were all great boosts to the economy. The farmers were confident and the whole economy benefited.  We must see to what extent we can reintroduce this momentum, even if never to the same degree.</P>
    <P>The ACC and other agencies' figures show that, provided finance can be got at interest rates which farming profits can repay, farmers are prepared to borrow. Since it is traditionally a very under-capitalised sector, there is vast room still for improvement on many of our farms.  With the climate at the moment and with interest rates what they are, it is very difficult to ask small and medium sized farmers to get involved in intensive development on land improvement and the provision of in-wintering facilities which, if they are going to increase their yield of milk, beef or other farm produce they will require. Present farm profits could not sustain the borrowings required for such improvements, and it may require restrictive measures in other non-productive areas of our economy.  There is no way in which you can have increased social welfare, extend your health services and provide new schools &mdash; all these essential areas &mdash; unless the productive base of the economy is expanding, and expanding to an extent adequate to cater for these needs.  Our balance of payments and our inflation rate have to be corrected as expeditiously as possible, to bring down interest rates to the level where productive sectors in our economy can afford them.</P>
    <P>A number of schemes introduced over the last four or five years have relieved the pressure &mdash; interest subsidy schemes, the European Investment Bank and the underwriting by the Government of the difference in the exchange rate.  All of <Col N="380" /> these have contributed to stabilising the situation.  But we are coming from a base which, as other speakers have said, is a bit too narrow.  When you are talking, as the Minister did, about arresting the decline in agricultural incomes in 1981 &mdash; and this is obviously the true position &mdash; you were arresting it from the declining state of the previous couple of years. The necessary momentum will only happen when the overall economic situation is such as to allow profitability in enterprises and interest rates at levels which the industry can stand.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the decline in the cattle population, the fact that in 1972 we had almost 7 million cattle, of which slightly over 2 million were cows and that at the moment, the total cow numbers are below the 1972 level.  This is, for people engaged in that industry, a fairly frightening prospect.  Most of the borrowings we are talking about here were incurred to provide facilities for carrying additional cattle numbers.  If we want to justify investment we obviously have to be able to enlarge the enterprise.  We have got to increase milk yield.  We have to increase cereal output.  This has been fairly largely achieved.  The decline in cattle numbers is the fundamental problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see some members of the ACC staff here this afternoon, and tribute was paid to them earlier.  I think I should add a word of praise to that organisation for the great work it has been doing down through the years for agriculture. I will encourage that organisation to be as expansive as possible in the design of schemes particularly aimed at increasing our cattle numbers.  I know land improvement is important and provision of in-wintering facilities, where possible, but all of that goes to nought if we cannot get cattle numbers up to the level that our land can carry, and most of us know that the capacity of our land is still well under-utilised.  Our whole economy, which uniquely depends on a thriving agriculture, will benefit from these schemes.  I would say to officials in the Department of Agriculture and to the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the calf subsidies scheme not to paralyse it <Col N="381" /> with the type of organisation which would frustrate the whole scheme, taking into account disease eradication and the fears farmers have in relation to this area and the unnecessary documentation, and what have you.  To have a broader look at the operation of the new scheme, which has come late but obviously will be of tremendous benefit provided it is operated effectively and not frustrated, I feel confident that the Minister for Agriculture and his officials will organise a successful scheme which will be a forerunner of a very significant expansion of our cattle herd, so fundamental to a thriving agriculture.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to imports of food.  We have read about over the years, and far too often see the evidence on shelves in our shops and supermarkets, food imports from different parts of the world.  Figures have been thrown out of something like £400 million a year being spent on food imports.  Perhaps half of that is on imports which we could but do not produce ourselves: it is fair to say that at least half of that amount of money is being spent on produce which we produce here but which we produce badly, process badly, market badly.  In the area of organising the modernisation of our processing plants and marketing, taking into account the conditions we have here &mdash; disease free, climatic conditions and our natural conditions for the production of food &mdash; as a country we must explore to the limit the possibilities there are for developing that side of our agricultural industry.  The downstream activities and the jobs that are available in the fuller and finer processing of agricultural produce obviously all of us want to see developed, with a growing young population, with so many people looking for jobs and with the prospects having to come from the productive side of the economy which can sustain the services and the other expansions that we want to see in the social areas.  I would ask the Minister and his colleagues to do all they can to work out a new vigorous intensive programme for the development of agriculture, particularly processing and marketing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the <Col N="382" /> chairman, the board and the staff of the ACC on their report and on their performance during the year under review and on the expansion which they have obviously worked so hard to bring about over the past decade or so.  It is regrettable that there has been a downturn in that rate of expansion over the last couple of years.  I know of course that the modern generation does not save for the future, it borrows to spend today.  At the same time I am convinced that the customers of the ACC borrow to develop their holdings and their business and to increase production in their own, in their families' and in the national interest as well.</P>
      <P>Of course I recognise the strains and restraints under which the board operate their policy.  I should like very squarely to put on record my total opposition to the manner in which the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank control the affairs of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which has a statutory responsibility to provide the finance to develop Irish agriculture.  On 10 May 1972 the people voted in the referendum to join the European Economic Community.  I contend that the very next day the ACC and the lending houses should have altered their policies to cater for that decision, to put Irish borrowers, Irish farmers, on the same footing as the people with whom they compete in the agricultural industry. It is very difficult to be able to put our produce on the market in competition with people who have much more favourable conditions in which to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason that the ACC should have been given a free hand to negotiate hard currency loans from the money markets of Europe, from the European Investment Bank, where then and now interest rates are some ten or 12 points cheaper than the going rates here. It was in my view a grave error of judgment of the then Minister for Finance and the Central Bank because they frustrated the Agricultural Credit Corporation in their efforts to negotiate hard currency loans direct from the European banks.  They could have made an arrangement to have the Central Bank or the Government underwrite the fluctuating <Col N="383" /> interest rates if and when they took an upward turn.  However, after the experience of the last three years we find the Government and the Central Bank operate the very same policies whereby borrowers are now charged 21½ per cent when everybody knows that the return on capital investment in agriculture is not much more than 2 per cent.  I think it is criminal.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary how the people with all the figures and all the facts and directives do not take into account what is happening to the agricultural industry at present.  One does not have to be an economist to understand that if one has to service developing capital at those high interest rates, and to cope with record inflation rates, it is not possible to survive and to service that.  The lending institutions, both the ACC and the commercial banks, are slowly but surely grinding the agricultural sector into the ground. Unless a change of policy is brought about agriculture in Ireland will continue to slide even faster down the slippery slope to insolvency that it has done for the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>You will recall that some years ago we had a great national scandal here which involved Telefís Éireann, who had highlighted the money-lending debacle in the city of Dublin.  The entire country was aghast at that time with the brutality of the usury that was rampant in the city. But when one thinks today that the conservative and respectable lending agencies are operating the very same interest rates and policies that members of the board of a semi-State body were sacked over, because they allowed it to go on the media, one must agree that there is a change in the attitude the public have to this kind of problem.  The farmers in the country, especially those with faith and hope for the future and with the best advice available both from the advisory services and from the lending agencies, who borrowed to develop their farms and to increase their output a few years ago at interest rates of 9¼, 10 or 11 per cent now find that in two years these rates have shot up to more than 20 per cent.  It is very difficult for them to meet the <Col N="384" /> commitments they genuinely undertook. Their hope at present is based purely on ministerial promises that have been very slow to materialise.  Their faith in the future is being frustrated by well-heeled self-interest groups who themselves are trying to squeeze the very last pound of flesh in recompense for the extra work they say all these schemes necessitate for them, while at the same time farmers, their wives and their families are being slowly driven to the edge of despair.</P>
    <P>I believe that farmers, and especially young farmers, should read again the history of this country from the 1870s to and including 1883 and into the 1890s because I believe that unless policies change people who want to remain on the soil that was dearly won for them will have to pluck an occasional appropriate leaf from those history books that are stained with the blood and toil and sweat of so many of the generations that are gone before us.</P>
    <P>There must surely be a future for the Irish farming industry.  But if that is to materialise and if the living standards are to be maintained at a level of decency, then policies must be changed to accommodate the unfortunate downturn that has been experienced in this country in the past few years.  It is difficult to explain to the ordinary person, especially in rural Ireland, how interest rates here are in excess of 20 per cent while in the Northern counties the interest rates are not much more than half that amount. The co-ops there are facilitated with hard currency loans subject to an interest rate of 8½ per cent, with the 2 per cent currency fluctuating levy, and in turn charge their members and customers 2 per cent per month interest charge.  This is something that makes one think.</P>
    <P>This century certainly has seen great changes and great improvements.  We have had the machine age, we have had a scientific age and we have had the technological age, but as far as Irish farmers are concerned they are going through the age of the rip-off, because at every sector, whether it is public or private, they are being ripped off.  Take a case in point.  At this time of the year we go into silage but those who are in haymaking avail of bailing <Col N="385" /> twine, the price of which has increased since this time last year by 32 per cent.  Farmers are supposed to meet that by the much heralded 9 per cent farm price increases that took four, five or six months to negotiate.  But nobody seems to mind the cost of agricultural input. That is indicative of the trend of agricultural cost inputs and what farmers have to face.  It is something which is not taken into account by the lending agencies.</P>
    <P>In his annual statement, the Chairman of the ACC, Mr. Molony, a gentleman for whom I have the height of respect and recognise his commitment and his ability, commented on the growth of the corporation's lendings over the past five years, shown in Table I, which indicates a downturn. For instance, the restructuring of debts increased from a total of 9 per cent of the facilities offered in 1977 to 15 per cent in 1981, and the provision for land purchase was reduced from 14 per cent of their business to 7 per cent in 1981, and on livestock it is down from 18 to 11 per cent.  That again shows the slow down in the industry as a whole which has been highlighted here by practically every speaker.  Senator Smith dealt with it very concisely.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Chairman what exactly have they done?  The ACC recognise the problems, they give us the figures but they still carry on with the rack-rents on their merry way.  I think that they must demonstrate a realistic commitment to the improvement of Irish agriculture.  I would ask them to do something to give some hope to the industry that is on its knees at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the importance of agriculture to the country as a whole, it is appropriate that the first Private Members' Motion to come before the new Seanad is one dealing with farming. I attended a meeting of farmers recently and I described agriculture as a vital arm of the economy.  I was quickly told in no uncertain terms that agriculture is the backbone of the economy.  I had to concede that the correction was justified. When there is prosperity and progress in agriculture every other aspect of the economy benefits, but when things are <Col N="386" /> not going well for the farmers, as had been the case for some time past, all other sectors of the economy suffer also.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I agree completely with the chairman of ACC when he says:</P>
      <P>The primary national economic objective must be to restore confidence and growth to Irish agriculture.  An unambiguous national commitment to this objective is now a matter of urgency.  Agriculture is the country's major source of export earnings and the development of agriculture lies in a core of renewed development and growth in the economy generally.  This is vital if we are to help ourselves to emerge from the present economic recession.  On the one hand we can wait and hope for an upturn in the world economy in the belief that a rising tide will lift all boats and that our economy will rise with the rising economic tide throughout the world.  On the other hand we can remember the old saying that God helps those who help themselves. We can help ourselves by striving for renewed development and growth in agriculture.</P>
      <P>An increase in agricultural production will result in increased exports and in the expansion and development of the processing industry.  In this connection I welcome the recent IDA review of the agricultural processing sector, namely a strategy for the development of the agricultural processing industry in Ireland.  If the developments envisaged by the IDA in that document are achieved, the result will be a substantial increase in the number of jobs both in the processing industry and outside it.  I accept, however, the statement by the ACC chairman:</P>
      <P>Because of the effects of inflation, the general level of indebtedness and high interest rates, confidence in agriculture is still at a low ebb.  There must be a restoration of confidence before farmers will be prepared to commit themselves to the level of investment that will be necessary to bring about a substantial increase in agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That confidence, however, will quickly <Col N="387" /> return when farmers see the prospects of increased profits, in other words, a considerable improvement in the farm income situation.</P>
    <P>In the short time since he became Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan has been responsible for the introduction of a number of measures which I regard as steps in the right direction towards the restoration of farmers' incomes and farmers' confidence.  The new reduced interest subsidy scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulty, even though it has come in for some criticism, will ease the pressure on many farmers who had serious problems with debt repayments.  In this connection also, I welcome the commitment that the ACC will continue to adopt a sympathetic approach to any customers who are in genuine difficulty. Other low interest loans and interest subsidy schemes which are available can also play an important part in encouraging investment and restoring confidence in farming.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, it would appear that many farmers are not aware of the existence of these schemes or how they operate or who are eligible to avail of them. Steps should be taken to bring these measures to the notice of all farmers.  The recently announced heifer subsidy scheme and the calf premium scheme should lead to a considerable expansion in cattle numbers.  Farmers will respond, and as a result of these schemes we will see a much needed increase in the national herd.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of the comments and criticisms that were made of the arrangements in connection with the calf premium scheme.  Some of these arrangements are not in the best interests of the scheme and should be changed.  However, due to the negotiating skills of the present Minister for Agriculture, difficulties which had arisen in relation to the introduction of the three schemes which I have referred to were all resolved within three months of Deputy Lenihan assuming office.</P>
    <P>It is vital to ensure that any increase in cattle numbers will benefit the farmers and the country and that there will never <Col N="388" /> again be a repetition of the disastrous chaotic situation which arose in 1974-75. Here again I am satisfied that the Minister for Agriculture realises the importance of developing our Third Country trade for both live cattle and beef.  I compliment the Minister on the recently negotiated contracts with Libya and I wish him every success in the negotiation of similar contracts with Egypt and other Middle East countries.  It is now up to the Irish meat factories to adopt a vigorous marketing approach so that they can fulfil their responsibility to the farmers.  It is a sad situation when so many of the Irish farmers involved in cattle production do not trust the meat factories.  This is an attitude which should not exist between the supplier of the raw material and the processors, but unfortunately in many cases it is justified.  The onus is on the meat processing industry to reverse that attitude.  The only way in which they can do so is by paying Irish cattle producers the highest price possible rather than the lowest.  They can do this if they adopt a more energetic and imaginative approach to the whole area of marketing.</P>
    <P>When steps have been taken to improve the situation, there are many other problems affecting farmers which need to be looked at as a matter of urgency.  The first I will refer to is the problems which exist in connection with disease eradication schemes.  Farmers who are unfortunate enough to have reactor animals, to put it bluntly are being robbed or ripped off.  Smaller reactor animals are realising approximately half the replacement value.  I know a case of a farmer who recently had to dispose of five reactor weanlings.  They realised £750 or an average of £150 each.  The market value of these animals was at least £300 each.  That man could not afford to lose £750.  Farmers are morally entitled to the replacement value of any reactor animals they may have.  This can be done by considerably increasing the compensation payable, or by reverting to an arrangement under which the Department will purchase reactor animals by weight at current market prices.</P>
    <P>As well as suffering because of the low compensation for reactor animals additional <Col N="389" /> hardships arise because the herd in question are locked up.  Many farmers, in particular smaller farmers, whose herds are locked up cannot conserve any hay or silage for winter feed because they cannot relieve their stocking situation by selling off some of their animals.  I know of a farmer with 17 acres and 23 animals whose herd is locked up.  That man is going to have some serious problems when winter comes.  The hardship fund which exists in connection with the disease eradication scheme should be restructured so that payments from that fund can be made irrespective of the types of stocks involved.  One way in which the pressure on farmers with locked up herds could be alleviated would be to allow animals from locked-up herds to be eligible for purchase for export to Third Countries, provided they were taken directly from the farm to the boat.  This is something that should be considered.  I would also like the Government to consider bringing in the pre-movement testing which was promised so many months ago.</P>
    <P>Another area that needs to be looked at as a matter of urgency is the bringing up-to-date the costings for grants under the farm modernisation scheme.  I understand that the costings which are now being used are based on 1978 prices, and everybody knows the extent to which costs have increased since 1978.  Actual grants for drainage, land reclamation and farm buildings are working out at about one-third of the percentage they were supposed to represent.  In other words, the 30 per cent grant for farm buildings represents about 10 per cent of the actual cost of those buildings and the 70 per cent grant for drainage represents 25 per cent of the actual cost involved.  Perhaps this is one of the reasons ACC lending under these headings declined substantially in 1981.</P>
    <P>There are other measures which would help considerably in the restoration of farmer confidence.  In my own county of Roscommon, for instance, we would wish to see the remainder of the county designated as severely handicapped under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  At the <Col N="390" /> moment only the northern and western parts of the county are designated as severely handicapped areas.  The remainder of the county has a large proportion of marginal land, low income farms and declining agricultural population.  Much of it also is affected by major flooding problems caused by the Shannon and the Suck.</P>
    <P>Fragmentation is another serious problem. During the years the Land Commission did very good work in trying to eliminate this problem but now, their activities have been scaled down very much.  I believe this has been a mistake, certainly as far as the west is concerned. I ask the Government to instruct the Land Commission to re-activate the policy of acquiring and dividing land for the relief of congestion and the elimination of fragmentation.  There is no other way in which these problems can be solved in the more disadvantaged parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have had an opportunity of participating in this debate.  I compliment the ACC on the very excellent work they are doing for Irish agriculture. I have every confidence that with a constructive approach on the part of the State and the State agencies involved in agriculture, such as the ACC and the farmers, both individually and through their organisations, the prosperity that we all want to see will soon return to agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMallon" hpid="Mr. Mallon Mr. Mallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mallon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one central point I would like to make.  No other industry in this island points as clearly the nonsense of having two sets of policies within this small island as does the agricultural industry.  As one who lives and works in a rural area I can see at first-hand the way in which this nonsense exemplifies itself every day of the week.  When we in the North look at the situation of agriculture in the South there are many times when we go green with envy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many remarks have been made about the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  We would appreciate having a body like that, because we simply do not have such an organisation.  Anybody involved in farming over this past number of years will realise the way in which development <Col N="391" /> farmers have found themselves being hamstrung to banks as a result of the absence of such a body.  It is one of the tragedies we face but the real tragedy is that the farming industry will never realise its full potential within this island until there is a central authority to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan in his opening remarks made reference to a national programme under a national agricultural authority.  I do not have any doubts that it is one of the areas which would cross the political and religious divisions that exist in the North of Ireland.  I support the type of approach that has been suggested by Senator Hourigan, because I would interpret the word &ldquo;national&rdquo; in its truest sense as meaning a policy and an approach to suit the whole of this island.  Indeed, it was known in years past that the best Minister of Agriculture the North of Ireland ever had was a former Minister of Agriculture here.  Unless there is a serious input from the Irish Government in terms of EEC negotiations and in terms of the common agricultural policy the North will not be catered for properly under the present arrangements.  Catering for the 3 per cent involved in agriculture in Britain is not going to be to the benefit of people in the North of Ireland.  Indeed, the policy is consumer-orientated rather than producer-orientated.</P>
    <P>There is a real role here to be played by the Irish Government in terms of agriculture.  As I said, it is quite ludicrous to see the way in which there are two sets of prices, in some cases for people on the same farm.  We have got a new type of pig and cattle in the North of Ireland.  It is known as the commuter.  Those who know the Border area will know the type of pig and cattle I mean: it is the pig or the cow that makes constant trips up and down in the same lorry.  The reasons are perfectly obvious.  There is that type of anomalous situation right throughout the agriculutral industry, and it is soul-destroying to see.  In the debate here the shortcomings as they exist at present in this part of the country have been recognised but when we look at it from the <Col N="392" /> Northern situation we see something which we envy very much because we see a vibrant approach to a very central industry.</P>
    <P>This also applies to all the ancillary industries connected with the agricultural industry.  Indeed, if we had an approach on an all-Ireland basis we would eliminate many of the problems that exist in terms of processing and marketing and we would arrive at a situation when the Irish agricultural industry instead of being sold in two sections abroad would be sold as one.  This would give it a new dynamic.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record that irrespective of what happens within this island there is one thing certain, that the only way in which the agricultural industry in the North of Ireland will ever be seriously helped is by the efforts of an Irish Government.  I would like to put on record that this has happened in the past. I would like it to be on people's minds in relation to the future.  It is something which has been referred to by the Ulster Farmers' Union and by farmers of every tradition in the North of Ireland.  In the last analysis no British Government catering for a consumer society will ever give the type of consideration especially to the small farmer in the North of Ireland that is needed.</P>
    <P>The real potential as I see it will never be fulfilled until we have got one policy for the island.  I would like to thank Senator Hourigan for making the point about a national agricultural authority.  It is very important to have one set of negotiators in Brussels from our point of view, because unless we have got this harmonisation within the island in terms of prices we are going to have many sleepless nights &mdash; I refer to those of us who live along the Border as lorries come and go at all times of the night.  It is also important to have one set of marketing proposals, and one set of marketing structures and, above all else, one approach to the structural problems.  It is unbelievable in this present day that in the North of Ireland 32 per cent of the land is designated as under-used.  That is a tragic situation where there is so much unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> One of the starkest exemplifications of this was brought home to me quite recently in a little townland between County Armagh and County Monaghan. It is excluded from the designated less-favoured areas but all around it, north of the Border and south of the Border, was included.  This little piece of land, sticking out like a sore thumb, was excluded.  It exemplified for me the nonsense that exists within a small island when there is this division in a very central industry which is crucial to everyone's livelihood.</P>

      <P>As a person living in an urban area I feel it appropriate in some way to make a brief comment on this motion.  I realise that much of the emphasis by the ACC in recent years has been on the urban areas.  If you examine the decentralisation programme you will find that they have 50 branches in the big towns and cities of Ireland, which indicates to me that they are seeking, and rightly so, the urban deposit.  They are looking to people working in our factories or offices to deposit money with them and to continue the further growth of agriculture and this is only right and proper.  As we said before, we all realise that if agriculture is booming then the rest of the economy does well also.  Agriculture is the very basis of our whole economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report we are talking about is an excellent one.  The directors of the ACC and their staff all over Ireland, a real physical presence of expert agricultural people in our towns and cities, are to be congratulated on a fine report.  The report indicates that their deposits are up by £33 million and, having regard to the recessionary situation, they had an excellent year.  Their advances, which show an increase of £17 million, are still in keeping with the general financial climate.  It was interesting to note that in dealing with the distribution of funds and advances since 1977 they gave 14 per cent for land purchase and in 1981 they gave 7 per cent for land purchase.  It indicates to me that the ACC have been mindful of the way land prices have been rocketing over the past few years.  They said they should put a halt to the high prices <Col N="394" /> and, therefore, they did not advance money.  That was responsibility at its best.  They endeavoured to keep land prices at reasonable figures.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that every effort is being made to encourage the small savers. As the report indicates they are not coming forward as much as the ACC would like for reasons of taxation inequalities that exist between the ACC and the other deposit-taking institutions.  The problem of loan arrears has been discussed.  This was mentioned in a very real way in the report, and they give a lot of attention to the reduced interest scheme.  It is regrettable indeed that it has not been as successful as we all thought: it has been in many ways a failure.  I spoke recently to one bank manager who indicated to me that he had processed 12 applications and not one of them qualified for assistance. It seems to me that there is something wrong with the scheme.  While I know there is a period of two weeks extension, every effort should be made to help as many people as possible who have financial difficulty.  In so far as loan arrears are concerned, I think the ACC would be sympathetic to people who are in arrears, but at the same time it is right to say that they should not be asked to write off any debt where there are known assets.  Many people think that the ACC should be the last to be paid if their debts are due.  The ACC are doing a good job and should be paid in accordance with the terms on which they give out their money.  This allows them to continue the good work they are doing.  They are totally committed to the long-term development of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>In a debate on agriculture that we had in the Seanad before Christmas, I briefly referred to the fact that industry and other sectors seemed in some way to have a national plan.  I am glad that the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, in a very short space of time has seen fit to introduce a national plan.  It is right and appropriate that he should do so, and he has given us some date in October for it to be finalised.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the ACC, its directors and staff.  Long may they continue to work <Col N="395" /> for the betterment of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">

      <P>First, I should like to thank the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Barrett, for being with us and for his very lucid address this afternoon.  I would also like to thank the various speakers for their contributions.  It is fortunate that this debate was taken quite seriously.  It is true to say with perhaps with a few exceptions nobody tried to make a political football out of the situation.  There was an acknowledgement that this matter is so serious that we cannot start trying to score points on a political front.  However I could not let one point go without mentioning it, that is, that in the period of 1974 when we experienced very serious difficulties in the cattle trade, it had nothing to do with the then Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Clinton.  He was a very capable man in his position.</P>
      <P>I want to reaffirm for Senator Mallon that my concept of a national agricultural authority would certainly be on the lines of the authority he would envisage.</P>
      <P>With regard to people who are in dire straits and for whom rescue packages and so on are being designed, for most of them it will mean shedding assets and in many cases the disposal of stock on farms and Senator Fallon referred to this.  I think there is a very serious dimension in this.  We have several situations where perhaps a family farm of 50, 70 or 100 acres was developed and where the owner incurred indebtedness over the years which has now become intolerable. As a result of even modest development on a farm, or the addition of a few acres of land, the entire holding may be at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I do not think this can be allowed to happen.  For that reason I urge very strongly a freezing of interest, the implementation of moratorium or a combination of these in certain circumstances. I am not saying that all circumstances must be treated equally but there are some very genuine ones and I am sure the Minister is quite well aware of them. We cannot allow such farms to go the wall.  The people concerned who might be in their fifties and sixties would be out <Col N="396" /> of business totally and they would not be trained for any other line of activity.  We must take cognisance of that.</P>
    <P>Personally I support the concept of grants.  Grants are very useful and good in their own way, but the most important things for farmers are realistic prices for their produce and realistic levels of input costs, which would include credit.  If we have these things right it will enable farmers to carry on.  One thing we must bear in mind is that we have a very low income position.  We are expecting farmers to deal with a backlog of arrears and indebtedness that is mounting steadily day-by-day with an income that is only just sufficient for daily living.  There are these special cases that a rescue package or a Minister will not be able to deal with successfully unless there is an acceptance by the lending agencies that they will suffer some losses too.  This is the reality of the situation and there is no point in expecting a solution otherwise.</P>
    <P>In my view, unfortunately we have not witnessed all the problems as yet in agriculture. A lot of the dirt &mdash; if I can use the expression &mdash; has been shoved under the carpet because most of the real problems in agriculture will surface, unfortunately, in the months and perhaps in the year ahead.  It gives me no joy to say this but that is the reality.  If we take into account the last figures published by ACOT in relation to agricultural incomes, it is rather frightening to see that the levels of incomes for farmers for 1981 are lower than those who would qualify for the position of clerk-typists and so on.  It is rather alarming that out of those incomes we expect people to meet credit commitments and so forth.</P>
    <P>I will not go on because I appreciate the time constraints existing.  As far as land prices are concerned, there is one point which must be corrected.  I do not think that the ACC had a major influence on land prices.  The biggest influence on land prices was the commercial banks and that is a fact which must be put on record.  I ask the banks, together with the ACC, to be aware of the very serious position of farmers at this time and to give the kind of sympathy and tolerance that is required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the chairman, board and staff of the Agricultural Credit Corporation for the excellent work they have done.  I am very pleased that some members of the ACC have been with us during this afternoon's discussion.</P>
