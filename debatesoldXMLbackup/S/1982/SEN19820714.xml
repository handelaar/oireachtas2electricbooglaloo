    <Title>Gas (Amendment) Bill, 1982: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Members of Seanad Éireann will appreciate the historic significance of this Bill.  The Bill will provide the basic financial framework for a new national energy network.  It is, perhaps, not an exaggeration to compare the work now in hand in developing our gas grid with the launching of the Shannon Scheme in the late twenties, or Bord na Móna in the thirties.  This Bill is an early milestone in the emergence of a great new native energy source and I have no doubt that, in the time ahead, it will substantially benefit our economy and the living standards of our people.</P>
      <P>I believe we all appreciate the importance of the Kinsale Head field as a natural resource.  The most effective use we can make of that resource is to have it quickly and widely available for use in the premium market which is principally domestic use, and after that, commercial and industrial use.  The whole project is a formidable one based on an indigenous resource which can sustain itself.  This Bill is necessary to ensure that the money will be available to enable us to get on with the job and to bring the benefits of that resource to our people as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to raise from £30 million to £80 million the limitation both on the aggregate borrowing powers of Bord Gáis Éireann for capital purposes and on the aggregate of such borrowings which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current limitation of £30 million is set by sections 23 and 25 of the Gas Act, 1976, as amended by the Gas (Amendment) Act, 1980.  Section 23 refers to the aggregate of outstanding borrowings for capital purposes and section 25 relates to outstanding borrowings, other than borrowings out of the Central Fund, which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  To date, the total borrowings of the board amount to approximately £8 <Col N="937" /> million and the amendments now proposed are necessary to enable them to finance the Cork to Dublin natural gas pipeline and other projects.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann were established in 1976 and undertook, as their first project, to pipe natural gas, which is of very high quality and calorific value, from the Kinsale Head field to the Cork area.  This necessitated an onshore pipeline and associated transmission facilities necessary for the distribution of gas to users such as the ESB, NET, Cork Gas Company and other industries in and around Cork.  As Senators are aware, this goal was achieved successfully and effectively by the board.</P>
    <P>At the time of the decision to proceed to commercial production, the Kinsale Head field reserves were estimated to contain 1 trillion &mdash; that is, 1 million million &mdash; cubic feet of recoverable gas. This was sufficient to maintain a daily production of about 124 million cubic feet over a 20-year period and the contracted off-take in Cork area was set at this figure in an agreement between BGE and Marathon.</P>
    <P>Following experience of actual production from the gas field and review of its characteristics generally, the recoverable reserves have now been formally revised to 1.35 trillion cubic feet &mdash; an increase of 35 per cent on the original estimate. This is sufficient to support production of approximately 180 million cubic feet per day over the balance of the 20-year contract period.  Current off-take is approximately at this level and is accounted for by an additional allocation of gas to the ESB for 1982 and 1983.</P>
    <P>The upwards revaluation of the gas field's reserves by 35 per cent was a major factor in deciding to proceed with extension of the natural gas grid.  Another important factor was the report of the Town Gas Review Committee which concluded that there were distinct advantages, both in economic and energy terms, in allocating a maximum proportion of the natural gas resource to the premium markets in the Dublin area and other populated centres, especially those with existing town gas industries.  The present Government approved such a <Col N="938" /> policy because of its emphasis on more efficient and economic use of natural gas, savings on imports of premium fuels such as gas oil, revitalisation of the town gas industry and because it will make available to a large sector of the population an indigenous premium fuel.  I personally wish to see the natural gas grid extended to as many areas as possible outside Dublin where this can be done economically and efficiently.</P>
    <P>Clearly the construction of the Cork to Dublin pipeline is the first priority and will form the backbone of the national gas grid.  The contract for the construction of the Cork-Dublin pipeline to Dublin City Gate has been awarded to the Irish-Dutch consortium of Irishenco-Nacap at a cost of £27.4 million. The overall cost of the project is expected not to exceed £45 million.  This includes the cost of acquisition of wayleaves, engineering, communications and other related projects not covered by the pipeline construction contract itself. When provision is made for construction of the link from the City Gate, beyond Clondalkin, into Dublin Gas and the ESB, the overall cost of the project is estimated at under £60 million.  Contracts for both parts of the link into the city from Brownsbarn to Grove Road on the canal and from there to Dublin Gas and the ESB have just been awarded to the Irish-UK joint venture of Murphy International-Murphy Pipelines.  All projects are expected to be completed in time to have Kinsale gas flowing into Dublin by early next year.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that the most efficient use that can be made of the Kinsale field is to maximise the availability of gas for the premium domestic market and for use in industry and commerce generally.  As I indicated, the displacement of imported premium fuels such as gas oil is a primary aim.  The central heating market in houses, offices and factories will be an important area in this strategy. After that we must look to the availability of gas for direct use in industry.</P>
    <P>While these markets are being built up, the sale of residual gas to the ESB will contribute quite significantly to the economics of the pipeline and will generate <Col N="939" /> additional substantial revenue for BGE and the Exchequer.  Moreover, the availability of gas to the ESB will help to stabilise electricity prices to the consumer and save on oil imports, thus assisting our balance of payments.  Current savings on imports from all sales of gas by BGE are running at £200 million and will increase over the next few years as the gas grid is expanded to replace the maximum amount of premium fuels.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the allocation to Dublin Gas alone would reduce our energy import bill during 1983 by about £17 million on present consumption levels. As Dublin Gas are confident that they can expand the market for gas by six to eight times the present level, savings on imports by the end of the decade should be very significant indeed, reaching a level of about £80 million a year in 1982 terms.  On the financial side it is the Government's intention that the estimated cost of the entire project, that is, £60 million, should be 30 per cent funded from BGE's own internal resources.  This provides a reasonable level of internal funding while ensuring that a substantial proportion of BGE's surplus arising from the sale of gas will accrue to the Exchequer. The remaining 70 per cent of capital investment will be mainly funded by borrowings from the European Investment Bank on terms which are currently being negotiated.  This will leave a proportion of borrowings to be raised on the home market in a manner still to be determined.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that our primary objective is to bring gas to Dublin.  This is as it should be.  An improved gas supply to the existing market in Dublin and the availability of Kinsale gas at competitive prices to new customers will ensure that the premium market is exploited quickly and efficiently.  Because of this I was pleased to be able to announce recently that agreement had been reached between Bord Gáis Éireann and the Dublin Gas Company on the main provisions of a contract for the supply of gas. This will clear the way for Dublin Gas to receive supplies from Kinsale in January next year.  But, as I also said, we must <Col N="940" /> cast our sights beyond Dublin.  I am anxious that other towns should have Kinsale gas.  I am particularly concerned that existing town gas companies should be given the opportunity to get Kinsale gas where practicable.  Town gas companies such as Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford either have had consultancy studies carried out or have such studies in progress. In addition, BGE have recently completed preliminary route studies on possible spur lines to Limerick and Waterford and these studies are being considered at present.  While I am not now in a position to give a time scale for the completion of this essential planning for the second phase of the development of our natural gas grid, I can assure Senators that it is being progressed as quickly as possible having due regard to all factors involved.</P>
    <P>Senators will, of course, be aware that Cork Gas Company are already receiving supplies of natural gas.  At present the company are using the gas as a feedstock for the manufacture of town gas.  I hope that the company will be in a position to complete their programme of conversion to direct use of natural gas as quickly as possible.  I look forward to seeing substantial growth in their volume of sales and simultaneous expansion of their distribution system as natural gas becomes available direct to the consumer.  Indeed BGE are now anxious to proceed to the quick conclusion of a contract with the company in order to facilitate these developments.  Concrete progress has been made and I hope to see the matter brought to a conclusion shortly.</P>
    <P>The extension of the grid has also presented us with a valuable opportunity for positive and worthwhile co-operation with the North of Ireland.  I recently met with Mr. Adam Butler, the Minister of State with responsibility for energy matters at the Northern Ireland Office, to discuss a possible supply of natural gas for the North of Ireland.  The discussions covered supply schedules, duration of contract, price, price review mechanisms, capital investment and transmission costs.</P>
    <P>We reached agreement on the main terms on which gas could be supplied to <Col N="941" /> the North of Ireland and the Minister of State and I have already recommended these to our respective authorities.  We should be in a position to deliver gas to Northern Ireland during 1984.  This will be a very significant extension of our gas grid and I am confident that the very great benefits to be derived from it will be quickly reflected in our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>The whole development programme which I have just outlined will require quite considerable capital expenditure on the part of BGE.  As I have explained, this will be met partially from surplus revenue from the sale of natural gas and partially from borrowings to be raised by BGE.  Over the next few years, as the various stages of development take shape, I anticipate that borrowings not exceeding £80 million will meet BGE's requirements.</P>
    <P>This type of capital investment is to be welcomed because of the substantial benefits which can be expected to accrue to the economy.  I have already outlined some of these benefits.  Other immediate benefits which should also be mentioned relate to the very high level of Irish input into the project and the jobs it provides. During the period leading up to the commencement of the construction phase, there was great awareness of the need to maximise the Irish content.</P>
    <P>The co-operation of the IIRS, the Confederation of Irish Industry and others, was a major effort to ensure that the opportunity for use of Irish goods and services was highlighted.  As a result, I am pleased to be able to tell the House that, notwithstanding that the major items, such as the pipe and fittings, had to be manufactured abroad, 60 per cent of the value of the pipeline project will be sourced in Ireland.  In terms of jobs this means that 700 to 800 Irish people will be employed on the project overall.</P>
    <P>The building of the works main into Dublin city and further extensions of the grid which I have mentioned also promise substantial employment as the various projects get under way.  That this level of home input should have been achieved on a project of a type and size new to this country is a tremendous tribute to all <Col N="942" /> those who contributed to bringing it about.</P>
    <P>We must not overlook the immense benefits to town gas enterprises.  As I indicated earlier, the distribution of gas through these enterprises will revitalise what was an ailing industry, give security of employment to workers, provide opportunities for investment in what is becoming an expanding industry with bright prospects, and provide a unique opportunity for private industry to cooperate with the State in maximising the distribution and use of Kinsale gas.  I am confident that the House will support this Bill which is designed solely to enable the board to borrow for the project.  I therefore recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I should like to take this belated opportunity to welcome you to the House because when I spoke for the first time yesterday you were not here.  I am very glad to see you here.  I should also like to welcome the Minister.  This is my first opportunity to welcome him to the House.  I will not be hypocritical and say I hope they will have a long stay because if I can help it they will not.  Apart from the fact that they are fully qualified for their positions I claim that both of them are friends of mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a few questions to ask the Minister about gas.  The first is: how accurate is the estimate of the amount of gas available? I heard him say it is one million million cubic feet, which is sufficient to maintain a daily production of about 124 million cubic feet over a 20 year period. In the second estimate there was an increase of 35 per cent.  Will there be an annual check on the amount of the gas available?  The Minister compared this industry to the ESB when the ESB were set up in the late twenties.  The ESB helped us to become an industrialised country.  A mistake was made at that time which is being repeated now.  We have experience now which we did not have at that time.  In starting this gas project we should manufacture the equipment, the pipe line fittings, the conversion units for town gas such as cookers and other domestic equipment.  If they were manufactured here they would provide valuable <Col N="943" /> employment and also reduce our imports.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has made arrangements with the Northern Ireland Government about supplies to the North and that the matter is about to be ratified by both Governments.  While it is a good idea, we should not move too quickly until the position in Northern Ireland has settled down.  We could be linked very profitably with the Northern Ireland electricity grid but it has been blown up on several occasions.  If they blew up the electricity grid the same people could blow up a gas grid.  Until times are better and more hopeful in the future, we should delay taking that action.  I welcome this Bill.  The gas field is a great find for us.  Much of our hard earned money has been going out of the country on imported fuels.  This is the first step in putting our house in order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Daly I welcome the Bill.  What a transformation this is from the time when we learned in our geography lessons at school that we had no native source of energy except turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator went to the wrong school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first man to contradict that and question it was the late Seán Lemass who embarked on a very farseeing, visionary enterprise when he set about ascertaining whether we had any mineral resources and energy resources. All of us who lived through that scholastic era will be delighted to hear the then experts contradicted and to realise that we have this great natural native source of energy.  I take Senator Daly's point that we have to be very careful about maximising the benefits from this discovery. It would be easy to use it and sell it in all directions but first we must ensure that native employment is maximised in this project.  I am sorry to say that this has not been the case up to now.  Irish welders are unable to gain employment from this Dutch-Irish company.  They have been discriminated against in the <Col N="944" /> sense that the employment has gone to Dutch welders.  I would go so far as to say that our welders are every bit as good as any welders in the world and our work force is every bit as good as any work force in the world.  I suppose one could understand it if the discrimination occurred in Holland but to have it occurring on our own native soil is a serious indictment of all of us.  We have to ensure that our people get the employment.  I am sure the Minister has been made aware of the fact that there is this disquiet about not giving our own people the employment they deserve on this project. A great deal of money is being invested in this project which ultimately will have to be paid by the Irish taxpayer.  It should be the <i>sine qua non</i> of any operation in which the Government have any say that preference is given to employing our own people.</P>
      <P>It is very good that we have available to us such a big market across the Border. I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for his initiative in going across the Border both on the political and the business side of the operation and having discussions with the Minister in the North about the supply of gas to the North. These economic ties cement the relationship between North and South.  This is such a new source of energy and so many of us know so little about it that obviously we can only listen to the experts and I suppose believe what we are told.  How can we ensure that we get the maximum return on the gas find off Kinsale Head? How can we ensure that we can prolong it and get the greatest possible payment for its export?  How can we sustain the quality of that gas on a long-term basis? Are there any plans to plough back some of the revenue or profits into exploring for more gas?  It is my opinion that exploration off our coasts for both oil and gas has decreased dramatically and I do not think that is a good thing.  We should be encouraging the continuous exploration off our shores for all sources of energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the involvement of the European Investment Bank.  I do not think the Minister mentioned the rate being charged by the EIB.  Nevertheless, <Col N="945" /> we have under-utilised this bank.  This bank has available to member countries money at reasonable interest rates.  I am glad to see that on a project like this we are using the European Investment Bank, and I hope it is the forerunner of many more projects in that field.  I hope also that, in the formation of a national grid, agriculture will benefit from this new-found energy.  Especially from Cork to Dublin there are many large co-operatives which could utilise this source of energy.  The cut in cost to the Dublin consumer is something in the region of 40 per cent.  Therefore, the saving in energy for the farmer must be in the same region. If it were possible to co-ordinate a policy where not alone do we have urban Ireland but rural Ireland benefiting, we would have come a very long way.  As a Member of this House and a TD for several years, I welcome this Bill and hope it will be the forerunner of many more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister in devoting the same amount of energy to this portfolio as he did to his previous one.  If he continues that good work, I have no doubt our natural resources, particularly gas, will be exploited to the fullest.</P>
      <P>The justification for an increase in capital expenditure to enable An Bord Gáis to proceed swiftly with this project can be justified because of not alone the development of our natural resources, but the benefits that will accrue to our economy, in the employment sector and in helping the reduction of fuel costs for the housewives and the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crowley in an excellent contribution, dealt with a few areas I intended mentioning, particularly the extension promised by the Minister's predecessor in regard to Limerick and Waterford, which are of paramount importance as second stage developments on this pipline.  It is obvious that Dublin has to get priority.  This is not the first good thing that came out of Cork to Dublin, and I hope the Dublin people appreciate it.  They did not always appreciate the good things that came from <Col N="946" /> Cork.  On the road from Cork to Dublin one passes the most important agricultural land in the country and, as Senator Crowley said, it is imperative that agriculture should benefit from the spin-off.</P>
    <P>Experts have questioned the feasibility of giving priority to the ESB.  There are technical people who will argue that to use natural gas in the production of electricity is not the most efficient way to use this natural resource nor is extending it to NET, but if it reduces the cost of electricity we must welcome it.  We must always use the technical expertise available to us to ensure that we are using this wonderful resource to the best possible advantage.  All experts agree that because of their huge energy costs in milk and allied processing industries the co-operative movement could benefit from this resource.  This is particularly true in the case of Mitchelstown and my own town of Tipperary where we have a major co-operative just a stone's throw from the extension proposed for Limerick.  Tipperary town is adjacent to the Limerick border where the pipeline will pass and I hope serious consideration will be given to this matter because of the importance of the Tipperary co-operative movement in the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that town gas companies, which have been run by corporations are at present carrying out studies.  Not alone has Clonmel carried out a study, but it has finished a study and is 80 per cent through the work of replacing the total pipeline in and around Clonmel, to be prepared for the pipeline from Cork to Dublin.</P>
    <P>It will pass close to Clonmel, the corporation have taken steps to ensure that they will benefit initially.  Clonmel is one of the few small urban towns that had a town gas supply years ago, maintained it in difficult circumstances and are now geared to reap the consequences of our natural resources.</P>
    <P>The other point Senator Crowley mentioned and which is vitally important to us, particularly in the trade union movement, is that the Minister envisages an increase in employment of 700 to 800 people.  If this is true &mdash; and I hope it is &mdash; I hope the Minister, through the <Col N="947" /> Department of Labour, will ensure there is no discrimination against Irish workers.  We spent millions of pounds on capital projects particularly on the Shannon Estuary where certain expertise was required during the construction of various projects &mdash; Aughinish and others. No apprenticeship scheme took place on site during the construction process and we lost valuable expertise and we have to depend on international and multinational companies.  It was impossible to give a contract of this nature to an Irish firm because it was a breakthrough for us.  It is good to know there are Irish people associated with this international company.  I saw some of the work of this company in Denmark where they have laid an extensive gas line.  I commend the company and their Irish associates to the House and I hope that during the construction of this pipeline they will have an apprenticeship scheme on site.  The National Youth Employment Agency should be in close touch with this company to ensure that through the agency, young people who complete AnCO training courses can be employed on site and acquire new skills.  If our resources are as good as we are led to believe, it is obvious that major extensions to this scheme will take place all over the country, not alone in the towns and cities mentioned here &mdash; Clonmel, Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary &mdash; but many other towns will benefit.  We will be demanding in this House and elsewhere to have extensions to this pipeline.  It is imperative that we have suitably qualified young people. There should be various schemes to assist young people to get gainful employment. Here is a way they can achieve a specialised skill.  I hope the Minister will look at the possibility of having young people apprenticed on site to this specialised work of gas welding.  The Minister said he hoped the materials used would be Irish, but I am advised by farming organisations that when this pipeline is going through people's lands many fences will be removed both in the farms and on the roadside, and many new gateways will be erected.  I am told all these gates have been manufactured elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear that the Minister has taken action in this regard.  This was ludicrous, because the Irish manufacturers are second to none and I am delighted that they are now providing these gates.  That is the kind of action I expect from somebody like the Minister.  I complimented him in his previous Department and I hope he continues to use that kind of influence in this area.  He has the co-operation of the Labour Party and the trade union movement in ensuring that we exploit to the fullest our natural resources and that the rest of the country will benefit in addition to the city of Dublin.</P>

      <P>Is cúis mhór áthais dom an Bille seo a theacht os ár gcomhair inniu.  Mar a dúirt an tAire ina ráiteas, is Bille stairiúil é agus tugann sé an-mhisneach dúinn, agus ba cheart go dtabharfadh sé an-mhisneach do aos óg na tíre, a leithéid de Bhille a theacht os ár gcomhair inniu.</P>
      <P>In welcoming the Minister again I commend him on the historical significance of this Bill.  Perhaps we do not realise our blessings.  God has been very good to us. Two of the greatest blessings He has given us are the sea and our coastline.  As the song says &ldquo;Thank God we are surrounded by water&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>Sin scéal eile, ach ní fada a mhairfidh an mhí-ádh sin.</P>
      <P>I was delighted the Minister gave us the figures.  His calculation of 20 years appears to be correct: maybe it is underestimated, but it would be 20 years at least on normal gas consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister, or whoever will be responsible, get going immediately and test for further supplies of gas along other parts of our coastline?  If gas can be found in Kinsale, why can it not be found elsewhere? I have a feeling that there is more wealth in the ocean than we could ever dream of.  A gas field is not what one would call a renewable asset as is our <Col N="949" /> fishing industry but there must be other places where such gas might be found and now is the time to do everything humanly possible to find these other fields.  This gas find in Kinsale could go a long way towards revolutionising industry. Take the pipeline that has been undertaken between Cork and Dublin: not alone will there be hundreds of people employed but there should be great scope for ancillary industries.  I hope everything to be used in that construction &mdash; every nut, bolt and screw &mdash; will be manufactured and supplied at home.  That is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris in his excellent speech referred to gates being of foreign manufacture. Thank God the Minister was on his toes and put an end to that.  There is no excuse for that sort of thing.  Where pipes are being laid there will be lots of other things besides gates needed.  There will be fences, material for knocking and erecting fences, building walls, and so on. One thing leads to another.  Everything we use in every industry, and ancillary industries, should be of Irish manufacture. There is no excuse for having it otherwise.  Reference was made to the skills of workers.  I hope AnCO will provide special courses where feasible so that our young men operating these appliances and doing this work will have the best training possible.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to gas going to the Six Counties area.  Thank God for that.  Everything that will bring us into closer contact with those people and everything that will go any way towards mollifying what we regard as their groundless suspicions will help to cement friendship.  Besides, it will be a profitable exercise as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>I am worried about costs.  The Minister in his statement said that the overall cost of the pipeline from Kinsale to Dublin was not expected to exceed £45 million. That, he said, included the cost of the acquisition of wayleaves, engineering, communications and other related projects not covered by the pipeline construction contract itself.  By the time it is brought into Dublin the cost is estimated to be £60 million.  Unfortunately from experience, it has to be said that no matter <Col N="950" /> what estimates were suggested as being acceptable in other areas, up to now somehow these costs seem to escalate. I hope firm contracts will be laid down and that we will not be faced at a later date, maybe one, two or three years, with having to bring in special Bills to salvage these operations because of increasing costs.  I have great hope in the Minister.  He is a very energetic and farseeing man.  He seems to be lucky.  Everything he puts his hand to seems to come right.</P>
    <P>I see that £80 million borrowing for capital expenditure would be required. That will be £80 million well spent.  I wish the Minister luck.  We should thank God for what the sea has given us, and I look forward to the day when we will discover many more gas fields.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMallon" hpid="Mr. Mallon Mr. Mallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mallon</NameTxt>
      <P>When one reads the term &ldquo;historic significance&rdquo; one usually expects a little pretension to follow.  In this case we can truly say that what we are discussing is of historic significance, because it is the beginning of what we all hope and believe will be a breakthrough into the field of energy, of our own natural resources.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on one term used in his speech, because I think it will be a very rare occasion when I will be able to refer to it, and that is, the national energy network. On the National Heritage Bill I referred to the fact that unless it was geared in such a way that it affected the lives of the people living in the North of Ireland, then it could not be properly termed a national Bill.  I should like to pay a compliment to the Minister.  Within this Bill we have what is genuinely a national energy network and something which will benefit all the people of this island.  Apart from the concrete advantages there is a very symbolic element in it also, the symbolism that both parts of this island, in terms of energy, can be complementary to each other, that they are part of the same island and that they have the same problem, that is, the need for energy at the cheapest possible rate. That should not be lost on people on either side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> The concrete benefits are perfectly and readily obvious when one considers that in the North coal, oil, gas and electricity, of which we have a surfeit, have been costing somewhere in the region of between 30 per cent and 35 per cent more than it costs on what is termed &mdash; if you will pardon it &mdash; the mainland.  It is an incredible situation, that people in Belfast, Derry, Larne or wherever they may be are paying more than one-third more for their energy than they would be in Liverpool, London or any part of England.  Yet we are assured that Northern Ireland is exactly the same as any other part of Britain.  It is tragic that that situation has gone on for years, because it is one of the problems which has contributed to the very substantial poverty element which is growing in the North of Ireland, which in itself is interconnected with the other problems of violence and unrest.  I regard it as a scandalous situation that the very same Government which keep telling us how lucky we are to be part of the British connection, how lucky we are to be part of that British way of life, at the same time say: &ldquo;Pay up, chaps, it is going to cost you one-third more in terms of everything&rdquo;.  That does not apply only to energy; it can be translated into the agricultural industry, foodstuffs, fertilisers and every other single factor.</P>
    <P>Looking at it from that point of view, I give a special welcome to the Minister and to the proposals in this Bill, but I have one slight reservation.  There was a period of time in relationships between North and South which could best be described as the cross-Border co-operation era.  There was a slight weakness in it because the term &ldquo;cross-Border co-operation&rdquo; seemed to have been a euphemism for doing nothing.  It developed into a little ping-pong game: when one made one's inquiries here one was told: &ldquo;Oh no, that would be progressing but the Northern Ireland Office is stalling on it; they are dragging their heels&rdquo;.  When one dutifully went to the Northern Ireland Office, one was assured in the same sincere tones that that would be proceeding <Col N="952" /> but the Department in the South were holding it up.  That went on for some years.  I have every confidence that the present Minister will not allow cross-Border co-operation to become a euphemism for doing nothing.  I have every confidence that he will never allow that type of ping-pong game to develop in relation to what substantially affects the lives of all people.  I have every confidence that he especially will see that that type of approach is at an end.</P>
    <P>The concrete advantages of this network are very substantial, apart from the cost.  It is almost unbelievable that schemes were afoot for the conversion from gas of all houses in the city of Belfast even when it was mooted in the early stages that this supply from Kinsale may be possible.  It is incredible that that type of thinking should have existed, but when one looks at the way the city of Craigavon was developed and the moneys which helped to develop that city which has now been pulled down one can imagine the mistakes that might have been made here, that is, if every house in Belfast had been converted to electricity when there was the possibility of this gas coming on tap.  If it had not been for the quick action of people on this side of the Border that mistake would have happened.  That would have been tragic, because it would have tied the people in Belfast to that extra one-third or more for their energy when this gas was going to be available to them.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Daly, I have certain reservations about the safety of this pipeline when it starts delivering gas to the North of Ireland.  I do not agree with him that what we should do is delay until times get better.  The reality of the situation is that if we delay until then, there would be a very long delay.  I join with everybody in this House in absolutely condemning the actions of those who presume to speak in favour of Irish unity or act in the name of Irish unity day after day, week after week, and who blow up the very concrete links we have with this part of this island.  I speak especially of the electricity grid, which has not worked for years because the people who say they believe in Irish unity keep blowing <Col N="953" /> it up, causing disunity in those terms between both parts of the island.</P>
    <P>Last week the rail link between Dublin and Belfast was bombed on three separate occasions, and that goes on week after week.  I hope everybody will join with me in unreservedly saying to those people that their unity is a spurious form of unity; it must be spurious because that which unites people must be a good thing, it must be positive and constructive and that which divides them must be part of the cancer in our society.  I find it strange how people can claim and espouse unity on the one hand and on the other do everything in their power to ensure that even the little basic forms of unity we have cannot exist.  We should take every step possible from now on to ensure that this supply of gas to the North will not be subject to those types of attacks.</P>
    <P>I have one fear &mdash; it might well be an unrealistic fear but I hope the Minister will reassure me.  There had been some speculation that rather than go overland the pipeline might be laid under the sea and go beneath Carlingford Lough.  The net result would be that a vast number of towns in the North of Ireland which badly need this gas could not avail of it.  It would become available only to the city of Belfast.  I have no doubt that that would be a very fundamental mistake because, once and for all, it would eliminate towns like Newry, Armagh, Omagh, Derry and many other provincial towns from availing of this opportunity to have this gas.  I await the Minister's observation. It may well be an unnecessary fear but I thought I should express it nevertheless.</P>
    <P>Finally, I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.  I recognise it is one of the few Bills or proposals to which we can really put the term &ldquo;national&rdquo;.  The Minister referred to the negotiations which are to take place.  May I ask that they proceed with the greatest possible speed? I ask that this undertaking should start as soon as is humanly possible and that it does not return from whence it came, to the sea, but remains overground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  We are devoting large sums of money for the <Col N="954" /> development of the natural gas industry. I would like to ask the Minister to give us some more figures particularly as to how he envisages the loan, the total sum of £80 million, will be repaid and over what period?  If am correct, Bord Gáis at the moment buy the gas from Marathon and currently are selling to the ESB, NET and the Cork Gas Company.  It is envisaged in the future they will sell to other organisations in Dublin and in other parts of the country, and eventually across the Border.</P>
      <P>The price at which they buy the gas from Marathon may not be public knowledge and neither necessarily is the selling price public knowledge.  I would like to have the overall figures which I think we should have if we are going to make an evaluation.  The total cost from Marathon per annum since the gas started to come on stream and the overall sales to the ESB, NET and to Cork Gas Company in the period of operation will give us some estimate of the profit margin and some idea of the possibilities of repayment of this sort of loan.  This resource is such that we must aim at repaying the loans which will be made to Bord Gáis and I would like to have some idea of the time over which those loans will be repaid.  I hope this is not going to be another foreign borrowing which is going to be continually rolled over, as so many of our foreign borrowings are at the moment. Those figures are important.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister also to give us an estimate of the percentage margin that Bord Gáis are going to aim at in the future and some estimate of the total sales.  This is important in trying to figure out where the loan of up to £80 million leads us and how soon we can expect it to be repaid.  This is an industry in which we can expect the total repayment of the loan and not just further borrowings from the European Investment Bank or such other sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point which was made by Senator Cranitch which I think is very important.  It involves further exploration. The Minister has given us a figure of 20 years for the life of the field.  This may be an underestimate but whether it is or not, it is obvious that if after 20 years <Col N="955" /> the Marathon gas field is closed down there would be a considerable loss in terms of the capital outlay unless further exploration had led to further discoveries of gas.  Then we could use the pipelines and the facilities we will be constructing by means of this loan for the purpose which they were originally designed for, in other words, the movement of gas.</P>
    <P>As Senator Cranitch said, there has been a decrease in exploration for gas and oil due to a fall in world prices.  I urge the Minister to encourage further exploration by being flexible in his agreements with the oil companies when they are doing their exploration in the sense that the original agreements were made when oil prices were high and when there was a lot of private investment.  On that subject one sometimes sees certain views in the media that it is wrong for private investors to make a profit, but that is absolute nonsense.  Some investors have made a profit and others have suffered a loss on oil shares.  The fact that people invest in oil exploration off our coast, and particularly our own people, is basically good and essential.  The overall situation is that probably people have not made a great sum and they have not lost tremendous sums.</P>
    <P>Every time there is a share transaction the Government make money.  There is stamp duty, transfer duty and all the rest of it.  It cannot be bad for the economy and it is essential that private investment be encouraged.  To do that, I hope that when the Minister is periodically reviewing licences and the contracts of the exploration companies, he will take into account the effect of world oil prices.  It is very important that we do not stick our heads in the sand and that we realise that the world energy situation has changed dramatically since the exploration was first undertaken off our coast and that the licences and the levels in which they are set reflect current oil prices on the international market.  In other words, we should ensure that exploration costs are not made so high as to discourage further exploration off our coast, because if we are going to spend money of this nature <Col N="956" /> it is essential that the gas supply does not run out.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the decision to start discussions with the Minister's opposite number in the North concerning the extension of the pipeline to the North of Ireland.  I reiterate everything that Senator Mallon said about the safety problem of the pipeline.  I think this also involves the electricity link and the railway link between the North and South. Organisations such as the Provisional IRA who disrupt these links could not have any interest in Irish unity.  I do not think they have any interest in Irish unity; their interests are quite different.  I do not think that people who blow up the railway line between Belfast and Dublin or blow up the electricity link between the North and the South or who threaten to damage a gas pipeline running from Dublin to Belfast have the slightest interest in Irish unity.  I think they are interested in getting control for their own purposes, but they are not interested in Irish unity in the sense that we know it. I urge the Minister that if we are to complete this extension, as I hope we will, and I hope it will go ahead with all possible speed, the way to deal with the problem is to look at the security situation in a totally different way from the way it is currently being looked at, and not to criticise the security forces on either side of the Border.  In this connection we should be thinking ahead and thinking of special security arrangements which are connected with these particular links.  It may mean the creation of special forces to deal with the situation.  It may mean that the special force created to, say, protect a gas pipeline will be able to cross the Border without hindrance.  It may mean a joint force.  If we are going to run a pipeline which costs an enormous amount of money and if it is in any danger whatsoever, then we have got to revise our security arrangements and make it a great deal more difficult to blow it up, damage it or disrupt it in any way.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is thinking about this, as obviously he will be with his colleagues in the North, I urge him to take into consideration the railway and electricity links.  People are sick and tired of <Col N="957" /> these being blown up by so-called patriots: certainly they are not Irish patriots in the sense of the term as we use it.  The people, North and South, would back up a scheme which would be totally different from our current security arrangements to protect these vital links between North and South.</P>
    <P>I am glad that these discussions are going ahead at the moment.  Senator Mallon made some reference to it.  Relationships between the Government and the Government in Westminster are supposedly at a lower ebb.  I think we should ignore these relationships altogether. The fact that they emerged after the Falkland Islands crisis really has nothing to do with the relationship between Dublin and Belfast and whether pipelines like this should go ahead.  I think the two things are totally unconnected, and I am delighted to see the Minister pressing ahead.  As Senator Mallon said, this will be truly regarded as a national resource.</P>
    <P>I think that ultimately these commercial links will be much more important in bringing about resolution of the conflict concerning Northern Ireland than many other so-called political initiatives.  I would say that people in the island as a whole are changing their attitude about our security situation.  I think if one reads between the lines of the debate on extradition last week one will see we are changing our minds on that, if slowly, and the decisions in the courts in the last few days show that the situation is changing overall.  Basically I think we are not going to put up any longer with disruption of our normal commercial life by terrorists and we have got to stop it.  If the development of the gas link makes us look again at the security situation and take new measures to deal with its safety then I think it will be of benefit to us all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister here.  For however long or short his tenure of office may be, I wish him the greatest personal success. I would also like to welcome this Bill.  In particular it gives pleasure to me, as well as it did to Senator Crowley, to be able to stand here and to deliberate upon the substantial natural resources which have <Col N="958" /> emerged literally from beneath the surface of our island and its coastal waters since the school days of Senator Crowley and myself.  In those days, as he so aptly put it, it was assumed there were no natural resources of any merit other than peat in this island and that it was one of the numerous misfortunes under which this distressed people had to labour. Indeed the word &ldquo;labour&rdquo; is inappropriate, since employment was not possible in the island and it had to be sought elsewhere.</P>
      <P>He referred eloquently to the late Sean Lemass and I, too, would like to join in praising the work that Mr. Lemass did in that area.  However I would like to point out to Senator Crowley that Mr. Lemass was not the first person to make a major contribution towards the development of natural resources.  Neither Senator Crowley nor I would have been available at the time to comment or to notice the comments that were made at the time of the Shannon Scheme, but perhaps more senior Members of the House, or those Members of the House who are familiar with the history of our nation, will recollect that when the Shannon Scheme was first projected it was greeted with derision and with howls of abuse.  It was suggested that if the Ardnacrusha, the Shannon Scheme, was built and carried out there would not be in the entire nation, or this part of the island, enough need for the resources of that scheme. We know now, of course, that the Ardnacrusha scheme alone only provides a very small proportion of the total production of electricity needed in this part of the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crowley also referred to the question of employment of Irish people on this pipeline and in the subsidiary industries that would arise from it.  In this context it is important that we should have a coherent policy with regard to the training and inclusion in the workforce of technicians and technological staff. Those of us who are involved in what might be described as the educational industry frequently are lectured on the subject of the tendency in that educational industry towards what are regarded as esoteric and impractical pursuits <Col N="959" /> in the academic area.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside for the moment the question whether education should be purely technological or not, it is a fact that the educational system in this country has adapted itself very well.  There are still things to be done but it has adapted itself very well to the technological demands of our society and economy. However, in the context of this pipeline, the gas industry and the subsidiary industries which will arise from the provision of gas, it is important that we have a coherent policy and a policy that looks beyond the immediate future, beyond the period during which this pipeline is being constructed and the period when the industries will be coming into existence.</P>
    <P>In this context, I will refer later on to the long-term projections on the availability of resources of our own.  Clearly we have a resource here at the moment and we are right to exploit it and to make the best use of it that we can.  However, two questions arise, and I would like to hear the Minister's views on this later on.</P>
    <P>The first is the rate at which we intend to use these resources, the resources that we know about at the moment, and also what contingency provisions exist.  We are talking of a period of time &mdash; may be 20 years time, maybe slightly longer &mdash; when according to the present projections we will have to consider where we are going to get the gas to service the system.  Whereas a period of 20 years may seem quite considerable &mdash; much longer that the proverbial week that is a long time in politics &mdash; nevertheless we have had in the past cases where public authorities in various areas have operated on short-time scales and left the consuming public in a difficult situation as a result.</P>
    <P>Whereas we should be very anxious to make these resources available to the consuming public as soon as possible and as effectively as possible, one question that does arise, and which is causing growing concern, is the question of the safety of the gas that is to be provided and the safety of the pipelines.  I am not referring to the projected pipeline to the northern part of this island &mdash; I will speak about that later &mdash; but I am talking about <Col N="960" /> the pipeline itself, its subsidiary offshoots in this part of the island, and about storage facilities.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention, if it has not already been drawn, to a statement on the front page of today's <i>Irish Press</i> in which the Assistant City Manager of Dublin stated quite categorically that the fire services of this city would not be able to cope with an accident at the projected LPG reservoir in Dublin Bay.</P>
    <P>If we were all to take the view that anything that was at all dangerous should not be tolerated, we would not arise in the morning from our beds for fear of the dangers we might encounter in the household, which is an extremely dangerous place, on the roads which are dangerous too, though possibly less dangerous than the household.  Indeed, we might well take the view that to go to bed at all would be to risk great dangers since a very large proportion of us die in bed. Consequently, we might feel that anything that was at all dangerous should not come into our calculations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the LPG reservoir, it has been suggested that the statistical chances of an accident would be very slight, according to present plans.  Unfortunately we have to take account of the fact that even the best laid plans come adrift, go astray, and accidents occur.  We have to take account of the fact that while we may have made the best preparations, we may have made the best projections, we may have explored every probability, nevertheless the human factor being what it is, there may be some element in our prepartions which is unsatisfactory.  I do not intend to go on any longer on this particular point, but I would be glad if the Minister could tell us something about the safety preparations and about general security.  I am not thinking so much of security from the point of subversion, although obviously that could be an important factor but I am referring to the general security of the pipeline and how it is proposed to protect it either from those who might deliberately wish to damage it or from the various kinds of accidents that can occur.</P>
    <P>The major user in the Dublin area is going to be &mdash; as far as I understand it <Col N="961" />&mdash; the Dublin Gas Company.  Those of us who were fortunate to grow up in the south-east part of the city almost under the shadow of the large projections of the Dublin Gas Company, hold that particular body in a certain degree of affection. It is literally part of the skyline, it is literally part of our lives.  Many of us who lived in this city during the hostitlites which were known in this island as the Emergency may recollect various aspects of the gas supply and the failure of the gas supply which entered the mythology and culture of this city.</P>
    <P>However, though we may hold the Dublin Gas Company in affection, some of us who have had recent contacts with its minions and with the ramifications of its attempts to supply us with gas, or with what are alleged to be preparations for the supply of Kinsale gas, may look upon the company with something less than pleasure and possibly with a somewhat jaundiced eye.  Friends and acquaintances of mine have heard from me at great length from time to time an account of what happened on my own particular road during the course of preparations for Kinsale gas.  Whereas I would regard these matters as being of some public importance, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to go into very great detail.  All I would say here is that, affectionate though I may be towards the Dublin Gas Company, favourable though I may be towards it, prejudiced in favour of giving it the greatest support and help, this favourable attitude of mine has been gravely reduced by the way in which the Dublin Gas Company approached that particular task.  I would add they were not exclusively to blame for what happened.  Dublin Corporation, with which in the past I have had certain connections, were also involved. The road on which I live is a very small, insignificant road and one which does not require a great deal of work but it took four months for the Dublin Gas Company and Dublin Corporation to carry out the necessary works in order to convert the pipelines on that road to provide for Kinsale gas.  That period coincided with the period of Christmas, a time at <Col N="962" /> which the supply of cooking fuel and cooking appliances is a matter of great concern to the domestic side, even of Senators' households, and all I could say at the present time is that Christmas and the provision of the Christmas dinner for Christmas 1981 have entered the mythology of my own family and household.  It coincided with a period of cold weather but the supply of gas was, to put it mildly, intermittent and interrupted at frequent intervals to the considerable danger of my good wife's patience and health.  That and certain other subsequent difficulties which I had in trying to persuade the Dublin Gas Company that I had paid my bill despite the provision of cheques and receipts and so on.  Again, it did not prejudice me in favour of the Dublin Gas Company.</P>
    <P>I have approached this matter in what might be interpreted possibly as a somewhat facetious fashion.  What I would say here is that with regard to the Dublin Gas Company, I think that I would hope that they would be successful.  I would hope that they would provide a good service to the consumers of this city.  I would hope that they would make the best use of the resources that are going to be made available to them by us, that is to say by the Parliament and Government and the taxpayers of this country.  On foot of my own personal experiences I am not optimistic about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks, for example, of the Gas Company's optimism that, on the basis of its projections it can expand its market by about six to eight times.  I would be very glad to see that happen, but it seems to me to be a projection pulled out of a hat and I would like to hear from the Minister some kind of concrete backup to that projection.</P>
    <P>On the question of the pipeline to the north I would like to join with Senator Mallon in the remarks that he has made about those people who believe that they can cement and strengthen the links between the two parts of this island by destroying pipelines, electricity grids and the like.  There is obviously a security problem.  One gets the impression that the security forces on both sides of the <Col N="963" /> Border have more or less given up the struggle, and it is regrettable that we should have capitulated, or appear to capitulate, to that blackmail.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by considering the figure of £80 million which is the subject of this Bill.  The original figure was £30 million in 1976.  I would like the Minister to indicate in more detail why it is that the figure has increased to that extent, whether it is mainly the result of inflation, and also to indicate his views as to whether this figure of £80 million is an adequate one and whether or not we may find ourselves in a few years' time having to come back and to provide a larger figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on his foresight.  We have seen the development of the Shannon Scheme, the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna.  We are going to see something of a major development and something that is very good for this country in An Bord Gáis.</P>
      <P>I believe the negotiations between Bord Gáis and the Irish Farmers' Association were excellently conducted and it is a great tribute to a semi-State body that it can talk to farmers.  We must look at other organisations like the county councils and other semi-State bodies that we would like to see having greater co-operation with the farming community because, as we are aware, there will be major disturbances in the areas where the pipeline is being laid through the country from Dublin to Cork, going through some of the finest agricultural land involving problems in regard to crops.  I am glad to say that farmers, by and large, are greatly satisfied with the negotiations that are taking place on their behalf between the IFA and An Bord Gáis.</P>
      <P>The spread of employment in the extension of the pipeline from Cork is something that gives me concern.  I would like more employment in the Cork area, which is the source of the supply.  I believe that we must have equity of employment along the line throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="964" /> There has been reference to the danger involved in the link with Northern Ireland due to mischievous activities of other people.  Before we continue to the northern area, we must seriously look at expanding the supply of gas to the agriculture-based industries of the south. It has been brought to my notice that the dairy industry in two of our major centres, Ballyclough and Golden Vale, would use more gas than Limerick city. This is something that we cannot ignore. If we look at the route of the line from Cork to Dublin it passes through some of the finest agricultural land, the home of our dairy industries, namely Mitchels-town and Avonmore.  Those areas are in need of servicing.  We are now considering, and one can read about it in the papers, other sources of energy which are much more expensive, a mixture of coal and oil for instance, to cut down energy costs.  That is going to be a burden on the Exchequer.  We must look at our own resources.  Those industries are creating great employment and we find that the larger six of the dairy industry have approximately 9,000 people employed handling 600,000,000 gallons of milk and having total sales of close on £1,000 million. They are entitled to priority.  We must get down to negotiating with those under the parent body, the Irish Cooperative Organisation Society.</P>
    <P>It will be argued in view of the supplies required for Dublin that we will not have enough capacity in the pipeline to supply the agriculture-based industries.  I do not agree with that.  Our peak season in the dairy industry is from April to October while in the case of domestic requirements the peak period in many of our larger towns and cities is from the month of November until sometimes around mid-March.  I believe we will have even distribution in our pipeline and that it will have sufficient capacity to service this type of industry and the domestic requirements.  Gas is an ideal source of fuel for our food industry.  Its low content of air-borne pollution is very important. We must take that into account and that is why we cannot neglect to make this fuel available to our food industry.</P>
    <P>Comparision with coal prices should be <Col N="965" /> the criterion rather than oil prices because many of our co-operatives are now considering changing from oil to total coal.  The technology has been such that they are looking at other areas of coal and oil mix with a slag type of coal. I am convinced that as an agricultural country our first priority must be to supply those industries, and rather than they having to come to negotiate with An Bord Gáis, An Bord Gáis should be going to them and asking them to take a supply of gas.  We have the co-operation of the farmers and it is only right that in the area where the raw materials come from we should give them an opportunity of having some benefit from that fuel.  I hope that the Minister will take those points into consideration.  We cannot ignore our agricultural industry: it is our finest and greatest national industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a very historic development, second only to the Shannon Scheme at Ardnacrusha which is operating efficiently to this day. It is important that we should at this time in our history have been able to detect this source of energy and be able to set about utilising it in the shortest possible time and to set about converting it for the many uses to which we can put it.</P>
      <P>It is essential to ensure the most direct conversion of this very valuable energy resource to the industries that need it. There would not be much sense in supplying this fuel to an industry which might in turn supply another energy resource at a higher cost.  We would have severe and ridiculous duplications if that were to prevail. This source of energy is very important and if we can ensure that it is converted directly to the sources that require it we will then have overcome the biggest problem associated with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to a few years ago many people in this country did not believe there existed such a resource in such tremendous quantities. I would like to compliment all those responsible since exploration began in relation to the detection of the energy and in making it available.  I would like to see the greatest possible use of this energy by industries that are most suitable <Col N="966" /> for its utilisation.  There immediately comes to my mind Nítrigin Éireann and the conversion to nitrogen.  We are all aware of the suitability of natural gas in that area.</P>
    <P>There may be a number of State or semi-State agencies that will have need to avail of this energy and that may be already in receipt of large-scale State subventions. We are now setting up the machinery for further subventions by the State to another semi-State company and we can arrive eventually at a ridiculous situation whereby the State will be funding a number of companies who may not necessarily be in a profit-making situation. We could, as Senator West has already mentioned, find ourselves going to the European Investment Bank for more and more money as years go by.</P>
    <P>Another speaker has drawn attention to the fact that the cost of the scheme has already gone up from the original estimate of £30 million to £80 million.  We must keep a very careful eye on the financial end of the matter and ensure that we do not waste any of this valuable energy resource that has now become available to us.  If we allow waste we shall have some serious questions to ask and answers to provide.</P>
    <P>In relation to the piping of gas there is also the safety factor.  A number of speakers have already mentioned safety in other areas and events will yet prove that the safety factor in gas piping will become very important in future years.  Despite the best technical advice and the most advanced techniques which are being used in conveying the gas from Kinsale, I believe it will be necessary to introduce sufficient fail-safe methods to ensure that if there is an emergency the State will be able to provide the necessary personnel and know-how to handle such a situation and not allow something to proceed as in the case of the transport of dangerous liquids where fire services not only have not the knowledge or know-how of dealing with it but do not have the resources to cope with an emergency arising in that area.</P>
    <P>The availability of this source of energy to the Electricity Supply Board should also ensure more efficient production of <Col N="967" /> electricity and should have some impact on the reduction of the cost of that energy to the consumer.  It has been commented upon very much of late that the cost of electricity would now appear to the average consumer to outweigh its usefulness. That is a sad thing because it is a non-polluting energy resource and it is essential that when natural gas is made available to the ESB we should impress on them the necessity to make their energy available to the consumer at a more realistic rate or at least to ensure that the increases experienced over the past number of years do not continue at such a rate.</P>
    <P>In relation to the national energy grid, recently it was alarming to find that during cold spells and at peak consumption periods our present energy resources were not sufficient.</P>
    <P>That again relates to the Electricity Supply Board and its inability to deliver at peak periods.  This has become obvious in the past five or six years when at peak periods there was loss of power, and, in fact, a number of areas were without power as a result of fusing of various sections in the supply.  This was caused by overloading.  In fact, we had the ridiculous situation just a few years back when at the worst period of the cold spell there was almost rationing of electricity supplies. I would hope that when this natural gas is made available to the Electricity Supply Board we will not have a repetition of what we have had for the last few years and that we would have sufficient supplies of both gas and electricity and, with the support of the gas, ensure that the domestic consumer is at least satisfied and that industry likewise has sufficient to proceed.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome the Bill.  As I said earlier, I believe that it is of tremendous historic importance.  It comes at a time when this country needs any assistance that it can get.  The best possible assistance this country's economy can now have is that which can be generated from within its own resources or from near its own shores.  The time will come when we will become more aware of the importance of our off-shore exploration <Col N="968" /> and, indeed, we will have to look further afield than we have been looking in our off-shore explorations.  We will also find that other powers will cast envious glances in our direction as time goes by &mdash; some of whom are not in the same happy position themselves.  With the increased demand for energy generally throughout Europe there will obviously be more and more envious glances cast in the direction of those who have arrived at producing their own extra energy.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill serves the purpose for which it was introduced.  I compliment the Minister for the speed with which he has introduced it.  I certainly hope that the country as a result will be much better off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome this Bill and welcome particularly the Minister who has brought it here to us.  I would see it definitively as a Bill of action and very much suited to the Minister who has introduced it.  The whole scene has started off very well on an optimistic note because the re-valuation of the reserves in the field upped the original figure.  I think that any enterprise which starts off on such a good note is one which will have a good future.  So often an enterprise starts on a high note and then the re-valuation process is down rather than up.</P>
      <P>As a housewife and as a woman I am particularly pleased that the Minister foresees that perhaps the availability of gas to the ESB, as the previous speaker mentioned, will help to stabilise electricity prices to the consumer and save on oil imports, thus assisting our balance of payments.  Again, we are only beginning and scratching the surface of what could be a vast potential for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has explained very carefully and very clearly that the most efficient use that can be made of the Kinsale field is to maximise the availability of gas for the premium domestic market and for use in industry and commerce generally. The vast ramifications of this Bill and how it will change the face of Ireland very much as Bord na Móna and the Shannon Scheme did are not yet clear to the general public.  We have seen from our history <Col N="969" /> books how the face of Ireland was changed and the economic and social transformations that swept through our country when those two massive Bills were brought in.  In the years to come Ireland will benefit to an enormous extent from this particular Bill and from the reserves which we now know are there and which hopefully will flow, and flow without any trouble or interruption.</P>
    <P>I am particularly glad that the social out-turn from this Bill is so important.  I refer to the link with Northern Ireland and the discussions between our Minister, Deputy Reynolds, and Mr. Butler from the Northern Ireland Office. I know many speakers have touched on this, but in these times when we talk of reaching a rapport with our Northern neighbours we talk sometimes on a lofty plain, and this does not have very real meaning.  In this case we have a very practical step, a hands-across-the-border move that the ordinary man in the street can understand and can realise.  The economic out-turn from this will be of great importance.</P>
    <P>Again I welcome the Bill and its plan of action and I look forward to its implementation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of thanking all the Senators for their contributions towards what will be seen in future years as a very important and historic Bill.  Many of the contributions were indeed excellent and many questions were asked to which I hope to reply in detail.  I think there are a few areas where a common trend emerged from the speeches of many Senators. I suppose I could deal with those first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will begin with Senator Durkan and the question of maximising use of our natural resources.  Indeed this is something on which the economy of this country will depend more and more in the future.  The nation's wealth is its people and its natural resources, and the fullest development of its people and of its natural resources is the real way forward for this economy.  The Kinsale gas discovery has been and will be seen to be a magnificent <Col N="970" /> contribution and benefits to the Irish economy.  I do not think that this benefit is appreciated by the general public as yet.</P>
    <P>Indeed, my job as Minister in charge in the Government of the day is to maximise the benefits for the Irish economy. At the same time we must not rest on our laurels but expedite further exploration around our coasts.  I think it is fair to say, and anyone can be cautiously optimistic, that Kinsale gas head, while small in international terms, in Irish terms is extremely large.  Nevertheless, one could be cautiously optimistic that this gas head at Kinsale is most unlikely to exist in isolation.  The indications from geologists and others are that there should be more finds around our coasts.  While many Senators called for more active exploration around our coasts I can refer them to the recent second round of exploration licences that have been issued.  Indeed, the concentration has moved from the Porcupine area of the west and south-west coasts of Ireland over to the Celtic Sea area and stretching down as far as Kinsale Head.  When one sees the concentrated efforts by many exploration companies to home in on a certain number of blocks in that particular area it tends to confirm information we have available to us and opinion that is freely expressed that there are some positive areas there that will need further exploration.</P>
    <P>I would take Senator West's point and bear it in mind.  When we look at our contract for exploration of many years ago, when Marathon operated also, of course, it is time in a changing world and indeed at a time when exploration budgets have been cut drastically around the world, to up-date our approach to exploration contracts.  He made this point quite clearly, and I am in agreement with him and will be taking it into consideration in a total review of the exploration area.</P>
    <P>Policy and pricing formed another theme which ran fairly commonly through many of the speeches here.  I would like to elaborate on this and clarify it for the benefit of the House.  On policy and gas pricing, the basic objective is to displace as much high value oil as possible, that is gas oil for cooking, heating, home, office <Col N="971" /> and commercial uses, and to sell additional volumes at the heavy fuel oil prices for industry and electricity usage.  The gas oil displacement is basically in the premium market but that market is small and Kinsale Head, if it was reserved for looking after the premium market, would last in the region of 50 years.  It would be bad economics and bad strategy to approach the usage of Kinsale Head in this way.</P>
    <P>The policy is to provide almost an equaly volume for commerce and industry as the premium market.  In that way the life of the field will be in the area of 20 years to 25 years on the known reserves at this point in time.  It is true the reserves have been increased by just over one-third since the discovery was made.  I was asked how often this will be reviewed. There will be a review of the reserves every couple of years because as the usage increases and as the pressure drops that is when a more accurate and more reliable set on the reserves will be obtained.  It is based on the known reserves, and the life of the field is based on that.</P>
    <P>To get back to the policy and the utilities, the Dublin Gas Company, Cork and other towns will take into account the two ends of the market, the premium market for household consumers and the market for commerce and industry.  At the same time, we have been engaged in supplying as much as possible to the ESB. I know that originally there were arguments about whether this is the most efficient use of the gas, but one has to bear in mind that if NET, who, incidentally, made their contract with Marathon before BGE was even established, and the ESB were not the large users of gas that they are today, the economics of bringing the pipeline to Dublin and the financial arrangements might not have been possible.  We can argue about whether this is the most beneficial use. Some of the arguments do not bear out the great diversity of financial returns that are there.  Nevertheless, we must also consider the impact it is making and will continue to make on our balance of <Col N="972" /> payments and the very heavy bills we pay for oil.</P>
    <P>The ESB price will be related to the heavy fuel oil price.  There will have to be some consideration of justifiable reductions for transfer of plant and reconversion of plant by the ESB.  Basically, those are the three approaches and the three markets for them.  A case was made here for spur lines to individual industries and towns off the main Cork-Dublin pipeline, and possibly spurs off the Limerick to Waterford line.  We are currently considering a more liberal policy of allocation of gas.  It is true to say that up to recently the pricing policy of gas to industry was not very informative as far as industrialists were concerned, but there was a reason for this.  The quantities required for the Dublin consumer market, the industrial market around Dublin and for the ESB had to be earmarked and identified.  The quantities that would be required if negotiations were successful in bringing the gas to the North of Ireland had also to be earmarked. All those factors had to be taken into consideration before the proper planning of making gas available to industry could be identified and a cohesive pricing policy introduced.  That is changing, and the pricing policy for industrialists, recognising that industrialists must know in advance so that they can get along with their planning and must have the fullest information will be available to them shortly.</P>
    <P>I think Senators will recognise and appreciate the hook-up cost to a utility or to an individual firm must affect the net contribution per therm sold, so that pricing cannot ignore the extension of the grid and the economic evaluation that has to be done in bringing it to any particular area.  That gives Senators a fair idea of the pricing policy and indeed of the reserves and the valuation that has been done on them.</P>
    <P>I shall now proceed to comment briefly on the individual questions raised by various Senators.  Senator Daly asked how accurate the estimates were and if the revaluation of 1.35 trillion is reliable.  I can tell him categorically that it is reliable. As I had already mentioned before <Col N="973" /> the Senator came in, it is reviewed every couple of years.  As the usage increases the pressure drops and we can get a more reliable fix on reserves.  All our planning and all our economic evaluation have been done on those known reserves, not based on possibilities of finding more gas or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Senators Crowley, Ferris and many others talked about the manufacture of Irish components and the added benefits to the Irish economy and indeed to possibilities for setting up industries to home in on not alone the conversion components but the whole gas industry, which is a new operation on the Irish scene. Early indications show that applications are being made to the IDA for setting up related industries and on the question of Irish components on the pipeline itself. As I said in my earlier speech, if one excludes the total cost of the pipeline and fittings, which had to be imported, from the total contract price, one sees that the total Irish input into the project is practically pushing towards 90 per cent.  That is a fair compliment not alone to the Irish Goods Council who have monitored the operation of the contract.  We also allocated a man to monitor the Irish input and to monitor the progress of the contract. The question raised about the importation of gates was correct from the very early stages, but that has been corrected. We will continue to take all steps necessary to ensure that the Irish input and the maximum benefit to the economy will be gained from a project of this size.</P>
    <P>On the question of workers on the project, I read somewhere about the number of workers but I am informed by BGE that approximately four highly skilled Dutch welders are there and that the balance are Irish welders.  I also take the point made by Senator Ferris, Senator O'Connell and others that in the build-up of a new industry like this with the expertise and the skills that we should be looking at apprenticeships and training our people in the very expert skills that are needed.  I have already taken this matter up with both the Minister for Labour and the Minister for Education in relation to homing in on the opportunities that are there to give our young <Col N="974" /> work-force the opportunity of specialising in those skills.  In my view the gas industry has a lot of potential for the future and we should maximise the benefits to our people from it.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris mentioned Clonmel.  I am aware of the great progressive work that has been done down there and the question of supply of natural gas is now being fully examined in my Department. It would be premature to say anything more definite, but the prospects look good and the people of Clonmel have to be complimented for getting ready ahead of time to accept it as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>Senators Ferris and O'Keeffe made pleas for the supply of gas to co-operatives. That will certainly be examined. Now that we have identified the quantities we will be looking at the various extensions that can be made to this spur as it comes from Cork to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Keeffe made the point about relating it to coal.  This is part of the overall pricing policy.  Senator West and others tried to find out exactly what the price will be.  We are in a commercial area here.  BGE are commercially orientated and they will be charging the price the market can bear.  Nevertheless, they will also have to bear in mind what fuels they would be replacing in selling gas to a particular company or individual.</P>
    <P>Many Senators, including Senator Cranitch, raised the question of the difference between the £45 million and the £60 million in the cost of the link.  Others mentioned the figure of £30 million.  I want to get the facts straight so that there will be no misunderstanding about the question of cost in relation to this project. The contract for the pipeline itself is set at £27.48 million.  It is a turnkey contract and is being monitored by a man in my Department to ensure that there are no over-spills or the extravagant way in which contracts like this in the State area have gone out of hand in recent years. This one is being monitored very closely. That is the exact figure.  It is a turnkey contract.  The difference between that, which takes it up to £40 million, is the question of wayleaves and other parts not related to the main contract.  £60 million <Col N="975" /> is the cost of bringing it from Brownstown Gate at Clondalkin right into the city.  This is another separate contract. While somebody might think that we started off with a price of £30 million and we are now at £60 million that is not the position.  Indeed, if one looks back some years ago when they talked about this project originally, figures of £130 million or £140 million were being bandied about.  It shows where people can get lost.  Certainly, those figures were estimates made when the original figures were being put together for this project. It was in the region of £130 million to £140 million.  However, the House can be assured that we are monitoring right along the way so that there is no over-expenditure to the extent that has happened in other major contracts in the past.</P>
    <P>While Senator Mallon welcomed the national grid to serve all the people of this island he drew attention to the higher prices in the North of Ireland than the UK for gas, coal and electricity.  While it is not appropriate to disclose the terms of the main heads of agreement that have been reached between myself and Mr. Adam Butler on the question of the contract for the supply and the price of gas to Northern Ireland, it is closely related to the price of the utilities down here. After that visit there was comment in the press that gas here would cost more than I had sold it to the people of the North of Ireland.  I want to take this opportunity to say that is not so.  When the opportunity arises to disclose the terms of that contract after both Governments have approved it, then it will be seen that Dublin gas users will not be subsidising users in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Mallon said he hoped that we would not continue in a ping pong exercise in relation to economic co-operation between the North of Ireland and here. It is not my intention to get involved in a ping pong exercise.  My record in the last Department in which I had the opportunity of working in the economic co-operation area will show that I set up the Dublin to Derry airlink.  Indeed it was totally and absolutely looked after by the <Col N="976" /> Irish Government resources at the time with no input whatsoever from the British Government.  That is the sort of determination I have in seeing this project through.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Mallon and the whole House that as far as the Irish Government are concerned we will have the gas available at the Border, assuming that both Governments accept the recommendations of the respective Ministers involved in getting ahead with this deal.  We should have the gas available at the Border crossing by 1984 and will also have it available to the North of Ireland in quantities sufficient to supply the consumer needs and the other needs on the basis of schedules of quantities that were prepared for us some time ago.  We will not be limiting their requirements up there.  It will be available to look after the requirements of the total community.</P>
    <P>Senator West wanted more information on what period the loans would be borrowed and the repayments on them. Home loans or any loans that are raised in Ireland will be on the basis of seven to ten years.  European investment loans, while only being negotiated at this point in time, will most probably be over a 15 year period.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of servicing those loans and the economic evaluations that have been done on the project, it is true to say that the capital requirements of BGE, by and large, are set at 70 per cent from external borrowings and 30 per cent from own resources. I can also confirm to the House that BGE will be allowed to retain enough of their profits to look after their own requirements and over and above that the excess profits will go to the Exchequer.  This is the present arrangement on that basis.  I do not think that anybody should be unduly worried about the economics of this entire project because we are into an area where I believe &mdash; the future years will show it &mdash; BGE will be in a very strong profit-making exercise.  They can retain what they need for their own resources and anything over and above that will go to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Senator West wanted to know the present off take.  The ESB is 125 million cubic <Col N="977" /> feet a day, NET 45 million cubic feet a day and the balance is about 5 million cubic feet a day.  When the gas comes on stream in Dublin it will take initially about 14 million cubic feet a day, growing about six-fold over the period for the next five to ten years.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell raised the question of the gas resources, which I have dealt with reasonably accurately up to now, and the contingency measures when native gas runs out.  It is a bit early to speculate hypothetical situations about when it will run out.  I accept the view that when the second round and future exploration exercises have been carried out around our coast and should they not be successful &mdash; I do not expect that to be the case &mdash; we will have to look at either the possibility of connection into the grid in England or indeed import gas. While I am a great believer in long term planning nevertheless until we get a better evaluation of our own possibilities around our own coast I would not be inclined to take that any further at this time.</P>
    <P>On the safety and standards to be employed in this whole operation, I have already got the full co-operation of the IIRS in reviewing the gas standards and work practices.  All work by BGE and the gas utilities is to the best international standards and being monitored and regularly checked on that basis.  The full conversion programme will be monitored as well.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell also raised the question of the basis on which these projections were made for Dublin gas and had I pulled them off the top of my head. I want to assure Senator O'Connell that I never pull projections out of the top of my head and I do not operate on the basis of figures pulled out of the top of my head either, because that is a very dangerous exercise.  It will not get you very far in business any more than any further in politics either.  The best projection is based on two independent market surveys. One has to have confidence in them when one studies them very closely.  The investments are being made on the assumptions of this growth.  When one considers that Dublin Gas will be in a <Col N="978" /> position to offer reductions of about 25 per cent to consumers who are involved only in the cooking area and up to 39 to 40 per cent to people who will be using natural gas for a combination of cooking and heating and one examines closely the independent market surveys one can clearly see that the opportunity is there for the growth we are projecting in that particular area, given that price advantage in the market place.  New schemes being planned both by architects and indeed by builders should take account of the opportunity that is there for new householders to get geared up in time for the use of natural gas and indeed for the great reductions there will be in their household bills.  I have confidence in the projections, and from my experience from looking at those things I am prepared to stick my neck out and say that growth pattern is there and it is still a question for the Dublin Gas Company to attain it.</P>
    <P>I would like to join with Senator Ferris and Senator O'Keeffe in complimenting the farmers, ICMSA and the IFA for such a great demonstration of civic spirit in this particular area for having stuck rigidly to the agreements made and for having made sure that BGE and the contractors were able to carry on with little or no interference in such a major national project.  I have already asked the contractors to ensure that the lands in which they are passing and putting down the pipes in should be left, so far as is humanly possible, back in the same condition in which they found them.</P>
    <P>I want to add my voice of congratulations and compliments to those organisations, to all the farmers who allowed it and who, understandably, had a fear of the unknown and suspicions of what a gas main running through their land might mean, for their tolerance and acceptance and for facilitating our great efforts in pushing forward with this great project so that we can maximise the full benefits to the national economy.  To them I say a sincere word of thanks.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is aimed at updating some important aspects of the legislation concerning town gas companies.</P>
      <P>The existing legislation has served an essential purpose over the years.  It established and developed the fundamental obligations and rights of gas companies taking account of their specific obligation to provide gas as a service to the public. Stagnation in the town gas industry in more recent times, and lack of incentive for development and capital investment, meant that no strain was put on this rather antique legislative framework.  But that is now in course of change.  The supply of natural gas to Dublin and Cork and the possibilities of supplying natural gas to other existing town gas companies, where practicable, call for legislative change.  There is an urgent need to remedy at least the more serious deficiencies in present legislation to prepare for the new situation.</P>
      <P>Gas companies need a modern legislative framework on the lines of the modern company.  The longer term solution will be to repeal all previous Acts and orders and to have a single piece of legislation dealing with all gas companies. But in the meantime, the purpose of the proposals in the present Bill is to deal with those deficiencies which are seen as impeding gas companies, such as Dublin and Cork.  These companies have to take immediate measures to raise capital and borrowings and to take other appropriate steps for the distribution of natural gas.</P>
      <P>The major features of this Bill, which I will deal with in more detail later, can be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) the introduction of the option for gas companies to have a Memorandum <Col N="980" /> and Articles of Association like any other modern company.  This will remove the necessity for Ministerial orders requiring Oireachtas approval for routine management matters while still retaining the more critical provisions of existing legislation.  Where a gas company do not opt to adopt a Memorandum and Articles this Bill will still dispense with the need for Ministerial orders in specified routine matters.</P>
    <P>(2) the application to gas companies of provisions of the Companies Act in such matters as issue of a prospectus and allotment and issue of shares or stocks.  The existing legislation either does not cover these events or is seriously deficient in relation to them.</P>
    <P>The updating measures will allow gas utilities to operate in a modern, commercial company law framework consistent with the needs for any major developments related to the lay-on of natural gas.</P>
    <P>Senators will know that there are eight operational town gas companies.  These are in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Dundalk and Wexford.  None of these is a company incorporated under the Companies Acts. With the exception of Clonmel and Limerick which are part of their respective local authorities, all other town gas companies are privately owned.  The gas companies were established about the middle of the last century.  Each is subject to its own separate regime of special Acts of Parliament from which it derives its initial constitution, powers and duties. For example, the present Alliance and Dublin Consumers Gas Company were incorporated for the purpose of supplying gas under the Alliance and Dublin Gas Act 1866.  The Act also defined the company's area of operation and regulated their capital and borrowing powers. Seven other special Acts concerning this company were subsequently enacted, the last one being the Alliance and Dublin Gas Act, 1909.  A pattern of special Acts for each of the other town gas companies developed in a similar independent way.</P>
    <P>The independent evolution of special Acts for individual gas companies <Col N="981" /> resulted in a certain lack of cohesion in the law on such companies.  It became obvious that there was a need for legislation which could have a common application and which could supplement the special Acts.  Thus various Acts, suited to gas companies in general, were also enacted.  For example, the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, as amended and supplemented, in a minor way, by other Acts, contains comprehensive provisions for the internal regulation and management of public utilities such as gas companies.  The provisions in these Acts are largely the forerunners of a kind which would be found in the articles of association of a modern company.  Many of these Acts are deficient and outmoded in many respects.</P>
    <P>The Gasworks Clauses Acts, 1847 and 1871 gave gas companies the right to open up public streets to lay, replace and repair gas mains.  They contain provisions obliging a gas company to supply gas to a person located near a gas mains.  They also contain provisions concerning use of meters and testing quality of gas.  The Gas and Waterworks Facilities Acts, 1870 and 1873 were enacted to enable a gas company to construct gasworks and raise capital for that purpose; to amalgamate with another gas company and to do various other things.  Various other Acts which have application to gas companies were enacted over the years.  The more important of these are listed in the schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Gas Regulation Act, 1920 deserves special mention.  Prior to that Act gas companies were, as I have outlined, almost totally locked into a region of Acts which extensively controlled their operation and regulation even in matters of a routine nature.  Change, Even minor change, could be achieved in most instances only by an amending Act.  The significance of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920 was that it enabled a variety of changes to be made by Ministerial order. In particular an order could be made to modify or amend the provisions of any special Act or other provision relating to a gas company which would help the company to operate more efficiently.  It was <Col N="982" /> a substantial improvement because it opened the way for some flexibility in effecting change.  The need for a more flexible approach is reflected in the numerous orders which, at the request of individual gas companies, have been made in the intervening years.  Most of these orders are still in force.  They deal with a wide variety of things such as increasing the number of directorships, determining the frequency of general meetings and evaluating stockholders' funds.</P>
    <P>The 1920 Act did not, however, give gas companies the degree of flexibility which today's circumstances require. Before an order is made, the draft must be laid before, and approved by resolution of, both Houses of the Oireachtas even though the draft order might relate only to some fairly simple aspect of day-to-day administration.  In the case of an ordinary company such matters could be dealt with by resolution of the company. I think Senators will agree that the procedures for making an order which I have described can therefore be regarded as unnecessarily cumbersome in many cases.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned a few of the more important enactments to give Senators some idea of the complex web of legislation which has become woven around gas companies over the years.  This interweaving of special Acts, generally applicable Acts and various statutory orders made from time to time, has created a situation where functions and constitution of any gas company are contained in a confused statutory framework which is unnecessarily inflexible, outmoded in many respects and inadequate for an expanding gas industry.  The case of Dublin Gas Company is a prime example. Some 37 Acts, orders and amending orders have been made in relation to this company.  Most, if not all, are still in operation.  They interact with each other in a complex way which makes it extremely difficult to understand the constitution and laws of the company.  It is for these reasons that I propose the measures contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill gives gas companies the option of adopting memoranda <Col N="983" /> and articles of association.  This will enable them to adopt a modern constitution generally.  In particular it will provide a flexible framework for raising the level of capital and borrowings required and for altering those levels to meet changing needs.  In general a company which adopts a memorandum and articles will have a more modern alternative to the provisions enshrined, for example, in the Companies Clauses Acts which I mentioned earlier.  However, existing laws will be replaced only to the extent of the provisions of the memorandum and articles.  In particular, those enactments or parts of enactments which give a gas company their fundamental powers and obligations as a gas utility will not be capable of dilution in the memorandum or articles.  There is a safeguard against this in a provision in section 2 which provides that a memorandum and articles or any amendment must be confirmed by me, as Minister.  Of course, I have the option to waive the need for confirmation in appropriate circumstances, and I will give maximum flexibility to gas companies in this respect.</P>
    <P>Section 3 applies to gas companies, with necessary modifications, the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963 regarding the issue of a prospectus and related matters concerning the allotment and issue of shares or stock.  The present laws on gas companies contain no provisions about a prospectus and are seriously deficient in other related matters.  Section 4 gives a gas company general borrowing powers subject to the provisions of their memorandum.</P>
    <P>Section 5 applies the provisions of the Companies Act, 1963, regarding appointment of auditors.  This means in particular that an auditing firm may be appointed as auditor.  Under present legislation at least some gas companies must appoint individuals.</P>
    <P>Under sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 provisions similar to the Companies Act, 1963, are being introduced regarding the creation and registration of charges on the property of a gas company, appointment of a receiver over their property, security for debts and priority of debts.  Existing creditors <Col N="984" /> will not be prejudiced by these provisions. Present legislation on gas companies does not cope adequately with such matters.  Gas companies need to be on the same footing as ordinary companies when securing borrowings for the capital investment which will be necessary for the changeover to natural gas. The proposals in this Bill to apply provisions of the Companies Act could possibly give rise to doubts and difficulties about the scope and extent of the application of company law.  Section 12 enables such difficulties to be resolved by order.</P>
    <P>A town gas enterprise which is part of its local authority does not have a company structure.  Local authority borrowings and other affairs are controlled by the Department of the Environment.  It would not be appropriate to apply to a local authority who supply town gas, the provisions of section 2 to 9, aforementioned. The effect would be to give the appearance of diluting the necessary controls which are the responsibility of the appropriate authorities.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 replace subsection (2) of section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, the repeal of which is provided for under section 15 of the Bill.  The effect of section 10 is to empower the Minister to allow gas companies to do certain things of an administrative nature such as giving a separate supply of gas for industrial purposes, which under section 10 (2) of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, would have to be done by order.  Section 11 retains the order procedure for important matters such as reduction of capital and alteration of the authorised limits of supply.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, these are interim measures.  A more comprehensive Bill to deal with all gas companies is planned. Such legislation will have to take account of an appropriate procedure for the incorporation of new gas companies.  No such procedure is provided for in the present gas laws and it may be needed as the gas grid is extended.  Preparation of new legislation will afford the opportunity, not only to replace out-of-date provisions on the constitution, financing and <Col N="985" /> management of gas undertakings, but also to provide a broad framework within which expansion of the natural gas network can take place with due regard to commercial, technical and safety considerations appropriate to modern circumstances. I have instructed my Department to prepare as quickly as possible proposals for a comprehensive Act.</P>
    <P>It has been considered necessary to have this Bill enacted during the present session because it will facilitate certain measures which must be taken by the Dublin Gas Company within the next couple of months in preparation for the receipt of natural gas around the end of this year.  The Bill will also provide similar flexibility for Cork Gas Company in case special measures are needed by that company in the near future.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, the purpose of which is to update existing legislation concerning town gas companies. It is particularly appropriate that the Bill should appear before us at the same time as the Gas (Amendment) Bill. There are a number of areas on which I should like to make a brief comment.  In section 11 (1) (b) the Minister may by order.</P>
      <P>... authorise a particular local authority, being a local authority which has power to supply gas within their functional area, to supply gas to any place which is outside such a functional area and within an area specified in the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a later stage that paragraph may well be found somewhat difficult to operate. In County Kildare, which is very close to the Dublin city area, there may be operational difficulties particularly when two local authorities are involved.  It was important that the Minister should introduce this Bill to supercede existing and multiple gas supply Acts.  As the Minister said, I am quite sure it would be almost impossible to operate effective legislation which required reference to a number of Acts, some going back quite a long time such as the Gasworks Clauses Acts of <Col N="986" /> 1847 and 1871 in relation to the opening up of streets, way leaves and so on.  It is unfortunate that all our legislation is not being updated in the same fashion, because many other Acts are so outdated in the modern world that it is almost impossible to operate business efficiently and effectively.</P>
    <P>Referring to the previous Bill dealing with the gas pipeline, one would hope to see a number of other towns along the route setting up the facilities to supply gas to the community.  This legislation should make it somewhat easier for towns in County Kildare, for instance, which will be very close to the gas pipeline, towns like Athy, growing industrial towns and also towns where the populations generally has increased and which would constitute quite a valuable market from the point of view of the supply of gas.  It should be possible for all those towns along the route to set up the necessary companies to take a supply of gas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it removes all the snags in the earlier legislation. I also hope&mdash;and this relates to safety and safety standards&mdash;that the various companies which might take a supply of gas will take full account of the absolute necessity to apply the strictest safety standards.  This is particularly important in relation to natural gas.  We have had a number of unfortunate tragedies in the past.  There have been a number here, and also a number in Britain.  I hope we have learned from these unfortunate experiences.  I also hope this legislation will ensure that the strictest and the highest possible safety standards are adhered to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senator Durkan for his observations on the Bill. I am glad the House has welcomed this Bill as an interim measure to take the necessary legislative decisions to enable the Dublin Gas Company and the Cork Gas Company to avail of the coming on stream of natural gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Durkan said highest standards of safety and otherwise should be adhered to.  I can assure him that those standards are being adhered to.  They are <Col N="987" /> being monitored by the IIRS and they are comparable to all the other safety standards set from experience in other countries down through the years.  On section 11 of the Bill he talked about gas companies operating outside their areas. He and the House might be interested to know that in Clonmel and Limerick they operate outside their areas.  He probably had in mind the extension around Dublin of all the satelite towns and the problems Dublin Gas could run into in those areas. This is one of the reasons for introducing the Bill.  I do not see any unforeseen problems there in relation to the Dublin Gas extending outside their existing areas, because there is no other gas company operating in those areas.  We hope they will take on this job and maximise the benefits to the total consumer and industrial market not only in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an interim step in trying to make sure that the Dublin Gas Company and the Cork Gas Company can take advantage of natural gas.  We expect to have it in Dublin by January of next year. That is not to say there is not a grave need for a Consolidation Bill covering all the Gas Acts which extend back into the middle of the past century.  It is a very complicated technical Bill.  I hope we have covered all the aspects which need to be covered in the interim period.  I have already commenced work on the consolidation of legislation in this area to bring it up to date.  It is basically to provide a modern company structure for the Dublin Gas Company and the Cork Gas Company to allow them to raise capital and to make the plans that have to be made in advance of the natural gas coming on stream in Dublin.  It is an interim measure.</P>
    <P>Senator Durkan asked about the incorporation of new gas companies.  This will be provided for in the Consolidation Bill on which we are already working.  I thank the Seanad for welcoming this Bill.  It is right and proper that we should get it under way as soon as possible.  Gas bills for people who use gas for cooking only will fall by about 25 per cent on the retail side, and people using gas for cooking <Col N="988" /> and heating will benefit by up to 39 per cent, and where light gas oil can be replaced by gas, light industrial users can benefit to the extent of 58 per cent.  It is a move in the right direction to enable the national economy to benefit.</P>

      <P>This alters significantly the 35 per cent rate band of income tax <Col N="989" /> for 1982-83.  The impact of this measure has not yet been fully felt.  When it is I feel the reaction against it will be very strong, very vocal and very determined. In some parts of the country there has been quite a significant shift in the number of people who suddenly found themselves being taxed at 60 per cent.  Would the Minister care to comment on these changes and let us know something of the background to the changes we see before us in this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The change in the 35 per cent band was part of a package which enabled me, as Minister for Finance, in the short time available to me to give the same effect generally to the tax changes as were proposed on 27 January, tax credits versus allowances.  The way it was done within the existing structure was the increase in the allowances and the exemption limits, plus the narrowing of the band which, by any objective assessment, will be shown to the nearest £5 per annum, per taxpayer, to be generally the same as what was proposed in the January budget.  I do not accept that the situation is as critical as the Senator describes it.  Because of the lateness of the introduction of the budget and the various changes implemented in it, and the difficulties in getting out the new tax free allowance certificate to taxpayers, there was a valley period of six or seven weeks which caused some problems in relation to income tax and PRSI contibutions but by and large the impact of that has settled down.  Most people I know &mdash; and this includes myself &mdash; do not like to pay tax, and especially do not like to pay tax at 60 per cent, or be pushed into the higher bands quicker than they might normally be, but the purpose of the exercise as far as I was concerned in relation to these sections at the beginning of the Bill was to give the same effect to the individual taxpayer as was proposed in the tax credits versus allowances in the 27 January budget.</P>

      <P>Senator Daly also wishes to speak on this section, as he did with great feeling yesterday, being a member of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, but perhaps, a Chathaoirligh, you will allow me to proceed.  The Minister and I tangled slightly on this point yesterday and I feel that he failed to distinguish between the criticisms I was making and the recommendations for an amelioration in this position which I also made.  It is perfectly reasonable to advert to the political back drop of the Finance Bill.  Never has a Finance Bill been the cause of so much controversy.</P>

      <P>To the best of my limited knowledge, I understand that normally the budget speech and the Finance Bill do not differ so diametrically as do some of the measures in this Finance Bill.  This was the cause of some slight difference of opinion between us yesterday.  I was being critical of what I would see as a certain backing down in the face of pressure, not so much in the amelioration of the measure.  I also criticised the extreme complications involved in the tapering relief.  We in the Seanad recognise that we have no power to amend the Finance Bill, but nevertheless, I would hope to tug at the Minister's heartstrings to some extent, and to point out to him that the motor industry &mdash; and I am sure he will recognise this fact &mdash; is on its knees.  The difficulties are enormous. Is there any way in which he could scale this down?  Would he comment on the fact that one of the economic commentators whose comments I read said that the taxation of benefits in kind could perhaps be avoided altogether by the use of car pool arrangements.  Is there in this some measure of avoidance?  I should like to hear what he has to say about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder, a Chathaoirligh, would you indulge me and allow me to refer to a letter from the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, because they would naturally <Col N="991" /> make their own case so much better than I would in relation to this measure?  They say:</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether or not the new assessments are equitable, it is scarcely just to impose such a massive hike in taxation in one year particularly when virtually all those who will pay BIK are already caught in the PAYE/PRSI net and their salary cheques are already seriously depleted this year because of the narrowing of the income tax bands and the increases in PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>Sales of new cars are virtually at a standstill.  The optimists are now forecasting a market this year of 75,000 new car registrations, a drop of 31,000 units on the market in 1981.  While some economists might welcome this situation from the point of view of our balance of payments, one must ask how the Exchequer will make up the fall of £70 million which this drop in registrations represents in lost excise duty and VAT.  There is also a very heavy price to be paid in terms of job losses and the collapse of motor companies. We know of at least 20 firms which have had to close down and with the news that the banks are now returning cheques at an alarming rate we fear to think how many more firms are close to the point of failure.</P>
    <P>The Society of the Irish Motor Industry are concerned about what is an acceptable way of taxing benefits in kind and feel that these should be set at moderate levels which will not disrupt the pattern of trade, and which those concerned will accept without continuous argument and dispute with the Revenue Commissioners. Nobody wants to see continuous arguments and disputes with the Revenue Commissioners if they can be avoided.  They suggest a rate of 8 per cent where no private petrol is supplied.  They say this compares with average assessments of 7 per cent in the UK where cars, of course, are a good deal less expensive because of substantially lower duties and taxes.  They also say:</P>
    <P>If at this late stage interference with <Col N="992" /> the percentage rates does not appear to be feasible we would make a strong plea for the tapering relief to operate at the level of 5,000 miles rather than at 10,000 miles as provided for in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I would be very pleased indeed if the Minister could manage some amelioration without too great a cost to the Exchequer.  I am aware, of course, that financial rectitude and strict budgetary constraints must operate.  Could he in any way soften this budgetary measure?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia has made most of my case for me and made it far better than I could make it.  She said if there was something the Minister could do she would like it to be done.  I have a solution to that, and the Minister could do it.  The BIK assessments are double or treble last year's assessments.  I am sure the Minister will not go back to last year's assessments.  If the Minister started the tapering relief at 5,000 miles rather than 10,000 miles that would give relief to these hard-pressed taxpayers.  The assessment here for a £7,000 car for a representative doing 10,000 miles a year is £1,190.  In the UK that would be only £360.</P>
      <P>The point was also made by Senator Bulbulia that the Minister will lose £70 million a year in excise duty and VAT. That will be a difficult one.  At the moment there is controversy about the £45 million given in PRSI relief.  Nobody has come up with the answer to where he will find that.  He will have to find another £70 million if he does not do something for the motor industry.  We will have a drop in car sales which will affect the motor industry and employment. The worst feature is that cars will not be replaced when they should be replaced and cars will not be serviced when they should be serviced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very nice way to avoid the tax for people who are in a position to do so.  I know one company who employed a consultant to find a way around this tax. He came up with a very simple solution for the company and they are adopting it. They set up a subsidiary and that subsidiary <Col N="993" /> was made a present of a fleet of 100 cars.  That subsidiary will rent or lease the cars to the people who are using them but they, in turn, will get a mileage amount for the cars which will offset the small amount of money they must pay. That is a revenue problem, and that is the Minister's problem.  My problem is that the cars will not be replaced with the same frequency as if the company were providing them because these people will not have the money to replace the cars and the cars will not be serviced with the result that we will have cars on the road which are not roadworthy.  That is very serious and I would ask the Minister to look at that aspect of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be some contradiction in the approach of Senator Bulbulia.  Yesterday her crtiticism was of the change since the budgetary announcement and today she made a case to scale it down further.  It seems a bit of a contradiction to criticise a reduction of the impact of the budget statement provisions <i>vis-a-vis</i> what is in the Finance Bill and then to look for a further scaling down of the impact.  I should like to make a general point and I am sure all Senators will appreciate it.  Here we are talking about what is in many cases a very genuine benefit in kind that should be taxable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the example of the person who has a company car for work as against people who travel 20 miles and 30 miles a day to and from their work and pay the expenses out of their own incomes, or those who have to travel five, six, seven or ten miles from the outskirts of this city by public transport and pay these expenses out of their incomes.  Senators, Deputies and others demand greater equity within the tax system, but when moves are made in that direction, particularly under the heading of the benefit of the use of a company car, people are critical and want it diminished even further. I do not accept the point about scaling it down at this stage; it is a new systems coming into effect with the enactment of this Bill.  If we learn from experince there are ways and means of <Col N="994" /> improving this new system, we will move to improve that situation.  As regards scaling down the impact on the individual taxpayer who has this benefit &mdash; and who has had it reasonably free without taxation for some time &mdash; and taking into account the ordinary worker who has to pay his or her own transport expenses to and from work, I do not think I could accept the necessity for reducing the impact any further.</P>
    <P>Car pool arrangements were mentioned but they are not referred to in the Bill.  They will remain under the old system. It is for the group concerned to opt for that system if they wish to get out from under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly spoke about people not buying new cars and said they would not even repair their cars.  In relation to new cars, Deputy J. Bruton in the Dáil wanted to encourage people to keep cars longer. That was his approach and that of Fine Gael.  Here again we have a contradiction. I do not accept that people will not repair their cars, because most drivers I know are very interested in their own safety and are very anxious to ensure that the cars are up to scratch.  This applies especially to people who have to drive many thousands of miles in the course of their duty.  On a more general point, and comparison has been made to the UK, it has to be accepted that in Ireland the importation of cars is a very serious burden on the balance of payments, whereas in the UK, which exports cars, it is in their interests to encourage the car industry. That is the reality and we have to live with it.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied, having had long and serious discussions in relation to this item, and having reduced its impact as against what was announced on budget day, that the majority of commercial travellers &mdash; the majority of people with company cars &mdash; who travel in excess of 15,000 to 20,000 miles a year, will get a scaled down tax arrangement.  Those who have been in touch with me, and there have been many thousands of them over the last few months, are reasonably happy notwithstanding the fact that some of them will be paying more tax under this Bill because they know it is of genuine <Col N="995" /> benefit to them to have a company car for private use.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill are reasonably fair in relation to trying to have some equity within the system and as the system goes into effect, most people will find it has not been the big bad wolf it has been made out to be.</P>

      <P>This section grants relief from income tax in respect of rent paid by claimants aged 65 years or upwards living in private rented accommodation. I welcome this and I referred to it at some length in my Second Stage speech.  I am very pleased to think that the Minister accepts the principle that people, aged 65 years and upwards, who live in private rented accommodation should receive some relief.  Is it possible to extend this relief to people who have very small taxable incomes?  I am thinking of people with a taxable income of, say, £2,000 or £1,000 per annum.  The Minister knows there is a great dearth of houses in this country.  Many people are forced to live in rented accommodation, not because they want to, not because they like seeing their money going to some rapacious landlords, but because they cannot find accommodation.  This particularly affects young married people with one or two small children who are very lucky if they find rented accommodation and who have to have another child before they get a local authority house.  Because there is such a dearth of rented accommodation some of these people find themselves living with relatives &mdash; in-laws, a mother or a sister. Although they are paying a very small amount in taxation, in effect they are propping up those people who are buying their houses.  This is not fair or just.  I wonder if the Minister could consider extending this provision to cover these people?  If he finds he cannot do it in the <Col N="996" /> current year would he accept the principle and see if he could work towards it if he is in the position of introducing the Finance Bill next year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will probably bring knowledge of this section with me to the grave, having spent nearly two weeks in the Dáil on various amendments ranging from £4,500 taxable income down to something like £600 of taxable income. While I said in the Dáil on numerous occasions that one can accept the principle of extension of this provision beyond those who would qualify over 65 years of age, in relation to many points that have been made in the Dáil and other places the cost, for instance, of Senator Bulbulia's suggestion would be £8.5 million in 1982 and £13.5 million in a full year. From that it can be clearly seen that it is not possible in the present financial circumstances to contemplate such an extension.</P>
      <P>What is in this Bill is exactly as was proposed in the January budget, notwithstanding the fact that in the election programme of the Coalition parties they had intended to have a scheme that would cater for all people in rented dwellings which would have cost upwards of £30 million.  To make a start in this area my predecessor decided on this course and I have carried it through.  As I said in the Dáil, one accepted in principle the necessity of something new like this being introduced and sooner or later it could be and would be extended but on what basis would still have to be decided.  I do not think the taxable income bases would be the criteria used.  There are many other ways it could be done and I do not want to delay the House going into them.  The Senator has asked me, like some of her own colleagues in the Dáil, to look at the provision continuously to see how best it could be extended in the future, and I am prepared to do that.  In the present circumstances only people over 65 years of age will qualify and it is estimated that approximately 28,000 people will benefit, and any extension will have to wait for another time.</P>

      <P>This section provides for the year 1982-83, a special allowance of £312 to those employees who pay the higher rates of pay-related social insurance. This is perhaps one of the more nefarious sections of the Bill and has come to be known as this great leap backwards. It is interesting to trace the background to the great leap backwards. After the budget had begun to bite, and before the Dublin West by-election the Government backtracked on the increase in PRSI to 7½ per cent at a cost, which is engraved on most people's minds, of £45 million.  An additional £312 in personal tax allowances was granted to private sector employees in the hope of blunting their anger.  It did not.  The question is: how will the £45 million be recouped?  To the best of my knowledge, the Minister has so far managed to evade giving a specific answer to this.  I would like to think that within the hallowed walls of this Seanad Chamber he might unveil how he is planning to recoup this sum. Does he agree that this concession favours the better off sections of the community rather than the poor and perhaps leaves something to be desired in the area of distributive justice and equity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the House that I am not going to get into the area of jumping forward or backwards because the situation about the levels of PRSI payments is identical to what was proposed, and some of them even passed through the Dáil during the term of office of the Coalition Parties &mdash; mainly the youth employment levy which was passed last December.  The budget proposals of 27 January dealing with the PRSI levels of contribution were put through the Dáil by the Minister for Social Welfare a day or two before I introduced my budget in the Dáil.  No provision was made for their impact by the Coalition parties nor was there any differentiation between the lower or higher paid workers.  As I said these proposals were passed even before <Col N="998" /> budget day.</P>
      <P>In relation to assisting those on the higher income more than those on the lower income, that argument does not really stand up.  We are talking about tax allowances and those who earn more, pay more tax.  The £45 million provision to ease the burden of the additional increased charges on PRSI contributions at the higher level was because of the double taxation element involved and came about after discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It has nothing to do with the Dublin West by-election. Many taxpayers and PRSI contributors had paid their full amount for the year 1981-82 in December last.  This meant that they had four months without paying any PRSI contributions and even if there has not been any increase they would have had to pay 4.5 per cent of their salaries on 6 April.  There also had been the increase of the 1 per cent levy and the various increases on the social welfare side.  Obviously, these increases had a tremendous impact on many workers who on 6 April had 7½ per cent of their salaries stopped for PRSI contributions as against nil for four months before, plus the fact that they had not got their new tax allowances arising from the budgetary changes of 25 March.</P>
      <P>To ease that impact, the Government rightly introduced the £312 tax allowance for the PRSI contributors at the higher rates.  I have said on numerous occasions, and I repeat, that the saving of £45 million will be through departmental savings and additional taxation is required.  That is still my stance and that of the Government. It has to be accepted that the impact of these increased charges was severe for many PRSI contributors and taxpayers and some easement of the burden had to be introduced.  That was done and we have given an undertaking that we will look at this whole area of PRSI contributions between now and the next budget.</P>

      <P>This section amends section 152 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, so that any excess premium due to health considerations which an individual is required to pay on a policy of life assurance, will not be subject to certain restrictions imposed by section 152.  Only the normal premium on the policy will be subject to those restrictions.  I referred to this at some length in my Second Stage speech yesterday.  I also referred to a concern I felt that perhaps those whose sad duty it is annually to fill in their income tax returns might find that this becomes yet another complication with which they have to wrestle.  I ask the Minister if he has considered this and if it would be possible to bring in less complicated tax forms?  Many of these people coping with income tax returns are first time workers and many elderly people find these forms very difficult to fill in.  I would like the Minister to give his comments on this.</P>

      <P>This section provides that in the case of a loan made by an employer to an employee at a preferential rate of interest, that is at a rate less than the &ldquo;specified rate&rdquo;, namely, 12 per cent, or such other rate as may be prescribed by regulations, the employee will be charged to tax on the amount representing the difference between the amount of interest he pays and the amount of interest calculated at the specified rate.  The amount of interest charged <Col N="1000" /> will be treated as if it were, in fact, interest paid by the employee and will qualify for relief subject to the normal restrictions on the allowability of interest.</P>
      <P>When speaking yesterday, I welcomed this proposal on the grounds of distributive justice stating that these people should be liable to tax in a fair and just manner as they enjoy certain benefits because of the employment or career they pursue.  Does the Minister think that the diminution, what is a substantial perk, and indeed is recognised to be so, might give rise to unrest in some sectors? I would also like to know whether there were or should have been any prior consultations before introducing the particular measure.  I would welcome the Minister's comments.</P>

      <P>In most budgetary matters there is very little prior consultation, but since this measure was introduced there has been a great deal of contact.  One has to do the best one can to find additional funds.  This is an example of trying to have greater equity within the tax system.  One can see from other sections that we were making changes in relation to interest on various loans and one had obviously to move in the direction of preferential loans.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, this is and has been a substantial perk for many people.  If a particular advantage is being taken from anybody he will complain and that is natural. The Minister for Finance finds himself in that situation in almost all circumstances. Nevertheless, he has to try to correct imbalances within the system. Here is one imbalance that is being corrected and not too harshly.  Loans at preferential rates have been a tremendous advantage to those who were in a position to participate in them.  It is expected that the yield from the provision this year will be about £.3 million and in a full year about £500,000.</P>

      <P>This section extends for a further year the relief for certain expenditure on residential premises which was introduced for the year 1979-80 and was extended to cover the years 1980-81 and 1981-82.  The limit remains at £450 for an individual and £900 in a case where a husband is assessed to tax on his and his wife's income.</P>
      <P>I referred to this in my Second Stage speech yesterday and I feel that it falls into a category which may help to preserve jobs, but I am not so sure that this will be the case because most of the work will be done as so-called &ldquo;nixers&rdquo;. Despite the fact that this should not be so and that pious platitudes fill the air bewailing and bemoaning this fact, nevertheless it is on record that the black economy is burgeoning and is now a growth industry.  This is one of the measures which will strengthen the position of the more affluent and give them further relief from their income tax.  I would like the Minister's comments on this, particularly in relation to black economy and &ldquo;nixers&rdquo;.  I would like to know if he feels there is a very strong element of this in this proposal and, if so, if he has any ideas as to how it might be dealt with?</P>

      <P>The contractors concerned here would have to be registered and would not be part of the black economy.  The purpose of this exercise in 1979 was to force contractors to become registered so that the taxpayers employing them would be in a position to claim for the expenditure involved up to the limits prescribed.  While the scheme got off to a slow start in 1979, it gathered momentum through 1980 and 1981 and continues to generate a high level of public interest.  To give you some figures the number of registered contractors in mid-July 1979 was 64 and the number of claims received was 63, but at end-May 1982 the number of registered contractors had risen to 2,921, and the number of claims had risen to 16,569.  Obviously progress is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1002" /> The Senator made the point and I agree that this should give some impetus to the building industry and help to eat into the level of the black economy, the percentage of which nobody can be definite about.  We all know about it and we are all anxious to see it eliminated because it is not of any advantage to the genuine hard working people who have to pay tax.  The figures I have given will show this has been of some benefit and that is one of the main reasons it was continued this year.  It was not expected to be continued but I felt that it should be because of its success so far.  Those measures do not cost very much.  This measure cost about £1 million this year. If this measure is a success, we will get more of these people who may have been formerly in the black economy into the tax net where they should be, and rightly so if we are to have equity within the system.  Its success so far has proved it is a worthy exercise and I hope that it continues to be successful.</P>

      <P>The plight of the farmers and the farming industry is exercising the minds of those who care about the economy.  Agriculture is our primary industry and if all is not well in that sector the reverberations are soon felt right through the entire economy, and they are being so felt.  In my area of County Waterford farmers who expanded confidently and happily in the sixties and seventies are now faced with frightening interest rates.  Many of them are liquidating their assets and are involved in a belt-tightening exercise.  Their one hope is that they will manage to hold on to their land so that it will be possible for <Col N="1003" /> them, if the economy takes an upturn, to continue farming in the way in which they had become accustomed in the sixties and seventies.</P>
      <P>One would wish, but perhaps it is not possible, that in the Finance Bill there might have been just a few more concessions to farmers.  The Minister knows that we on this side of the House are aware of his responsibilities in relation to the entire economy and one would not wish him to be wildly generous for these reasons.  However, I would like the Bill to demonstrate a greater recognition of the plight of the farmers.  I welcome the proposals contained in these sections.</P>
      <P>Section 28, which we will be coming to, indirectly relates to farmers and their problems and applies some relief, but the situation is so bad at the moment that I do not really feel these measures go anywhere near relieving the plight being felt so keenly by our farming community and their families.  That is particularly sad, and I would welcome the Minister's comments on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody accepts that farmers have gone through difficulties over the last three years or so.  I suppose I could describe myself as being in an unfortunate position now, but I was in an unfortunate position as Minister for Agriculture too, in relation to the difficulties that farmers experienced throughout 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1981.  I think both the Government and the EEC recognised those difficulties and moved in many directions to assist the farming communities.  Some of them are now being provided for in legislation under sections 13 to 16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator said, it is our major industry and if agriculture is doing well then the economy is doing well.  A big contributory factor to our difficulties in recent years has been that agriculture was not doing well.  I do not think it would be possible in the circumstances this year to contemplate further concessions.  We had the price fixing in Europe for this year which gave a fairly reasonable price increase and there were some special measures which will give substantial benefit <Col N="1004" /> to farmers in the course of the next year mainly, the £37 million calf subsidy agreed by the EEC.</P>
    <P>While every sector has to continue to make its case for whatever resources are available, this year will show that farming incomes will improve in real terms and this is one of the few sectors of which that can be said at this time.  I am glad to see that that corner has been turned and that the agricultural sector will come back into increased production and increased output. All the signs this year show that and the price levels are staying high, so that all in all the various measures that have been taken over the last few years have been successful.  Some other measures not contained in the Finance Bill were taken by the Government, such as the halving of the rates, the various measures under the farm modernisation scheme and restoring grants that were taken back last July in my predecessor's budget. Those items are very important for the farming community.</P>
    <P>Taking all matters into account, the EEC, the national measures not contained in the Bill, plus the measures that are contained in these sections, the various items mentioned add up to substantial sums of money in the context of the difficult financial situation in which we find ourselves.  All the information available to us shows that the farming community apparently have turned the corner. It is important for them and for the economy that that should continue.  I can assure Senator that I, as Minister for Finance, and the Government of which I am a member, will be watching the situation closely in the agricultural sector and making sure that the maximum amount of support and guaranteed prices will be available from the EEC.  I hope we can move away from the situation where the Exchequer, as it had to do in recent years, has had to move in with substantial sums to help the industry through those difficult years.</P>
    <P>I think everybody will agree that things have begun to improve.  Let us hope they will stay that way and even continue to improve further because they have a bit of ground to make up as compared with the situation in 1977-78.  The past three <Col N="1005" /> years have not been good but I am satisfied we have turned the corner and this is in the interest not only of the farmers and the agricultural sector but of the economy as a whole.  I hope that improvement will be maintained.</P>

At present up to one-third of the capital expenditure on farmhouses qualifies for capital allowance. No other section of the community &mdash; we had Senator Bulbulia talking, and rightly so, about people in rented accommodation &mdash; have such a concession. <Col N="1006" /> That is why it has been withdrawn.  It is only a minute thing.  It has nothing to do with agricultural output or productivity. It is the actual residence of the farmer and one has to have some equity within the system.  Bearing in mind the amounts of money that have been given out in recent times by the Exchequer, and again this year, £200,000 in relation to the provision of their own dwellings or their improvement will not make or break the farming community.

      <P>I think this is an appropriate measure because the abuses which this led to in the past were infamous. Junketing and expense account gambling had become a feature of our society.  It is good to see that this feature is contained in some measure, although I would see it is or could be in some instances quite a legitimate exercise and perhaps a beneficial productive outcome for people to socialise together in an informal setting for the purposes of engaging in business growth.  I would like the Minister's comments on the timing of this measure because, to the best of my knowledge, of late about 3,000 jobs have been lost in the hotel and catering industry.  This measure is being introduced when the hotel and catering industry are under severe pressure and when tourism is not in the healthy state it should be for all sorts of reasons, some of them not unconnected with the stance taken by the Government on the Falklands crisis.  I would like to have the Minister's comments on the timing.  Also, I would ask him if the existence of an abuse and the desire to eradicate it is a sufficient reason for framing legislation of this nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there should be sufficient grounds.  In relation to equity in the system, that should be grounds in itself.  The Senator raised the question of the timing.  In the budget of 1980, 50 per cent of this allowance was discontinued.  The second half of that is going now.  The main reason is because of various abuses in the system as well as greater equity.  It is accepted generally that our tax base is narrow.  The PAYE sector complain about the contributions they have to make to the Exchequer, and rightly so, and they can see either preferential loans or benefits in kind for company cars or business entertainment <Col N="1008" /> expenses for various other sections of the community.  One has obviously to move to correct that situation and that is what we are doing here finally after taking the first step in 1980.  I do not accept it will have any impact on the trade because there has been no falling-off in the business since 1980 when 50 per cent of the allowances were removed.  As far as this year is concerned, there is no yield expected to the Exchequer but the yield in a full year, next year, would be around £3 million.</P>

If it is really only hitting us this year, then maybe we have been fortunate because it has been hitting the bigger economies in the world for the past couple of years. Information that is available to me, and not argued with by some of the trade who deal in the area that allows entertainment expenses or caters for those who have entertainment expenses, shows that there has been no falling-off in that trade since the 50 per cent exemption was removed in 1980.

      <P>For too long we have lived in the era of plastic money in relation to entertainment expenses.  We had many restaurants and hotels pricing themselves out of the market because <Col N="1009" /> they had available to them a clientele who created a completely artificial price structure.  I speak here as a businessman. I am not against the basic principle but I would say there were total abuses of the system.  Inevitably there will be some people in the catering business who will suffer as a result but that is only because they have lived in a catering utopia for so many years, where the sky was the limit, where a person took out a plastic card and charged it up without even being aware of the cost.  Surely when we are taking money from PAYE people, who have to watch and save every pound, we have an obligation as legislators to make sure there is equity and that we do not have people creating artificially high prices because of the fact that no matter what the charges are it does not matter to them because they are not paying.  We have waited far too long to get rid of that kind of an exercise.</P>
      <P>This system was bad generally for the whole tourist business.  When tourists arrived in Dublin they found that the city was probably one of the most expensive cities in Europe in which to dine out.  I would submit that the major contributing factor to that state of affairs was the plastic currency we were using in relation to business expenses.  I am talking personally now, not on a party basis.  The sooner that system is got rid of the better for all of us.</P>

      <P>Sections 21 and 22 set out new and extremely complicated proposals concerning restrictions on the liability of certain interest for income tax purposes.  As with sections 4 and 8, this measure hits at the more affluent and, as such, it should be welcomed on the grounds of equity and distributive justice. As with the expense account junketing, I do not quarrel with the measure. Equity and distributive justice must be seen to be done and must be done and in the areas in which it is done in this Bill I quite straightforwardly welcome it.</P>
      <P>As I said, these proposals are extremely complicated and, like section 7 this section again virtually ensures that an individual faced with making out an income tax return may find himself or herself without the technical capacity to do so in the face of these new complications and added difficulties.  It substantially complicates the entire income tax system and I would like the Minister to comment on that.  I also feel that the transition provisions are, and have been in the past, subject to abuses.  These abuses would have had a much greater impact if the proposals in the budget had been capable of being implemented in full.</P>
      <P>It is also interesting that despite all the available expertise both of the Revenue Commissioners and the civil servants in the Department of Finance the Minister should make proposals in the budget which, on subsequent examination, were found to be technically unworkable in the Finance Bill.  I do not claim any deep knowledge of these things but it fails me that this situation should arise.  I would be glad of clarification from the Minister as to why it happens that there is this difference between what is not workable when it comes to the Finance Bill and what is supposedly workable when it is enunciated in the budget speech.</P>

      <P>In relation to the points made about the difficulty in filling up forms, most people are well used to filling up forms in relation to allowance for interest paid and there is no change here <i>vis-a-vis</i> the existing system for the interest allowed for the sole or main residence. The only problem will be in relation to those who have claimed for personal loans other than mortgage interest loans, but there should not be any major complication there.  Most people concerned will be used to filling up that part of their tax form.  The Senator also asked why we were not able to go ahead with the proposals originally announced on 27 January.  We had a discussion on this in the Dáil.  While one can say quite clearly that the expertise is available in the Revenue Commissioners, it was not found possible to implement the proposals as outlined on 27 January.  There are various problems with the computer regarding the £35,000 capital allowance and various problems regarding the 35 per cent rate of tax, with the result that it would be virtually impossible, without formulating something like eight or ten new computer programmes, to fit them into the system. I would have been very anxious and glad to have such a proposal.  We said we would implement it and what was possible to be done is being done in this Bill. It is an area that one will have to look at very closely at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked a question in the Dáil in relation to section 5 on the allowance for rent paid.  It was a small amount of money but the actual amount lost to the Exchequer in tax was something like £50 million to £60 million for various interest reliefs given to the taxpayer.  I will be looking very carefully at substantial sums like that.  I have explained that the technical and administrative problems could not be overcome.  If it is possible at some future time to overcome them, then one can move in the direction that was suggested on 27 January which the Government <Col N="1012" /> and I were prepared to implement.  On 25 March, or as of today, it still has not been found possible or worthwhile to go along the line that was suggested on 27 January.  The Senator can be assured that I will be looking very closely at this area between now and next budget day.</P>

      <P>This section proposes to increase from 45 per cent to 50 per cent the standard rate of corporation tax. In times of recession and high inflation such as we are experiencing at present, to my mind companies need to retain profits for investment purposes, for future expansion and for employment, all vital and necessary for growth.  This measure will have the effect of reducing the funds available for these measures and for this type of re-investment.  In my opinion it will put some companies out of operation, with a consequent loss of jobs and an added burden of unemployment benefits and a loss in PAYE revenue.  It could also be said to have the effect of preventing other companies from gearing themselves up so that if the recession <Col N="1013" /> recedes they will be in a position to come out of it with some capital.  If companies are not able to invest and to consider expansion from the proceeds of their profits, then they are forced to borrow. If you couple this with the high rates of Government borrowing, it pushes up the interest rates and increases the spiral of inflation and, therefore, sets at naught all that the Minister is attempting to achieve.</P>

      <P>I was trying to follow the gist of the Senator's argument but I find it hard to understand.  If you do not make a profit you do not pay tax.  Therefore, I see this as a purely legitimate means of collecting tax from those who can afford to pay it.  Allowances are being made for the profitability of companies and allowances are also being made for the amount of tax that is to be paid on the profit.</P>

      <P>Manufacturing industry is on the 10 per cent rate so it is not affected.  What we are talking about &mdash; and I could not accept the point made by Senator Bulbulia &mdash; is that only those who make the profit will be paying tax. For the information of the Senator and the House, these rates of corporation tax are now to be restored to the levels at which they stood in 1976 prior to the reduction in the 1977 Finance Act.  I do not think that the effects will be as drastic as Senator Bulbulia has put forward here. At least I would hope not, I can assure Senators.  But I honestly do not think they will.  Manufacturing industry has a much more favourable regime and will not be affected.</P>

      <P>The proposed changes in the rates of corporation tax will have very little effect on the yield from corporation tax in 1982 because a small part only of the corporation tax which will fall to be assessed at the new high rate will be payable during this year. It is expected that the yield in 1983 will <Col N="1014" /> be £7 million greater than it would have been had the rates remained at their 1981 levels and the extra yield in a full year will be of the order of £10 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to what the Minister said earlier.  I feel that £10 million taken from that sector of the economy at this time will, despite what the Minister has said already, have a detrimental effect on the economy generally. Non-manufacturing companies at least &mdash; and this would involve service industries &mdash; will be required to pay an extra £10 million, and excluding manufacturing companies from the arena it will, in fact, put an even greater burden on those who are not in the manufacturing business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment about £188 million comes in from corporation tax; £10 million extra is an increase of about 5 per cent.  So I do not think it can have the impact suggested.  Is the Senator suggesting that such profits should be left?  This is an argument we had in the Dáil in relation to various sections.  We all know as PAYE taxpayers ourselves that we pay the day we get our salaries and so does every worker on Friday night pay his tax.  Is it now being suggested by Senators that profits which have been restored to 1976 levels should be left with the corporations and that the £7 million to £10 million should be taken as an additional revenue from the PAYE sector next year?  Is that the alternative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fear that the Minister in replying is merely referring again and again to whether or not we would agree that there should be further taxation gleaned from the PAYE sector.  I do not think that is relevant.  Having regard to the fact that the manufacturing sector are to be excluded in this area then it will apply only to the non-manufacturing area, such as service industries etc.  I would suggest that the payment of additional revenue by that sector at this time of economic difficulty must put a greater strain on many of those service or other type of industries.  That was the question I was asking the Minister.</P>

      <P>We may take it that the Senator would accept that any additional burden of taxation should not be paid by banks and insurance companies but should be paid by other sectors.  Is that what the Senator is saying?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It comes back to the old adage again that nobody likes paying tax. We all suffer when the squeeze is put on. Unfortunately, the Minister has not invented a magic wand yet which he waves to produce money from nowhere without anybody being hurt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand Senator Durkan's argument, he disagrees with the manufacturing industry getting this preferential rate.  Obviously he is not in agreement with the PAYE people getting any greater whack than they are getting already in the payment of their tax.  But I think it is only right that those who make a profit should be asked to contribute their just share to the running of the economy because, as we have been saying over and over again down through the years, neither the Government nor the Minister for Finance have money themselves.  The Minister is only getting the money that he takes from the people. So, his problem basically is how to spread the burden as equitably as possible.  I think the fairest possible way to do this is to ensure that those who make a profit in their business pay their fair share.  I would go along with the Senator's argument in the sense that re-investment suffers: perhaps one does not re-equip in the way that one should re-equip.  But we are talking about extraordinary times at the moment.  We are talking about a time of recession when everybody who has to pay any extra money feels the pinch.  It is not like the old days when we had, as the late Seán Lemass used to say, the rising tide lifting all boats.  We have not a rising tide.  I think on that basis the <Col N="1016" /> Minister is doing an excellent job in that he is trying to spread the load as fairly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is hard to disagree with many of the arguments that have been put, because we all realise that re-equipping and going out and engaging in more aggressive marketing and other business activities are vital to the successful running of any company. The tax base is so narrow in this country that if you say there should be no increase in corporation profits tax there are only two or three sectors left.  Do you say the PAYE sector should pay more, the farmers should pay more or that manufacturing industry should pay more?  If you say that corporation profits tax should not be increased then you must opt for one of the other three in regard to where you are going to get the money. I think &mdash; although I am a victim of this personally &mdash; this is the fairest system.  I think it is right.  I think manufacturing industry is going through a far more stringent time than the catering and the service industries.  I do not see why the banks or the insurance companies should not pay.  Certainly, if you are excluding this section you are excluding them. Therefore, while seeing some of the points made I think it is only right that we should go after the other three sectors who are the only other sources of taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept some of what the previous speaker said.  There is one thing we should not overlook.  While I agree fully that the banks and the assurance and insurance companies should be required to pay the amount of corporation profits tax for which they are liable and which they are well able to meet, at the same time there are a number of companies which will be affected by this increase in taxation who in order to stay in business may pass on to the consumer some of the burden which they will incur in the course of a full year.  As a result the PAYE sector will be hit through that particular avenue and perhaps even to a greater extent than any of the previous speakers have suggested.  We were not suggesting on this side of the House that there should be greater taxation imposed <Col N="1017" /> on the PAYE sector.  I am sorry that the Minister and the previous speaker sought to deduce from our remarks that that was what we were trying to do.  This is not the case.  We questioned the effect that this particular section would have on industry in general, having regard to the fact that the Minister quite rightly stated that the manufacturing sector is excluded from any penalty.  I would suggest that in the course of a full year it will be yet seen to have a detrimental effect on many service industries.  It should be pointed out that there seems to be a feeling in the House that to make a profit is some kind of a cardinal sin but in fact, to stay in business, it is essential to make a profit.  In order to stay in business some firms affected by this section may yet have to increase their charges and ultimately the consumer will be affected.</P>

He feels that because we are in difficult times and because we have a recession, this is precisely why we must gather up more taxation.  But I would advance the argument that it is precisely why elements of profit must be ploughed back into industry in order to strengthen industry and in order to ensure that there is job creation, growth and development.  Otherwise, we just worsen our plight and we do nothing to advance the economy.  That is why I feel so strongly about this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure of the point that has been made because there are certain contradictions in the arguments put forward, the complaints about the extra corporation tax on certain people involved in the service industries including banks and insurance companies because of the impact it will have on them and, that now it is going to affect the PAYE sector.  I do not accept that approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> I should like to make a couple of points.  There is something like £4,000 million collected in taxation.  Corporation tax brings in £200 million which is 5 per cent of the total tax collected.  In relation to the points made by Senator Bulbulia and to which Senator Crowley referred about re-equipment, re-investment and so on &mdash; that is 100 per cent allowable for tax purposes.  So, if the fellow is concerned about paying X amount of money in tax and he has to make up his mind as to whether he will re-invest in the business, instead of paying the tax to the taxman he just spends it on re-investment if that is what he wants to do and it is 100 per cent allowable, I do not see how that would have any impact.  Also, in sections 43 to 49 later on we will be coming to another allowance, which is £10 a week for each additional employee for such companies.</P>

I should like to repeat that what we are talking about here is taxation on profits. If there are companies who do not make profits they are not liable; it is as simple as that.  If there are companies that want to re-invest they get 100 per cent allowance for the re-investment that takes place.</P>

      <P>This section proposes to bring forward by three months the due date upon which corporation tax has to be paid.  It also reduces the period of grace from two months to one month during which, if corporation tax is paid, interest will not be charged by the Revenue Commissioners.  From the passing of the Bill this will have an immediate impact on many industries already struggling and many of them will be brought to their knees.  They will be brought closer to liquidation as a result of this measure, with consequent job losses.  I would be happy to have a reassurance from the Minister that this will not be so. I think it poses an immediate threat to the position of many companies which are struggling to remain viable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, as such, imposing any additional taxation.  What the section is doing is bringing forward the payment dates of the taxation.  The company pays corporation tax in two instalments for each accounting period, which normally runs for 12 months.  Currently, the first instalment is due in the case of all companies nine months after <Col N="1020" /> the end of the accounting period.  The due date for payment of the second instalment can vary from nine to 18 months after the end of the accounting period. What is being done here is bringing forward by three months due dates for payment of corporation tax and for a reduction from two months to one month in the period of grace during which if corporation tax is paid interest on overdue tax is not chargeable.  I do not see how people can seriously argue, with equity in the back of their minds, against bringing forward their tax payments to six months after the year in which they made their profit while the PAYE sector, as I have said already, pay in the week they get their weekly cheque.  I do not think anybody can seriously argue on this point.</P>

      <P>The bringing forward of measures which has been a feature of this Finance Bill is an exercise in cosmetic accounting and will create difficulties for these companies, and I stand over what I have said.

But, giving the same answer to the question in different words I do not think anybody could seriously argue that bringing forward payment of tax to six months after the accounting period, instead of nine months after, is a problem.  I do not accept that it is when if one wants to consider equity within the tax system, the PAYE income earners have to pay in the <Col N="1021" /> week they get their salaries.  In the 1981 Finance Act the first step was taken in relation to the corporate sector by advancing the due date for payment of the second instalment corporation tax by three months.  The present section represents a further step in the same direction, that is to move closer to tax equity. I do not accept that it will have any major impact on the people in corporations or companies concerned.</P>

      <P>These sections deal with new proposals in relation to capital gains tax.  In equity and for reasons for distributive justice, I think these proposals should be welcomed.  I would like to ask the Minister a question in relation to this.  Does he feel that the measures as proposed are likely to delay significantly the pick-up in the construction sector with consequent loss of employment, as <Col N="1023" /> this sector is already hard hit?  I would like to have his comments on this lest there be a delay which would further worsen the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think basically you are talking about development land capital gains.  I do not think that will be the position, because most developers do not pay capital gains tax: they pay income tax because they are in the development business.  They have the land and develop it.  They build the houses and are liable to income tax and do not generally get caught under the capital gains tax on development land.  It was to stop those who have been purchasing land and holding it for some time and making massive development gains that this capital gains tax on development land has been introduced.</P>
      <P>I agree that the construction industry has been going through a difficult time. There are many factors responsible for that.  I think the Senator has more or less welcomed the section on capital gains tax.  When we come to the appropriate section we can go further into this matter perhaps and talk about something which some of the Senators including Senator Bulbulia would be interested in, which is the exemption from the development land capital gains tax up to £15,000 for individual sites.  I feel that is a help and it should be a help to many individual farmers who for one reason or another have a site or two to sell in any given year and have exemption from the development land tax.  They would be normally liable for the ordinary capital gains tax but will be allowed roll-over relief and certain other exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it will have any great impact on the construction industry.  Certainly the case can be made, as the Senator has already made it.  It is a justifiable case or argument that taxes can be blamed for causing difficulties for individuals or companies or corporations, but it is a point I do not think I can accept.  I do not think any Minister for Finance down through the years has accepted it.  We all agree that nobody likes paying tax.  The first fright that the Minister for Finance <Col N="1024" /> will get in suggesting any new taxes will be the impact on the particular sector, the massive unemployment and problems of other kinds that will be created.  These are arguments that have been put forward since taxation was first introduced. We still tend to overcome these problems and difficulties.  The recession and other problems like the level of interest rates and the availability of funds or whatever would have much more impact on this sector than the taxation measures proposed in this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any personal experience of capital gains.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to clarify a few points for me.  In the case where a property holder has to dispose of his property, either to meet ordinary debts or an operating loss or indeed to meet taxes in the case of inheritance, what is the actual situation?  I find that an additional problem arose quite recently, certainly this year, when it is very difficult to get the Commissioners of Valuation actually to take a physical look at property. This is causing great hardship in some cases.  In my own constituency I have a case of a farmer who inherited property and the adjoining property was acquired since the relevant date by the Department of Lands.  The adjoining property was £80 an acre, yet the Office of Valuation valued this property at £1,500 an acre.  They did not come out to look at the property.  This is a grave injustice.  Is the Minister taking any steps to ensure that people are not treated in this very penal fashion?  At the present time people are not able to meet their lawful debts due to the poor income from agriculture. When the decisions are being taken arbitrarily by someone looking at a map and just taking figures from the clouds it is most unfair.  I do not see how it can be supported in natural justice. Can the Minister let us know if there are any concessions under this section for people who are forced to dispose of property to meet taxes or to meet ordinary commercial debts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McDonald covered quite a few taxes in his contribution <Col N="1025" />&mdash; capital acquisitions, inheritance and capital gains tax.  Capital gains tax was probably the most important innovation in recent years to get at the parasite in our society, the fellow who went along, because he had the capital, bought up land, sat on it and kept sitting on it until such time as the value of that land had increased to a tremendous degree. This person was able to make a considerable profit without any input whatsoever except for the original investment of capital.  There was no attempt made to bring services into the land that he bought, to add anything to the environmental dimension.  It was just left there and became an eyesore in a lot of cases. That person made a considerable financial killing from it.</P>
      <P>Of course like all taxation you will never get a perfect system where somebody will not suffer unjustly.  By and large this is one of the taxes that has the agreement of all sides of the House.  For years I have opposed the system &mdash; Senator McDonald will know quite a bit about this &mdash; where local authorities zone land, thereby creating an artifically high price for land in that zone and making millionaires out of some people because of the zoning.  We have got at a part of it here in capital gains, but I feel that the fundamental problem that we are up against is in the zoning of land by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are driving our people into areas. They must build in towns or villages.  We are discouraging young couples from going to the country or going into the rural areas because we say that the cost of providing services in the rural areas is far greater.  I maintain that the zoning of land creates this sort of monster.  I am glad that in these sections we are getting at this monster.  I have in my constituency a case where there is a considerable amount of building land available within the town that I live in but that building land is not for sale.  The less land that is for sale for building the more the demand and the greater the price of land goes up. We have begun to tackle this problem but we have not fully tackled it yet.  I have absolutely no sympathy for people paying capital gains tax.  They should pay <Col N="1026" /> it and they should be taxed to the hilt. This is the area where we can make the most impact.</P>
    <P>I must come back to the fundamental problem.  We are creating the problem by the zoning of land.  If we could get some message across from here to the local authorities, it would be to discontinue the zoning of land because we are putting the price of sites out of the reach of young people wanting to get married.  As I said at the outset, we are making millionaires out of others.  I welcome these sections. Any charge on gains or any tax on gains, expecially where there is no input, is legitimate and just.  You have a legitimate, just tax code which I think does away to a certain degree with the frustration that young people feel.  They see those people making huge profits from no input whatsoever so they naturally become resentful.  We are breeding a type of society that is not healthy.  These sections are very important sections and should be backed by every Member of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not completely clear on the point made by Senator McDonald because there was a bit of a mix between capital gains and capital acquisitions tax, which will be coming later on, and inheritance and gift taxes which are covered under the capital acquisitions tax sections later on in section 89. A disposal is a disposal, and if capital gains tax is due that is the capital gains tax system.  The Senator raised the point about delays in the Valuation Office. One has to accept that there are some delays.  My experience as a representative over the years is that delays, appeal procedures and contacts that are made by solicitors on behalf of the client or by Deputies and Senators on behalf of the client in the main work in favour of the particular client.  I know that there are delays there.  Every effort is being made to improve the situation and speed up the decisions in regard to those particular questions.  In relation to capital acquisitions tax, inheritance and gifts the Senator asked if there are losses are they taken into account.  I think that is the point the Senator is making.  Under that section, <Col N="1027" /> they are under the capital acquisitions tax when somebody inherits something or gets a gift and there are some losses, before the tax is computed the losses are taken into account.</P>

Most of the penalties were of a significantly lesser amount, namely around £20 or £50 with a time factor added on.  I gather that these have not been altered since around the sixties. Does the Minister envisage employing any more people to monitor would-be tax evaders or generally oversee the whole area of tax evasion?  There is really no point in moaning and throwing our hands up to heaven about tax evasion and tax <Col N="1030" /> avoidance, which one would deplore, without adequate staff.  Again, we are into the area of the black economy which we have spoken about before.

I would agree with her fully that where they are required and if they are necessary it is my intention, because I am very anxious to ensure that we eliminate avoidance of any kind of tax.

I very humbly said that if there were any good reasons why this could not be done that I stood corrected in my observations concerning it.  The Minister, however, countered by saying that it was <Col N="1032" /> a preposterous suggestion, which left me feeling somewhat deflated.  I find it very difficult to understand that he would just tell me that it was not possible for the Revenue Commissioners to implement this before 1 September.  When my children ask me questions I just do not give them answers like that telling them that it was not possible or it is not so.  I would really appreciate very much if the Minister would give me a fuller answer to why it was not possible to implement this before 1 September, because we all know that the volume of tourist traffic takes place between Easter and September and it seems a pity to by-pass the possibility of accruing revenue in that period.

The Senator is saying it again.  The main reason for the introduction date in this particular tax is, first of all, that naturally we would not have liked to introduce a tax in the middle of the tourist season, bad and all as it is. That is why September was chosen.  That is one reason.  The second reason is that quite an amount of discussion had to take place with the various tour operators about the implementation of this tax. Those discussions went on as and from 25 March.  There was quite an amount of detailed discussion between the various Departments and tour operators regarding the introduction of this tax.  It is for those reasons mainly that 1 September was chosen, not for political ones.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a comment that yesterday when we were speaking on this I felt very strongly that the measures had a disproportionate effect between urban and rural dwellers. I adverted to the fact that rural dwellers really do not have quite the same choices as urban dwellers.  They do not have the same public transport, they have to travel long distances to go about their legitimate business, they need to use the car for shopping, going to religious services, for coming to and fro from work and in the rural community.  I feel that in the rural community the brunt of this will be felt in a far more severe way than it is in the urban areas.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.</P>

      <P>There are two facets to this.  The Minister seems to be giving on one hand and taking with the other.  He is giving in the area of the reduction on parts and taking in the other area of the increase in excise on the petrol duty. Without going into it all again, I spoke about the disproportionate effect of this measure as between rural and urban dwellers.  I know it would be very difficult to introduce a form of taxation which would be split between urban and rural. There are far too many splits in this area as it is.  I would not be for introducing anything even more divisive.  I would just <Col N="1035" /> like to have assurances from the Minister that he is aware of the disproportionate effect of this measure.  I wonder if he has any ideas of how this could be softened in some way in the interests of the person living in a rural area.</P>

      <P>Depending on which of the sections the Senator is taking into account, excise duties or benefit in kind on cars, or a reduction in duties on parts and accessories, in my view this is the one which will be of advantage to rural dwellers because they are inclined to keep cars longer than urban dwellers.  The Senator can argue that they will be affected more by excise duty because they have to use their cars more.  One has to try to strike a balance between the various sectors in the economy and in the trades.  This is necesary and it should help to prolong the life of old cars rather than encouraging the attitude that people must replace their cars every 18 months or two years, which seems to be a feature in Ireland.  No matter what other country one goes to, one finds that the life of cars is much longer.  That has enormous implications for the balance of payments.</P>

      <P>I want to enter my protest on behalf of the motor trade against the increases in duties on hydrocarbon oils. While the Minister has been very helpful on this Finance Bill, he has done nothing whatever for the motor trade.  He has shown no sympathy for them, apart from the one thing I thanked him for.  His stock answer so far is that the dire situation of the motor trade is purely as a result of the recession.  I want to pinpoint all the increases.</P>

      <P>Both these orders were reducing excise duties imposed by the previous Government and the one before that.  We are confirming those orders.  I will give the Senator the note I have in relation to No. 255: The effect of this Order was to increase, for a temporary period, the relief from excise duty which was introduced in the Finance Act, 1981, on oil used in sea-fishing boats.  The period was from 1 June 1981 to 31 December 1981.  Initially it was 5p a gallon over and above the 2p introduced in the Finance Act, 1981.  That is the full relief from duty.  That is what the first order was doing.  The relief then reverted to 2p a gallon as and from 1 January this year.  Order No. 256 made a reduction of 2.5p per gallon in the excise duty payable on hydrocarbon oils in the residual fuel oil category intended for use for a purpose other than the generation of electricity for sale and delivered on or after 1 December, 1981.  We are confirming <Col N="1037" /> those two actions by two previous Governments.</P>

      <P>The famous one.  It has been a very long afternoon.  This has been subject to criticism across the board.  I understand the financial constraints which the Minister must juggle with and I understand that unpopular measures must be adopted in order to ensure a certain buoyancy of revenue and some stability.  In the industrial estate in Waterford there was a veritable outcry in relation to this measure, and firms who were experiencing liquidity problems and cash flow difficulties found themselves trembling on the brink of disaster.  I have a letter from one such firm, and the Managing Director, who is a German, said in his letter:</P>
      <P>It will effectively mean that we will have to arrange a bank overdraft of approximately £100,000.00 on an ongoing basis and, which you will be well aware, will be a difficult task in the present economic climate, and could possibly affect the continuity of our workforce, which is presently 114 people.</P>
      <P>This is just one firm finding itself caught in the crippling effects of high interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like some reassurance from the Minister that some way around this can be found.  I understand there is some phased payment arrangement and perhaps that will ameliorate it to some extent for some firms.  My anxiety is that it may lead to a loss of jobs and the closure of <Col N="1038" /> many firms with the consequent disruption to the economy which this will cause.</P>
    <P>All in all, the Minister, though he will necessarily feel offensive, must admit to the fact that economic commentators have been unhappy about this measure, feeling that it is a certain cosmetic accounting, and that eventually it will catch up with us, and we will have to deal with it in 1983.  It will introduce a certain artificiality into the revenue for the current year.  I would be glad to hear the Minister defend his position on this and, if he could give me the reassurance that it will not lead to closures and unemployment, I would be so much happier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator does not wish me to go into the detail and complexity of VAT and various forms of payment, but the position is that what is being done here has been talked about for some years.  In fact, I even quoted the Leader of Fine Gael in the Dáil at present as requesting the Taoiseach in October-November 1980 to have a serious look at the possibility of introducing VAT at the point of entry, because of the disadvantages that obtained, and still do, up to 1 September against those who produce at home.  There has been quite a lot of comment on this point from many sources over the past couple of months. In fact, we put it into our election programme in January and February, and here it is now in the Finance Bill having been accepted in the budget.  Obviously, I can understand and appreciate the genuine fears of those commentators and certain business people.  I took note of that even before it was announced in the budget speech which made provision for a special scheme to be operative by that date by the ICC.  There have been many discussions between the Department of Finance and the ICC to ensure that that scheme will be available for people who find themselves with liquidity problems in relation to the bringing forward of the payment of VAT and having VAT introduced at the point of entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into all the details surrounding VAT generally, by and large, if a large number of people importing goods opt for the one monthly rather <Col N="1039" /> than two monthly system they should be out of pocket for about four days only. The majority who will be affected are those who will pay in December what would normally have been due in January.  So it will not have such a huge impact.  I know it could have some cash flow problems or liquidity problems for some companies and that is why, at the very time it was introduced in the budget, I announced the setting up of this scheme operated through the ICC to help people who found themselves in that situation. I can assure the House that we will look very carefully at it to ensure that the situation outlined by the Senator does not arise where it would lead to the closure of any company, no matter how small.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the benefits to the home producers of having VAT on imports must be enormous, plus the fact that it is now fairly common knowledge that there are widespread abuses in relation to imports of goods and avoiding the VAT liability on such goods.  I was under quite a lot of pressure from 9 March until 25 March, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the election proposal for the imposition of VAT on imports.  I had ample opportunity, even in that short period, to look very carefully at the possibility of exempting certain goods or products from the imposition of VAT at the point of entry.  I felt that if we were to have the success we want to have &mdash; and I am sure the Senators and all concerned will be glad to see the outcome of this tax at point of entry in the months ahead &mdash; in relation to the elimination of avoidance, the elimination of certain advantages importers had over home producers, this should be done.  When it is shown that there will be additional revenue everybody will be quite satisfied with this new proposal.  I accept that there can and should be genuine fears on the part of some importers.  If any liquidity or cash flow problems arise as a result of bringing forward the dates of payment of VAT, then the ICC will be there and will have a suitable scheme ready by 1 September when this new proposal will come into operation.</P>

      <P>I should like to comment <Col N="1040" /> on the reassurance the Minister gave that prompt payment would ensue. Am I to understand there will be a lifting of the embargo on jobs in the public sector, and that we will see a rush of people willing to join the ranks of the Revenue Commissioners in order to deal with the outcome of this fairly radical move which, of course, will necessitate increased work in that area?  Failing that, I do not see how the prompt payment which the Minister promises can be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>This VAT payment at the point of entry is another nail in the motor traders' coffin.  When a dealer collects a car from the importer or distributor, he pays for his car and he pays VAT at the time.  The fact that the motor manufacturer or distributor has the benefit of that VAT which he has collected at the time of sale enables him to give to the motor trade credit which he could not otherwise give.  Now the motor trader will still pay for his car as heretofore at the time of collection.  The credit he got on a one-for-one basis from some manufacturers is gone by the board immediately VAT is payable at the point of entry.  The benefit of the money the motor manufacturers and distributors had at their disposal, until they had to pay in tax at the end of the two-monthly period, was given to the motor trade.  From 1 September the motor trade will find that their credit is gone and they will have to find a great deal of money in an industry which is already on its knees.  It is almost the last straw that breaks the camel's back.  There are one or two more straws left.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that at first I missed the point made by Senator Bulbulia. <Col N="1041" /> In relation to staff, whether it be staff operating this system on the ground, or in the offices paying out the money when it is due to be refunded, sufficient staff will be provided.  There will be no delays in that regard.  If additional staff break the embargo, then I suppose in these circumstances it has to be done. The question of the general embargo is a matter for the Government and it is something they will be considering.  Discussions have been going on with the Department of the Public Service in relation to any additional staff required for the efficient operation of the new system. I should like to tell Senator Daly that I am sure new suitable arrangements can be made between the importers of cars and the manufacturers of cars similar to whatever arrangements they had before. The motor trade, like all other trades, will get their refund in the refund period even before the actual car is sold to a customer.  That will be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct the Minister.  That would be a Utopian situation if it existed.  The Minister must take into account that normally I would collect the car from the manufacturer.  If the car costs in the region of £10,000 I pay for it, take it home and sell it.  Then I would recover the VAT, as the Minister said, if it was all as simple as that.  But unfortunately it is not as simple as that, because the person who buys that car could have another car to trade in and, instead of getting £10,000 I might get £3,000 or £4,000 plus his old car.  I may then have his old car in a parking lot for five or six months and the tax is payable on it.  That is where the problem arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making was that VAT would not be outstanding for that period.  At the end of the VAT period, the man will get his refund, as is known.  For example, a man brings in goods, say, cars, and on the 15th of the following month he has to pay VAT on the basis of bringing them in, and he pays it.  The VAT period ends two months later and he gets his refund whether the vehicle is sold or not.  That is the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but the Minister does not seen to understand me.  Perhaps I am not making myself very clear.  I buy a car from the manufacturer and I give him a cheque which includes the full amount of VAT.  I sell the car but, instead of getting the price of the car in cash, I get 70 per cent of it on a trade in and 30 per cent in cash.  At the end of two months, if I still have that car in stock, I can then claim back the tax on that money, but I can only get it back if I have a tax credit.  So at best I have two months, and my money is tied up there.  The manufacturer has the money he got at the point of sale and he does not have to make a return for two months.  He gives us credit terms to benefit the motor trade. That will go after 1 September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already replied to the general point the Senator made, but he will get back what he paid to the manufacturer at the end of the VAT period from the Revenue Commissioners. That is the position, and that is the way the scheme will operate.  Whatever arrangements were there previously can be re-negotiated.  They are outside the tax system.  They have nothing to do with the tax system.  Any arrangements a manufacturer has with a customer, or a customer has with a client, are matters for themselves.  That is their own business. As I said earlier, I am sure new suitable arrangements will be made in relation to any disruption of those arrangements which might arise as a result of the new imposition of VAT at the point of entry.</P>

The 100 hour winter farm school only caters for 20 or 30 people in each country and there are many farm families.

When one is legislating for a certain qualification, one has to be fairly specific &mdash; the 100 hour course is one, the farm apprenticeship board certificate is another.  Prior to ACOT, the Country Committee of Agriculture's certificates were issued in their name, and the equivalent university degree in agriculture is acceptable.  One cannot legislate for the lad who serves his apprenticeship at home.</P>
      <P>In most of these cases the individual already has had a year's agricultural experience, if he has not already taken the opportunity of doing the 100 hour course.  It would not be possible to extend it beyond that, because if we did the qualification would be meaningless.  I am sure the Senator would agree.  As I said, I will take up with the Minister for Agriculture the point made regarding the number of places available for participants in the 100 hour courses, which are held throughout the winter months and see if anything further can be done.</P>

      <P>This section introduces <Col N="1046" /> substantial changes in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976.  Do these measures represent an erosion of the existing position? Does the Minister feel it would involve the break-up of estates?  Would this be possible as a result of this measure, thereby breaking up businesses which are included in these estates? Would this put these estates at risk by forcing sales at an inappropriate moment?  We are all aware that at the moment any sales could only take place at what is an inappropriate moment.  A risk may be inherent in this, and I would like to be assured of this, but if it is, it would not be in the best interests of the country or the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give that assurance to the Senator.  I do not think this is a possibility under this section or that taxes of any kind would be the reason for the break-up of estates.  I have known certain businesses and properties being dispersed in certain ways according to the numbers in families, but that had nothing to do with the tax situation because there were fairly substantial exemption limits for taxation in relation to certain lands. Notwithstanding that, there was still the decision of the owner at the time in relation to the division of the property among his family and that had nothing to do with tax.  I do not consider that taxes as such will have the impact the Senator fears.</P>

      <P>The general changes in the capital acquisitions tax combine various acquisitions or gifts within the same classes but not across classes. Therefore, they confine the amount that can be given tax free.  This is a taxation imposition.  We are talking about substantial <Col N="1047" /> sums passing without sufficient tax being paid.  We have all spoken at different times in support of the various protests &mdash; the PRSI protest, the PAYE protest, the farmers' protest &mdash; because we were not getting sufficient taxation under the capital gains and capital acquisitions taxes or whatever it might be.  We cannot argue it two ways.  I am saying this as a general point.  All day the Senator has been asking for information about what is intended under the various sections and for further elaboration of the sections, and I am doing my best to reply.</P>
      <P>This is a further imposition of taxation, and a relaxation of the relief that obtained for certain families.  In that respect, this is going to cause some difficulty, I will not say hardship, because I do not think it should in relation to the amounts of money we would be talking about.  What we are talking about here is equity within the tax system and broadening it to help the Exchequer situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about the problems that have already been created not far from here by a semi-Státe body in terms of destruction of our heritage, to illustrate the fact that one cannot leave things entirely to administrators.  What is most important in terms of preservation of our national heritage is national awareness and that means awareness by the population as a whole.  It is the only protection we have.  The illustration I gave was the destruction wrought by the ESB on a large section of Fitzwilliam Street, that marvellous vista of Georgian buildings, ruined now by a red monstrosity. There were great protestations at the time but it came to nothing in face of the intransigence of that organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important if we are to pass this Bill that the situation should be seen to be better than it is at present.  It is no use <Col N="1049" /> passing a Bill which is going to hold things up rather than to speed them on.  By this I mean the whole awareness of our national heritage and in that respect the educational role which this council will play is probably the most important thing they will have to do.</P>
    <P>One has only got to look at the cross-Border situation.  This morning we talked about selling our natural gas to Northern Ireland.  As far as this Bill is concerned, we could learn a great deal from the example that the North has set us.  There a Prime Minister, now Lord O'Neill, took a great interest in Ulster history.  He comes from a very historic Irish and Ulster family and to a large extent he was responsible for the foundation of the Ulster Folk Museum in Cultra which is one of the finest examples of such an institution in the world.  It is a great tribute to the Northern people not only in terms of the actual location and the physical rebuilding of houses coming from the various periods of Ulster history but in the research facilities, the library facilities and the general attitude of making history available to the widest possible public.  We should look at what Northern Ireland has done and we should copy such examples.  We should see how we can benefit from the Ulster experience and the Ulster expertise.</P>
    <P>Another example not State funded &mdash; in fact, privately funded &mdash; is the Mellon homestead near Omagh in County Tyrone.  There again, it is an absolutely marvellous example of what can be done. One has the old Mellon cottage from where the family sprang and then examples of the houses in Pennsylvania where they first settled.  The contrast is very marked and a visit to the Mellon homestead and indeed to the Ulster Folk Museum is most inspiring.</P>
    <P>One of the things I am disappointed about in this Bill is something that Senator Mallon mentioned this morning.  We say this is a National Heritage Bill but no mention is made of statutory contacts with the corresponding body in the North.  As far as I recall, no mention of this was made in the Minister's Second Stage speech.  The North might as well <Col N="1050" /> not have existed.  Now that is a shortsighted view because in this area we have a great deal to learn.  Our Northern friends are well ahead of us in the preservation and presentation of their heritage and we should be talking to them and learning from them.  I would like to see something in the shape of a provision for a very definite link between the council we intend to set up and the corresponding body in Ulster.</P>
    <P>One other item of which I have some experience is the interest in local history which is springing up in all parts of the country.  Here, again, in Northern Ireland the structures have been set up. The local history associations have been in operation now for a number of years and many of them are producing their own journals.  They have a whole programme of lectures, film shows and local history studies.  Every aspect of local history in Northern Ireland is being examined and that is something which is to be commended.  Here there is a similar interest but the same structures have not emerged.  We have a great deal to learn from our friends in the North in the way they have encouraged local history societies by giving some central encouragement but by allowing and encouraging self-reliance in local areas.  It is really remarkable what has been achieved and we have a great deal to learn.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister in his reply to make it absolutely clear that the council which we are about to establish in this Bill are going to prove a real and definite benefit.  We face a situation in which Government expenditure is going to be cut back severely over the next decade or so.  The Department of the Public Service have as their job the overseeing of the staffing and the finance of personnel in the public service.  They will be at the forefront of the cutting and the chopping that will go on.  One wonders if they will not see this National Heritage Council and the various expenditures which they will undertake as an area which is more expendable than most others.</P>
    <P>I really worry that the structure we are describing will not help but may even hinder the developments which we all wish to see and which everybody who has <Col N="1051" /> spoken in the debate so far wishes to encourage.  One wonders in a situation such as the Wood Quay situation what the reaction of a council would be, because in Wood Quay it was not very long before politics entered the situation. We had a debate in this House in which a motion to preserve Wood Quay was defeated by only one vote.  That gave a pretty good indication of the division in the country over the issue of Wood Quay. There was a tremendous amount of concern that the buildings which are now appearing just below Christ Church Cathedral &mdash; which are going to have the effect of blotting out that cathedral from human view from the north side of the city &mdash; would cover a vital part of our Viking heritage which was irrecoverable once those buildings were put up.  There was a great deal of public disquiet right across the board.  The issue, because Dublin Corporation were involved, became political, and there still is a good deal of debate as to whether the essentials have been preserved as Dublin Corporation would claim.  So, whether one likes it or not, politics is bound to come into this, and we hope that the council, when it is set up, will be sufficiently independent to take a stand on these important issues.</P>
    <P>Two of the functions which the council will have to undertake are the overseeing of the National Museum and the overseeing of our parks.  There is a contrast between the two because great progress has been made particularly in recent times in our national parks.  The people who run the national parks service are to be commended on the improvements they have made in the existing parks and the developing of new ones.  They have greatly added to our countryside and to our towns and they have done a magnificent job.</P>
    <P>The National Museum is a remarkable institution.  It is one of the most remarkable of such museums in any part of the world with its heritage of gold and stone. It is a marvellous panoply of Irish history. Many people who come from outside are astounded by the idea that a highly developed civilisation existed in this country <Col N="1052" /> prior to the 10th century.  It is quite new to them.  It is certainly new to most of my friends in the United Kingdom and they get a shock when I show them the National Museum.  It is not so new to our friends in Europe, because the Irish missionary tradition of the 13th and 14th centuries still has an impact and that impact remains.</P>
    <P>The National Museum has suffered for a considerable period from great disabilities in terms of staff, rooms for display and the primary facilities a museum needs.  These have been in very short supply.  We have the parks, where the situation is very encouraging and the National Museum where things are not encouraging at all.  We have fallen very much behind in our efforts just to maintain a reasonable standard.  I wonder if the council will have the teeth, the finance and the muscle to make the necessary improvements to the National Museum which we know are long overdue? On a number of times they have been discussed in this House.  There have been a couple of Adjournment motions in my time here, crying out for more money and more space for the National Museum.  I hope the council will be able to deal with this very serious problem.</P>
    <P>Another item which was referred to in an Adjournment discussion in this House not so long ago was the state of our national geological collection which, when the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction were here at the turn of the century, was stored in this House.  Parts of it are stored in Daingean, and when the question was raised some years ago the Minister admitted that our national geological collection was stored in such a way that it was not available to the public.  That was at a time when there was the great expansion in the oil industry and when our scientists were putting great emphasis on the newly discovered mineral wealth which Senator Crowley referred to this morning.  I learned the same geography as he did: I learned that there was not any mineral wealth in this country when I went to school in the fifties.  Now that has been proved to be totally wrong.  As an added help to our scientists, our geologists, our science <Col N="1053" /> teachers in the schools, we should have our national geological collection on proper display.  Some improvements have been brought about since that Adjournment debate a few years ago but I am certain that not everything has been done that could have been done in terms of display.  Is this council going to have the finance, the expertise and the muscle to be able to deal with problems such as this?</P>
    <P>I would like to mention one other item which I have felt very sore about and where something has got to be done very soon or an important part of our heritage will disappear off the face of the map totally.  Here, again, there is a contrast with what has happened in Northern Ireland.  I refer to pub interiors.  Fifty years ago Dublin possessed a collection of varied pubs whose interiors in wood and stained glass dating from the Victorian period, were a joy and a delight. Over the years, as the pub trade increased in commercial value, the majority of these houses were bought by developers.  The old stained glass and the wood have been stripped and have been replaced by chrome and by mock leather. These famous old pubs have been turned into drinking emporia by philistines of the worst type.  Only a week ago we saw two famous Dublin pubs on the market. Probably the best interior in Dublin is in Ryan's pub in Parkgate Street, absolutely marvellously maintained by the Ryan family, with the barrels and the brasses all polished up.  It is a joy to go in there. Whether one takes a drink or not one cannot help being affected by such an interior.</P>
    <P>Another pub which has just come on the market is Bowes in Fleet Street where there are some of the old snugs which were a feature of all these establishments and which have now become rare.  Individuals have protested at what has been going on but there has been no concerted attempt to declare the famous interiors of these houses to be a part of our heritage which must not be ruined.  They have just suffered a purely commercial fate and in most cases they have been wrecked.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland just opposite what <Col N="1054" /> used to be the old GNR station in Great Victoria Street, now beside that monstrosity, the Europa Hotel, there are two of the finest pubs in this country.  One is the Crown and the other is Robinson's. When the Europa was bombed by that organisation to which I referred this morning, which does everything in the name of Irish unity, the Crown bar with marvellous stained glass from the Victorian period was, to a great extent wrecked. The stained glass was broken almost beyond repair and the fate of the pub hung in the balance.  Some enterprising Ulster people got together and they persuaded the National Heritage Trust, or whatever the corresponding body is in Britain, I am not quite clear on its title, that this interior was unique, that it should be preserved, that the stained glass should be replaced and that the brass should be polished.  This has happened. It has been taken over, with some help from one of the big breweries, by the National Trust and it has been entirely refurbished as it was originally. The wood has been replaced by wood stained in the same way, the snugs have been rebuilt, the stained glass has all been done again.  I do not know how they did it but they have done it all again in an absolutely marvellous way.  It has been done by the corresponding body in Ulster to the body we are talking about setting up here.  That is an example of the awareness in Ulster of their part of the Irish heritage.  I regret to say that few enough of our proprietors or their clients in the pub trade in Dublin have shown similar awareness.  I hope the Minister in his reply will say something about these interiors which are in great danger of disappearing totally in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the Bill.  I think that the general spirit is correct but I wonder whether the mechanics will work as we hope they will.  In particular, I would like to see section 7 strengthened. A number of previous speakers have said that section 7, which is the section which deals with the preservation, restoration, repair, upkeep and improvement of heritage buildings, is too strong.  If a State authority intend to disturb, demolish or destroy one of these heritage buildings <Col N="1055" /> they have to indicate in writing to the council that they intend to do so and they have &ldquo;to receive and take into account the advice of the council in relation thereto.&rdquo;  My feeling is that that is no good.  They have to receive, take into account and act on the advice of the council.  I intend putting down amendments to strengthen the functions of the council in this respect so that State or other bodies just will not receive advice but will act on it.  I want to give the council some teeth in this matter because as the section stands there is no reason whatever for the State authority to act on the advice of the council in terms of preservation, maintenance and so on.  That needs to be strengthened and I would like, when the appropriate time comes, to put down amendments to strengthen that section.  There are other amendments to this complicated Bill which will be essential and I hope if this Bill is sufficiently amended it will make a real contribution to the preservation of the essential parts of our heritage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillaHannon" hpid="Mrs. Hannon Mrs. Hannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity to welcome the Minister to the House and to say how happy we are to have him with us.  We are all aware of our heritage but most of us have a differing opinion of the contents of that heritage or of the dangers threatening it. There is no exact account of how many national monuments we have but one suggestion is in the region of 150,000, which is a very big number indeed.  The State has approximately 1,200 monuments either in ownership or guardianship, about 350 more have preservation orders and another 1,000 or so are listed. As listing only gives limited protection, the number of monuments constructed before 1700 AD and adequately protected are very small indeed when one compares them to a country like Denmark, which is half the size of Ireland, but which has 25,000 prehistoric monuments fully protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very fortunate to live in a very historic county like Meath.  There is a wealth of history in that county.  We have Newgrange on which a magnificent job <Col N="1056" /> has been done and I am delighted to see people from every part of the country coming to visit Newgrange.  We also have Trim which is steeped in tradition and has a wonderful castle.  Again, a wonderful book has been compiled and one can walk around Trim and spend a whole day there seeing all the ruins.</P>
    <P>I hope that this is the sort of thing that this council will encourage in every part of the country.  Again, in Trim we have an education centre and a museum.  It gives the opportunity to the people of rural Ireland to take advantage of the facilities that are available to their urban counterparts to see some of the exhibits from our National Museum.</P>
    <P>All our monuments are a priceless legacy, yet many of them are being threatened by senseless destruction.  As a result of minimal involvement by the State, up to 70 per cent of national monuments in some areas have been destroyed or severely damaged over the past 150 years.  This has accelerated enormously in modern times and since 1950 the destruction has been relentless.  This is why I welcome this Bill which will cater for archaeological matters and other aspects of our national heritage.  It will assume responsibility for the functions exercised by the Departments of Transport and Education, the National Museum and the Commissioners of Public Works.  In addition to archaeology, museum development, historic monuments, national parks, heritage houses and gardens and inland cruiseways, the council will have wide ranging powers and will be in a position to give expert advice to public bodies.  I feel that as a result of this our heritage will be much more secure under the auspices of the council.</P>
    <P>I know that the members of the council will endeavour to see that the mistakes that have been made in the past will not be repeated in the future.  The council will also ensure that our heritage will be explained and exhibited in the manner befitting it.  Last year Bord Fáilte took the iniative in publishing a new tourist guide which covers houses, castles and gardens and gives a brief description of each of them.  I feel this is something that <Col N="1057" /> should not be just for our tourists but should be something for every one of us to buy and be able to enjoy and so be aware of our heritage.  I was delighted to see the Department of Fisheries and Forestry mentioned as the Department which will be consulted by the council, because they are doing a very fine job. The Forest and Wildlife Service is responsible for State forest development and management and the encouragement of private forestry.  It also has responsibility for wildlife conservation and games development.</P>
    <P>Senator West spoke of the growing popularity of national parks, and I feel the people concerned are to be congratulated on this. More and more people are enjoying the pleasures of the parks each year.  In An Grianán, the educational centre for the Irish Countrywomen's Association, we are setting up a museum at present.  We made approaches to the National Museum and they were very receptive of our idea and have promised to give us some exhibits both on a permanent basis and on loan.  It is a step in the right direction to move these objects out of Dublin and give the people of rural Ireland the opportunity to see them and enjoy them.  Up to now a number of specialist organisations like An Taisce and the Housing Trust have done trojan work.  They have provided a vital service in cushioning the impact of industrialisation and urbanisation.  The new council can continue this fine work with vision and initiative.  A new beginning is needed to ensure that our archaeological inheritance is preserved for posterity and I feel this Bill is a move in the right direction. I welcome it and hope that it will soon be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and I would like at the outset to pay a tribute to the Bord of Works, the National Museum and to the excellent work of the National Monuments Commission over the years.  The Board of Works as an institution more often than not come in for criticism or are accused of being too slow, but at least in the case of what they tackle with the limited <Col N="1058" /> resources they have they demonstrate that they are expert and leave nobody in any doubt about that.  One needs only to look at the work they have undertaken in the Midlands &mdash; Kilkenny Castle, the abbey in Graiguenamanagh and Holy-cross. These are tremendous works of conservation and preservation and maintenance.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan dealt at length with Kilkenny city, and I do not want to follow him down the same road.  Deputy Gibbons, when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance in charge of the Board of Works, some years ago set the ball rolling in that respect.  Since that time there has been new thinking in the board which has enabled it to do a lot even though I still believe that greater resources must be made available and I hope that the council as envisaged in this new Bill will be given the facilities and the finance to tackle the job as it should be tackled, because we need to have greater conservation and preservation, apart from maintenance.  The Board of Works are tremendous.  They have a role to play in maintenance.  Seir Ciaran in Offaly which is a very ancient Christian site is difficult to get into; certainly that was so last year with nettles, docks, weeds and thistles.  When I reminded the Board of Works of its existence they took action and they carried out a small improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these difficult times of high unemployment I would hope that the council, who must start off conscious of their role in maintenance, would tackle the job of maintaining the sites free of weeds, thistles and nettles so that people can get access to them.  In summer time children with bare legs will suffer unless the nettles are removed.  Would it be possible for this new council to look at the relief type schemes that local authorities operated up to the sixties when in the autumn months before Christmas they were able to engage people to do maintenance work and give them a few shillings for Christmas? In the summer months that kind of operation might be tackled if not by the Board of Works then by this new council so that historic sites will at least be maintained and would be accessible to the <Col N="1059" /> public.  In every county there are many sights of historic interest.  I am sure the authorities know where they are but much work needs to be done.  The public need to have access to sites so as to appreciate their worth.  We have a lot to learn from our history and it must be kept before the coming generations.</P>
    <P>In my own county of Laois we have the Rock of Dunamase which has a recorded history which is at least a couple of thousand years old.  During the period when I had the honour of serving as Vice-President of the European Commission for Cultural Affairs, I had the opportunity of visiting practically all the major museums in Europe, but on one such visit to Greece I saw a map there which showed Hibernia in a rather square form.  It was almost 2,000 years old and Dunamase was one of the three places marked on that map.  I believe it has a very glorious history.  It was burned down.  I am sure it would be an interesting place for a dig, but to date the Board of Works have not been able to acquire it or have not been sufficiently interested in taking it over despite the fact that to restore both the east gate and the west gate would not be a tremendous job.  You had that as a seat of power in the 16th century where the one clan kept Essex and his men at bay for almost half a century.  Apart from the fact that it is in a very beautiful setting in the midlands I think the Board of Works have been playing around with it long enough.  I hope the Minister will take out the file and see if it can be signed over into the care of the State without further and undue delay.  I do not think there is any problem with purchase.  It is only a matter of tying up the legal ends.</P>
    <P>My experience over a long number of years with local and public authorities is that they do not want to maintain an old building or, if they think it is getting in the way of traffic, they diagnose that it has dry rot or woodworm or some other malady and it must be got rid of as a nuisance.  Many old Georgian buildings have met that fate over the years.  I remember the courthouse in Mountrath, which, I suppose, has not very happy historical memories.  Nevertheless, it was <Col N="1060" /> of some architectural value.  There was a tremendous effort to get rid of it and eventually it was replaced by a not very nice looking circular rose bed with three or four different public notices stuck up in the middle of it.  I think that when these buildings are removed they take with them part of the character of the towns and the streets in which they stood.</P>
    <P>The approach of public authorities and even of the Department of Finance to heritage buildings in the past has been peculiar.  I will take a fairly recent example, Malahide Castle.  It was handed over to the State.  I think it was passed on as a going concern, as a property in which the benefactor had resided up to his or her death.  The will was no sooner read than the Minister sold it &mdash; not the Castle itself but he had a clearance sale to raise a few million pounds out of it.  He just disposed of or distributed a priceless collection which it took the family several hundred years to collect in artefacts, furniture and works of art.  That is said, because especially in a capital city such as Dublin, people need places to go with their families, whether it is on a half-day or an evening, and people like to see things of beauty or art such as that.  The State must surely see a need to conserve, not only from a historical point of view, but people must, I think, always be reminded of the past, even if it does not always make us happy.  It is good to see how the country and the people evolved. For that reason the State should be a little more culturally minded.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance on the Finance Bill this morning kept on reminding us that the country is in a dire recession and perhaps this is not the best climate in which to talk about spending money on conservation and on maintenance of ancient or historic monuments, but I think the State and public bodies must give a lead in their attitude to maintenance and to conservation. Some years ago before CIE, a Dublin bus company operated public transport between Dublin and Limerick.  Between the towns of Portlaoise and Mountrath there was an ancient Abbey of Cloneanna which had there Saint Fintan's tree.  I think Saint Fintan was an 8th <Col N="1061" /> century saint.  He had trouble with his landlord at the time and he took away the well, and the well sprang up in a tree several feet high.  But the bicycles on top of the old bus company's bus were constantly being swept off the top by the branches of this tree and so the managing director of the Dublin Omnibus Company wrote to the county council at the time to have the tree removed.  The county surveyor went out to the ganger and the ganger said he would not touch it.  The council could not get anyone to cut down the tree.  I do not know whether it was because it was a holy well that was on top of the tree or whether they were afraid of the fairies, but nobody would touch it.  It is quite a different situation now with the bulldozer, which does not fear God or man or fairies.</P>
    <P>On record in the council is a copy of a letter the county surveyor wrote to the Dublin bus company telling them that if they wanted to cut the tree they could come down and cut it themselves.  It is less than 20 years ago since the council conserved the tree and routed the road, at some public expense, around that particular ancient monument which is a holy well which sprang up in this tree several hundred years ago.  I mention that point to illustrate here again the situation where it was possible to have a public authority even consider that kind of vandalism. I think we must get conservation orders on everything that is worth conserving. There are many fine old trees. Developers move in very fast with bulldozers, given half a chance.  I would like to see in this Bill real penalties, not just fines of £200 or £300.  The penalty for somebody who for gain would destroy an ancient monument should be ten or 20 times the value of the actual site as a commercial site.  It should be prohibitive in the case of anyone who would perhaps ruin an ancient monument, whether so designated or not, for personal gain.  If it is done in the name of a council I think the penalty should be several times the wages or the salaries of the people who give the order to do it as well as of those people who are involved in actually doing it, because with just one sweep of the blade of a bulldozer one can have the <Col N="1062" /> history of hundreds or thousands of years wiped out.  We must be very clear on exactly what we want in this regard.  I hope that it will be possible to tighten up control and give the new proposed council greater powers and that there would be greater accountability all along the way.</P>
    <P>A greater effort should be made by the council and indeed by local authorities to find new uses for ancient and historic buildings and for buildings of particular architectural value.  There must be quite a number that can be adapted.  Again, as an illustration there is a Church of Ireland church which was designed by Gandon at Coolbanagher, near Emo in County Laois.  I am sure it was built for Lord Portarlington at that time.  Over the last few years that has been restored to its original proportions and design &mdash; the original plans were still available.  It certainly is something that is worth beholding and the lines and the proportions are indeed a joy to behold.  That kind of an effort should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment should be aware of our heritage and of our environment.  Only four or five years ago they paid a grant to reconstruct a Tudor house in County Laois, I thought it was sad to find that a house which dated back to the 15th or 16th century with the original hand-cut oak beams and small windows was replaced by nice plaster slabs and plush doors.  It seems a pity that an inspector could not have been able to say to the person before the work was started that a heritage grant would be available or put him in touch with somebody who would assist and advise him. After all, we do not have very many thatched houses of the last century, never mind rare specimens like that.</P>
    <P>The heritage of the country should be the business of everybody, especially those working for the State.  I hope this Bill will result in greater co-operation and co-ordination between all the agencies and services working for the State and within the State.</P>
    <P>Somebody welcomed the fact that the Department of Agriculture were mentioned in the Bill but I think they are the greatest philistines the country has ever <Col N="1063" /> seen.  I started on a long reclamation job the year before last and they cut me by £300 because I refused to cut a white-thorn bush which was growing in the middle of a pasture on low-lying land where there is no danger of tillage.  The tree has a span of 12 feet and it is a beautiful specimen.  I suppose I was guided by the fact that I can have whatever I like in my own field: I do not think it was the fact that I was a tremendous conservationist but the fact was that I did not want to be told what to have or what not to have. Perhaps that annoyed me.  The land reclamation people do a great deal of damage that is not necessary to get the land into full production.  I do not think every bush or tree or hedge should be despoiled. Those growing things are necessary if wildlife is to be conserved.  Before this century is out, foxes and hares will be extremely rare in this country.  People see them as vermin but they are there to keep a certain balance of nature.  People do not see them as having any use.  I doubt if this new council will be able to extend themselves that far.  Nevertheless the great work that An Taisce have undertaken over the years, especially since the Planning Acts are being implemented, has been invaluable and I hope they will be given a role and will be able to cooperate with this council when they are set up.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I would like to say to local authorities and local authority members who sit on planning sub-committees: they should practise the art of saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;; that they do not want to bend rules and regulations.  Especially with conservation they ought to be conscious of their obligation to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; when necessary in the general interest.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to see this Bill coming to the House.  I know it is coming at a time when there is not as much money as we would like to have to spend on conservation and on maintenance, but with the will, the way will be found to maintain that which will enhance the quality of life in the country.  If one undertakes the Seanad election tour around the country one sees in practically every other town the same kind and type of houses; if you <Col N="1064" /> go into a housing estate you could almost give the date it was built and you would also know the architect because I think there must be only three architects working for the 27 county councils.  Everything is dated with Bestone and cement blocks and there is very little of architectural value.</P>
    <P>Our planners, engineers and architects seem to be dead set on removing every tree or bush or hedge as they like to have the place in one concrete jungle.  This takes from the environment.  People wonder why we have so many vandals and why young people seem to be so bent on destruction.  Their environment is static and though it is new, it is dead: there is no life present, no movement.  If the builders and the planners were able to plan the housing schemes and break them up so that they would fit into the existing countryside, people would have a different and more human environment and perhaps would not be so aggressive.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success in his role and I hope this new council will be able to take up the best traditions of the two or three bodies they are replacing.  I wish them success and I hope that when the council are established they will be able to take over Dunamase and take it into their permanent care.</P>

Bhí a lán cainte mar gheall ar áiteanna stairiúla, museums agus rudaí mar sin. Nílim chun morán a rá faoi na rudaí sin mar labhair Seanadóirí go sár-mhaith orthu.  Ach ba mhaith liom cúpla rudaí eile a rá.  Tá a lán rudaí eile gur ceart dúinn bheith ag tabhairt aire dóibh, rudaí mar ár rinncí agus ceol.  Nuair a théann tú trasna na tíre féachann tú ar na coillte agus na crainn iontacha a bhí an Seanadóir McDonald ag caint futhu.  Nílimíd ag tabhairt aire dóibh sin ach oiread.  Ba cheart dúinn bheith ag tabhairt aire dos na rudaí sin mar sin cuid d'ár dtír agus na daoine a chuaigh romhainn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not spend a lot of time talking about museums or about archaeology as <Col N="1065" /> they have been well talked about by many of the previous speakers.  It is not that I do not appreciate museums, it is not that I do not appreciate archaeology but they have been well looked after.  There are many more things in our heritage, many things that we seem to disregard and take for granted as part of our heritage.  I am afraid we will lose track of many of those things.  We have our traditional dances. If you go to County Clare you have the Clare set, they have a set in Limerick and I presume Kerry has its own set.  We do not concern ourselves with all these things.  They are there.  We should be nourishing them.  This is part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>Music is part of our heritage.  It is as much part of our heritage as the Hill of Tara or Newgrange.  We have barely talked about it.  The game of hurling is part of our heritage.  It is probably one of the most ancient games of skill in European civilisation.  I am not sure if it was referred to earlier on in this debate.  Senator O'Connell mentioned, when he was talking about our identity, that it would be very evident during the course of the latter part of the summer and early part of the autumn in various parts of the country, when people on Sunday afternoon would gather in various places for strange rituals associated with leather and wood.  I am not sure if that is hurling. I would just call it hurling.  It is a much better name for it.  I asked a colleague of mine what were various rituals associated with leather and wood right through the country.  Maybe the man wants to build mini Sohos in which these pursuits can be followed.  These are part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday week I had the privilege to be with members of the European Council on a trip to Newgrange.  I stood in Newgrange and I looked across the plains of Meath, I could have stood in a similar place in other parts of the country where there are mountains, hills and bogs and I could have thought the same thoughts.  I said: &ldquo;This is Ireland, here is history right under my feet.&rdquo;  When I looked across I saw the Hill of Slane where Saint Patrick is reputed to have lit the paschal fire.  Then I looked a little more to the west and I saw Tara where <Col N="1066" /> high kings resided.  This is all part of our heritage.  I looked around me and saw the river Boyne, the beautiful waterway winding its placid way through the plains of Meath and I said: &ldquo;This is our heritage.&rdquo; I looked across at the woods and the trees and I saw the elm, the oak and the beech and I said: &ldquo;This is our heritage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All these things combined are our heritage. It is important in this debate that this should be brought out.  We should talk about the living things we have.  We have talked about the past.  It is right that we talk about the past and about museums.  It is right that we have museums in which to house things that are important in the growth and the culture of this nation.  It is right that we talk about our ancient monuments because they are important as reminders of the great tradition, the great educationalists and the great philosophers from whom we were bred.  We should never forget what is growing.</P>
    <P>Part of our heritage is our people.  We must show respect for that irrespective of who our people may be, whether they be the tinker, the tailor, the soldier, the sailor, the rich man, the beggarman, the poor man or the thief.  I would add another profession to that, a fine profession of men and women who were referred to three times in the last week, once in this House, once on radio and once in a press conference as if they were sadistic, semi-retarded morons.  Those are the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Senators, welcome this Bill.  I have given quite a good deal of thought to the Bill for reasons which I will explain in my address.  It is a very important Bill.  A Bill dealing with our heritage is very important indeed.  I agree with the idea of bringing together heritage functions which have been scattered throughout the civil service.  I agree with the idea that a State-sponsored body in the form of the proposed Heritage Council is important.  The eventual council must be acceptable to the plain people of Ireland and it must be sensitive to the wishes and the aspirations about heritage matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> There has been an enormous amount of comment in recent years about the growth of the public service and about the way in which it has been concentrated here in Dublin.  Here we have draft legislation to establish a new public body.  I most earnestly and strongly recommend to the Minister that this body should be located away from Dublin.  I particularly ask the Minister's advisers here to take note of that suggestion.  The Minister for the Public Service has an opportunity to strike a bold stroke and to designate the Heritage Council for the provinces. This would be in keeping with Government policy in this particular area.  I would go a stage further and call on the Minister to name a centre outside of Dublin as a location, and I would ask him to name it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend to my colleagues that they support this request in principle. If the Minister does not do this we can all be certain that the public servants will come up with every reason in the world why it should be located in Dublin. In my opinion this would be a very bad beginning for national heritage.  Ireland to me is its townlands, villages, towns, counties and regions.  Unfortunately, far too many influential people think that Ireland is Dublin.  I have heard many important commentators speak about the growth of Dublin city with all its undesirable consequences and the concentration of salary workers in the city.  People everywhere are becoming alert to this. There is a growing demand, which has not been yet properly voiced, for corrective action.  Too many opportunities have been missed, for example, Bord na Móna headquarters, ACOT and many others. Here is a new opportunity which should not be missed.</P>
    <P>Whilst the Minister might consider various locations for the Heritage Council I humbly ask that Athlone be seriously considered purely on its merits, for the following reasons.  Athlone is steeped in historic content.  Athlone is the bridge between the east and the historic west.  The greatest single physical feature that the Heritage Council will be concerned about is the river Shannon. <Col N="1068" /> Athlone is the largest town on the navigation upstream from Thomond Bridge in Limerick, which is referred to in section 4 (2) (f) of this Bill.  Athlone is the most strategically placed centre on the navigation between the two lakes of Lough Derg and Lough Ree.  Excellent riverside development has taken place in and around Athlone.  Athlone is the most central location in relation to the national park and other properties listed in Parts I and II of the Second Schedule to the Bill.  Connemara, Burren, Kilkenny Castle, Glenbeigh and others are mentioned. It is also convenient to the historic Clonmacnoise, the Goldsmith country, to Tara and so on.  Athlone is well located in relation to forest parks.</P>
    <P>The absence of a proper regional heritage policy is reflected in the Bill and in the Minister's speech on 30 June.  The vast bulk of the items to which reference is made are located in Dublin or near the coast.  Do we not think of the Midlands? What about Athlone Castle?  This is surely one of most striking and most dominating features in all Ireland.  Surely its site location is the most important gateway to the West.  Its singular significance at vital stages in Irish history should mean that it should have been listed as a special item in our heritage.</P>
    <P>Reference to the canals has in some ways been disappointing.  It will be a mystery to many people that the canals cannot be easily transferred from CIE because, as we know from our own local authority matters, of legal complexities. Canals are too important in the context of the Shannon navigation to be dealt with separately.  The canals up to now have received scant attention from CIE. I ask the Minister to give us some insight into the legal complexities to which he referred, because if we do not sound a note of urgency about this particular matter the wish to have them transferred will have somewhat disappeared.</P>
    <P>I have to say an important word about the Shannon.  This Bill proposes the transfer of the navigation functions from the Office of Public Works to the Heritage Council.  While the Office of Public Works in my opinion have done excellent work on the Shannon I have often heard <Col N="1069" /> criticism that they were not at all sensitive to the views and to the wishes of commercial interests.  The approach of the National Heritage Council in the navigation improvement will have to be primarily a commercial as distinct from an engineering approach.</P>
    <P>I would like to get at something which is most fundamental in this.  Transfer of navigation functions does nothing to solve the overall problem of the Shannon. It is the greatest waterway in Great Britain and Ireland.  It is one of the greatest waterways in Europe and was described in the Rydel Report as one of the greatest rivers of the world.  In November 1979 there was a submission to the Government by representatives of 12 counties in the Shannon catchment area which dealt with this overall situation. It dealt with many things like power supply, fisheries, navigation, town and agricultural areas, effluent disposal and arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>What regard precisely does this Bill have to this particular submission?  What is the position about the overall scheme for the Shannon for which the EEC have provided something close to £500,000? My opinion is that the vast potential of the Shannon will not be realised until there is one overall development body for the Shannon, which has already been recommended.  Where does the navigation function of the proposed Heritage Council fit in this context?</P>
    <P>These are questions of importance. The Seanad would be making a big contribution if it were to explore these further. I want to again emphasise my wish that this Heritage Council be located outside Dublin.  I recommend that this be enshrined in legislation.  I respectfully submit that what I see as a genuine merit of Athlone be taken into account in this particular context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McEllistrim, to this House tonight.  I welcome the opportunity that Senators have had on all sides of the House to contribute to this very important matter.  The fact that this Bill was brought to us here prior to its introduction in the Dáil is a <Col N="1070" /> very significant step and one which is in keeping with your feeling about the importance of the Seanad, the Leader of our House and the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Public Service in his very excellent speech when introducing the National Heritage Bill made what I would regard as one of the very finest speeches of content and of sentiments that I have read or listened to for a long time.  Therefore, I regard this Bill as very important.  As a Senator on the other side mentioned today we were occupied all morning and, indeed, most of the afternoon with financial affairs, such as gas, money or absence of both; we were occupied with matters of economic importance. I feel very strongly that we cannot divorce our economic affairs from our cultural affairs.  I also feel very strongly when times are hard, money is tight and we are the whole time being exhorted to tighten our belts and look carefully at every penny and púnt that we spend, matters cultural should never lose their importance.  We are much diminished as a people and as a nation if we lose touch with our past, if we lose touch with our heritage and if we do not take inordinate care to see that our heritage in all aspects is preserved and prolonged.  It is our duty as public representatives to see that the final aspect of our heritage is passed on to the next generation and generations after.  We will not be thanked by future generations if we lose any aspect of our past which could contribute so much to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the National Heritage Bill and the stated intention of the Minister that he does not intend to prevaricate.  I noted when Senator O'Connell spoke so eruditely from the opposite side of the House on the introduction of this Bill he had slight reservations.  The words he used were &ldquo;the excessive expedition of this measure&rdquo;.  Yet when I spoke on adoption last week and I spoke about <i>festina lente</i> I was cavilled at, so I suppose you wear different hats for different occasions.  The excessive expedition of which the Minister spoke was that he wished the council to be set up.  That is very laudable.  He also said that he would <Col N="1071" /> keep an open mind on many aspects.  This is one which we should latch on to immediately. He is willing to amend in legislation which will come before the Dáil and Seanand many aspects of this particular Bill, but his primary objective, first of all, is to set up the Heritage Council with its members, to give them their task and stated objectives, to let them work towards this and then to have it monitored and track kept of it so that from time to time the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas can comment on it and can make our points on it.</P>
    <P>Ireland is an old nation.  I was indeed interested to hear the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator McDonald, speak of the ancient map he saw in Greece and Hibernia draped upon it.  We are an amalgam of so many races and reaching back through the mists of time when it is impossible to pinpoint who we are, where we are, when we came or how we came about.  No matter how it happened or what an amalgam of strains of people we are, we are very separate and very unique.  That is the attractiveness of our country.</P>
    <P>I know when tourists come to Ireland, particularly from what we call &ldquo;the New World&rdquo;, they are fascinated because we have such a past.  It is very old to them. They can go back to the Pilgrim Fathers or what they perceived as the first mass landing on their Continent.  They come here and they see stone buildings and we can say: &ldquo;Yes, they are a thousand years old&rdquo; and that we can trace back a hill or mound.  We cannot really trace it back. It could be millions of years old.  It is a great feature with them.  They can talk about the size of Texas, the size of their ranches, the size of their farms and whatever, but they cannot touch our unique quality, which is the length of our past.</P>
    <P>The primary thing about our heritage is the fact that we have such a past.  How do we preserve it?  How do we keep it? How do we keep its unique qualities?  I think we do so, firstly by the setting up of this Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>If I may sound a little partisan note from a party political point of view, I am very glad that one of the stated commitments <Col N="1072" /> of Fianna Fáil, when we would come into power, was that we would set up this National Heritage Council.  I am glad that the economic malaise of the day has not stopped us from so doing and has not stopped the relevant Minister from carrying out his brief and the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have talked about the vast tourist potential of the past and I have talked about the philosophical need to preserve our past if we are to keep ourselves intact as a nation.  I also see it in a slightly mercenary light from the tourist point of view with the unique quality which we have by our past and the educational aspect which the Minister stressed in his introductory speech.  This is of great importance.  It is a role that the council should pay very careful attention to.</P>
    <P>I envisage this National Heritage Council to be set up, and here I would like, indeed, formally to go on record as seconding my esteemed colleague, Senator Fallon &mdash; we are from the same town of Athlone and we are beating our own particular drum here as Senator McDonald beat the Laois one loudly and clearly, we are beating the Athlone one &mdash; that we put it to the Minister that if there is a designated area &mdash; I presume there will be &mdash; for the formal setting up of this National Heritage Council I can think of no finer place than the town of Atholne for the location of a national heritage centre.  What have we got?  We have simply got everything.  We are an old town, an ancient town on one of the largest rivers in Europe and in close proximity to Clonmacnoise which is one of the oldest and most valued settlements in Europe for the instruction of scholars. We all know the poem:</P>
    <P>In a quiet watered land, a land of roses stands St. Ciaran's city fair</P>
    <P>And the warriors of Erin in their generations slumber there.</P>
    <P>That would be a marvellous focal point, and I would like to pay tribute here to the way that Clonmacnoise has been kept by the Board of Works.  I hope that the Minister will pass on our congratulations. I was there last week with French students and it was beautifully maintained, <Col N="1073" /> beautifully kept.  The guides and the literature are very good.  The crosses, the grasses and every part of it are models of what historic sites should be.</P>
    <P>Athlone is an old town, on the largest river in Ireland, easily accessible &mdash; when we have our bye road we will be much more easily accessible &mdash; with a wealth of history surrounding it.  When the Heritage Council is set up formally I would second the proposal by Senator Fallon that Athlone be chosen as the venue.  I would like that recommendation to go to the Minister.  The setting up of this council will give a focal point for many bodies who up to now had done their best, but in separate units, to promote, to preserve and to keep our heritage.  I am thinking specially about local historical societies all over the country who have beavered for years and years with no financial input, purely on a voluntary basis.  I think particularly of the Old Athlone Society who have done so much to preserve the castle in Athlone.  They have got it floodlit and have kept the museum in a very separate area there.  Societies like this around the country see the setting up of this council as a green light to them and also as an expression of interest by the Government of the day in the unsung work that they are doing and have done for so many years.</P>
    <P>I went away from the education aspect which I meant to dwell much longer on. I envisage the decentralisation of the museum.  I note that the Bill setting up the museum, which has served us so well for 104 years, the 1877 Act, will now be put to one side and that this will take over.  I hope that the many items of a local interest could be decentralised to their areas, made their main focal points of interest so that the young people particularly of those areas would have an opportunity to come to their local museum to see the items of interest relating to their past.  I just do not mean high crosses or objects of stone, I mean the implements used by people, farming implements of the last century, the clothes perhaps that people wore, the everyday articles that people used in their daily living.  History is not all in the &ldquo;old, unhappy, far off things and battles long <Col N="1074" /> ago.&rdquo;  It is very much, too, how people lived, how they ate, how they learned, how they had social intercourse with one another.  It is so many things.  It is part of what we are.  It is the make up of everyone of us.  I envisage the items of interest related to the agricultural, industrial, social, historical interest of an area being brough back to that particular location, that they would be housed suitably in a suitable environment so that everyone in that location would have a chance to see how their forebears lived.  Pride in their own locality would be fostered among the people of that particular area.</P>
    <P>The River Shannon is mentioned here but I am slightly worried about something which I shall be bringing up on the Committee Stage.  It relates to the fact that the Minister stated that he could not yet incorporate the canals into the Bill because of the complex nature of the legislation governing CIE ownership of the canals.  If the whole waterway system of the River Shannon and the canals to it could be incorporated in the Bill I would be happier.  I know that the Ireland Waterways Association intend to make a submission to the Minister on this particular aspect of it.  They are slightly worried that though the Minister has said he has an open mind and that he will look again at different aspects of it, they would like that enshrined in the Bill.  I will discuss this on Committee Stage.  That will be for another day.</P>
    <P>I would like the matter of the canals to be taken up and that this is brought into the Bill.  Too often in the past our history has been a dead matter, museums have been seen as dead places, history has been seen as an inaminate thing.  I would like to say history is alive, it is real.  It is of people, as we lived and as we worked. Ireland is unique in that we have so many generations to look back on as we lived and as we were.  I would like to say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to the Minister for bringing in this Bill.  I would like to echo formally. &ldquo;Make Athlone the heritage centre of Ireland, we will do the rest of Ireland proud.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, my concern in raising this matter is with the circular issued by the Minister F36, 1982.  I am concerned about the social implications of this circular.  I should be very glad to have whatever clarification the Minister can give, and whatever assurances he can give.  The circular refers to the raising of fees for all categories of students attending VEC courses.  I deplore the raising of fees for full-time third-level day courses and part-time courses for ordinary students, but that belongs to a wider argument about the cost of education.  I do not wish to dwell on that point.</P>
      <P>My concern is with the implications for adult and second chance education.  The implications of the Minister's circular have given rise to very serious concern among the professionals in the field, the CEOs, other administrators, teachers and adult education organisers.  They have also caused serious concern to the public at large, particularly that section of the public who are in the process of benefiting from the facilities offered by the VECs, or hope to benefit from them at a future stage.  There is real public apprehension about the directive from the Minister that the fees should be increased.</P>
      <P>Let me be more specific.  What is causing real alarm is the radical change proposed in the payment of fees for adult education classes.  Apparently there is to be a new system for September next, a system of hourly rates which will have the effect not alone of increasing significantly the cost of adult education classes but also of multiplying the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second chance education will be very <Col N="1076" /> badly hit under this drastic change. Adults who want to study for the leaving certificate and who expected their total fee outlay to be, say, £40 or so may now find themselves faced with a prohibitive three figure fee.  Harassed housewives and, indeed, harassed husbands who want to get out of personal and environmental problems, and who already may be burdened with baby sitting and other incidental costs, will now be overwhelmed by the burden involved in the new scale of fees.  If the Minister's directive is to be rigidly implemented, the fee increases can result in a substantial fall in adult education recruitment next winter. That has dangerous social consequences in the light of present day massive unemployment and increasing social alienation. I wonder does the Minister agree that what I am saying is a reasonable and non-alarmist forecast of what may happen?</P>
    <P>Apart from the second chance leaving certificate course, the fear is that the most worthwhile sections of the VECs' work in the realm of adult education courses will suffer most, and the relatively luxury courses &mdash; if I may so style them &mdash; will be largely unaffected.  The Minister's predecessor in the last Fianna Fáil Administration was responsible for instituting a number of posts in adult organisations under the VECs.  Among the valuable work done by adult education organisers has been the arrangement of courses for the socially deprived, literacy courses, and so on, courses which have not simply an individual benefit but have profound community connotations.</P>
    <P>I know of two such courses, taken at random in different VEC areas.  One is in Kilmallock, under the auspices of the Limerick VEC.  The other is in Tralee, under the auspices of the Kerry VEC. Both have brought into the net of the adult education system groups who would normally be deprived of access to self-knowledge about the tax system, their rights under the law, and so on.  One cannot imagine any more socially significant courses than these.  The question is: are these valuable community building courses to be threatened by a fee increase of twofold, perhaps threefold, significance? <Col N="1077" /> It seems to me that, even as a matter of enlightened self-interest, for our society to hazard such a consequence would be very foolish indeed.</P>
    <P>Of course we are in bad times.  Of course people should pay for the kind of courses which lead to personal fulfilment and personal enhancement.  There can be no argument about the fact that, if under the auspices of any vocational education committee, people are given the opportunity of improving their proficiency in bridge, or golf &mdash; and apparently such relatively esoteric courses are available &mdash; then they should have to pay for them. There are in Cork and in other places courses in cordon bleu cooking.  Anyone who aspires to such a skill, by definition, can afford to pay for it.</P>
    <P>The point is that there is now genuine alarm among VEC people that they will not have the necessary discretion to make the distinction between charging a substantial amount to people who want to do this kind of thing, and not charging for socially essential courses.  One of the questions I should like to ask the Minister is: is there to be an element of discretion available to the vocational educational committees within the overall imperative of observing that courses have to be as self-financing as possible?  Can they load on the cost in certain areas?  Will they have to observe an economic criterion in every single course, or can they use their discretion to charge a purely nominal fee in certain areas while making it up in other areas?</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that people should have to pay for courses like literacy courses, or the kind of courses that give their lives any basic meaning, when they feel threatened by all kinds of social and economic deprivation.  It is intolerable that they should have to pay increased fees for these facilities.  It would be rather as if the entitlements of the citizens to public library facilities were suddenly surcharged and people felt they had to pay a kind of economic cost if they wanted to go in to borrow books in the public library.</P>
    <P>We have, in theory at any rate, made considerable advances in our approaches to adult education in the past few years. <Col N="1078" /> I can remember in this House a very good debate, which I put on the Order Paper, on the importance of adult education, of second chance education The then Minister's response was extremely favourable.  I remember on that occasion welcoming the Minister's initiative in providing adult education organisers whose work has spoken for itself.  Against the evidence of forward thinking in all this, I hope we are not now moving backwards through this particular directive.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the reactionary consequences of what is now proposed and at least allow the local VECs the discretionary authority in the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, if I have not taken up my full time I would be glad if Senator O'Mahony could avail of the remaining time to say a few words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senator Murphy for allocating me a portion of his time to add my comments on the matter before us.  I became aware of this circular and the increase in fees proposed under it some days ago when a group of adults from the north side of the city came to me and said they were doing their leaving certificate course on a second chance basis and that, on the basis of the fees proposed, if they were to do four subjects in the coming academic year the cost would be of the order of £280. That is, on the basis of 80 pence per hour, three sessions per week, per subject, over the academic year, a total of £72 per year per subject.  If they were doing four the total would be over £280.  I did not believe them when they said that to me.  I did not for a minute doubt their sincerity, but I thought there must have been a mistake somewhere along the way.  I made it my business to inquire from the Dublin Vocational Education Committee whether this was in fact the case, whether people who were trying to have a second chance in education and take the leaving certificate as adults in the vocational education system would be charged £72 per subject per year.  The information I managed to glean yesterday was that a circular had come out which would have <Col N="1079" /> that effect.  I was told at the same time that there was a possibility that that circular either had been or would be withdrawn, at least in so far as second chance education was concerned.  I discovered today that there is no certainty at all that it has been or will be withdrawn in so far as second education is concerned.</P>
      <P>Clearly if they are implemented the figures involved are outrageous and would effectively put off second chance education at inter cent and leaving cert levels for those people who wished to have it and who intend to engage in it.</P>
      <P>In the area of adult education one can distinguish between so called hobby classes for which a reasonable sized fee can be justified in certain circumstances and second chance education, or community based education, where it seems to me the objective should be a zero fee rate if possible, or certainly something which is quite nominal because of the nature of the courses provided, and because of the people who are attempting to benefit from them.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify for us this evening whether Circular F36, 1982, will apply to second chance education, whether it is true that leaving certificate programmes will be charged at the rate of 80p per hour, or whether a mistake was made in issuing this circular in the first instance.  If it is true the 80p per subject per hour is being charged for second chance education, or indeed for community based education, then it seems to me that the circular must be withdrawn.  There is no possibility whatsoever that anybody wishing to benefit from these programmes can pay £72 per subject per year in the case of the leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>I hope a mistake has been made, I hope the circular has been withdrawn at least as far as second chance education is concerned.  It it has not, it is imperative that it be withdrawn forthwith.  The scale of anger building in the north side of this city is very serious indeed, and rightly so.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy should be congratulated on raising the matter here, and the Minister has an obligation to clarify this as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I share the interest of Senator Murphy and Senator O'Mahony in this topic.  I recognise their concern for some of the consequences of the increased fees and charges contained in this circular F36, 1982.  I want to say straight away that I do not think any Minister for Education likes to have to be the bearer of bad news in the sense of announcing increased charges along these lines.  In effect, the financial provisions for 1982 do not really permit of much flexibility or much discretion in this area.  One of the problems we face is that there appears to be a great reluctance on the part of the VECs to face up to the fact that they are expected to stay within their financial allocations for the year.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the financial Estimates for this year in the case of the VEC area were framed, in effect, on the basis that substantial fee increases would be needed for full-time students and, indeed, that was also the case at university level, and so forth.  As Senator Murphy pointed out, that is part of a wider debate.  The point I am making is that, given the difficulties of the financial situation, it was felt necessary to have the commitment to fee increases of that order.  It crosses a very wide spectrum of the educational sector.  Some of that increase was necessary also in the case of these adult education courses.</P>
      <P>I should, perhaps, make it clear at this point that it has been the long settled practice that, as far as possible, adult education should be self-financing.  There is no acceptance of the notion that there should be any form of general subsidy or underpinning of these adult education courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the trend, as indicated by the financial data from quite a number of committees in recent years, suggests that many of these courses have not been paying their way, so that there was an element of subsidy creeping in.  If one were to set about correcting that, it was necessary not only to have a fee increase but also to try to bring home the point <Col N="1081" /> that these courses were required to be self-financing.</P>
    <P>The basis for introducing the idea of some minimum charge for each category of class was that it was noticed that there were quite wide variations in the level of charges as between different committees. Whether or not that is desirable could be debated in some wider context.  On the face of it, until we have some more comprehensive review of education in general and adult education in particular, it seems fairer to try to introduce some degree of uniformity into the level of charges as between one part of the country and another, so that we do not have the anomaly of people in neighbouring areas facing fees of the order of three or four times those in the county next door. That is the underlying rationale for this attempt to specify minimum charges per hour for each course.</P>
    <P>On the point about drawing the distinction between what we might call the more leisure or hobby oriented classes and second chance ones, I am very sympathetic to this.  We have been exploring what is feasible in the context at this juncture.  I cannot really come forward with a very substantial easement in the situation because of the lack of apparent response by the committees to putting their financial house in order for the year as a whole despite the fact that they have been receiving letters from the beginning of this year from my predecessor as well as myself saying there simply could not be any supplementary estimates for their activities for this year because of the budgetary situation.  Despite that we are still receiving requests for very substantial supplementary funds for this year. The requests already received amount to something over £6 million, and that is with quite a number of committees still to come.  I have no idea what the total additional funds requested will be.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances I had no option but to say to the committees, as has been said to them many times already this year: &ldquo;There is not the slightest possibility of you getting £6 million or anything like it.  Would you please, therefore, try to take some action and demonstrate that you are taking some action to adapt your <Col N="1082" /> behaviour to the funds that are available to you?  Do not just carry on as though nothing has happened, and as though you can simply provide whatever courses you think best and send the bill in to the House, not just to the Government&rdquo;.  I would want to see some evidence from the committees of action on their part to adapt their overall finances to what has been provided for them this year, before I would be in a position to try to cater in any substantial way for a particular area of need.  I would have to see evidence in the area of adult education that there would be sufficient funds raised from charges for leisure or hobby-type courses to help to finance any reduction or any easing in the charges for second chance education.</P>
    <P>It should be feasible to offer a reduction of 50 per cent for any courses over and above the first two hours per week. This would tend to introduce some element of discrimination as between people turning up for one or two hours for a leisure type subject, and students who embark on a more substantial programme of second chance education or whatever, which might entail seven or eight hours or more of class work per week.  That is the sort of suggestion I would make.  I recognise that it will not go all the way towards meeting the points that have been raised, but the possibility of going further in that direction would have to await some response from the committees to the overall question of staying within their budgets for this year.</P>
    <P>I do not feel happy at having to be the bearer of these sort of tidings, but, unless and until the financial situation improves, the limited funds available for education must be allocated with some sense of priority.  In so far as pressures have come on from all levels, I tend towards the view that there is a greater degree of priority attaching to the need for additional funds at primary level and, to a lesser extent, in some sections of the post-primary attaching to the need for additional funds at primary level and, to a lesser extent, in some sections of the post-primary education sector.  I am not saying that everyone would share that view.  I do not even know the extent to which it would be possible to adapt further funding to meet that shift in emphasis.  Those would be my first concerns, and it would be only <Col N="1083" /> when progress had been recorded in that area that I could contemplate any easing in the situation for Vocational Education Committees.</P>
    <P>Specifically in the area of adult education the House will be aware that a commission are examining this subject.  They are due to report in October.  I have been in touch with them, and I am assured that they expect to adhere to that timetable. I would expect that they will come forward with some fairly practically based proposals for tackling second chance education, and so forth.  It would be in that context that we could come forward <Col N="1084" /> with what might be a more acceptable pattern of charges in future years.  As of now, the situation for this year is very much one that does not give me any real flexibility in the budgetary constraints already established.</P>
