      <P>I have notice from Senator John A. Murphy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Cancellation by the Department of Education of special course in Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick, for university graduates wishing to qualify as primary teachers.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>I welcome the commitment from the Leader of the House to have the motion taken.  We were rather unfortunate at our last sitting because business precluded it from being taken.  We might adopt that method in future when a motion has been agreed to be taken and we might refer this matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  If possible and in fairness to the Members <Col N="524" /> who wish to move a motion a special time should be set, irrespective of what happens on the day, so that they would know then that their motion would be taken that day and not the following week.  I welcome the commitment of the Leader of the House today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That a Select Committee be appointed to consider every statutory instrument laid or laid in draft before Seanad Éireann in pursuance of a statutory requirement with a view to determining whether the special attention of Seanad Éireann should be drawn to it on any of the following grounds:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that it imposes a charge on the public revenues or contains provisions requiring payments to be made to the Exchequer or any Government Department or to any local or public authority in consideration of any licence or consent, or of any services to be rendered or prescribes the amount of any such charge or payments;</P>
      <P>(ii)  that it appears to make some unusual or unexpected use of the powers conferred by the Statute under which it is made;</P>
      <P>(iii)  that it purports to have retrospective effect where the parent Statute confers no express authority so to provide;</P>
      <P>(iv)  that there appears to have been unjustifiable delay either in the laying of it before Seanad Éireann or in its publication;</P>
      <P>(v)  that for any special reason its form or purport calls for elucidation;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> (vi)  that its drafting appears to be defective; or</P>
    <P>on any other ground which does not impinge on its merits or on the policy behind it; and to report accordingly;</P>
    <P>(2)  That the Committee consists of nine members of whom three shall form a quorum;</P>
    <P>(3)  That the Committee has power to require any Government Department or other instrument-making authority concerned to submit a memorandum explaining any statutory instrument which may be under its consideration or to depute a representative to appear before it as a witness for the purpose of explaining any such statutory instrument;</P>
    <P>(4)  That the Committee has power to report to Seanad Éireann from time to time any memoranda submitted or other evidence given to it in explanation of any statutory instrument;</P>
    <P>(5)  That it be the duty of the Committee before reporting that the special attention of Seanad Éireann should be drawn to any statutory instrument to afford to any Government Department or other instrument-making authority concerned therewith an opportunity of furnishing orally or in writing such explanations as the Department or authority may think fit;</P>
    <P>(6)  That every report which the Committee proposes to make shall on adoption by the Committee be laid before Seanad Éireann forthwith whereupon the Committee shall have power to print and publish such report together with any memoranda or evidence given to it in explanation of any statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the importance of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments which is the only Oireachtas committee which oversees the vast number of statutory instruments made on foot of <Col N="526" /> our legislation.  There is a report of 100 pages by a previous committee of which I had the honour to be chairman, in the process of being printed by order of this House.</P>

      <P>I join with previous Senators in welcoming the re-establishment of this committee and also in expressing appreciation of the work done by past menbers and by the chairman, Senator West.

    <Title>National Heritage Bill, 1982: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald) Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the Bill I want to take this opportunity, a Chathaoirligh, of congratulating you on your appointment as Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann.  I congratulate all the Members and wish them every success.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of a National Heritage Council.  The main functions of the council will be to protect, preserve and develop various aspects of our physical heritage.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with the well-known features of our national heritage such as Newgrange, Glendalough, the Hill of Tara and Clonmacnoise.  However, our heritage is to be found all about us in the cities, towns, villages and countryside of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" /> Much of the fascination of the Irish landscape lies in the way in which the country has been settled by successive generations of colonists from about 6,000 B.C. and the fact that unlike many other countries it was spared the worst effects of the industrial revolution.  This pattern of human settlement and land use has left an indelible mark on the face of the country and is one of the major attractions for our European neighbours, with whom we share the greater European cultural and historical heritage.  Beginning with the earliest remains such as earthworks, hill forts, megalithic tombs, standing stones and crannogs of pre-historic times, we can trace this heritage through early Christian crosses, churches and round towers, on to medieval castles and monasteries and structures of more recent origin like court and market houses, military fortifications, watermills, canals and even traditional features of our folk culture including farm buildings, thatched cottages, walls and field patterns.</P>
    <P>We as a nation are proud of our history and heritage but regrettably very often this pride does not extend beyond rather general expressions of good-will.  Today more than at any other time in our history, Ireland's physical heritage is in grave danger from the rapid technological progress being made in our farms and factories.  Such progress is of course essential to our economic well-being but progress achieved at the cost of the destruction of part of our physical heritage is of doubtful value to our net welfare as a people.  Our heritage does more than remind us of our past.  In this era of instant communication and increasing tendency towards a kind of universal or international culture our heritage is one of the strongest forces for preserving our own sense of identity as a separate nation and people.</P>
    <P>As time goes on, the task of preserving our identity through our heritage becomes more and more difficult.  Our culture is now exposed to changing values not only from outside but even from within our own society.  The Government have been concerned about these <Col N="528" /> changes in attitudes and have for some time been giving consideration to the best means of protecting, preserving and developing our heritage.  This Bill and the National Heritage Council which it proposed to establish are the evidence of the Government's concern for the solution of these problems.</P>
    <P>In this country we have built up a considerable amount of expertise in the fields of history, archaeology, architecture and in related disciplines associated with the restoration and preservation of our heritage. There are also many enthusiastic interest groups which are greatly concerned with the preservation of our past. This expertise and enthusiasm must be utilised to the utmost if the vital task of preserving the national heritage is to succeed. The best way of doing this is to bring this expertise and enthusiasm into a single body and to give the body concerned the powers and scope to carry out its tasks.  The proposed council will include people who are eminent in and concerned with various aspects of the national heritage.  The direction which these people will be able to bring to the new body will of necessity be better than the present arrangements under which heritage matters are inevitably the minority concern of large administrative organisations which were set up primarily to perform other functions.</P>
    <P>The main State involvement in the heritage area has up to this been carried out through Government Departments or offices.  When the concept of a council was first mooted the pros and cons of establishing it within the existing civil service framework were considered.  The conclusion was reached that a council of the type envisaged could not operate with full effectiveness within a Government Department.  If the staff of the council remained within the civil service there could possibly be some scope for conflict between Ministerial responsibility and the council's area of responsibility.  In addition, in a Government Department the heritage functions would inevitably be a small part of a large administrative machine.  It is essential that these functions be given a clear separate identity if they have not been sufficiently identified <Col N="529" /> as such in the public mind due to being adjuncts to larger Government services. This has, perhaps, led to these services not being granted sufficient priority by politicians and administrators alike.</P>
    <P>Up to this, the heritage functions which are to be transferred to the council have been scattered throughout the civil service.  In some cases this has resulted in a situation in which very closely related functions have been carried out in different Departments under different Ministers. For example, the work of the staff of the National Museum bears a close resemblance to that of the national monuments staff in the Office of Public Works.  Both groups are concerned with the preservation of our past and with archaeology and other related matters. The bringing together of related heritage functions in a single body will help to focus public interest and attention on heritage matters and should enable decisions to be taken in the context of the national heritage as a whole rather than on a piecemeal basis.</P>
    <P>The council will have both executive and advisory roles and will have the advantage of not being burdened with tasks which do not relate to our heritage. It is hoped that in this way the council will involve all sections of our society in the preservation and protection of our heritage.  The Government feel that such commitment might be more easily forthcoming if the council were seen to be separate from the Government's traditional administrative structures.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have outlined, it was decided to set up the council in the form of a non-commercial State-sponsored body.  Initially this new body will draw together functions which are at present carried out in various parts of the civil service &mdash; principally the National Parks and Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works and the National Museum. This is not to imply that the civil servants engaged on this work were doing a bad job.  In fact I would like here and now to pay tribute to the men and women of the National Parks and Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works and the National Museum.  They have performed excellent work over the years and will, I <Col N="530" /> hope, continue to do so in the years to come.  Indeed, the expertise and experience of these staff will be essential to the new council if it is to function successfully.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with the functions proposed for the council I would like to stress to the Members of this House that my mind is by no means closed on the contents of the Bill.  My principal objective is to establish the council as quickly as possible, to assign certain functions to it and to frame the Bill in such a way that the council can take on additional functions once it is established.  I think this is the right way to deal with a Bill like this.  It follows that any comments or suggestions for improvement of the Bill will be carefully and seriously considered.  The only <i>caveat</i> I would enter is that I would not favour proposals which would result in unduly delaying the establishment of the council.</P>
    <P>I would like now to outline in some detail the specific functions which are to be allocated to the council.  These functions will arise in connection with the following areas: the National Museum, national monuments, national parks, other parks owned by the State including the Phoenix Park and St. Stephen's Green, inland waterways including the Shannon Navigation, heritage buildings owned by the State, forest parks.</P>
    <P>The National Museum is one of the oldest of our public institutions having been established under an Act of 1877. The Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 assigned responsibility for the museum to the Minister for Education.  The Bill proposes that the National Heritage Council take over responsibility for the museum. In so far as the staff are concerned, there will initially be no visible change in the work of the museum.  However, the council as well as being responsible for day-to-day administration will also be responsible for formulating museum policy. It will, for instance, be in a position to make plans for the future development of the museum.  Because of the task they perform in preserving things of the past, museums inevitably possess a somewhat staid or musty image.  However, the importance of the National Museum and <Col N="531" /> other museums generally as cultural and educational institutions should not be underestimated.  It will be the task of the council to ensure that we have a museum service worthy of our rich past.  The Board of Visitors of the National Museum will continue to operate but will now report to the council.</P>
    <P>With regard to national monuments the council is to take over the functions at present exercised by the Commissioners of Public Works under the National Monuments Acts of 1930 and 1954.  This involves the protection and preservation of buildings and sites of national historical, architectural, artistic and archaeological significance.  The National Monuments Advisory Council is being dissolved and its role will be taken over by the National Heritage Council.  As well as assuming a formal role in respect of the protection of national monuments it is expected that the council will advise the State on archaeological matters.</P>
    <P>There is some evidence that the National Monuments Acts may no longer be adequate to meet the needs of today. To meet this situation legislation making further provision for the protection of national monuments and archaeological objects is in an advanced state of preparation. It is hoped that this legislation will, among other things, deal with such vexed questions as the use of detection devices and the protection of historical wrecks.  Before the Government bring their legislation proposals before the Oireachtas they will discuss them with the council and seek its advice.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a remarkably wide range of scenic beauty, inland waterways, lakes, parks and open spaces of great value for scientific, amenity and recreational purposes, interesting rock and mineral formations, a great variety of flora and fauna and some habitats of international importance.  In many other countries it is the practice to designate areas of great natural beauty or scientific importance as national parks.  This procedure distinguishes such areas from places of purely local significance and gives them greater status in the public mind.  As a result of international cooperation, <Col N="532" /> high standards have been set for the management of national parks around the world.  It gives me pleasure to say that Irish national parks are recognised as meeting these standards.  Up to this, however, our national parks have not been designated as such by statute. The National Heritage Bill proposes to designate four areas as national parks. These areas are in Killarney, Connemara, Glenveagh in Donegal and the Burren.  The council will be responsible for the care, management and development of the newly designated national parks.  In addition to those designated by the Bill the Minister for the Public Service will be given the power to designate further properties as national parks by order, on the recommendation of the council.  In addition to being important features of our national heritage the national parks will of course be major tourist attractions.  Some of the areas concerned such as Killarney and Connemara have been tourist attractions for many years but much remains to be done in the area of developing the tourist potential of other less well known but perhaps no less beautiful parts of the country.</P>
    <P>In addition to the national parks, the council will take over responsibility for other properties owned by the State such as Kilkenny Castle, Saint Enda's Rathfarnham and Garinish Island which do not really qualify as national parks but are otherwise of great recreational or historical significance.  These properties include Phoenix Park and St. Stephen's Green.  As Senators are no doubt aware, Phoenix Park contains a number of buildings which are used for State purposes such as Aras an Uachtaráin, the Ordnance Survey Office and the Department of Defence.  It was felt that it would not be appropriate to give the council any functions in respect of the care and maintenance of those buildings and the lands attaching to them.  The council will, however, have an advisory role in relation to any such buildings which are of historical importance and I will have more to say about this later in my speech.</P>
    <P>The council will be taking over responsibility for many areas which are used for recreational purposes.  Increasing urbanisation <Col N="533" /> has led to an increasing need for the development of lands for recreational purposes and the council will become involved in meeting this need.  I would also like to say that it is the intention that any existing recreational areas to be taken over by the council should continue to be used for those purposes and the council will not merely be involved in the preservation of properties for historical or scientific purposes only.</P>
    <P>The National Heritage Council will not take over responsibility for all our inland waterways.  Initially it will only have responsibility for the Shannon Navigation which is at present under the care of the Office of Public Works.  It will then have responsibility for the navigable part of the River Shannon and its tributaries above Limerick.  The River Shannon is the longest river in these islands.  It was developed at the beginning of the last century as a commercial navigation and since 1831 the Commissioners of Public Works have been responsible for its operation and management.  As competition grew from the railways and the roads, traffic on the navigation declined and, since the last war, commercial traffic has disappeared.  The Shannon is now much used for pleasure boating and the involvement of the council in this area will be of considerable importance for the tourism industry in the area.  It is also intended that the council will eventually take over responsibility for the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal.  These canals are at present the property of Córas Iompair Éireann.  The transfer of the canals and related properties from CIE involves many complex legal problems which will take some time to solve.  Accordingly it has not been possible to arrange for any functions in respect of those waterways to be assigned to the council under the Bill.  There is a provision in the Bill which will enable additional functions, including functions in respect of the canals, to be assigned to the council by order of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>I might say at this point that the ownership of the properties in respect of which the council will exercise functions will not be vested in the council in the first instance.  It was felt that the transfer <Col N="534" /> of ownership by means of legislation would make the present Bill unduly large and unwieldy and would certainly have delayed the establishment of the council. There is, however, provision in the Bill which will enable the council once it is established to acquire ownership of property.</P>
    <P>The State has in its possession many fine buildings which are of a heritage or historic character such as Leinster House, the Custom House, Dublin Castle and the Four Courts.  Such buildings are, of course, used for State purposes, the most common use being as office accommodation.  It was felt therefore that it would be inappropriate to give the council ownership of such buildings or even to give it a care and maintenance role.  Such a role would have involved the council in a large &ldquo;works&rdquo; exercise in maintaining office accommodation, which would have diverted it from its primary function.  At the same time it was felt that the council should have some role in protecting and preserving such buildings.  Accordingly the Bill proposes an advisory role in this area for the council.  Such advice can be given on the council's own initiative or, in a case where a State authority such as the Office of Public Works propose to demolish or fundamentally alter the character of a public heritage building, the council's advice must be sought and taken into account before any action is taken.</P>
    <P>The National Heritage Council is not being assigned a similar role in respect of privately owned heritage properties.  The main difficulties in this area are caused by the constitutional rights of private ownership.  Under the existing planning legislation local authorities have experienced considerable difficulty in ensuring the preservation of buildings which they consider worthy of such preservation. The National Heritage Council will, as the successor to the National Monuments Advisory Council, be entitled to receive information in respect of development plans and also in respect of planning applications affecting buildings or sites of archaeological or historical interest.  The position of the council as a watchdog in the context of planning legislation <Col N="535" /> will be looked at with a view to strengthening its role as regards privately owned heritage properties and it is almost certain that the council when it is established will have some views to express in respect of this question.  The council will also be empowered to co-operate with and assist persons including private owners of heritage properties.  The council will also be empowered to acquire heritage property subject to Government consent.  The extent to which the council will be able to engage in these tasks will of course depend on the economic and financial situation at the time.</P>
    <P>Much of the heritage property in this country is in private hands and I am sure the council will be able over time to develop its role in this area.  I for my part will do everything I can to assist the council in this endeavour.</P>
    <P>The council will have a general advisory role on heritage matters and will be in a position to advise the Minister for the Public Service or any other person on such matters.  It will have a specific role in advising the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry on the development of forest parks.  The council will operate as a non-commercial semi-State body and will be subject to all the usual freedoms and restrictions which apply to such bodies. The council will receive an annual grant out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas and will be free to appoint its own staff, subject to the usual control on numbers exercised by the Minister for the Public Service.  Each year the council will furnish a set of accounts and an annual report and these will be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I have given the House some detail of the council's functions and responsibilities. I felt that this was necessary in view of the broad range of those functions and responsibilities.  The Bill itself contains far more detail, discussion of which would, of course, be more appropriate for Committee Stage.  The question may well be asked why the council is not being given a broader range of functions and responsibilities at this stage.  The Government's immediate priority has been to establish a council and to give it a basic <Col N="536" /> framework of functions and responsibilities. It will be possible, however, to assign further functions to the council later by way of order.  Such orders will be the subject of resolutions in Dáil Éireann and so there will be an opportunity for debate on the new functions as they arise. There are many other measures which could possibly be taken to ensure the preservation of the national heritage.  I have already mentioned the possibility of new legislation in connection with national monuments, detection devices and other related matters.  The National Heritage Council will, of course, have an opportunity to make a significant contribution to the formulation of such measures.</P>
    <P>When he first announced the proposal to set up the council last year the Taoiseach said that it would ensure that our heritage would be explored, assessed and exhibited to the general public in a manner worthy of its splendour.  The Government do not see the establishment of the National Heritage Council as being an end in itself but rather as the beginning of a new era in the protection and development of our physical heritage.  They are strongly of the view that this Bill contains the measures necessary to get this under way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to introduce this Bill in the Seanad.  It is a non-controversial Bill which can be improved upon by all parties and by our contributions, provided there are no undue delays.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to welcome the Minister to the House and to offer him the best success in his office, however long or short the tenure of that office shall be.  I would like very much to extend a general welcome to this Bill and to indicate that, so far as we are concerned on this side of the House, we welcome very much the initiative of the Government in bringing this forward and in trying to deal with this very serious area.  We also welcome very much the decision of the Government to introduce it in the Seanad, where we will attempt to give it the treatment that it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="537" /> This is an area of very great importance, an area that has aroused great controversy in the past.  It seems to me and to all of us on this side of the House, that there is an opportunity here for a constructive approach and we certainly want to adopt a constructive approach and intend to do so.  There is a place in all parliamentary assemblies for various methods of obstruction tactics, like the utilisation of Standing Orders.  We certainly believe that, so far as this measure is concerned, this is not the place for that type of thing and that will not be our attitude.  However, this is an important area, an area which impinges upon the activities and interests of a great many voluntary bodies, organs and institutions of the State and of local government.  We consider it of great importance that this Bill be given the kind of discussion, the detailed, intelligent treatment that it deserves.</P>
    <P>Whereas we welcome the general spirit of the Bill, the general emphasis of the Bill, there are a number of points which deserve further discussion and debate and upon which we intend to produce some amendments.  Whilst we agree with what the Minister said about not delaying unduly the establishment of the council, it was brought before us with a certain amount of excessive expedition, in that it was published and placed in our hands only a very short while ago.  We had very little time to examine it and to give it the kind of treatment that the Government would expect us to give it.  Also, the various bodies that are concerned with this &mdash; technical, interested bodies, voluntary bodies and so forth &mdash; have not really had a great deal of time to examine it.  We feel, therefore, that there is a case for extending the debate, not excessively &mdash; we are as anxious as the Minister and the Government to make sure that this council is established quickly, so that it can get to grips with the problems that exist &mdash; and will be suggesting to the Government that Committee Stage should not be brought forward too quickly so that people may be given an opportunity to discuss the Bill intelligently.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem in approaching a <Col N="538" /> Bill of this kind is that, as presented, there was no explanatory memorandum. At first glance at any rate, in general terms it is not a particularly difficult Bill. But an explanatory memorandum might possibly have dealt with some of the issues which arise and might have helped us in that respect.  The Minister's very eloquent and enlightened speech has gone some way towards that, but he will appreciate that for us to give his speech proper treatment and consideration we can hardly be expected to react to it instantaneously.  Some of the points of explanation which he made require further studying.</P>
    <P>Despite what the Minister has said, it is not immediately clear what the overall purpose of this Bill is.  The Long Title says that it is to make provision for the national heritage and to provide for other matters connected.  But it does not specify exactly, for example, what the national heritage is.  Within the context of this Bill, for example, one might well ask where does the matter of the canoe that was discovered some time ago in Lake Derravarragh &mdash; and which, we understand, is to be flung back into the waters and the wild &mdash; come into the framework of this Bill?  If it is possible for the Minister in his present function, before the possible enactment of this Bill, to give us some indication of Government policy with regard to the concrete example, we would be very glad to hear, before the end of the debate, whether the Government have a policy with regard to that specific incident of the canoe discovered in Lake Derravarragh upon which it seems that public money was spent and yet this is to be cast away.  The canoe, though it might be regarded as a frivolous example, does in a very real way, outline the difficulties that exist not only in terms of legislation and regulations but in terms of the provision that we make as a community for that kind of episode.  It casts a certain light upon the situation with regard to the national heritage.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not really define very clearly what we mean by &ldquo;heritage&rdquo;.  It would be of assistance if during the course of this debate we came somewhat <Col N="539" /> closer towards a definition, a setting out in fairly precise terms, of what we mean and do not mean by &ldquo;national heritage&rdquo;. Obviously one could say that the national heritage consists of those things to which we are the heirs, those things which we inherit.  It is important to deal with this point with regard to the Bill because as we go through the Bill and examine it we are going to find points at which we have to take whatever our definition of &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; is and apply it to particular instances in the legislation and see whether the functions, purposes and role of the council as outlined in this Bill, in fact, fit in with this idea of a heritage.</P>
    <P>Heritage is generally considered to include things which are handed on to us by a previous generation and things which we decide should be handed on to us.  How are we to decide upon those things which we should not hand on? When we address ourselves to this, we are not just involved in a semantic exercise, philological, or even philosophical exercise.  We are concerned with specific instances, such as the Derravarragh canoe.  Is this something about which we should become immensely concerned, or is it something we have to take as part of the pattern of the contemporary situation? What about those things which we fail to hand on?  Is this something which we should have on our consciences?  Is this something we should make provision for?</P>
    <P>When we are dealing with, say, something like Kinsale gas, or Posts and Telegraphs, we are dealing with very easily defined matters which we can approach &mdash; we can use a term and it is fairly easy to understand what we are talking about. It is fairly easy to suggest or to assume certain good reasons for dealing with these things.  It is necessary, before we go much further in our consideration of this Bill and the council that we propose to set up, that we should at least momentarily during the debate seriously consider why we should be concerned with handing on anything.  In considering that, we consider the importance and the value which we attach to this type of thing. Should we be concerned with it, or <Col N="540" /> devote substantial public funds to this kind of exercise?</P>
    <P>This is not an academic suggestion. This is the kind of question that has come up again and again, when we have had incidents concerned with conservation, with the preservation of monuments, buildings and so forth.  People have asked should public funds be devoted to this matter, or what proportion of public funds?  What kind of value do we set upon these things?  Should we be more concerned with today and the things which come up today, rather than set aside valuable resources for something that may well be considered to be dead?  If I pick up correctly the kind of thinking in the Minister's speech, and presumably it reflects Government thinking here, we must be agreed that the tendency to think only of today is not universal.  It is not the way human beings behave.  Human beings are concerned, it is part of our approach to life, we are concerned with tomorrow and with yesterday.  We place today between those two and today is to be seen in the light of tomorrow.  The reason for this is that in human history, in all living beings, but particularly among human beings because we think about this and talk about this &mdash; sometimes at interminable length &mdash; there is a very deep need to survive, to live on and to live beyond.  This in a very great sense is a matter of self-preservation.  I am thinking not so much of egocentric or selfish self-preservation, but of the preservation of what we are.</P>
    <P>The Minister, being a member of the party to which he belongs and taking into account the aspirations of that party, will appreciate that the preservation of national culture, of our identity, is something which is important and something which is not irrelevant to ordinary practical politics.  In talking of self-preservation, we refer to our desire, in our actions and in the decisions we make, to look forward to the future, to look forward to the welfare of our children and the kind of life that our children are to enjoy.  We believe in setting aside things of value which would be of use to them and which would be part of their lives.  We believe in holding on to things that are of value.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> Value is very central to our discussion on the functions of this council.  The whole business of evaluating, accepting, deciding what is of value and what is not, of deciding what is of greater value and of lesser value are matters we are going to have to discuss fairly deeply during the course of this debate.  When we talk of things that we value, we are talking of those things that we believe in looking after, caring for, cherishing.  Cherish is a good word, a good concept to have here. When we talk about cherishing we talk about something that we respect and our attitude is that the decisions we make are aimed at, or directed towards the care of that particular object.</P>
    <P>I would like, if permitted, to go a little into semantics.  When we talk about heritage and what we want to preserve in our culture, we should consider the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo;.  We should not be too ready to divorce that word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; from a similar word &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo;.  What have &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; and &ldquo;culture&rdquo; in common, semantically and philosophically?  They have in common, basically, a word of Roman origin which is concerned with caring for something, with looking after, with management.  The words culture, agriculture and cult all derive from the same root.  Cult is often in common parlance nowadays used to refer to very esoterical, bizarre practices of a pseudo-religious nature, or something like that.  That is not the way it is used, for example, in ecclesiastical documents or liturgical documents. It refers to a way of approaching things which shows our veneration of them.</P>
    <P>Worship may not be the appropriate word here, but we are talking of respecting, defending, venerating, celebrating in some cases, commemorating.  Section 4 (1) mentions the words preserve, protect, enhance and develop.  In other words, we are talking about ensuring the survival of something as it is, or as we wish it to be. When we talk about survival we are talking about something that is alive and not dead.  I am glad that the Minister, in the course of his speech, made reference to the fact that museums are often seen as places that are musty and dead and indicated that in his view they should not be <Col N="542" /> seen in that way.</P>
    <P>Why should we concern ourselves with these things, given the economic and financial situation, given the kind of problems that exist in the world?  When I quoted those words from section 4, it may have been noticed that I omitted one of the words.  I omitted it deliberately because I wish to refer to it now, and that is the word &ldquo;identify&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;identify&rdquo; is used elsewhere in the Bill to mean to separate something out, to lift it, to take a number of items and put them into categories &mdash; to itemise them, if you like.</P>
    <P>The word and the concept of identity are central to our entire discussion here and to many things to which the Minister referred.  It is central to much of the discussion that we have and the whole question of national culture and of our distinct existence as a nation.  Again, we ask ourselves, why bother with national culture or national heritage?  Why not regard it as something to be regarded as a gimmick, or some particular attraction, as you might have a star turn or a freak turn in a circus, something to be attached to tourism, something we trot them in to see, for which we take money from them and forget about out of the tourist season.</P>
    <P>Our heritage is the point from which we start.  It is the interaction of what is going on at the present time, the interaction of our own personalities, the interaction of our own circumstances; it is what makes us what we are.  We are what we are.  We are here and we have our assembly here in this building because we think, for some reason, or some people before us thought, that we had an identity which could only be reflected adequately by our having, for example, a separate, distinct identifiable, national parliament. Identity, in the world in which we live today, is not an abstract or an abstruse concept, maybe from philosophy, or from the more irrelevant areas of psychology. It is something that is fundamental to our way of life, that is very important to our psychological social and economic health.</P>
    <P>Our identity, so far as we are concerned as individuals &mdash; and the same applies to us as a nation or as a community &mdash; is very evident at certain times of <Col N="543" /> the year.  It will be very evident during the course of the latter part of the summer and early part of the autumn in various parts of the country when people on Sunday afternoons will gather in various places for strange rituals associated with leather and wood.  Our identity is reflected in the names we use.  The names by which we are to be identified reflect the circumstances of birth, of upbringing, the locality from which we come, the location where we happen to be, where we operate, where we live.  It is associated with memories of childhood.</P>
    <P>Memories of childhood are very important to people, particularly in a family.  If I may be permitted to use the example of my own children in this respect, one of the things that they like most to do is to sit around and talk about the things that happened to them when they were younger.  This is something that bonds them together, that reminds them of whom they are, and what they are.  It reminds them that they belong to each other, that they are a part of the community.  It gives them a certain security, because by knowing that they belong to a group and that they belong to something that is real and strong, it secures them in the knowledge that they have a future.  Part of the problems that we find in the social environment at the moment, that we hear of in terms, in particular, of the urban environment but also the rural environment, is the rootlessness that many people feel, the sense of not belonging to an identifiable community, of not belonging to something that is distinct, of alienation from the society around us, and from other people, other classes, other aspects, other factors in that society.</P>
    <P>It is interesting here, too, to remember that when we are talking and thinking about the word &ldquo;tradition&rdquo; which literally in its roots is a handing-over, the same root gives us the word &ldquo;treachery&rdquo;, the word &ldquo;traitor&rdquo;, the concept of handing things away, handing them over, to other people who may not be our friends, who may, in fact, be alien to us, enemies, people whom we do not understand and to whom we do not wish to belong.  There <Col N="544" /> are, in that, various associations of capitulation and surrender.</P>
    <P>Again, why should we bother with national heritage?  Should we not be concerned more with pracatical matters, particularly in a harsh world that is making it very difficult for us to survive economically? There are massive unresolved global problems &mdash; poverty, hunger, fear, greed, war, the abuse and misuse, or neglect or exploitation of the natural resources of this globe.  We live in a world dominated by super powers or by forces which have the effect of super powers. We live in a world in which much of what we grew up with is threatened by new technology and economic and commercial changes.</P>
    <P>It is precisely because of the threats that exist in this greater world that we must consider, if we are to survive as an identifiable entity, what it is that bewitches us.  We must consider what it is that distinguishes us and consider why and to what extent we should be prepared to go to maintain our identity and whether indeed we should be loyal to the concept of a national identity, something separate, not just to some abstraction of an identity but loyal to each other and to our traditions.</P>
    <P>What are our traditions?  We must identify them and we must recognise what is our common heritage.  We must mark it out and cherish it.  We must hold on to it as a symbol, not of a network of something dead but as a symbol of life and survival, of the continuance of the possibility if not the certainty of the future that is ours.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that I must refer to the episode of Wood Quay.  There may well be people here who feel that Wood Quay is dead that it is an issue that is gone and settled; and if they do, it may well be significant.  An acid test of the effectiveness of what we propose to set up in this Bill will be to consider whether what is proposed in this Bill would have made a difference so far as Wood Quay is concerned.  We may well feel that there should not have been a difference, that a lot of time was misspent on that episode. Many honourable and well-intentioned people may hold that view but <Col N="545" /> Wood Quay for many people in this city and throughout the country was an event of some significance because it crystallised a number of these issues.  It was not just an issue of archaelogy but much wider issues as well.</P>
    <P>Wood Quay was uniquely ours.  There are other Viking sites; there are the Norman sites; there are sites possibly more substantial, that have more exciting and glamorous contents, that may have had more lasting effect upon our knowledge of those times.  But Wood Quay was something that was uniquely ours.  It was in the centre of our city, not just physically but psychologically and symbolically; not just the city of &ldquo;the Dubs&rdquo;, of the natives and adoptive natives, but the capital city.</P>
    <P>What was in Wood Quay was not the property of kings, aristocrats or nobles but of very ordinary people who were our predecessors, our forefathers and foremothers. Should we be really concerned then about bits of leather, of stone, pottery, wood and metal?  They were our people who put them there.  They are our memories, our roots.  There were people who wanted to sweep these away, to dump them in the Irish Sea, and to place on that site symbols which were not distinctively ours.  They are not things that we could identify specifically as our property and as part of our identity, but buildings identical in many cases with a thousand other buildings in a hundred other cities all over the world.</P>
    <P>It may well be thought that some of the sentiments expressed here are possibly chauvinistic and jingoistic, a word that has come recently into favour in other parts of the world.  We would be far from that.  But to take away what was ours and to put in its place what was not ours is another matter.</P>
    <P>Should we become involved, in public time and money, with bits of sticks and stones, sometimes very dirty, and hundreds of bones that can be found in any part of the country, if we look for them or bother to look for them?  It was not for their own sake; they had no intrinsic value in themselves &mdash; that is not where the value was set.  They are valuable because they are associated with <Col N="546" /> human beings, not any human beings, but our people.  We must remember what James Connolly said.  These things are not valuable in themselves.  This island is not valuable in itself.  James Connolly said that Ireland was nothing to him without its people, that the sticks and stones with the vegetation and bog which make up this island are nothing without our people.  That soil has been sanctified and consecrated for us and given value for us by the blood and sweat of our ancestors over countless generations: they have made it ours not just for this generation but ours as trustees for the generations yet to come, who, too, will be our people. It is important to use the word &ldquo;ours&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When we are approaching this question of the National Heritage Council and what its functions will be and the kind of things with which it will be concerned, it is important that we know precisely what it is when we use the word &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;we&rdquo;. I was a little alarmed at the beginning of the Minister's speech when for a moment it seemed that there was nothing in our national heritage later than Clonmacnoise. I do not think that it was his intention or that that was the overall effect of his speech, but a great deal of the controversy that has arisen in this area arises out of the fact that we are not clear in our minds about what we mean by &ldquo;we&rdquo;.  We still find people thinking in terms of &ldquo;the pure Irish&rdquo;, which would exclude Pearse and Éamon de Valera.  I often think, as somebody who has had occasion to attempt to acquaint younger people with the history of our country, in terms of our ancestors as people who had to get off a boat at some stage.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about this kind of thing we tend to think that it is some kind of final definition of &ldquo;Irish&rdquo;, that there was some race back there which was always Irish, which always belonged to this country.  Nobody has yet shown that human life originated in this island.  All our ancestors at some stage had to get off a boat: all of us at some stage had to come to this island.  There is no race that has an exclusive right or title to the land apart from the Irish, and &ldquo;the Irish&rdquo; has a very wide definition.  If we are talking about the Irish as being indivisible, whatever <Col N="547" />&ldquo;the Irish&rdquo; are, and it is difficult to define them at times, our heritage is indivisible.</P>
    <P>There is a certain tendency in this Bill towards the drawing of limits.  Section 4 refers to &ldquo;that part of the national heritage to which the functions conferred on the Council by or under the provisions of this Act relate&rdquo;.  Obviously one has to be practical in this: one cannot at first glance include everything in the provisions of this Bill.  If we are to approach this in any constructive way, if we are genuinely to make provision for the national heritage as a whole, and there may be parts of it that do not necessarily come within the compass or scope of this Act and should not do so, it is time that we began to think of the national heritage as a whole, that we saw it in global perspective, and what we might well do is to think in terms not just of a national heritage but of a concept of a national archive.  When I refer to a national archive we are back again to the Minister's reference to museums, musty, dead buildings where things are preserved in a dead state, where butterflies are dipped in spirits or whatever the appropriate thing is, and pins are stuck into them and they are stuck in a drawer and forgotten.</P>
    <P>The concept of the national archive is much broader than that, it is &ldquo;archive&rdquo; in the sense of all those things which we believe should be preserved or conserved, not just buildings.  One of the problems that arises in regard to this Bill is that, for example, it refers to the National Museum, but not to the National Library or the National Gallery. There may well be good reasons for this, maybe practical administrative reasons; maybe there is a reason in principle why this should be so.  I should like to hear the Minister at some stage in the course of this debate give a more elaborate explanation of why the National Gallery and the National Library are not being included in the compass of this Bill.  If we are to consider a site of importance we would find as matters stand that some references to it or some of the remains associated with it would be found in the National Museum at the moment, artefacts <Col N="548" /> probably, but if we were to look for documentary evidence or descriptions, we would find them in the National Library.  We could find some of those in the Public Record Office.  We would find some of them in the National Gallery. We would find possibly on the site itself that there would be references to this in all traditions, in musical tradition, and whereas from a practical administrative point of view we must be precise, we cannot leave ourselves in a woolly kind of condition in which we would talk of all this and refuse to address ourselves to the problem dealing with it in a practical way.</P>
    <P>It is important in this debate that we clarify why we are putting some things in one department or compartment and others elsewhere.  In this context it should be said that there is a strong argument for having all those areas which are to be covered by such bodies as the National Heritage Council and the Arts Council within one area of Government.  We on this side of the House would incline towards the view that the Department of the Taoiseach might be best for that purpose. I assure the Minister that I am not in any way casting aspersions on him or his ability to cope with these things or to bring to them a great interest and care in all those qualities of cherishing and so forth that I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>There are many arguments which would suggest that the Department of the Public Service are possibly not the best Department, leaving aside the present incumbent who is eminently suited for that post.  It is not, possibly, the best Department for this purpose because I think the Minister would agree that the main scope of the Department of the Public Service has to do with the organisation of the public service, questions of pay, conditions, pensions and the like.  It might well be that by placing this heritage council under the aegis of the Department of the Public Service it would fall into exactly that category to which the Minister referred at one stage when he suggested that in the past some of the functions which are considered in this Bill, by being attached to very much larger organisations which were not concerned directly with this type of thing, <Col N="549" /> though not neglected, received a lesser priority than they might have received.</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister and the Government to consider seriously whether they might not have this national council under the Taoiseach's Department.  Our policy on this side would be inclined towards the idea of a sub-Department or a separate Department of Arts and Culture. That is not something that we need to get involved with at any length now, but we suggest to the Minister and the Government to consider whether they would be prepared possibly to accept an amendment to that purpose.</P>
    <P>When talking about the council and considering this type of body, and the precedents for this type of body, we in this House might all agree that its composition will be very important.  The Minister has referred to the eminent people who will be part of the council.  There is a strong case for ensuring that provision is made for a certain number of the members of this council to be appointed on the nomination of specific named bodies or institutions which I will not mention now.  One example is the Royal Irish Academy.  There should be provision for certain reserved places on the council for bodies of this kind.  It would help to promote the prestige and status of the body and help to ensure that it reflected opinions among the learned and technical bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the provision concerning how members of the council will be appointed.  They are rather loose.  For example, section 4 of the first Schedule states that a member of the council should hold office for such term not exceeding four years and subject to such terms and conditions as the Government may determine when appointing him. This should be clarified.  There is a suggestion there that it would be possible for the Government to have an individual set of conditions for each member.</P>
    <P>Also, I am not happy that the council may be hired and fired at the will of the Government.  We agree they should be appointed by the Government rather than by the Minister, and I am not casting aspersions on the Minister or future Ministers. The fact that these appointments <Col N="550" /> will be made by the Government adds to the council's status and prestige, but there have been cases, such as the RTE Authority and Cospóir, when members of bodies of this nature have found themselves abruptly no longer members.  This body should be an effective body and should make an effective contribution to the whole area involved.  It should not be a collection of nice nonentities who will never make decisions or produce any controversial advice which would cause differences of opinion.  The Government should indicate some means by which the members of this council may be offered security of tenure, at least for a number of years, and that they do not have the threat of dismissal hanging over them if they say something unpopular somewhere.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendments which we intend to table, we would ask the Minister to take Committee Stage at a time which will allow all of us, including the Government and the various interested bodies, to consider these questions in depth.  The appropriate time might well be the first day after the recess rather than an earlier date.  We intend to publish our amendments as soon as possible so that the Minister and the Government and the other interested bodies may consider them.  They may be able to show us that these amendments are ill-advised or do not contribute anything constructive. They may suggest that they do not deal effectively with the problems we are attempting to address.  This Bill requires serious consideration and we intend to help the Government in doing this.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the effectiveness of existing legislation for the protection of national monuments, particularly with regard to such vexed questions as the use of detection devices and the protection of historical wrecks.  The Fine Gael Party in the other House put forward two Bills in this respect, one in 1978 and one in 1980, in which we proposed to update legislation in this area in order to ensure the protection of items of the national heritage.  The Minister intends to consult with the council on this matter.  That presupposes a time scale which may not be satisfactory.  We are anxious that this <Col N="551" /> council should become effective as soon as is practicable so that they can consider these problems.  Irreparable damage is being done in this area.  We are talking about areas of the national heritage which cannot be replaced and it is important that we bring legislation up to date on this so that it can be effective.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we will propose amendments which will incorporate most of what we had proposed in those two Bills.  We hope the Minister and the Government will look kindly upon them and accept them as a constructive attempt to provide protection for the national heritage where it does not exist at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to a number of other parts of the Bill which are causing us a certain amount of concern.  For example, in section 4 (2) there is a list of functions which it is proposed should come immediately under the scope of the National Heritage Council.  We presume &mdash; and we would like an assurance from the Minister &mdash; that this is not an exhaustive list.  As we look at the Bill as it is, and as we consider the practicalities of politics and administration, there is a certain danger that, with the best of intentions, promises can be made with regard to future actions and future functions to be added, and so on.  Given the pressure of the work involved and the problems of staffing, in the normal course of events, a genuine promise having been made, these things are placed on the long finger and it takes a great deal of time and energy to bring them back onto a shorter finger.  On that section we would like an assurance from the Minister and the Government that this list of functions is not an exhaustive list and that other functions will be added.  We would like the Minister to indicate, possibly in greater detail, the type of things he feels he should add to the list of functions.</P>
    <P>In section 4 (3) there is reference to &ldquo;care, management, control, maintenance, improvement and development of the properties...&rdquo;.  As an example, we can take the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park in Killarney.  Included in that park <Col N="552" /> is part of the Lakes of Killarney.  Anybody who has connections with that part of the world and is familiar with it will know that, for many years, those lakes have been very severely polluted.  I should like to know whether the National Heritage Council will have a function with regard to that type of problem.  It is a problem which occurs elsewhere.  I mention this park as an example.  There is a severe pollution problem with the Lakes of Killarney.  Is there a means by which the National Heritage Council can address themselves to that problem?  In section 5 there is reference to additional functions.  Again, one would like to ask the Minister to indicate, without necessarily committing himself in a binding fashion, the kind of additional functions he has in mind.</P>
    <P>We are quite concerned about section 7.  We are very worried about certain aspects of that section.  For example, there is a reference to heritage buildings. Heritage buildings are vested in a State authority.  Is there a particular reason why they should not be local government authorities?  That is something to which we will be addressing ourselves.  In subsection (2) (a), we see the word &ldquo;fundamentally&rdquo;. That word &ldquo;fundamentally&rdquo; is of very considerable importance when it comes to the question of how the National Heritage Council may impinge, or may comment, or may have an effect upon incidents such as the Wood Quay incident.  It has been suggested, for example, that to speak in terms of altering &ldquo;fundamentally&rdquo; is not sufficient.  You can do a great deal to a building or to some other item of the national heritage without altering it fundamentally.  We would think that the word &ldquo;significantly&rdquo; would be more appropriate there.</P>
    <P>In subsection (2) (b) there is the phrase &ldquo;taken into account&rdquo;.  It reads:</P>
    <P>A State authority shall not proceed to carry out a proposal to which this subsection relates without having received and taken into account the advice of the Council in relation thereto.</P>
    <P>What does &ldquo;taken into account&rdquo; mean? Does it mean that the authority concerned <Col N="553" /> read the advice given by the council, note it and then get on with what they meant to do anyway?  We feel that there should be something very much stronger in the paragraph than &ldquo;taken into account&rdquo;.  In this context we would like to have it spelled out in this Bill that this National Heritage Council will be a statutory body within the whole framework of planning.  There is a reference to this in the Minister's speech but it is not in the Bill.  A number of people who have had a brief look at this Bill noticed this and pointed out to me that this is not spelled out in the Bill.  If the council are to play an effective part in the whole planning process and if they are to deal effectively with the management of the national heritage and the whole physical infrastructure, this should be spelled out clearly.</P>
    <P>In section 7 (3) there is a fairly comprehensive list of various kinds of categories of history.  I am worried about the fact that is does not specifically refer to what might be called, for want of a better word, topographical history, that is to say, the lay-out of the physical context, not just in terms of townscapes, buildings, and so on, but in a much broader way.  A reference might be made here to what is known in architectural circles as the vernacular aspect of architecture. There are certain buildings in towns and villages which almost all of us here had an opportunity to visit twice in recent months and which we hope we will not have to visit too soon again.  If we looked at them we would find that certain buildings have some military or political significance. They may not fit into the categories listed here but, nevertheless, as a whole and as an entity, they represent part of our heritage.  They should be included in the national archives, and we would like to see that teased out a little more.</P>
    <P>In section 7 (4) there is a reference to a list of the heritage buildings vested in State authorities.  Many local authorities have buildings which should be included in any list of heritage buildings.  The Minister addressed himself in his speech to the whole problem of buildings in private ownership and private occupation.  He <Col N="554" /> also referred to the constitutional problems, and so forth.  They are legitimate problems, but we would like a guarantee and we would like a little bit more teasing out from the Minister to indicate that this is not an escape clause, that he is not using, unintentionally perhaps, the real constitutional problem with regard to private property as a means of evading the necessity for this council to address themselves to the problem of heritage buildings in private ownership.</P>
    <P>In section 8 (2) there is reference to the &ldquo;spirit and purposes of this Act...&rdquo;&ldquo;Spirit and purposes&rdquo; is a useful phrase for employment on occasions when you do not want to be too specific or you do not want to commit yourself.  We would like to see that teased out in more detail.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>The Council may, on its own initiative, and shall, whenever so requested by the Minister, advise the Minister in relation to matters relating to Council's functions or otherwise relating to that part of the national heritage to which the functions conferred on the Council by or under this Act relates.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; can be regarded as fairly definite in the sense that it would seem to indicate that there is an obligation upon the council to advise the Minister. Again this is something that should be spelled out in greater detail so that the responsibilities of the council and the Minister in this respect can be clarified.</P>
    <P>We approve very much of the suggestion in subsection (3) that the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and the council should consult together and have a fruitful relationship.  This again raises a question connected with what was said earlier about the Lakes of Killarney.  In the context of the national heritage there is the whole question of the degradation of the environment, in the case of the Lakes of Killarney a fairly obvious kind of pollution arising from the fact that the town of Killarney is situated near the lakes.  A problem which has occurred in many countries is the damage done to buildings by airborne pollution, by the presence in the atmosphere &mdash; in rain in particular &mdash; of toxic and corrosive substances.  This has become a very real and serious problem <Col N="555" /> in some mainland European countries. We would like to have it clarified by the Minister that the National Heritage Council will have an effective function in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (4) provides:</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of this section does not apply in relation to the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, Phoenix Park, Saint Stpehen's Green or the River Shannon or its tributaries.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister could explain why that is so.  We are a little worried about the possibility of fragmentation of functions, fragmentation of the role and scope of this heritage, fragmentation of the whole area of who is responsible for the national heritage in various spheres.</P>
    <P>On subsection (5), whereas we would not like to give the officers or servants of the council unlimited draconian powers, at the same time this strikes us as a rather weak position.  I do not wish to go into great detail about it now, but if one were to consider this subsection in a practical term what it says, in effect, is that an officer or servant of the council may act and do certain things, if he or she sees somebody doing something wrong within the areas under his or her responsibility. We are worried that the use of the word &ldquo;sees&rdquo; might well produce a situation where, if the officer or servant did not actually see the person carry out the act involved, it would be possible in a court of law to plead that no penalty should follow.  We would like to see that strengthened.  It might well be that that could be solved by substituting in line 3 of that subsection the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  In other words, if he sees a person doing or admitting to doing something, of if he has reasonable grounds for believing such doing or admission, he may do the other things referred to there.</P>
    <P>On section 16 (2), when we consider the question of a report, the question of the interaction of this council with the Oireachtas, with the Government, and so forth, it underlines the importance of having a general plan for the environment, so that the actions of the National <Col N="556" /> Heritage Council fit in with an overall plan and provision.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall cause a copy of a report submitted to him under subsection (1) (a) of this section to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Coincidentally we had a reference earlier to a committee on statutory instruments. We all know that in practice a reference to a copy of a report of this kind would be included on the Order Paper.  As far as most of us are concerned, that is the first we will see of it and the last we will see of it.  We will not actually see the publication.  It is not a proper publication as such.  If the National Heritage Council are to carry out their responsibilities for the environment and our heritage, what they have to say must be published clearly and must be available to people so that it can be discussed.</P>
    <P>On section 23, we were a little surprised to find no reference to the Department of the Environment.  Possibly the Minister could outline the reason for that.  With regard to section 22, on the question of the engagement of consultants or advisers the council may consider necessary for the performance of their functions, it is only fair to say that there is a certain amount of unease among the associations and representative bodies of the technical staffs of the existing institutions and Departments on the whole question of the appointment of consultants and advisers.  Again we need to get our minds clear on this so that we do not have on the one hand a situation in which nobody from outside may be appointed, and on the other hand a situation in which consultants and advisers are appointed to the detriment of existing staff.</P>
    <P>Something I should like to see brought out in greater detail is the whole question of the rights of those people who are to be transferred from the civil service to this new body when set up.  There is a reference in the First Schedule to terms and conditions.  Section 11 (1) provides that &ldquo;the Council shall hold such and so many meetings as may be deemed necessary for the due fulfilment of its functions&rdquo;. There is a feeling here that we might well include in the Bill a minimum <Col N="557" /> number of meetings.  The Water Pollution Council and the Toxic Substances Council were set up some considerable time ago.  In the case of one of these bodies, the one set up in 1979, they have had only three meetings so far.  One was the inaugural meeting.  The National Heritage Council have immense potential. We welcome the Government's initiative. There is the danger that we could start off with a great flush of enthusiasm, excitement, bands playing, flags flying, and so on, but when it comes down to the actual practicalities we will end up with something of a whimper, and a whimper that is not very audible.  Possibly by including the necessity to have a minimum number of meetings we could ensure that the council do not become an accumulation of people holding sinecures.</P>
    <P>As I approach the final stage of my speech I should like to mention briefly a certain number of aspects which have to be teased out.  There is the whole question of finance.  What sort of scale of finance are we thinking of in terms of this National Heritage Council?  We would be under a grave illusion if we thought this council would be effective given, for example, a typewriter and an occasional secretary and left to function with those kinds of resources and facilities.  If they are to be an effective council they will need finance.  This is why we believe &mdash; calling a spade a spade &mdash; this council should be under the care and protection of a substantial Department.  I do not wish to be offensive to the Department of the Public Service but, in the realities of politics, they are not at the top of the pecking order.  We would like to see this body having available to them the kind of prestige and financial resources which would be made available if they were under the care of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>We have to be realistic about the amount of finance involved.  This is linked closely with the whole question of the technical back-up facilities which will be available.  As matters stand, for example, with regard to the Office of Public Works, if those people who are involved in the care of national monuments want a photograph to be taken, they have photographic <Col N="558" /> facilities available within their own Department.  If the National Heritage Council are to be set up as a separate body, they will require their own photographic facilities.  They will require this kind of technical back-up.  I should like the Minister to go into greater detail on how this is to be provided.  We must have the necessary finance to ensure that the council will not be starved of resources and will have the facilities and the power to set up this kind of technical back-up.</P>
    <P>I feel very privileged and humble to have the honour to speak on this Bill.  It is concerned with an area of vital importance &mdash; and I chose the word &ldquo;vital&rdquo; advisedly &mdash; to our community and to our nation.  I spent a certain amount of time earlier in my meagre contribution referring to the importance of national identity and cultural identity.  It seems to me, particularly if one looks at the recent history of some of our neighbouring countries, that the impact upon all aspects of their life, all aspects of their behaviour as communities, of their sense of national identity, their sense of national pride, their respect for themselves, their ability to identify themselves as distinct entities is very important.  We have difficult times ahead of us and, within those difficult times, we will need the help of every factor which accentuates, emphasises, enhances and cherishes patriotism.  There is a profound difference between patriotism and crude nationalism.  Patriotism is concerned with the consciousness that our country, our community, the place in which we live, are associated with our fathers and mothers and our ancestors generally.</P>
    <P>I am tempted in this context to note in passing that there is a certain piquancy and poignancy, if you like, for me in addressing myself to this Bill when I happen casually to turn my eye to the Second Schedule, Part II and the item referred to under Reference No. 1. which concerns a family which in the past did some small service for the State.  This is what it is about.  If we are to survive and come through our present troubles, we must refresh our memories, our consciousness, and our awareness of what it is that makes us what we are.  I welcome this measure. <Col N="559" /> I welcome the initiative of the Government and the Minister in bringing it forward. Our attitude will be one of constructive discussion and criticism and we will propose amendments which will be chosen well in advance so that they can be discussed without party points, without partisanship, so that all of us in this House, the Government and Parliament generally can make the best contribution towards the preservation, conservation and continued survival in living form of our national heritage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMallon" hpid="Mr. Mallon Mr. Mallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of making a brief contribution on this Stage of the Bill because it has far-reaching implications, not just in terms of what is written in the Bill but in terms of its potential.  I would centre my remarks on the very first words of this Bill which is entitled &ldquo;An Act to make provision with respect to the national heritage...&rdquo;. My central concern is that it would be in reference to the national heritage and not to a heritage which stops somewhere 60 miles north of Dublin and runs in a rather irregular line right across to Sligo.  If it does not extend itself beyond that, no matter how successful this Bill will be in relation to the Twenty-six Counties of Ireland, it will be a failure because it will not have fulfilled its own terms of reference and that is creating that which will foster and encourage an understanding of our truly national heritage within the whole of this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, putting it in that context one can only question how it could ever be successful if the land of Séamus Heaney, of John Huet, of Brian Friel, of Sam Thompson, to name but a few of our present day modern writers who have explored the whole interaction of our tradition on our present lives, were to be excluded from it?  That is the central point that I would like to make to the Minister in relation to this.  I would like to make it in relation to a positive suggestion that I would like to put to him.  We have seen in recent years how Tyrone Guthrie's house, which indeed straddled that irregular line that I mentioned, has been <Col N="560" /> developed into an oasis of interchange of ideas, of peace, of solitude and work for the writing and artistic communities within Ireland.  Could we translate that, in relation to section 5 of this Bill, into the creation somewhere &mdash; perhaps somewhere in the region where Cúchulainn had to leash himself to a stake so that he could die on his feet in the Cooley Peninsula, &mdash; steeped in the traditions of not just one part of this island but of both, of an establishment or a centre &mdash; I would not like to call it a museum &mdash; where the cultural convergence could take place, where the interaction between the traditions within this island could be understood and developed, where one could maybe use that which exists in terms of the Guthrie establishment, in terms of, as Paddy Kavanagh called it, looking out on the cold hills of Armagh and thus centre all factors in our heritage, bring them together and allow them to develop in such a way that we are not going to see something that is merely passive.  Indeed if I have any criticisms of this Bill it is that it seems to be rather passive; the emphasis seems to be on preserving rather than on creating that which is organic, that which is living, that which is part of our present life and culture and indeed our future thinking.  I think it was Cicero who once said that not to be aware of one's past is to remain forever a child.  We have a lot of children in this island, north and south, and the type of practical centre that I am suggesting to the Minister would help to take us through adolescence into adulthood perhaps more quickly than we think.  I would emphasise that I am making this as a positive concrete suggestion, not just in relation to one section of the heritage which the Minister refers to as our physical heritage because if we find that this Bill is confined simply to that then it will not become the type of living, organic thing that we require within our society.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell referred to the global perspective that is required to make this Bill a success.  I agree with him. I agree that that should be developed as well.  Can we, as members of this nation talking about a national heritage, ignore <Col N="561" /> the other members of this nation who because of accidents of history and many other accidents do not live in this country at this time?  I think especially of the 45 million people who are living on the Continent of North America and who indeed would very much value this type of positive construction that I am speaking about.  Indeed, when reference was made to finance it struck me that there may be an ideal way that the interests of Irish-American people can be channelled in a very positive way into something that is totally creative and totally organic and not just a museum piece, however old or however worth seeing.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer also to the British connection.  There are many Irish people living in that country as well.  There is a tremendous depth of historical perspective within the European dimension as well.  If we could weld all that together within a centre which straddled the Border we would be laying the basis for something which could have a tremendous effect on the life of this nation in years to come.  I refer to that especially in relation to the diversity of traditions that do exist.  We cannot ignore those. Senator O'Connell was right to say that we are not all of the same stock.  It is very obvious that if we are to create a national heritage we will have to recognise this diversity.</P>
    <P>We will have to recognise that within that heritage there are different strands. It is our challenge to bring those strands together in a positive way where the living reminder of the past will possibly help us to cope with the misunderstandings of the present and where that understanding and concrete approach to the present will help to channel all strands of that diverse heritage into a new vision of the future, a vision indeed which can have its roots in that very important heritage which has been referred to earlier by Senator O'Connell and indeed on which the Bill is centred.</P>
    <P>I would ask also that we do not take a defeatist approach to this.  It will immediately be said that we cannot do that if we do not have co-operation from the administration which rules the North.  Is <Col N="562" /> there not a good case in this instance where, if this idea is not supported by local authorities or by the central authority in the North, the Government of the Republic of Ireland should go ahead unilaterally and create this?  It would seem to me that by doing that it would be an act of faith in the past and a much more active act of faith in a future which we are all going to share within this island, I hope, in a unified state as soon as possible. But that is something concrete that can be done.  It is something which could have tremendous spin-off effects educationally, socially and, indeed, politically.</P>
    <P>In thinking about this, I would ask that we do not be selective because if we are going to be selective in our approach to this then what we are doing is applying that to history and tradition which one simply cannot do.  I would like to see a good look being taken at the religious dimensions within this island and, indeed, not just the religious dimensions but the part they have played within our history.  I would like to concentrate within this centre, upon the political role that has been played within this island by the non-conformist religious groups which were, in past decades and past centuries, part of the dynamics of life within this island.  Indeed, not just within this island because, having had to leave this island as a result of discrimination against them, they went and formed the other states where a number of Irish people are living, the United States of America.</P>
    <P>I would like to centre on that tradition. I would like to centre on the vocational aspects contained within it.  Any person who has visited Mellon Park, the folk park outside Omagh, or Cúltra, can see the enormous potential for creating something which will remind all of us of our past and help us to live with the future, not just the vocational future but the social and educational futures too.  It is a matter of fact that within the museums of Cúltra and Mellon Park there is enormous spin-off in educational terms.  An enormous number of children from all parts of this island visit them. There is something concrete there; it is a living thing.  It is not something just to <Col N="563" /> look at: it is growing every day, it is growing every year.  It is that type of focal point that I would like to see in this whole concept.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to make one very political point.  One of our problems within this island must surely be that a cultural vacuum exists among those people who claim at this stage of their lives to be British and yet their whole cultural tendencies are towards life within this island.  We have a challenge there.  By &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean the people in the South, the Government in the South, and more especially people like myself who are in contact with my neighbours every day of the week.  I recognise, as the traumas of the past ten years continue, that that cultural vacuum is something which has to be filled.  It will not be filled by the British Government in its administration of the North.  We can take that for granted because they are not in the least concerned about it and have shown time after time that they have no concern.  If it is going to be filled it will be filled by us.  I see a great opportunity within this Bill to set about filling that cultural vacuum in a way which is not platitudinous.  The people in the North have had enough platitudes to do them for the rest of their lives.  Let us have no platitudes about it. Let it be concrete; let it be bricks and stone; let it be something we can see, that exists, not just as something to look at, but as part of the community.  Let it be something that will bring the advances in modern day sciences to play on the traditions of the past.  Let us create something which in educational terms, political terms and social terms will help us to create and develop a new vision within this island.  It is crucially important that this should be done.  It can well be considered under section 5 of the Bill.  It is a development which would possibly help to change the passivity of this Bill into the type of active, creative development that we can apply to our traditions so that they are very positive, constructive things, that they are not just educational but that their spin-off is there in all terms within the island.</P>
    <P>I look forward very much to the establishment <Col N="564" /> of that type of centre.  I make it as a very concrete proposal.  I repeat that if help is not forthcoming from the authorities in the North to establish it, then it is the responsibility of this Government unilaterally to establish it because there cannot be a single argument put forward against the concept of understanding our past to help to create a vision for the future.  I would recommend it to the Minister as something which he should actively pursue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I inquired at the General Office some time ago for an explanatory memorandum.  I was informed there was none.  On asking why, I was informed that mine was not to reason why, that these are arbitrary matters decided elsewhere.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister's introductory speech supplied what we would expect from a memorandum.  It told us quite a lot about the hoped-for purposes of the establishment of the National Heritage Council.  It went some way towards giving a definition of what the national heritage is.  I take it that for the purposes of this Bill the national heritage concerns itself with tangible expressions of our legacy. I accept that as fairly clear.  It raises, of course, the profound philosophical/ cultural questions of whom we are, of our national heritage.  Senator O'Connell raised that point.  Senator Mallon touched on it also in the Northern context. It is not an easy question to answer. No matter how generous or comprehensive we try to be in our definition we sometimes revert to tribal type.  I hope Senator O'Connell will not mind if I instance here his distinguished collateral ancestor who was capable of great generosity of thought in his concept of what constituted Irishness but at times took refuge in the cosy feeling of identifying with his own Catholic people.  So, as one historian latterly observed about Daniel O'Connell, when he referred to his Protestant fellow countrymen, he was not altogether sure they were his countrymen &mdash; a lack of certainty which characterises most of us still.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other aspects of the distinguished Senator's distinguished ancestor I could refer to, but I forebear in charity.  Seriously, the question of our national heritage does raise the British/Irish connection that Senator Mallon referred to.  In another context it refers to the great stream of cultural diversity that has gone to make up modern Ireland.  It is true that we feel more at home with our own tribe.  I am never happier that when I am with my Irish speaking own, my Catholic own &mdash; although most of them are lapsed Catholics, but culturally they are my people. It requires an effort of the will and a generosity of the heart to reach out and make that wider definition of Irishness. That is the cause of all our trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that case I am glad to see that the Bill mentions not simply archaeological remains but private houses, the kinds of houses that are taken in trust for the nation.  I hope we have reached the stage of maturity when we accept everything that survives provided it has an intrinsic worth, provided it has an aesthetic or historical worth, that we accept everything that survives in this island as ours. Indeed, we must accept that some of our heritage is British.  Some of our heritage is Ascendancy.  I hope we are long past the stage that we think it perfectly legitimate to cherish what the Gaels left but to blow up what the Brits left.  When in 1918 Lenin found that his followers in excess of revolutionary zeal were blowing <Col N="566" /> up or destroying the churches of the despised Orthodox Church &mdash; and rightly despised from their point of view because it had shored up the intolerable regime of the Tzars &mdash; Lenin took them to task and said everything that survives from the past is part of the heritage of the people.  George Santayana said very wisely that a civilised people does not tear out pages from its history, it turns them over.  I have every confidence that the council to be set up by this Bill will be similarly civilised in its outlook.</P>
    <P>If we are welcoming this Bill today &mdash; and we certainly are, and the Minister said it is largely non-contentious &mdash; we have to say it is not before its time.  The rate of archaeological destruction here is simply appalling.  Let me give the House one fact which was conveyed to me yesterday by my distinguished colleague, the Professor of Archaelogy in UCC, Professor M.J. O'Kelly.  One of his graduate students has been doing a survey of earthworks in north Kerry, that is, from Tralee northwards to Kerry Head or so, and he was concerned with trying to estimate what was the damage done to earthworks in general from the early Christian period, notably ring forts of course.  He came to the conclusion that in the last few years 68 per cent of all such works have fallen victim to the bulldozer or to some other diabolical machine of modern development.  It is true that bulldozers are not supposed to bulldoze archaeological monuments.  There is supposed to be protection in the law.  But we all know that where developers move in there is not sufficient care for what is happening when, let us say, the supervisor turns his back.  A farmer who wants to get rid of an inconvenient archaeological remains in his property will have no difficulty in getting the bulldozer to do it.  One of our problems is that we do not have enough supervision in this particular area.  If we have Government grants and EEC grants being disbursed it behoves us to make sure that they are not disbursed at the expense of our archaeological heritage.</P>
    <P>One factor that has accelerated the rate of destruction is that our people are losing their sense of reverence for the physical past around them.  One word to <Col N="567" /> describe that reverence could be superstition. We talk about the superstition of countrymen who will cut around a particular ring fort or fairy mound, as they might term it, or refuse to destroy a particular tree which has long-rooted associations in the neighbourhood.  But superstition is not the correct word here at all.  It is really a reverence for the past which obtained and which prevented, in many cases, the destruction of important archaeological remains.  But we are losing that reverence.  Matthew Arnold described the Victorian attitude to religion; he described his fellow Victorians in that regard as half believers in a casual creed.  I think we are becoming that.  In terms of conventional, canonical religion and certainly in terms of the old gods of the countryside, we have lost that reverence which was a safeguard against this kind of destruction.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we blame the mindless youth for their vandalism in places like the Rock of Cashel and elsewhere for inscribing &ldquo;John loves Mary&rdquo; on an early Christian cross.  I think that that is not the worst kind of vandalism, nor are they the worst kinds of vandals.  The worst vandals can be very wealthy landowners; they can be private developers; sometimes they can be local authorities.  The attitude of local authorities to conservation is not always what one would desire. They sometimes fight shy of their obligation to disclose the existence of worthwhile remains to the local archaeological officers.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that legislation is impending, that one of the things the council will have to do, of course, is to examine the necessity for legislation.  I take it that the National Monuments Act was the legislation referred to and that that is well on the way to revision, and it is about time too. The position about treasure trove, for example, needs much firmer and harder legislation than obtains at present.  I understand that the legal position at the moment is that the use of metal detectors is forbidden in important areas, but everyone knows that one can buy a metal detector.  One enterprising firm in a city <Col N="568" /> which shall be nameless supplies not only a metal detector but a helpful list of sites at which a possible treasure may be detected.  There are lots of ways in which the National Monuments Act needs to be revised, and such an Act, I hope, will build-in the need for conservation into the whole planning area.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that we should compare our position in all this context with the position in other countries.  It is not something I like doing because frankly I do not give a damn, saving your reverence, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, what they do in other countries.  I think it is the most servile of all arguments to say we should do this because Europe will be laughing at us.  The truth is that no one outside this island gives a damn about us anyway, so in that respect we should do what we like. Nevertheless, one has to instance here the progressive legislation in Scandinavian countries, for example, where not alone is a national monument firmly declared to be in public ownership and custody but the onus is on the developer to pay the costs if there is any prospect that he might do damage to that monument.  I think we have to be much firmer in this legislation.  So I look forward to a revised National Monuments Act as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The National Museum, of course, is foremost in all our minds as we sit in this House because of its very proximity and because of the fact that we can actually see the place if we take time to look in there and see how bad the conditions are. Only the other day we had the example, which I am sure Senator O'Connell has already instanced, of the inability of the museum authorities to deal properly with a very valuable artefact found in Lake Derravaragh.  I might mention in that connection that one thing I hope the newly established council will deal with is the whole business of putting our treasures on world show, so to speak.  I have very great reservations about the wisdom of the transatlantic and now European exhibition of the treasures of Ireland.  I can see what the arguments are in favour of it.  They are very considerable in terms of national publicity, tourist potential, enhancing the image of the country <Col N="569" /> abroad.  Undoubtedly all these objectives have been achieved in the United States; but the risks are absolutely enormous. One hitch in air transport, for example, not necessarily a crash, one mishandling by indifferent staff could be disastrous. Even when the exhibits are on show the conditions of temperature and other conditions of exhibit are sometimes not observed.  I simply think the risks are not worth it.  But that is a personal opinion. It is something which I hope the new council will give very grave consideration to.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the national council will give serious attention to the separate but at the same time integrated idea of doing what we can about a folk museum. Senator Mallon referred to the example of Northern Ireland.  Indeed the North puts us to shame in the general matter of public records and of conservation and in the way in which its staff keep on acquainting the public with what they have.  There is the educational function, if you like, of their public records, their services and archaeologists and so on.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Submission to the Government in relation to Reforms in the Adoption System, made in June 1982 by six voluntary organisations, and requests urgent action from the Government on the principal proposals contained in that submission.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter in an entirely nonpartisan way.  It is a matter which affects only a minority of the population but it affects them in a most profound way.  It behoves all of us who debate the motion today to see whether we can devise a collective will to make progress in this area rather than engage in any form of partisan discussion or debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The submission referred to in the motion was prepared by a group representing <Col N="570" /> a number of highly responsible organisations, all of whom have considerable skill in the area of adoption and in the area of child care services generally. The organisations in question are the Federation of Services to Unmarried Parents and their Children, the Central Council of Catholic Adoption Societies, Children First, the Adoptive Parents' Association of Ireland, CARE and Cherish. The submission to the Government was made earlier this month.</P>
    <P>The proposals made in this submission are broadly similar in content to those contained in the supplementary report to the final report of the Task Force on Child Care Services published in 1980. As somebody who was involved with the Task Force on Child Care Services in their initial years, I regret that the Task Force as a whole did not find it possible to deal with the question of adoption in their complete report.  I understand the difficulties associated with dealing with this question, and I also understand that time was a factor.  I do believe that those who wrote the supplementary report were correct when they made the point that adoption is, after all, one part of a range of comprehensive child care services and that the Task Force therefore should have seen it as such and, despite the difficulties, should have dealt with it for that reason.</P>
    <P>The motion is before us today not only because reform of our adoption laws and system is long overdue and is recognised as such, but also because the previous Government had prepared and the present Government have committed themselves to the introduction of a new Children's Bill.  In this regard I share the view expressed in the introduction to the submission to the Government which states:</P>
    <P>We consider that adoption ought not to be something separate from the other child care services, and that to as great an extent as possible appropriate reforms of the Adoption System should be included in the provisions of the promised Children's Bill.</P>
    <P>There are two suggestions contained in that quotation from the introduction to the submission to the Government. <Col N="571" /> Firstly, adoption should be seen as part of, or as an option within, a comprehensive range of child care services.  Historically, of course, we know adoption was seen as largely a legal procedure based principally on the needs of single mothers and adoptive parents.  Traditionally it was seen primarily as a legal device for solving the twin problems of illegitimacy on one hand and infertility on the other.</P>
    <P>Today, however, our perception of adoption has changed.  It is now seen as a child-centred service, its primary objective being to meet the social and emotional needs of children requiring substitute families.  Seen in this way, it is appropriate that responsibility for adoption services should be transferred from the Minister for Justice to the Minister for Health, who will in future have departmental responsibility for a broad range of child care services generally. Traditionally and for as long as adoption was seen primarily as a legal device, it could be argued certainly that adoption was appropriately the responsibility of the Department of Justice.  Given our new awareness of the role and functions of adoption, however, its child-centredness and the fact it can be seen as one option in a range of child care services, it is appropriate in my view and in the view of those who made the submission to the Government that responsibility for it should be transferred to the Minister for Health.  I am aware that approximately a fortnight ago there was a brief announcement in one daily paper to the effect that responsibility for adoption was being or would be transferred from the Minister for Justice to the Minister for Health.  I hope that in the course of the debate the Minister might be in a position to clarify this, because it was not clear to me from that newspaper report what exactly had happened or was intended to happen.  In so far as it is the intention of the Government to transfer responsibility for adoption to the Minister for Health I certainly welcome it and see it as a significant step forward.  I would certainly welcome clarification from the Minister in regard to what is happening.</P>
    <P>The second suggestion in the passage <Col N="572" /> I quoted earlier is that adoption reform should be included in the proposed new Children's Bill.  This is profoundly important. If it is the case that adoption should be seen as part of overall child care services and if we are, as I understand it, about to have a new Children's Bill covering almost all, if not all, other aspects of child care administration and law, then I would argue strongly that it is appropriate that adoption reform should be included in the context of that Bill.  I believe that the previous Minister for Health had this precisely in mind while preparing the proposed Children's Bill. I would certainly argue strongly that the present Government when they introduce the Bill should see to it that adoption reform will be included.  I would therefore ask the Minister if he would give us in the course of the debate some indication as to whether it is the intention of the Government to deal with this matter in the context of the proposed Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition to these broad recommendations, the submission to the Government contains a range of specific proposals all of which seem to me to have considerable merit.  At the simplest level, there are a number of proposals concerned with the administration of the adoption services in addition to the transfer of responsibility from the Department of Justice to the Department of Health. These are referred to in pages 6 and 7 of the submission and I will refer to them briefly here.  It is suggested &mdash; and I think all of us would agree, as well as most of the personnel involved in adoption procedures &mdash; that it is important in the course of reforming the law that we introduce regulations to ensure the periodic registration of adoption societies.  This is a straightforward and essential safeguard and does not pose any threat to anybody, but it would see to it that certain minimum standards of practice were laid down and adhered to.  This is not to say that one is criticising what is happening now.  I would think it to be an essential safeguard for the adoption system as a whole in the long run.</P>
    <P>The submission also refers in this context to the drawing up of comprehensive <Col N="573" /> guidelines and statutory regulations for the operation of adoption societies.  The submission states:</P>
    <P>...proper functioning cannot be adequately ensured without stringent control on the operation of adoption societies.  These regulations would include such matters as the scope of the society's activities; the nature of its resources; effectiveness of organisation; accepted standards of practice for pre-placement assessment; placement arrangement and post-placement supervision.</P>
    <P>These suggestions in the context of comprehensive guidelines are sensible and should be acted upon in the form of giving them a greater formulation than they have at the moment.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the submission refers to the need to provide adequate funding for the adoption societies.  That is a sensible and self-evident idea which does not need development.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, it refers to the need for research into adoption in this country because very little of a comprehensive nature has been done to date.  These proposals seem to me to be both simple and sensible.  It is inconceivable that anybody in the House would have any objections to acting in the shortest possible period of time.</P>
    <P>The submission refers to a number of other matters of significance which I would like to mention briefly.  At present there is no statutory provision relating to the length of time which ought to elapse between placement of a child for adoption and the final completion of the adoption order.  Traditionally it appears that the average period between placement and completion of the adoption process has been of the order of six months.  More recently the minimum period has been extended to ten months, and the average period appears to be of the order of 12 months between placement and adoption. This period, it is suggested in the submission &mdash; and I think most people concerned with adoption services and practices would agree &mdash; does appear to be too long.  It is too long for the natural mother, too long for the adoptive parents, <Col N="574" /> and it seems reasonable to suggest it is too long for the child itself.  In this regard I would refer to the comments made on page 8 of the submission, which are as follows:</P>
    <P>The natural mother has to face the decision to place her child for adoption, and later must decide whether she wants the adoption to go to completion. Even if she makes the latter decision earlier on, it is effectively still with her until the adoption order is made, because she can revoke the decision at any time until then.  This preoccupation may interfere with or postpone other decisions which she should be making for her own future.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that the average period at present does seem to be too long from the point of view of the natural mother, whose feelings and concerns also have to be taken account of here.</P>
    <P>As far as prospective adopters are concerned the submission states:</P>
    <P>Prospective adopters feel that they are on trial until the adoption order is made, and know that if they are found wanting or if the natural mother does not give her consent or withdraws a consent given they may lose the child. This may interfere with the bonding between the intended adopters and the child, and with full integration of the child into the family.</P>
    <P>That too seems to be a reasonable and sensible point of view.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the submission states:</P>
    <P>The child, whatever its age, may suffer as a result of delay in or failure of bonding and integration into the family.  If the child is anyway mature, it will also be troubled by doubts about its own future, in addition to having to cope with changes in its life brought about by the placement.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I would agree with the suggestion in the submission that the minimum placement period should be reduced by regulation, and it would seem reasonable that the period between placement and the making of the adoption <Col N="575" /> order should be reduced to something of the order of three to six months. That period would provide adequate safeguard while at the same time dealing with the problems to which I referred.</P>
    <P>On the question of eligibility of children for adoption, the submissions are again sensible and the ideas are worth acting on.  The supplementary report of the Task Force to which I referred earlier said that the present upper age limit of seven should be changed to 21.  That is certainly worth thinking about, although it does seem strange that one should be talking about the possibility of adoption up to that age.  In certain circumstances it is not as strange as it might seem and we know already that while in practice the upper age limit is seven, that can be waived and is waived in special circumstances. In the context of the proposed legislation the Government should consider raising the age of eligibility for adoption.</P>
    <P>On a more contentious issue the submission refers to the impossibility under present legislation of adoption for legitimate children, except in one or two special circumstances.  As a general rule legitimate children are not available for adoption at present.  This practice of exclusion of legitimate children from adoption arises presumably from the traditional view of adoption to which I referred earlier; that is to say, that it is a legal device linking unmarried mothers with infertile families.  If we see adoption as part of an overall child care service and as one option within a range of facilities or solutions available for children who require substitute families, then it makes no sense any longer to consider it wise to preclude legitimate children from the right to adoption.  The law therefore should not continue to discriminate in relation to eligibility of children for legal adoption on the basis of the marital status of the child's parents.</P>
    <P>In this regard I would like very briefly to quote from the supplementary report of the Task Force on Child Care Services, section 4.7.5 of which states:</P>
    <P>We do not think that permitting the <Col N="576" /> legal adoption of children whose parents are married to each other would result in parents placing their children for adoption who would otherwise wish to have to bring them up themselves. The universal devotion of parents to their children is one of the strongest bonds known to the human race.  It is as unlikely to be weakened by permitting legal adoption as it is to be strengthened by prohibiting it.  Parents do not willingly part with their children permanently unless in the most exceptional circumstances.  Such exceptional circumstances do exist, however, and refusing to acknowledge that they do will not prevent them from arising or prevent children going into care as a result of them.  Its only result is that some children will stay in care throughout their childhood who could instead be growing up happily in adoptive families.</P>
    <P>The authors of the supplementary report go on to recommend that the law should be changed to permit the adoption of children whose parents are legally married to each other.  This is important, because we know that there are significant numbers of children who require substitute family care but who cannot have recourse to the option of adoption because their parents are married.  I am thinking here of children whose parents show no concern for them and do not wish to care for them, and children who have been as a result taken to care.  Under the present system the only option is residential care or long-term fostering or some combination of both.  It is wrong to discriminate against these children by preventing them from having the security which adoption can give to them in that situation.  It should be dealt with in the context of general reform of child care.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the constitutionality of this proposal is in doubt, and that is referred to in the submission before us. But if that is the case we must bear in mind that the Constitution can be changed by way of referendum if we feel strongly about the issue.  We talk about other referenda at present which seem to me to be less pressing than this one. <Col N="577" /> There is doubt about whether this is constitutionally inoperable, and before we move to the point of considering a referendum we should have the matter tested in the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court are quite capable of making a decision on this if it is put to them. We should do so if we are to provide the prospect of adoption for legitimate children, which child care experts and people dealing with children in residential institutions deem it desirable for them to have.</P>
    <P>The constitutional issue which I refer to also affects the law in relation to dispensing with the consent of the parent to the adoption of a child.  The Adoption Act, 1951 permits the consent of the parent to be dispensed with (a) if the parent cannot be found or (b) if the parent is incapable, by reason of mental infirmity, of giving consent.  The 1974 Adoption Act made the additional provision that in dealing with any matter in relation to adoption the Adoption Board or a court of law shall &ldquo;regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration&rdquo;. The constitutionality of this provision of the 1974 Act also appears to be in doubt and excessively vague, although it is obviously moving in the right direction in terms of policy.</P>
    <P>The submission to the Government referred to in the motion suggests that it may be necessary to clarify and extend the exceptional circumstances in which parental consent to adoption may be compulsorily dispensed with.  I agree with the formulation presented in the supplementary report of the Task Force in sections 4.7.14 to 4.7.16.  We should move towards some formulation which is more explicit than the one contained in the 1974 Act to something similar to that suggested in the supplementary report of the Task Force, which states:</P>
    <P>The consent of a parent (or any other relevant person) which would normally be required for the adoption of a child should be dispensed with if, considering all the factors relevant to the needs of the child and the wishes and circumstances of the parent, the child's long-term welfare requires that he should <Col N="578" /> be legally adopted by another family, and any one of the following grounds is established:</P>
    <P>(a)  that the parent has not cared for the child herself or does not propose to care for the child herself or to make arrangements for his appropriate care by other persons;</P>
    <P>(b)  that the child is already being cared for in another family and that his interests require that he should remain in that family;</P>
    <P>(c)  that the parent is unable because of grave incapacity to provide a home for the child or to give him adequate care, affection and protection, during his childhood.</P>
    <P>That kind of formulation, which may seem somewhat extreme, is valid and desirable in the context of dispensing with the consent of the parents.  After all, in the business of adoption, bearing in mind developments in our knowledge of child care, it is the welfare of the child which is the paramount consideration. The task of the new legislation is to formulate this view in a more explicit way than was done in the 1974 Act and, if necessary, to have its constitutional validity tested either in a Supreme Court or, if it proves to be unconstitutional, by way of referendum.</P>
    <P>With the growing acceptance and reality that larger numbers of women who are not married and who have children decide to keep them, the children who may need adoption are children whose parents are married and who are therefore legitimate but whose parents are often unwilling to take the necessary steps to ensure that the child's future is secure in so far as it can be.  We should look closely at the business of dispensing with the consent of parents in certain special circumstances and the formulation which I have outlined from the supplementary report of the Task Force is a worthy one which we could consider putting into legislation.</P>
    <P>If we see adoption as part of a child-care system, we should do away with the Adoption Board.  We should make important legal decisions in the context <Col N="579" /> of the proposed new family or children's court systems which I hope will emerge in the context of the new Children's Bill. The submission to the Government outlines various options as to the form of court which would be most appropriate to making decisions about adoption. Given that it is part of a child-care system and given that we will build up expertise in the proposed new children's and family courts, I hope that the decision about adoption will be taken there and the need for a separate Adoption Board will no longer be relevant.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the main proposals contained in this submission.  We in the Labour Party put it before the Seanad because it seems a very sensible approach to the need for reform of the adoption law and administrative system.  It has been prepared by highly responsible skilled people and it is the business of this House to listen to what these people are saying and to encourage the Government to make the necessary legislative changes in the context of the proposed new Children's Bill.  We are not trying to make this a partisan issue between Government and Opposition.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the economic crises which the country faces.  Where finances are scarce the business of Government is to identify things which can be done at virtually little cost.  I am not saying the proposals contained in this submission are cost free &mdash; they are not &mdash; but relatively speaking they do not involve much expenditure.  The business of Government in the present economic climate is to seek out and identify things which are good in themselves and do not cost a lot of money.  For this reason, together with the reasons set down in the submission, I commend the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. T. Conway Mr. T. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad.  I second the motion that Seanad Éireann takes note of the submission to the Government in relation to reforms in the adoption system made by very responsible organisations which include representatives from CARE, Children First, Cherish, the Adoptive Parents' Association of <Col N="580" /> Ireland, Central Council of Catholic Adoption Societies and the Federation of Services to Unmarried Parents and Children. These societies represent the rights of the parent, the rights of the child and the rights of adoptive parents.  They are very highly constructive bodies who have put together a great submission to the Government.</P>
      <P>We have reached a unique period in the evolution of the State and its population. We have the youngest population in Europe, but we have laws to guard that young population enshrined in a Constitution which is outdated, laws which, in effect, were drafted in a time which has no relevance to the present.</P>
      <P>At present, in the adoption system there is a period of from ten to 12 months before the adoption can go through.  The mother has the right, for up to six months, to change her mind, but the period between six and 12 months, which is often extended to 18 months, causes great concern to the adopting parents.  It is a situation which should not exist, nor should there be such unease at so sensitive a time for the adopting parents.  The reason we are given for the extension of the time from six months to, sometimes, a year and a year-and-a-half is that the adoption societies are understaffed and underfinanced.  This is a terrible situation in such a sensitive area where children are involved.  It should be our first priority to make sure that the societies are efficient, because of the sensitive matters with which they are dealing.</P>
      <P>The submission talks about an adoption court, which makes sense, as all family law is, at present, dealt with in ther family court.  However, first of all, the adoption societies should be looked into and properly staffed and if there is an adoption court it should meet throughout the country and not be situated in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law, as it stands, says that the child is totally the responsibility of the adopting mother, but I would suggest that in cases where the father expresses a desire to be involved in the decision of adoption, that desire should be taken into consideration and he should be involved in the adoption procedure.  The law prohibits <Col N="581" /> parents of mixed marriages, except in extreme circumstances, from adopting children.  People who profess no religion are excluded from adopting.  This is unconstitutional, because it denies the right of these individuals to play an active role in society.</P>
    <P>At present, the legitimate child cannot be adopted.  The child can only be fostered. That fostering lasts, in some cases, for the life of the child and at any time the parents can return and demand the child back.  This, in effect, denies the right of the child, because the child comes first.  The child demands a secure family and surroundings.  I have often seen children in foster homes and know them to be psychologically very sensitive indeed and unprepared, at the end of their childhood, to face the realities of life as it exists outside.  The law should be made to cater for the legitimate child.  These legitimate children are often the result of marriage breakdowns and are herded into institutions.  They are left, on one side, with foster parents who have a desire to adopt them and, on the other side, with the threat that the parents might return at any time to repossess them.  A child caught up in this situation suffers a great deal of insecurity.</P>
    <P>Regulations should be drawn up by the Minister for Health and not by the Minister for Justice, as it is a matter for the Department of Health to register all the adoption societies.  The Department of Health should then examine all adoption societies to ensure that they are efficient at carrying out their duties in a responsible manner and being responsible to society and parents.  This should be done as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the proposals enshrined in this document for what they represent.  They are proposals by a body of people who know the rights of the child, parents and the adopting parents.  If the regulations were established by the Minister for Health and if the adoption societies were investigated properly, they would be reasonably efficient and this long period of waiting would be eliminated.</P>
    <P>If the idea of an adoption court and the other items were taken into consideration, <Col N="582" /> there would be a better system.  As Senator O'Mahony said, there is frequent adoption nowadays and children are pushed into a very delicate situation at a very sensitive period in their lives.  The adopting parents find that after waiting six months, they have to wait for a year. I cannot see the reason for this and feel there is no need for it.  I know the Minister will take note of the proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to welcome the Minister to the House.  It is the first time in this session that I have had the pleasure of his presence and I would like to make him welcome. I also welcome the motion here before us:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Submission to the Government in relation to Reforms in the Adoption System, made in June 1982 by six voluntary organisations, and requests urgent action from the Government on the principal proposals contained in that submission.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I certainly would welcome the Seanad's taking note of the submission.</P>
      <P>I would like to go through the main headings of the submission and perhaps enter a small caveat here and there.  Like the previous speaker, I had noticed that the bodies that have made the submission are the recognised authoritative bodies dealing with the problems of parents and children &mdash; the Federation of Services to Unmarried Parents and their Children, The Central Council for Catholic Adoption Societies, Children First, Care, Cherish and The Adoptive Parents' Association of Ireland.  There can be no doubt of the validity, veracity and authority of these organisations.  Therefore, it behoves us on all sides of the House to take note of what they say in what is a very important area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the historical sense, adoption has come a long way.  Attitudes about every section of society have changed, and these attitudes have permeated into the realms of adoption and of care of unmarried mothers.  This has necessarily reflected itself in our attitude towards <Col N="583" /> adoption.  I agree with section 1.5. of the submission:</P>
    <P>The Central Council of Catholic Adoption Societies</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is one of the bodies who made this submission&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>does not subscribe to the views expressed here as to the Court which should have adoption jurisdiction, preferring that it should be exercised by a single Adoption Court sitting in Dublin....</P>
    <P>They continue that, arising out of that, the Family Court would eventually deal with them, but that, as an interim measure, the single Adoption Court would be best.  I am of that opinion, too.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with all the regulations for the operation of adoption societies. That they be funded adequately needs no explanation.  As Senator O'Mahony said, that is a question of economics but it is one field to which finance should be applied.  We are dealing with children and should recognise the priority.</P>
    <P>Regarding the need for dispensation with consent, that is an area in which we should proceed cautiously.  Perhaps <i>festina lente</i> would be the best motto to adopt here.  We are, after all, dealing in a very sensitive area, there is no doubt about that.  It is an area in which I have direct experience, and one should be always conscious that here are human beings with very, very human problems.</P>
    <P>Shortening of the period of placement is very desirable.  Placement puts enormous psychological pressures on people. We can imagine the pressure it would impose on a natural mother who has decided that she will give her child for adoption.  I know the pressures it puts on an adoptive parent.  The length of time one waits, the agonies one goes through and the cases one hears of, perhaps of a child being taken back, all cause distress. I heartily concur with the length of time being shortened as much as practicable, allowing, of course, for everybody's rights.</P>
    <P>The shortened birth certificate is <Col N="584" /> referred to on page 16 of the document. This is one area on which there should be much more emphasis.  I did not hear either of the earlier speakers touching on it.  The submission says:</P>
    <P>The participating Organisations fully concur in the recommendation in the Task Force Report, that &ldquo;... children who have been legally adopted should, at the age of 18, be entitled to receive information about their background and to receive a copy of their original birth certificate if they so wish&rdquo;, subject, as the Report advises, to widespread information about and discussion of the issues....</P>
    <P>The proposal has been made, and we would favour the concept, that either no reference to adoption should appear on the long form of the Birth Certificate of adopted children, or that use of the long form of the Certificate should not be mandatory.</P>
    <P>The latter is perhaps the better suggestion, that the use of the long form of the certificate should not be mandatory.  It is discriminating, particularly in this day and age, that adopted children have to go through that process at the stage when they need their birth certificates.  I have had personal experience of this, and it is demeaning in some way.  When we are adopting the principle that all are equal, why should adopted children be treated as not equal?</P>
    <P>An appendix says:</P>
    <P>Because of changing practice in other countries and changes in attitudes towards adoption and illegitimacy in Ireland, it is a fact that Irish adoption agencies are now prepared to give to adoptive parents, and to adoptive children who are old enough, a greater amount of general information about the background of adoptive children and about their natural parents, than was formerly the case.</P>
    <P>In general, that is a principle that appears to be liberal and correct, but it is one that I would take slowly.  I regard this submission as excellent in principle.  It is a necessary document, in the light of changing <Col N="585" /> circumstances, of our changing feelings and attitudes towards children, parents, families, the natural and the civil laws. However, I would proceed cautiously. The submission says, on pages 17-18:</P>
    <P>Agencies should be empowered and directed that, when a child placed by them has geen adopted and has reached, say, 7 years, the agency should take all reasonable steps to satisfy itself that the child has been informed that it is an adopted child, and if the adoptive parents have failed to do this the agency should attempt to have resolved the problems underlying the failure.</P>
    <P>Naturally, all adoptive parents tell their children that they are adopted, but they choose their time.  That is the point that I wish to make.  There is a special bonding relationship between all parents, natural and adoptive.  Particularly in the adoptive parent situation, one watches for the right time to give this information, one waits until a special relationship has developed.  You cannot stipulate a certain age as the right time to tell a child, because children develop along different lines, they develop mentally and physically at various rates.  I do not like the idea that there should be a definite age at which one should tell a child he or she is adopted.  There comes a time when one can do it and that will be the right time to do it.  Be it at bathtime or bedtime, that father or mother introduces the subject naturally and it becomes a part of that family's life.  The child, if told correctly and lovingly, quite likes the idea, and it grows with the child.  It should not be statutory and the adoption society should not act as big brother with the adoptive parent, saying &ldquo;Have you told that child?&rdquo;  The mother, father, or both as a unit, would take the right opportunity to inform the child.</P>
    <P>These are the main points I want to make.  I welcome this submission.  I know that the Government will take particular note of it but enter my own caveat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first time to be with the newly elected <Col N="586" /> Seanad and I wish it well.  I thank the Senators for their good wishes and also want to extend a special welcome to the Members from Northern Ireland, Senators Robb and Mallon.  In the past, I have participated in some very good debates in this House and look forward to more. I now wish, in reply, to outline our policy in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>Adoption is a complex and delicate area involving many sensitive issues, and because of this it attracts considerable publicity.  There have been many criticisms of our adoption system from persons and groups both directly and indirectly involved in adoption, but despite their expertise in and knowledge of adoption, these persons and groups have been very hesitant to say precisely what changes should be made.</P>
      <P>One of the constant demands has been that provision should be made for the adoption of legitimate children.  On humanitarian grounds, one must agree that there is a good case for such adoption in the case of abandoned, or possibly severely neglected children.  But, as was pointed out by the then Minister for Justice in his speech on the Second Stage of the Bill to amend the Constitution &mdash; and I refer to the Dáil Debates of 7 February 1979 (Volume 311 at column 585) &mdash;&ldquo;No criteria of neglect or abandonment could eliminate collusion between natural and adoptive parents to fabricate neglect or abandonment.&rdquo;  Adoption is unique, in that it affects the legal status of all parties to it and, unlike other child care services, its effects are permanent and irreversible and, on that account, it cannot be regarded as just another welfare service for children.  I have no doubt that Senators will have seen the newspaper references to a statement by the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace to the effect that the proposal that legitimate children (other than orphans) should be capable of being legally adopted raises fundamental social policy questions which need further study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like to be critical of groups whose sincerity is not in doubt, but I might mention one point which is made in the document which is the subject matter of this motion.  I refer to the suggestion <Col N="587" /> that the consent of the natural mother, or of the parents as the case may be, might be dispensed with when, by reason of personal incapacity, the parent or parents cannot make adequate provision for the care of the child.  This kind of suggestion raises the issue of what is meant by personal incapacity.  What, for instance, about the children of itinerants?</P>
    <P>The bodies who prepared the document say that this and other proposed grounds for dispensing with consent should be the subject of further discussion and consideration, with a view to developing more precise definitions.  But, with respect, there has been a great deal of public criticism of the existing law over a long period of time.  Surely, those who take it upon themselves publicly to criticise the law on specific issues could have been expected to spend a little of that time working out in detail what precisely they want done.  In this, as in some other sensitive matters, precise thinking is crucial. Those who criticise some of the existing provisions include public figures who are trained in law and in the social sciences.  They must realise that pious aspirations and generalities are just not good enough when it comes to working out what ought to be done.  I hope that they realise that what they seem to be saying is that one or two civil servants, who would not claim to be specialists in this area and who have a multiplicity of other duties, plus a parliamentary draftman, should be able to produce easily the kind of solution that they themselves, as experts, have singularly failed to do.</P>
    <P>As the Government have decided that responsibility for adoption should be transferred to my colleague, the Minister for Health, it would be wrong for me at this stage to comment on possible changes.  I feel I should point out, however, that adoption has not been a neglected subject.  This can be seen from the fact that there have been three amending Acts since 1952, two of them in the seventies, as well as an amendment to the Constitution to safeguard adoption orders.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has undertaken to establish a committee to review <Col N="588" /> the existing legal and administrative adoption arrangements, and all suggestions for change will be considered by this committee.  I would hope that the advocates of change will submit fully worked out proposals to that committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreBolger" hpid="Mrs. Bolger Mrs. Bolger">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bolger</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I welcome the Minister to the House.  It must be a change for him to be listening to a debate other than on the environment, and may be a welcome change.  Nevertheless, I am disappointed that the Minister for Health cannot be here but, no doubt, the Minister of State who is present will pass on the points that come out of the debate.</P>
      <P>I would like to congratulate my Labour colleagues in the House for putting down this notice of motion and the six voluntary bodies who have made this excellent submission to the Government.  Nobody will doubt the sincerity of all involved in this submission, and I hope that some progress will be made in this sphere.  The Minister says that adoption has not been a neglected topic, and I agree.  It has not been a neglected subject in this country, thanks to certain voluntary groups and pressure organisations.  Nevertheless, there is still a lot of work to be done in the adoption area.  A lot of these recommendations are in the submission.  I welcome wholeheartedly the recommendation of this committee that adoption should come under the umbrella of the Minister for Health.  It is most appropriate, as the health services are already responsible for family care and child services.  These services are a natural follow-up to adoption, and we should be concerned with the welfare of the child from birth to adulthood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing is not spelled out specifically, that health boards need to become more involved as a non-denominational agency.  Adoption societies are seen to be biased by their very names.  I welcome the recommendation that the operation of adoption be evaluated from time to time.  This is very important, and I hope that that will happen.  The Minister says that he has undertaken to establish a committee to review the existing legal and administrative adoption arrangements and that all suggestions for change <Col N="589" /> will be considered by that committee.  I certainly welcome that and look forward to the setting up of it.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell the House how soon it will be set up.  That is most important.</P>
    <P>One point that has come strongly out of it is the urgent need to abolish the status of illegitimacy.  One area of concern is this consent of the single parent, who through stress, pressure or sickness of one sort or another loses her sense of objectivity and is unable to make up her mind.  In that instance there should be provision to allow a team decision on the future of the child.  Senator O'Rourke said that this is an extremely sensitive area and that we would want to tread very carefully when laying down any specific rules and regulations in this matter. It is something that should be considered by this committee being set up, and some recommendations should come from them.</P>
    <P>It is most desirable that provision be made in certain circumstances to adopt legitimate children.  Other speakers have advocated this and I do not intend to go into it.  It is another extremely complicated and sensitive area and a major one for this committee that the Minister is to set up.  But I and many Members of the House feel that there are instances when adoption of legitimate children should be possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report highlighting the need to speed up the process of adoption. I know many cases where there are interminable delays, suffering and heartache for those who are waiting the final word about adoption.  We all know that the earlier a child is adopted, the better.  The younger he is when adopted the sooner the parents who are to be responsible for him can arrange for his education.  The reason for the inordinate delays that take place is the very in-depth investigations that have to be made on the history of the child and the family background of the home where he will spend his life. This had been referred to by other speakers and we are all agreed that that is one of the big drawbacks in this area.  It is very involved and a very responsible job and it cannot be rushed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> I congratulate the adoption societies on the tremendous work they have done over the years.  One thing I would stress, and it should always be maintained, is the confidentiality of adoption.  It is extremely important and I would not like to see that watered down in any way whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Rourke that we should not have any hard and fast rules about seven years of age or any age: we should be a little flexible.  We all know, any of us who have children, that they develop at different paces.  Each child is different: even in a family of five or six there are no two children the same. Therefore, we cannot lay down rules and regulations for adopted children because each child is a different case.  It is up to parents to make the decision of when an adopted child should be informed of his or her status in the family.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my welcome for these submissions. I think the Minister may have been a bit harsh on the voluntary organisations involved, but they have started the ball rolling and I am quite sure that they are prepared to go the full round and put their backs into whatever changes are needed.  I am quite sure that if they are approached when this committee are set up they will give their all to it because they are extremely concerned people and they are to be encouraged. I hope these submissions will go further very quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I rise to speak here I begin to say I feel I belong to a different world from that of politics.  I do not know whether it is age or background or experience or what.  We have betrayed our children for 70 years, we have temporised about children's legislation, we have temporised about the problems of children in large families, we have temporised and shipped a generation overseas because we could not provide them with employment, and we make ignoble, pointless, irrelevant gestures towards their welfare and towards the safety of society, and we ship off a tiny minority, who cannot be controlled otherwise, to a prison in the heart of County Cavan, <Col N="591" /> and we call that looking after our children.</P>
      <P>What astonished me about the proposals of the voluntary agencies, as somebody who does not know and did not know much about adoption, was that it should be the level of our adoption legislation that the full sum of the proposals of bodies who are intimately concerned would be to suggest that when a parent is clearly incapacitated or cannot make, for instance, a credible case that he or she will be capable of looking after a child, they would suggest that the child should therefore be able to be adopted without consent.</P>
      <P>In a society that preaches so loudly, so consistently and so insistently and with something close to unanimity that we are concerned first and foremost about the welfare of our children, born or unborn, I find it astonishing that what I would believe to be spurious, in the sense that I do not believe they are the real reasons legal arguments should be advanced.  I accept that there may be constitutional problems, but as we have seen and are seeing, constitutional amendments are not a problem when you think of the political mileage we make out of a good issue.  But constitutional amendments should never be an excuse for leaving one, not to mention large numbers, of our children to suffer.</P>
      <P>It is a bit much to suggest that it is rather difficult to determine personal incapacity of parents and at the same time quite consistently in the case of travellers, lock up parents and leave children with absolutely nobody to look after them and put them into care.  That is quite all right because that is the law of the land.  I am aware that there are delicate and sensitive problems involved in these areas, but there are delicate and sensitive problems involved in every area of family law, and the fact that there are delicate and sensitive problems involved is no excuse for the sort of waffle, with all due respect to the Minister, that he treated us to here this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like saying those things.  The fact that there are sensitive and delicate problems involved does not excuse us <Col N="592" /> from our responsibility to our children. Our responsibility is ultimately, fundamentally and basically to our children before everybody else.  The creation of some sort of mythological property rights of parents which somehow minimise or modify the fundamental right of all our children to decent homes and stability is nothing but a load of old waffle.  It is the sort of thing which makes this House and the other House of the Oireachtas more and more irrelevant to the sort of idealistic thinking that our young people expect from us.</P>
    <P>I seem to be standing up here always talking about our young people, because I am becoming more and more aware of the fact that children and young people generally regard us as a crowd of old wafflers who whenever there is a delicate issue postpone it, proscrastinate and temporarise, hoping that ultimately the courts will solve the difficult problem for us.  I found the Minister's speech unhelpful. As one who is identified most with a voluntary organisation, I found offensive his suggestion that somehow the voluntary organisations are culpable because they could not do a job that is properly that of the Legislature, which is to draft legislation.  It was offensive to voluntary organisations to expect them to extend their role beyond what they are doing. The Minister should welcome the efforts of poorly funded, overworked, grossly exploited by the State, voluntary organisations when they try on limited resources, and an enormous demand on their members' free time.  When they try to assist the process of legislation, to come back with that sort of nonsense is offensive and insulting and is typical of the way politicians of all parties, when they have the opportunity, will pat the backs of voluntary organisations and say &ldquo;You are great as long as you stay in your own place but when you enter our area, then the crocodile turns on you, the teeth are bared, how dare you suggest that we are not legislating properly&rdquo;.  It is our job in the Houses of the Oireachtas to legislate. We should not be pointing a finger at other people.  The problems have been identified &mdash; indeed even the Minister's inadequate speech identified them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> The difficulty is the drafting of legislation. That is the Government's job and the Legislature's job.  This is where it should start.  Everything that these bodies have recommended I find to be reasonable. I find it astonishing that it should have to come in the form of a submission, that after years of cogitation such reasonable suggestions, all of which are designed to protect our children from the inadequacies of their elders, are somehow regarded as needing to be qualified, to be pared away, to be tagged by various kinds of caveats, warnings etc.</P>
    <P>Maybe I am simplistic, maybe I am naive, but I believe that when a child is at risk, the child matters first.  If there is a problem or a doubt the benefit of the doubt should go firmly, squarely and fundamentally to the child.  I do not believe I have any exclusive property rights over the one child I have.  I sincerely hope that if I am ever judged to be inadequate and unfit to look after that child that in her interest somebody will have the authority to say, &ldquo;No, you cannot ruin that child's life because of some sort of mythological property right that allows you to own the child as a piece of your property&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our children are our responsibilities that we have in trust.  If we cannot discharge that trust, they are entitled to the best that society can offer them.  As far as I am concerned, that report suggested a number of reasonable proposals which ought to be given serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed with both the quality and the content of the Minister's statement.  It is dismissive of the work of a group of committed, knowledgeable people.  It is offensive to voluntary organisations, completely misunderstands their role and function and does nothing to advance the fundamental cause that we would all, at least on the surface, claim to be committed to, which is the cause of our children.  I repeat that my view is quite simplistic.  Our children come first; they come before the rights of parents, the rights of property and constitutional provisions.  Anything that has to be changed to ensure that all our children have the right to proper, decent, secure family homes must be done irrespective of any other rights that in the <Col N="594" /> process may have to be qualified or toned down.</P>
    <P>It is ultimately as simple as that.  Our children have rights over and above anything that the rest of us may claim. Therefore I am very happy to support the motion.  I hope that ultimately the final Government response to all these areas will be much more worthwhile and valuable than what we got from the Minister here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillaHannon" hpid="Mrs. Hannon Mrs. Hannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  There have been many changes in our perception of adoption over the past 30 years.  In the past it was looked upon as the legal device, first of all for looking after illegitimacy and on the other hand infertility: it saved the unmarried girl the problem of having to disclose that she had had a baby, and it supplied a readymade child for the infertile couple.  Today the emphasis is rightly on the child.  Today the emotional and social needs of the child are being considered, particularly the social needs of the child in getting a substitute family.</P>
      <P>The most trying and emotional period for all concerned in adoption is the time before the final adoption order is made. It is a time of great anxiety for the natural mother, because despite the fact that she has already consented to the adoption up to the time the final adoption order is made she can change her mind at any time.  This places great stress on her.  For the adoptive parents it is a time of insecurity &mdash; they feel they are on trial.  They are afraid to get too fond of that child because they are afraid the mother may change her mind at the last moment and they might lose that baby.  Even the child can suffer in these circumstances because it cannot be absorbed completely into the family unit, and if it is a little older it feels not only insecure about its future but also it has to adapt to the changes involved in getting used to a new family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone in this set up has their rights and all of these must be taken into account.  At present we are aware that there is a statutory provision relating to the length of time that must elapse before the final adoption order is made.  In the past we were talking in terms of about six <Col N="595" /> months.  Now the usual time is ten months.  It is far too long.  It took 28 months before a child was finally handed over to a friend of mine.  I would not like to tell you the problems those parents had during that time.  They were terrified that they were going to lose the baby.</P>
    <P>The suggested time of three months is not unreasonable.  In a large number of cases there is absolutely no problem in assessing the suitability of the applicants. These cases could be dealt with very speedily. In other cases in which problems exist sufficient staff should be made available to ensure that they are dealt with as speedily as possible and that difficult decisions will not be shelved or some excuse made for putting off the decision.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in the report that the consent of the natural mother, or the parent as the case might be, would be dispensed with in cases in which, because of personal incapacity the parent or parents cannot make adequate provision for the care of the child.  This is an area in regard to which we should tread very lightly as it is a very sensitive area.  A lot more thought must go into it.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly that exists in the present system is that legitimate children cannot be adopted.  This discriminates against legitimate children because it denies such children the right to be absorbed into family units.  The report states that any child should be eligible for adoption when it has been established by the courts that the parents are unable or unwilling to carry out their parental responsibility.  It may be necessary to have a change in the Constitution to ensure that this will be possible, or it may be necessary to present draft legislation to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Something that is very much in the news at the moment is the stigma of illegitimacy.  In yesterday's papers we all read that the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace had said there should be changes in the law to have illegitimacy abolished.  The Minister for Justice responded to it in a very positive way by declaring that the Government were committed to its abolition.  This is very welcome news as it will stop many single <Col N="596" /> girls from taking the abortion trail to England because no longer will their children be faced with a lifetime of social exclusion because of their illegitimacy.</P>
    <P>The report stated that at a certain time it should be made known to the child that it has been adopted.  I feel this is something the parents must have some control over.  They should choose the time when to tell the child and not be told that they must tell the child at a certain time.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that many changes have been made in the adoption laws over the years.  Three amending Acts have been passed since 1952, two of them in the seventies, and an amendment to the Constitution to safeguard adoption orders was made also during that period. The submission supplies answers to most of the problems relating to the present adoption system.  It is made by organisations closely involved with the implementation of the system, all recognised as authoritative bodies.  For this reason it should be considered as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes.</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I would refer to a line in his speech where he said &ldquo;I do not like to be critical&rdquo; May I say that I do not like to be critical, but I am going to be?  Firstly, as has been said by many Senators before me, the work done by the organisations responsible for this submission has given them a base of experience and a sense of frustration.  That is very finely contained in the submission, in so far that they have phrased it sensibly: they have noted the sensitivity of many of the recommendations and the teasing out that would be needed, as well as possible constitutional reform.  I think they have done this because of the very human problems and traumas that adoption poses for every person and section involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it amiss that the Minister would use that restraint on their part to criticise them for not suggesting legislation: that is not the role of such voluntary organisations but of a Government.  Successive Governments have failed miserably not alone to produce such legislation.  Not alone did they temporise but they ignored it.  We should be ashamed of the situation <Col N="597" /> we have regarding lack of children's rights, which on the whole are non-existent. In fact, the whole area of adoption that is approached here merely encapsulates our attitude to children.  They are property, they are owned, and the first thing we must consider with regard to any change or reform in the law is how will it affect the ownership, the property right and the sensibilities of adults.</P>
    <P>We have fine phrases in the Constitution, such as treating the children of this nation equally.  I will not go into what has been said already by several Senators. Not alone do we discriminate disgracefully against those children whom we deem illegitimate, but within the adoption laws we make sure that we do not include all the children of the nation by discriminating against legitimate children. In doing so we have failed totally to accept the right of a child to the security and the love that he is entitled to by being born.</P>
    <P>I would also take issue with the Minister for saying that he did not see any real defined recommendations coming through.  In his introduction Senator O'Mahony gave a very comprehensive review of them and I would like to comment on a few of them, perhaps adding a little that I think could be effected almost immediately without alarming the sensibility of anybody.  For instance, the adoption boards could be looked at immediately.  Apart from the funding which is sorely lacking, thus leading to a total denial of skilled trained staff in this all-important area, there should be specific statutory criteria by which the people appointed to the adoption boards would be judged and appointed.  It goes without saying that the staff of such boards should be professionally trained, versed in the law and very supportive in counselling all the people in this very human situation.</P>
    <P>Regarding research, I would like to put forward suggestions in support of the recommendations and of what Senator O'Mahony has said on the need for research which would help everybody involved in drawing up such legislation. The more research we have the better with regard to this.  Perhaps an annual report from each of the adoption societies <Col N="598" /> and boards would help us to evaluate and monitor the situation with regard to the rate of adoptions and the difficulties and problems that the adoption societies are encountering.  We need far more general information about the whole area of adoption.  It is really a closed shop, a mystery to most people, even to couples who would seek to have access to adopting children when they find that they cannot have children of their own.  Many people have come to me and they just do not know where to turn.  They are suffering from the disappointment of not being able to have children of their own.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board should set up a basic minimum standard and code for all adoption societies.  It has been said here again and again, and I reiterate it, that nobody is criticising the adoption societies. However, I think that a certain basic standard and code would help, and I think the societies themselves would welcome it.  Above all, for too long the areas regarding child care have been split up, between one Department and another. For years the voluntary organisations, everybody involved in child care, have requested that all child care services be integrated under one Department.  I welcome the news that at long last these child care services will be under the umbrella of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>I might ask the Minister if I can assume that he has undertaken to establish a committee?  Am I to take it that he has only undertaken this and that the committee has not been established yet in regard to reviewing the existing legal administrative adoption arrangements?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it has not been established yet, but it is the intention of the Government and the Minister for Health to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is years since we produced task force reports and recommendations, since these various organisations were set up.  They have now again sent in their recommendations.  It is really appalling.  I do not agree with the Senators who said we had a great deal of amending legislation dealing with adoption. <Col N="599" /> We had not.  We tinkered with small pieces of it because constitutionally we would be in a very difficult position if we had not done so.  We fought a rearguard action and unfortunately all our reforming legislation seems to be based on panic, stumbling from crisis to crisis with no real look at why we need the reforms and why we should have the courage to make changes in accordance with changes in our society.  That is what has happened.  We have had changes of attitude. We have massive amounts of knowledge of child psychology, and the whole area of the importance of child development, and the implications of the first few years of children's lives.  That research has been done.  We did not do it here but at least we had been able to borrow it from other countries.  We know it exists and we know the evidence is there.  Yet within our reforming legislation there has been a total neglect and ignoring of those fundamental facts.</P>
      <P>Much has been said, and rightly so, about delays in placement.  In some cases there are serious complications for the natural mother who sees it as her right to have her child back, while the adoptive parents declare it is better for the child to remain with them.  Therefore, some legal judgment is needed and the case usually goes to the High Court.  Everyone in this House, including the Minister, is aware of the very high cost of taking a case to the High Court.  Perhaps if he has any influence on the Minister who is about to set up a committee, the Minister of State might ask the Minister to consider whether the legal costs could be undertaken by the State.  Legal costs of thousands of pounds to be met either by the natural mother or by the adoptive parents are unreasonable, and this is not a time when mentally and emotionally people feel they can enter into such a commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must consider very seriously whether the right of the natural mother should be paramount.  There have been cases where the father who was prepared to face up to his paternity responsibilities was totally denied that role because the couple were not married.  As somebody <Col N="600" /> who has fought valiantly on behalf of women, I certainly feel it is discriminatory that the law as it stands cannot recognise the rights of fathers who are prepared to accept their responsibilities. That is an area we will be looking into.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Rourke and other Senators spoke about sensitivity regarding the information which should be given in an adoption situation, and I take the point. One area to which Senator O'Rourke adverted but did not elaborate on will have to be faced up to even though it is an extraordinarily sensitive one.  Other countries had to face up to it and its implications.  Perhaps research would help us.  I refer to the right of an adopted child later on in life to know his or her natural parents' background.  This has arisen in other countries.  It has been said it is important psychologically for such children to be given that information and there is a gap if they have not got it.  This should be explored with all sensitivity having regard to the needs of the child and not our perceived needs or our perceived conditioning.  We will achieve the real reforms we need if we adopt this attitude to the recommendations in this document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clarify a point. The Task Force did not report on adoption. They recommended that a separate committee be set up to consider adoption. The Government have decided to set up that committee.  In regard to costs, in many adoption cases in court, the Attorney General carries the costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back again.  I had the opportunity and the privilege of doing so on the last occasion, and I hope we will not have to go through the same drill again too soon.  However, having said that, I want to comment on the Minister's statement.  If someone is using catch phrases, or slogans or dealing in the safety of generalities it is quite right for the Minister to attack them.  But, having listened to quite a number of debates on this subject, I do not think that has been the case.  It may have been the case outside of this House but certainly not in it.  If we go back to the <Col N="601" /> debates when the 1952 Act and the 1972 Act were being amended we will find that there were some constructive debates and some very worthwhile suggestions.</P>
      <P>On the question of hastening slowly, I agree this is a difficult and complex area. We have to bear in mind that we can also hasten too slowly.  The fact that you amend Acts does not mean you are moving rapidly.  It means you have taken some steps.  I take issue with the suggestion that three amending Acts indicate that we have made great progress.  It means we passed three amending Acts and made some progress and whether that progress is sufficient is a matter for debate.</P>
      <P>The system is very complex with all the problems inherent in it, particularly those of the adoptive parents.  Once attitudes are taken up, either by the parent or the person who is surrendering a child to a home or to someone else, they are not easily changed.  In this very sensitive area it is hard to say positively whether any real progress can be made towards alleviating all the problems highlighted in the submission.  When we are thinking about this submission and urging that some action should be taken on it, we should remember that 11 years ago a proposal was made to the then Government on the question of research.  If it had been carried out with speed, I am sure it would have solved many of the problems we are now dealing with or made them less acute and we would not be haggling about the rate of progress made.  The question is whether enough research was done since 1952.  There has been no survey I know of despite proposals to the then Government to have a survey carried out.  Modified proposals were made by the Government but not as the result of a survey such as that proposed 11 years ago.  Proposals were formulated that the Adoption Board, the Department of Health and the Department of Justice should be restructured.  I do not think anything effective was achieved in that respect.  I cannot see any real evidence of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to see the Government taking a decision to transfer responsibility for this matter to the Department of Health.  I am delighted about this.  This is <Col N="602" /> the area where it belongs, and more progress can be made there.  The whole matter can be given a better profile in the Department of Health, but it cannot be dealt with as easily as the other social services under that Department.  This report has helped to identify problems and difficulties which families may face in adopting children.</P>
    <P>The real question is whether there has been a fully informed review and whether that review will result in a restrictive formulation of proposals.  I do not wish to make any judgments in advance.  There is always that danger, particularly having regard to the sensitivity of the matter we are dealing with.  It is a matter of very grave concern.  It has been around for a long time.  We have tried to do something. For some reason when we get into sensitive areas of social legislation we seem to be more hesitant than they are in other countries.  Other countries seem to be able to make more progress.  I know there is a particular problem with regard to the position of the churches and so on. In this day and age we cannot have it said that our legislation in this sensitive area measures up to that in other countries.  I will give one instance.  The courts cannot rule in favour of somebody adopting outside the jurisdiction.  If somebody adopts in Japan, for example, there is no way that the courts can give full authority for that adoption.  That area has not been dealt with.</P>
    <P>I mentioned research.  Research should be ongoing.  It should be a permanent feature of the system when we are dealing with sensitive areas.  If we claim that we want to keep the performance of the system at a high standard we must assess the situation and be continually on the ball. We must introduce the necessary proposals, not to remedy all the problems but to make them less acute until finally we can get into a much healthier situation.</P>
    <P>Mixed marriages present a problem. This is very unfair, and it is another area to which we could give attention.  I hope the committee to be set up by the Minister for Health will have a look at this area of concern.  On the whole question of exclusions from wills the submission goes as far as it can in the recommendations, <Col N="603" /> but the adopted child does not seem to have any real rights in this area. In fact it is doubtful whether the law is clear enough on the question of whether after the death of an adoptive parent the child has full rights.  The child will have an awful job to establish his or her rights to inherit.  I do not know of any case history but I believe that to be the situation. I am not a lawyer but my reading of the situation is that it present difficulties.</P>
    <P>These are some of the areas which need clarification.  Most of the other Senators have dealt with the submissions in a broader sense.  Sufficient initiative has been taken by this House in putting down this motion and debating it to urge that there should be no delay in setting up the committee and no unnecessary delay in coming back to this House with an amending Bill to improve the situation. The problems in this area are very painful and difficult and I do not wish to add to them by raising any issues.  That would not be right but, at the same time, it is not right to let existing situations stand which might put pressure on parents to allow adoption.  There is an element of that.  I should like the committee to think about that, apart from the problem of the withdrawal of consent.  There is a certain amount of pressure on parents who are about to give their child for adoption and this presents problems too.  The time limit on the natural mother for withdrawal of consent is another problem.  I am not competent to take a view on whether the High Court should dispense with the mother's right to withdraw consent.  I will not enter into that area.  There are many good minds around and I hope these people will find their way onto the committees when they are set up.  There are many people with degrees in law, the social sciences and so on, who can deal with very delicate and sensitive areas like this.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Leader of the House for allowing the motion last week. He re-arranged the programme to suit us, to get this motion down, and we in the Labout Party are very grateful for that.  It is necessary for this type of motion to come before the House.  Here we can <Col N="604" /> get away to a large degree from the emotive politics which might distract us from the real meaning of the motions put down to be discussed.  I should like to go on record as thanking the Leader of the House for making this arrangement.  He did the same in the previous Seanad.  This was good for the Seanad and for the debates.  I am grateful to have had this opportunity to speak.  I urge the Minister for Health to allow no unnecessary delays in setting up this committee.  It is a very sensitive area.  Sometimes it is disturbing to hear what adoptive parents had to go through.</P>
    <P>We should not have these types of problems.  We should see how far we can go towards facilitating not only the adoptive parents &mdash; even though I have concentratedon them &mdash; but everybody concerned with this delicate question.  I wonder whether the Adoption Board are the right body.  I am not criticising them. In changing world circumstances, in changing situations throughout Europe and with the updating of the adoption laws in other countries, I wonder would a shift of some powers to the High Court make the situation better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one or two short points on the report and the response by the Minister.  May I thank the Minister for his kind remarks addressed to both Senator Mallon and myself?  In this document there are the essential ingredients for advance in the whole area of adoption in Ireland.  It begs the question as to why it has taken so long to get to this point.  I have the viewpoint which applies North of the Border as well as South, that we are a male dominated and church orientated society. I feel certain from some of the remarks made here today that the things which have blocked the discussions about these sensitive issues are the same things which block the unlocking of the swings in Northern Ireland on a Sunday afternoon, or finding a tennis court that has not got a padlock on it on a Sunday afternoon.  I am not here from the North to condemn you in similar respects but you can use your imagination and guess what I am driving at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> I welcome the proposal that illegitimacy should be done away with.  It is very late in the day to be discussing the plight of adoption for a couple who happen to have joined in love from the opposite traditions and have created an intermarriage of the two traditions in Ireland. That, to my mind, is what we should be all striving to achieve.  I hope that not only will there be sensitivity but that there will be a great encouragement for such couples to adopt Irish children into their loving care regardless of what religious denomination they were born into. As Senator Ryan has said, the most important thing is that children should be brought up in homes where there is love and care, and where they have an opportunity to find themselves as citizens of this nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has undertaken to establish a committee.  When we discuss the problem of drug addiction in Ireland the last person we consider bringing onto the committee is a person who has been or is at present afflicted with drugs.  When we discuss the problem of the prisoner and the prison, the last person to be considered in the discussions in all committees and boards is the person most affected by the problem being discussed, namely, the prisoner.  In this context we have natural parents, adoptive parents and children who have been adopted.  I hope the Minister in composing his committee will consider the possibility of having on it representatives of people who have been adopted, of adoptive parents and the natural parents of children who were taken from them or who gave them into the care of adoption authorities.  I should like to commend the report once again. Although the phrase <i>festina lente</i> sounds well, it does not commend itself to this Senator.  In Ireland there has been a lot of <i>festina lente.</i>  I would prefer the phrase <i>festina celerrime.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too should like to welcome the Minister of State to our debate.  I should like to compliment those who put forward this motion on adoption. As of now, we do not regard adoption as normal a procedure as we ought to do.  Too often we regard adoption as <Col N="606" /> something very different.  We must normalise the situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> adoption.  I agree with what Senator Robb said on the religious aspect.  In no circumstances should religion present a barrier or problem in the whole area of adoption. This should constitute a major part of any examination or study to be carried out.</P>
      <P>An important point which was not mentioned in the debate is the question of the age of the adoptive parents.</P>
      <P>At present the age of the mother proposing to adopt a child must not be more than 40 years and the age of the father must not be more than 45 years.  That is a fairly rigidly applied rule.  I am acquainted with some circumstances which are and have been directly affected by this.  I would urge very strongly that flexibility should exist in this area.  I support the concept that some control mechanism is necessary.  At the same time we cannot afford to have a break-off point of, say, 40 years and one day and 45 years and one day.  Many children have been reared very successfully by grandparents, uncles, aunts, and so on, who were well over that age, so the question of age should not be a barrier any more than religion.  I know many people who would be ideal parents.  Taking into account the fact that couples must be married for three years before approaching the adoption process, it is very easy for a person to be excluded on the grounds of age.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; should be put aside.  It is an unfortunate way of describing children.  There must be another way to describe children born out of wedlock. It puts them in a category of their own. While, from a legal point of view, the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; is probably most descriptive, I am sure there is some substitute for it which would be legally effective and less hurtful to all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that we must never forget.  That is, that adoption involves three major parties, the adoptive parents, the natural mother and the child itself.  It is a very emotive sort of area where one is tinkering with feelings. It must be very carefully monitored because if it is mishandled and procedures <Col N="607" /> are not carried out correctly, it can have lasting adverse effects on the relationship between the adoptive parents and the child and on the natural mother. This whole area requires a very high degree of skill.</P>
    <P>I also would support the concept of putting this whole area of adoption under the Department of Health.  In that Department the area of adoption would warrant the involvement of the highest degree of expertise available in the whole area of psychology and related matters. This should not be overlooked because it is a highly sensitive area.</P>
    <P>Many points have been made already. An important one made by one Senator was the question of informing the child that he or she was adopted.  This, again, is a delicate area and has to be handled extremely carefully.  I would support that point of view very fully.</P>
    <P>The motion that we are discussing this afternoon has been put forward by six very responsible and caring organisations &mdash; The Federation of Services to Unmarried Parents and their Children, The Central Council of Catholic Adoption Societies, Children First, Adoptive Parents Association of Ireland, Care and, finally, Cherish.  There is no doubt but that they have put forward the problems.  Perhaps not all the answers are included in the submission.  But a body or committee that is appropriate to go into the greatest depth possible ought to be established. We must approach adoption as a more natural sort of development, take it as something that happens and not look aghast at an adoptive situation.</P>
    <P>There is one other important question, the question of inheritance.  At the moment, a child born out of wedlock is excluded totally from any inheritance. This needs attention and correction.</P>
    <P>The other point is, I also believe that legitimate children, those born within wedlock, should qualify for adoption because there are many very large families where the parents would welcome the opportunity of having their child placed for adoption.  Again that is sensitive; the full and total consent of the parents must be available.  We must be <Col N="608" /> extremely careful about this suggestion of removing the consent of the mother in an adoptive situation because it is a very traumatic experience for a mother who happens to be unmarried to have a child and that mother is entitled to have a say, up to a point where it becomes illogical that she should have.  Every avenue has got to be explored in taking account of that person's feelings.</P>
    <P>The only other comment I would like to make is on the question of the age limit of the child to be adopted.  At present the age limit is seven years.  Again, I do not think that that should be a rigid figure; there should be room for some manoeuvre there.</P>
    <P>I fully support this motion.  I would like to compliment those persons who brought forward the motion and I would like to thank the Minister for being with us and for his very elucidating and enlightening comments which he circulated to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank those Senators who spoke on the motion. Almost all, if not all, were positive about it.  Some had some qualifications to make about the submission and the proposal contained in it.  But most people felt on the whole positive and that we should do something in this area.</P>
      <P>The exception was the Minister speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice. I was deeply depressed about that contribution. I thought it reflected a very defensive attitude and I thought it was not really very helpful at all in the context of what we were trying to do.  In so far as it reflects the longrun policy of the Department of Justice it does indicate the correctness of the argument made by many people about the imperative need to move the legislation dealing with adoption out of that Department and into a Department which is more concerned with the development of personal social services and child care services generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am still not clear what is intended in relation to the transfer of responsibility for adoption to the Minister for Health. I am sure that will be spelt out in time. But it seems from the comments made by the Minister that it is unlikely that any <Col N="609" /> proposals for reform in relation to adoption will take place in the context of the proposed Children's Bill.  That is deeply regrettable.  The Minister's comments either mean that or they mean that this proposed Children's Bill will not materialise for a considerable period ahead. That, too, would be regrettable.</P>
    <P>As I said in the very beginning, it was not my intention to be in the least partisan about this matter because it is too important and affects too many vulnerable people for any of us to partisan.  But I feel strongly that the comments made by the Minister on behalf of the Minister for Justice, who was not able to be with us today, are deeply distressing.  On the one hand, it is conceded by the Minister that there are humanitarian reasons why legitimate children should be available for adoption, but he then goes on to say that the reason we cannot do anything about this is because we cannot guarantee eliminating collusion between natural and adoptive parents.  That seems incredible. What we are really saying is that we are prepared to continue to condone a situation in which children, because they are children of parents married to each other but who have been abandoned, as is the case frequently, are put into longterm residential care, and their parents have no intention, expectation or wish whatsoever to provide them with a decent life, and they cannot be available for adoption.  What is happening here is that, although the principle that the welfare of the child is the first and paramount consideration is enshrined in the 1974 Act, there is no commitment to its implementation and to living up to the principle which that suggests.  This matter has been discussed widely enough and often enough among all kinds of people concerned and skilled in the area of adoption, and the matter is now capable of being dealt with because at the end of the day it is the courts which will make the decision about adoption.  We cannot put precise criteria into legislation but we can provide the courts with the option of making decisions based on knowledge and based on skilled support from social workers and others.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response on the issue of <Col N="610" /> consent or dispensation with consent is also unduly stringent and unhelpful. Introducing the red herring about what we do about the children of itinerants is really to introduce a side issue and to avoid the real question of what do we do about parents who, while abandoning all contribution towards their children's welfare, at the same time attempt in some way to retain a nominal relationship with them, and is deeply regrettable.</P>
    <P>It seems that there is a positive will to make progress here, but on the basis of what the Minister has said I am not very hopeful about early progress.  I regret that deeply, as most of us do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní bheidh an méid sin ag teastáil, tá súil agam</P>
      <P>The matter here concerns the cancellation by the Department of a special course which had been going on since 1976 and was being carried on in various centres.  My concern is particularly with Mary Immaculate College of Education in Limerick.  The course was being offered to university graduates who wished to qualify as primary teachers. Now the whole idea of offering this extra topping up, so to speak, to the graduates of universities was so that they could qualify as primary teachers.</P>
      <P>There were two motives which obtained in 1976 when the scheme was introduced.  One was to move in some direction towards improving the pupil-teacher ratio and the other was to offer an additional employment opportunity, albeit marginal, to university graduates. There was a third element involved.  It was not necessarily present in the minds of those who implemented the scheme. But it was certainly a very desirable side effect of the scheme.  By putting university graduates into a training college one did something towards bridging the gap which has always obtained between the primary and secondary levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last few years there have been, from the point of view of those who are concerned about this, sinister signs that this scheme was being curtailed.  In the year 1980-81 25 students had taken the course in Our Lady of Mercy College, Blackrock and that was discontinued altogether in 1981-82, and in the same academic year the number of places offered dropped from 120 to 50 in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra and from 23 to 10 in Mary Immaculate College, Limerick.  That was the position up to the spring of this year, leaving Mary Immaculate as the only training centre outside Dublin which continued to offer this facility.  On 27 March 1982 the matter came up for discussion at an Irish Federation of University Teachers conference in Galway where it was raised from the floor, where the Minister was present and concern was expressed at the drift which was by then evident.  My information is that the Minister responded sympathetically, <Col N="612" /> but not being very long in the hot seat at that stage he was obviously guarded in his response.  But it was suggested that perhaps written submissions could be made to him.  Then suddenly the axe fell on Mary Immaculate College. With no warning and so soon after the Minister indicated he was prepared to discuss the matter it was conveyed to the president of the college that the course would be discontinued forthwith. That happened on April 2, only a few days after the discussion in Galway.  It was only within days also of a submission by the people concerned.  On 31 March they wrote to the Minister and made their case.  Then suddenly on 2 April the president of the Mary Immaculate College in Limerick was informed that the course would be discontinued.  This has given rise to widespread dissatisfaction among the staff in the Mary Immaculate College and among the Association of Professional Staffs in the Colleges of Education.</P>
    <P>The manner of the conveying of the decision is as much a matter of concern as the decision arrived at, because it is felt that the whole thing illustrates very clearly the lack of consultation there is between the Department of Education and the staffs at the training colleges, not simply on this matter, but on the levels of intake of their ordinary student teachers. So, I bring up this motion in order to highlight on their behalf the sense of unease felt and to hope that the decision may be reversed.  They feel that the Minister was himself presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> in this matter and that the decision to discontinue the course had already been made while he in Galway was promising to look into the matter, that in fact it was probably a decision which had carried over from the previous administration.  Senators may have seen a letter to the newspapers on this topic, and in that it was stated that the matter of great importance, namely the cancellation of the course, was communicated to the president of Mary Immaculate by a relatively junior official.  I do not think we should make too much of this because I am sure that really represents a cordial and continuing communication by a principal officer with the heads of the colleges <Col N="613" /> concerned.  But what we should note is that it was made without warning, without consultation and at a time of year when the planning of courses for the coming academic year is already at an advanced stage.  So, on the face of it it would seem to be a particularly notable piece of bumbledom.</P>
    <P>It raises wider issues, of course.  It now means that St. Patrick's is the only place where this facility is being offered, and this means that the principle of regionalism, of decentralisation, which in the whole thrust of administration is supposed to be so important to Government policy, is ignored.  I am not just talking of the present administration; in recent years the whole thrust of administration is the decentralisation of various services, and this decision seems to run absolutely contrary to that.  By the way, the Minister's letter in response to the protest which arose was, I might say, laconic in the extreme.  It simply said that curtailment of recruitment to graduate courses was necessary to secure a reasonable balance between the output of qualified national teachers in the colleges of education and the availability of employment in national schools; in other words, there was a crude criterion of supply and demand.  If the letter was brief to the point of being laconic it was also, I may suggest, disingenuous in its concluding sentence when it said &ldquo;Consultation on questions of recruitment and related matters is undertaken on an ongoing basis with the presidents of the Colleges.&rdquo;  That may be strictly true at the level of a principal officer communicating with the president.  It is not true in any real bilateral consultation about policy.  The Minister's reply by no means allayed the sense of grievance which the whole thing gave rise to.</P>
    <P>There may be a case in pure terms of retrenchment, pure terms of economy, for the step taken.  But it does not seem to make any sense to continue it in St. Patrick's in the centralised metropolitan area and discontinue it in Limerick.  In other words the continuation of the course in Limerick would have made as much economic sense as the present situation and would have made a much <Col N="614" /> greater deal of sound regional sense, because it means that graduates of UCC and UCG who supply the overwhelming preponderance of those taking advantage of the course are now being grievously disadvantaged.  Since many of these people would be married persons hoping to change or improve their lot perhaps they have even less chance of coming to Dublin to avail of the remaining facilities. The people in Limerick complain, with some justification, that the educational service at Mary Immaculate is diminished by this step in that the graduate body of students, small in number perhaps &mdash; they began with 40 in 1976 and set against the total student body in Mary Immaculate they might be no more than perhaps 8 or 9 per cent &mdash; represented an important leaven in that little academic community; it was a mixing of different experiences. These graduates comprise not only BAs.  I am saying that in case one thinks it was the same kind of academic background.  These graduates came from different academic disciplines and they would have represented, no matter how small, a benefit to the economy as well as to the educational experience of Mary Immaculate College.</P>
    <P>Tá rud amháin eile chomh maith.  Tá fhios ag éinne go bhfuil baint aige leis na coláisití traenála go gcuirtear béim faoi leith sa Choláiste i Luimneach ar an dteanga agus ar an chultúr Gaeilge.  Ní hé rud é seo go bhfuil aon chur i gcéill ag baint leis.  Éinne go bhfuil taithí aige ar an gcoláiste agus a théann ann go rialta agus go bhfuil deileáil aige leis an bhfoireann tuigfidh sé go bhfuil an díograis sin ann i leith na Gaeilge.  Bhí bhaint nár bheag ag an dream seo céimithe a bhí ag freastal ar an chúrsa.  Thugadar san ana-chabhair agus an-chuidiú don ethos Gaeilge atá chomh láidir san sa Choláiste.</P>
    <P>So on all kinds of grounds I suggest that this a retrogressive decision, and I must say that it is disappointing that the Minister does not seem to have responded to the protests which were made or to have addressed himself to the important educational and professional issues which have been raised by the whole decision.  It has been bad for morale in Mary Immaculate and in the <Col N="615" /> other training colleges by extension, and it does not mean that existing resources are going to be utilised more rationally. Let me here take the opportunity of paying tribute to the training colleges and to the one I know extremely well, Mary Immaculate, because University College Cork has a very close association with Mary Immaculate Training College. They are committed quite altruistically to educational reform.  Next Monday morning, for example, I am going to be opening a course for about 500 primary teachers who are doing an in-service refresher course.  Mary Immaculate's commitment to all these things is affected, no matter how marginally, by what is widely regarded as a regressive decision.  So, I would ask the Minister to consider reversing the decision and, at the very least, on this occasion to elaborate on the rather curt explanation which was given in his letter of 31 March.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Education (Professor O'Donoghue) Minister for Education (Professor O'Donoghue)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that Senator Murphy is raising in saying that it probably is very difficult for those involved in a particular institution to understand or accept when changes are thrust upon them in a rather cursory or peremptory way.  He did make the point that this arose comparatively soon after the change of Government.  Perhaps I could clear that aspect of it.  Naturally I could not be familar with all the issues, all the aspects that were likely to arise for decision within a matter of a couple of weeks after assuming office.  There were some other matters that were taking up quite a lot of time in the educational area at that time.  I did assume when the matter was raised verbally in Galway at the end of March that there would be time to look at these things in some more leisurely way, to have adequate consultations and discussions.  But on referring back I discovered that it was the sort of area where if one was to take any action for the academic year 1982-83 it was in the interests of the colleges concerned that they should know as quickly as possible what that decision was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="616" /> It became apparent that there should be some cutback in the numbers going on for teacher training, and specifically that raised the question of whether one should make the cutback on the ordinary three-year course for students going through the College of Education for the B.Ed. degree or whether there should be a reduction in the numbers admitted to this one-year post graduate course.  I will discuss the pros and cons of that later.  I felt it was right to agree to a further reduction in the graduate intake.  There had been reduction in the previous year, which incidentally had resulted in a third college being asked to withdraw from this type of graduate course.</P>
    <P>As to the rather curt or peremptory nature of the communication, I would like to have had more time.  I should point out that this transpired during Holy Week and there was no possibility of arranging any sort of more normal meeting and consultation for a matter of at least two weeks, because Easter week was taken up with holidays, teacher conferences and so forth.  Rightly or wrongly I felt it was better to communicate a decision quickly to give the maximum time to the college.  As to the reasons for it, we have been hearing a great deal from many people about the need to economise on Government spending, to learn to live within our means, to try to make the best use of limited resources and so forth, and this has to apply to education as much as to any other area.</P>
    <P>Looking then at the relative pressures that are coming on education, it is fair to say that there has been a slowing down in the growth of pupil numbers.  While there is some further modest expansion in pupil numbers it is a quite small one. Larger pressures in terms of numbers are still occurring at the post primary and third level.  In the primary area I emphasise that a very substantial improvement in the teaching strength, and therefore some significant improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio at that level, had taken place over the previous four years since 1977.  We must slow down that improvement because there is not the financial scope to afford that type of continued <Col N="617" /> progress for the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>Then it becomes appropriate to look at the numbers who are entering training. Surely it would be wrong to allow numbers of young people to go into training courses in the expectation that there would be teaching posts available for them at the completion of their training if in fact that will not be the case.  The numbers available show that for the first time, over the past year or so, a surplus of primary teachers has emerged.  Several hundred of last year's graduates from the colleges were not able to find teaching posts.  That situation was likely to become much worse over the next two to three years if nothing were done to curb or slow down the intake to the colleges. That is the background against which the decision was taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy pointed out that the numbers entering this post primary course had been reduced over the previous year as well.  The decision to make a further reduction then raised the question of whether one should concentrate the remaining intake, the proposed 30 places for 1982/83, in Dublin or in Limerick.  Senator Murphy has made the argument about the decentralisation, and it is very much a matter of Government policy to encourage and support decentralisation where possible.  I do not think that can be the only criterion, and, in fairness to St. Patrick's College, it has been operating on a much larger scale for many years past both in the three-year B. Ed. course and also in provision of these one-year courses.  In effect, the reduction for St. Patrick's is relatively speaking as severe, indeed more severe, than the reduction now being asked of Mary Immaculate College in Limerick.  Both colleges are being asked to make a cut-back and I do not think the cutback in the case of Mary Immaculate is any more severe in its overall impact on the college than the one in St Patrick's, Drumcondra.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put forward that in some sense the presence of a group of graduate students has a beneficial impact on the general life and activity of the college, but while that may be so I <Col N="618" /> doubt if one would argue that that would be significant looking at a group as small as ten.  Perhaps it is so, but it would be a difficult point to establish.  While if all other things were equal it is the sort of factor that one might allow to tilt the scales, I do not think that in the context of the overall decision that of itself would be sufficient to decide the matter.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that while it is always unpleasant to have to contemplate curbs, cutbacks, restrictions and so forth, nonetheless when they become necessary they should be faced and undertaken as fairly as possible.  I believe that we have acted fairly and reasonably in deciding on the proposed activities for the various training colleges.  I would wish that it was not so and that we were in a happier overall situation when we could afford not only to continue but preferably to expand the sorts of training courses, but that is not the practical situation which we face nor is it likely to be the case for several years to come.  It is better to face up to that situation and to ask the colleges to adapt their level of activity to the more restricted climate which is likely to prevail for the years ahead.  The fact that the course is only being offered in Dublin does not mean that students from various parts of the country cannot avail of it. There will be maintenance grants available, including a boarding grant element, to meet the costs of the students who are not living in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>No, but in the context of overall provision it is right to move towards a scaling down.  There is no point in seeking to sustain a programme of courses if you do not have the student intake to justify them.  We would find that over a period of time it is financially more attractive.  I would also argue that it is educationally more appropriate to think in terms of offering courses where there is a reasonable student body to avail of them.  It is not in anyone's interest to maintain courses with artificially small numbers.  I do not think that is good for morale.</P>

      <P>The facilities and staffing would be there for the other students of the college.  If that helps the college not only to sustain but perhaps to strengthen the nature of the provision which it can make for those, so much the better.</P>

    <P>The overall point must be that there will be a smaller intake of teachers into the primary system for a number of years ahead.  The rate of growth will not be as rapid as it has been in recent years. Therefore there must be a corresponding slowing down in the numbers entering the training colleges.  The reduction of ten students which we are talking about here is quite a small fraction of the overall reduction which is taking place in absolute numbers.  The cut-back means in terms of St. Patrick's College that they have come down from something like 110 two years ago to 50 and now to 30.  At the basic three-year course level there will be a slowing down of the order of several hundreds over a two to three-year period.  While I recognise the reasons which give rise to this motion, I would <Col N="620" /> find it difficult to do anything to alter the decision.  I would not see scope for any growth in the intake of students to training courses for at least several years.</P>
