      <P>I have noticed from Senator Brendan Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The continuing delay in the provision of proper custodial care for homeless children and children at risk.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann considers that, from the first day of sitting after the Summer recess&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  if the exigencies of business allow, motions other than Government motions should be taken at 7 p.m. on each Wednesday on which the Seanad sits; and</P>
      <P>(2)  in determining the order of priority in which such motions should be taken regard should be had to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  rotation between different groupings, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the availability of the Ministers concerned: provided that a motion not necessarily involving a statement of Government policy may be proceeded with without a Minister being in attendance.</P>

      <P>Fáiltim go croíúil roimh an tairscint seo dar gcion is céim buail ar aghaidh é i gnó an tSeanaid.  I think this proposed item of business is very important in that it is the first time that Seanad Éireann will have Private Members' Time every week, virtually. This is a radical new departure.  We must thank the Leader of the House for his willingness to meet the wishes of those of us who were pressing for this and indeed his ingenuity in devising this kind of solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Senator Murphy has said.  The proposed changes are much to be wished for and will greatly improve the running of the Seanad.  With him I should like to congratulate <Col N="712" /> the Leader of the House on the motion and say that I fully support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I also would like to associate myself with the remarks made by Senators Murphy and West in welcoming this innovation.  There are a large number of motions on the Order Paper and I think there will be even more very shortly.  I imagine that we will, in the next session, be able to get through a large proportion of these.  It is indicative of the fact that the Leader of the House is allaying the suspicions of some of us that he was not taking the Seanad seriously and that he was, perhaps, pushing too much legislation through too fast.  I would like to congratulate him on this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges who discussed this innovation, I would like to thank the Leader of the House for his co-operation in trying to ensure that Private Members get a fair share of the time available in this House.  I had reservations about the time and I proposed 5 o'clock but 7 o'clock was agreed upon. However, on an evening like this evening, when you have agreed to accept a matter on the Adjournment, that would not apply, as that would take precedence over this innovation.  However, it is a step forward and we should keep this matter open to constant review so the Members may feel that they have the fullest possible opportunity to contribute in this House on matters other than legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, want to support this motion.  I think that the feeling is that we should endeavour on an on-going basis to improve the effectiveness of the House and to endeavour to provide for as many motions and discussions in the House as possible.  I can appreciate the proposal of the Leader of the House to reduce time allowed for individual Member's contributions.  Perhaps it may prove to be that little bit short but if it is I am sure it will be possible to go back to the Committee on Procedures and Privileges to see if we can amend it or change it. From a personal point of view, I would have liked to have seen the introduction <Col N="713" /> of a list system for speakers on motions where the Cathaoirleach could ascertain before the Order of Business how many Senators propose to speak on a motion. Some motions might attract a small number of speakers only and some might be contributed to by every Senator.</P>
      <P>On the very first motion in the previous Seanad I think 54 or 55 speakers out of the 60 spoke.  I know from my experience in the European Parliament that it was necessary to register one's desire to speak, a list was put up and one also saw the order in which one was to speak.  The time factor was important.  This motion is designed to improve our present situation and will afford each and every Member of the House a better opportunity of having any proposal aired in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, from the first day of sitting after the Summer recess, notwithstanding anything contained in Standing Orders in relation to motions other than Government motions, the speech of a Senator proposing such a motion shall not exceed twenty minutes; the Senator proposing, or such other Senator who has not already spoken as he may authorise in that behalf, shall be entitled to ten minutes for a speech in reply; and the speech of any other Senator in the course of the debate shall not exceed ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should say a few words about this.  The reason that the time allowed has been shortened is not certainly in any effort to stop people from saying all they want to say but to have regard to the fact that three hours is the time allowed for a motion.  That means, under the existing system, that if you allow for the proposer, and possibly for an intervention by the Minister, there is probably time for only eight Members of the House to speak. There are many motions coming before the House on which more than eight Members would want to speak.  For that <Col N="714" /> reason it is proposed and recommended by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that the time should be shortened to ten minutes and in that way permit many more Members to speak on a particular motion.  It is a provisional change. It can be reviewed in due course, but I think it is worth trying for a while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Leader of the House has indicated that this is, in a sense, a trial.  There are Members of this House who find it difficult really to get warmed up in less than five minutes and they might indeed find that ten minutes is rather restrictive.  It is something that we should look at.  It may well be that if we do find it restrictive we could revert to the 15 minutes and extend the three hours to four hours so as not to be confined to a number of speakers.  Of course, this would have the disadvantage of spreading out a debate more.  What has been proposed by the committee is the proper thing.  Let us experiment and find out, by trial, what the best arrangement will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is a matter for experimentation.  As Senator Dooge has said, some Senators are barely warmed up after ten minutes.  It is true, at the other end, that some speakers can be shut up only with great difficulty after 15 minutes.  Although as a member of the committee, I went along with the time limit suggested here, I am not terribly happy about it.  I think that ten minutes is unduly restrictive.  Of course I am aware that some people with elephantine memories can recall that some years ago I said that anything worth saying could be said in ten minutes.  It is one of those famous last phrases that one lives to be abashed about.  But then we have famous precedents for that: an Irish speaker of immortal memory lived to preside over Irish politics for 40 years after he had said that no matter what happened he was so sick and tired of politics he was going to quit immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite what Senators Ryan and Dooge have said it has been my experience, on most Private Motions, that there is a kind of a natural time-span <Col N="715" /> within which people adjust themselves. There were very few motions when three hours was not enough and most speakers do not take up their 15 minutes.  I welcome this motion.  I think we should look at the ten minutes specification very tentatively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have anything further to say.  As I said, this is temporary, we can look at it again and, if it is found to be unduly restrictive then we can revert to 15 minutes.  I have not got any strong feelings on it but I think it is worth trying.</P>

    <Title>Irish Steel Holdings Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1982: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my first visit to this Seanad and I look forward to the discussions that will take place here.  I hope to be as accommodating and as forthcoming as possible with all Senators.</P>
      <P>The main purposes of the Bill are to increase the authorised share capital of Irish Steel Limited from £25 million to £50 million; to provide, as a consequence, a similar increase in the value of shares which the Minister for Finance may take up; and to provide for an increase in the limit on the Ministerial guarantee of company borrowings from £60 million to £75 million.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel Limited are a wholly State-owned company, whose principal activity is the manufacture of steel from scrap. The steel products made are mainly used in the construction industry.  The company's only other activity is the manufacture of galvanised sheet of the type used for farm buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider it appropriate at this point to give some background to the present state of the company, which creates the <Col N="716" /> need for this Bill to restructure Irish Steel's finances.</P>
    <P>Up to Ireland's Accession to the EEC, Irish Steel operated with marginal profits, behind a protective tariff wall.  Their production capacity at that stage was small, only about 150,000 tonnes and was aimed at supplying the needs of the Irish market only.  Exports took place from time to time but the quantity exported was very small and was directed almost entirely at the UK market.</P>
    <P>By the mid-seventies, it had become clear that the company could no longer maintain their traditional operation.  The dismantling of the protective tariffs meant that European producers, some of whom are amongst the world's most efficient, now had free access to the Irish market.  In these circumstances, Irish Steel's plant was not modern or efficient enough to compete.  The company commissioned a Canadian engineering firm to draw up a plan for the physical restructuring of the plant.  Work on implementing this plan began in 1978.</P>
    <P>The old plant was almost totally replaced, and production capacity was increased from 150,000 tonnes of crude steel to 345,000 tonnes, equivalent to about 300,000 tonnes of finished product. The new plant consists of an electric furnace, melting 114 tonnes of scrap to produce 90 tonnes of steel every two to three hours, a continuous casting machine, and a specially designed rolling mill which can produce bars which are round, angular or flanged in cross-section in dimensions from 12mm thickness to 120mm, and up to 70 metres long.</P>
    <P>The project is now complete in all essentials, and its final cost is estimated to be £80 million.  This is accounted for as £64 million for fixed assets and capitalised interest, and £16 million for additional working capital.</P>
    <P>The actual cost of fixed assets and pre-production expenses, at £64 million, is more than double the original estimate, which the Government approved in February, 1977.  The resulting level of debt is an additional handicap on the company in their efforts to attain viability.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the cost increases are many, the principal ones being the fact <Col N="717" /> that the orginal estimate was based on a general design concept rather than of firm tenders; and the need, after work began, to modify extensively the design in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>The level of cost increase is a serious cause for concern, but the fact remains that the extra costs have already been incurred and the problem now is to deal with their consequences.</P>
    <P>The cost of the project is itself only one of the costs incurred by Irish Steel, although it is the major one.  In addition, the company have suffered losses since 1974 due, firstly, to the obsolescence of the old plant, secondly, because it was necessary to suspend production for 18 months during the installation of the new equipment and, finally, since July 1981 losses have occurred while running in the new plant and attempting to break into export markets.  Accumulated losses at 30 June 1982 are about £49 million, of which £22.8 million was incurred in the past year.</P>
    <P>The combined effects of the project cost and losses can be seen from the financial state of the company.  At 30 June 1982, the unaudited balance sheet of the company shows assets of about £69 million, financed by share capital of £25 million; grant capital of £29 million; loans of £64 million; less accumulated losses of £49 million.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel will need a further £11 million in loans to enable them to operate up to the end of the year.  Their ability to obtain this finance is heavily dependent on the enactment of legislation to enable the Minister for Industry and Energy to guarantee further loans.  As the existing guaranteeing limit of £60 million has been reached, the limit must be raised.</P>
    <P>Increasing the amount of borrowing which may be guaranteed will not of itself solve the company's problems.  The burden of debt is too large to allow the company to make profits, and fundamental financial restructuring is clearly necessary. The full extent and form of restructuring required is not yet clear due to a number of factors, market prospects being the major one.</P>
    <P>The world steel markets are very depressed at present, and Europe is in a <Col N="718" /> particularly bad situation.  It is estimated that the over-capacity for steel production in Europe is now 30 million tonnes per year.  This situation arose partly because the steel industry has never recovered from the oil crisis of 1974-75 &mdash; and indeed the latter one in 1979 &mdash; and partly because of increasing competition from countries such as Japan, Korea and Brazil, who have newer, more modern steel plants, and often have cheaper labour and energy.</P>
    <P>It may seem strange that Irish Steel increased their production capacity at a time when great overcapacity already existed.  This apparent anomaly arose because the type of plant chosen by the company, while it is the most modern available, cannot operate viably below the size chosen by Irish Steel.  This minimum size was over twice the size of the company's old plant.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to comment on the level of competition from countries outside the EEC.  These imports are causing great problems in Europe, particularly this year.  Indeed, Irish Steel themselves suffered from the importation into Ireland of 11,000 tonnes of reinforcing bars from Argentina in the early part of this year.  The reason for the present glut of third country imports is that the world steel market is so depressed that producers try to achieve sales at almost any price, while the European producers, in an attempt to ensure their survival, raised their prices on 1 January 1982, thus giving the third country producers greater scope for exporting to the EEC.</P>
    <P>The EEC's trade relationships are complex and delicate.  It is not possible to prevent imports without jeopardising exports, and since the EEC is a net exporter of about 13 million tonnes a year, it is obviously necessary to be careful in this area.  The same reasoning applies in Ireland's case, as Irish Steel will need to export some 70 per cent of the 250,000 tonnes they will produce when running at full capacity.</P>
    <P>The only way to counteract imports, therefore, is within the framework of existing agreements.  These allow anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties and other measures, provided evidence <Col N="719" /> exists that the imports are competing unfairly with European steel.  It is also possible when renegotiating agreements with the EEC's main trading partners to restrict the quantity of imports.  In the case of the Argentinian imports I have mentioned, an anti-dumping complaint is being investigated by the Commission, while on the broader question, the Minister for Industry and Energy will be pressing to make the EEC's trade agreements for steel more restrictive when they come to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>In addition to the problem of competing imports, European producers also have problems caused by internal competition. In an effort to streamline the industry, control destructive competition, and improve Europe's competitive position, the European Commission prepared a plan in the late seventies called the &ldquo;Davignon Plan&rdquo;.  The main measures currently in operation under this plan are restrictions on investment in steel; restrictions on State aid to steel; restrictions on steel production; measures to raise prices and control competition; aids for redundancy, short-time working and early retirement; loans to help industries which employ redundant steel workers; and loans to help steel undertakings to increase their efficiency and reduce their production capacity.</P>
    <P>Our concern in discussions on these measures has been to ensure that Irish Steel's prospects of viability are not damaged, particularly by restrictions on State aid and restrictions on production.  As the company's development plan was approved by the Commission, it would now clearly be unfair if Commission measures rendered it unprofitable.  I am now happen that the likelihood of this is remote.</P>
    <P>While steel is not our most important industry, representing less than 0.2 per cent of Community production, it is of vital importance for most other members of the EEC.  For this reason, it is essential that all countries strictly adhere to the Commission rules.  Otherwise market chaos would ensue, with the effect of causing severe distress throughout the Community.  One important consequence <Col N="720" /> of this for Ireland is that the State aids code must be observed.  This lays down that all intended aids for steel must be notified to the Commission by 30 September 1982, for prior approval and that aids cannot be paid after 31 December 1985.</P>
    <P>This means that the Government must decide by 30 September on the funding requirements of the company for the foreseeable future, as no further aids will be allowed.  A firm of consultants, jointly appointed by me and by the Commission, are currently studying this question, and they will report by the beginning of September.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to the Seanad from what I have already said that the prospects for Irish Steel are difficult in the extreme. The company must achieve levels of exports far above any previous achievement, at a time when the European and world markets are at their most depressed level for many years, and at a time when established producers are being forced to reduce their production capacity as demand will not match supply for some years to come.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to paint such a gloomy picture, but I consider it my responsibility not to mislead this House with a falsely encouraging picture.  There are encouraging aspects in this situation, however, which I will turn to now.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel now have one of the most modern plants of its size in the world. They have a great advantage over their competitors in being able to produce well over 100 products, although for technical reasons it is envisaged that no more than 84 will be produced.  The result of this is that it is the only plant of its size which can offer merchants such a complete range of products, while its flexible design enables it to change its production to suit market trends.  In general, it is fair to say that a small, efficient and flexible producer has a special advantage in the market, however depressed it may be. This is borne out by the fact that the only type of plant now making profits in Europe is the so-called &ldquo;mini-mill&rdquo;, which is the type of plant used by Irish Steel.  Taking all these factors into account, Irish Steel's prospects, in spite <Col N="721" /> of the difficulties which can be expected, should be reasonably good with a proper approach to sales management and cost control.</P>
    <P>An example of the difficulties which can arise is now taking place.  Due to poor sales in their first year of operating the new plant, when sales were 41,500 tonnes against a projected 110,000 tonnes, it has proved necessary to introduce a three-day working week from 5 July.  This measure affects about 500 of the 637 workers at the factory, and it is to be hoped that the situation will soon improve enough to allow a resumption of normal working.</P>
    <P>On the question of management, the company have been keenly aware of the need for staff of the highest calibre.  Since the beginning of the project, a total of 20 new management personnel have been recruited, including a new sales manager with considerable international experience, and a new chief executive.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel are under no misapprehension of the difficulties facing them.  They are facing a very severe test in the market place, while at the same time coping with severe financial problems due to their high burden of debt.  The company will need constantly to increase their borrowings unless a major financial restructuring is carried out.  Financial restructuring in this case inevitably involves State aid and, as I have already stated, no aid can be paid without the prior approval of the Commission, and the Commission will not approve such aid unless the basic viability of the company is established.</P>
    <P>The only other provision in this Bill is a minor amendment to provide that the company should comply with directives about remuneration and conditions of employment issued from time to time by the Minister for Industry and Energy, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would hope that, in spite of the many difficulties now facing Irish Steel, the future of the company can be assured.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Bill will commend itself to the Seanad and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House.  I hope our discussions will be fruitful and beneficial.  I would like to welcome the Bill.  It would be all too easy, having regard to the serious losses which Irish Steel have suffered over the past number of years, to write this off and say this was another area in which we were not prepared to continue incurring losses.  It would be easy to bury our heads in the sand and forget about the 700 workers employed there and say that we were going to cut our losses.  I compliment the Minister for having the courage to go into the market place again and decide that the ideal thing was to restructure the firm, allow it to expand, allow it to diversify and also to encourage it to become in every way more competitive.</P>
      <P>The first thing which comes to mind &mdash; it is a worrying aspect &mdash; is that according to a recent release by the Confederation of Irish Industry there has been a drop of 27 per cent in the volume of metal articles produced between February 1980 and February 1982.  This, as the Minister has already indicated, is in fact making it quite clear to everybody the great difficulties facing Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>The proposal originally was to modify the plant in order to make it more productive and more competitive on the world market.  It must be obvious to everybody now the absolute necessity, where possible, to recycle any steel or metal products that are available.  We must all be aware of the increasing numbers of such articles which are only too blatantly obvious to everyone.  It can have a twofold benefit: it can be beneficial to our environment and it can be equally beneficial from the point of view of our balance of payments in that recycling of metal products which are available in the way of scrap inside the country at present can ensure that we will not need to import as much as we have been doing heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to importation, I am deeply worried at the impact which the importation of such large consignments of steel from Argentina could have on Irish Steel even in their restructured form.  I know <Col N="723" /> that there are certain limitations and restrictions within which the Government must work in relation to EEC membership. At the same time, it must now be made quite clear to our EEC partners that importations of this nature from third countries can have a detrimental impact on Irish industry, having particular regard to the fact that our industrial economy is not the sophisticated economy of some of our European competitors.</P>
    <P>Our industry is in its infancy in comparison with our partners in the EEC. We have only to think back to when the industrial revolution came to Europe and to Britain and compare that with when the industrial revolution came to this country in the sixties and the vast expense involved in setting up industries in the sixties, seventies and the eighties as compared with the setting up of industries at the turn of the century.  We are much more vulnerable to the winds of change that are blowing through our EEC partners. I ask the Minister to pay special attention to the imports from third countries and the very serious impact they would have on Irish Steel in particular and the jobs involved in Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>The facts speak for themselves.  The output of Irish Steel will now be altered from 150,000 tonnes per annum to converting 114 tonnes of scrap to 90 tonnes of steel in less than three hours. That is the type of modification which should probably have taken place several years ago and probably would have taken place many years ago had it not been for the protection to which they had become accustomed.  On the one hand, free trade is probably detrimental in one aspect but beneficial in another in that it will make certain aspects of our industry, and in this case Irish Steel in particular, more competitive.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spelt this out and I welcome it.  Irish Steel must be under no illusions as to the task that now faces them.  The fact that this Bill is brought before the House and that certain financial arrangements are made whereby it will be easier for them to continue in business does not necessarily mean that <Col N="724" /> a Government are prepared indefinitely to underwrite losses if Irish Steel continue on the same basis as they have been over the past couple of years.  It would be very wrong if we were to indicate that we would continue to underwrite such losses, because with losses in a year of approximately £10 million-odd it would be entirely unrealistic to expect any Government to continue underwriting such losses.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the drop in the volume of output of metal articles.  There were many reasons for that.  Firstly, there is the general recession both here and abroad and, secondly, within our own economy we have had a recession in the agricultural sector &mdash; the Minister referred to corrugated iron and so on &mdash; which would have a bearing on the drop generally as there was not the same demand for the last couple of years from the agricultural sector for corrugated steel as there was, say, in the previous ten years.  I believe, with an upswing in the agricultural side of the economy in the next six or eight months perhaps the demand in that area will increase again. That should have hopeful prospects for Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>Generally, as I already said, the Bill is to be welcomed.  It is progressive.  It is necessary in these times of recession, gloom, doom and so on that at least one firm are prepared to rationalise, to look at themselves carefully and analyse themselves, decide where they were going wrong, decide how best they can compete in the future and decide how they can best serve the economy in which they are housed.  If all other industries could take an example from what Irish Steel propose to do we would probably be in a far better position in two or three years time.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we must keep a careful watch on how the firm progress for the next couple of years and particularly for the next year because trends will be very quickly established and we will know in a very short time if it has been found possible to compete with our EEC partners when, as the Minister said, there is already very serious overproduction of the steel, and at the same time compete with imports from <Col N="725" /> third countries.  If we can compete in those two areas this Bill will be well worth while and rewarding both from the point of view of Irish Steel and the economy generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to welcome the Minister to the House and as a Cork Senator I am quite proud of the amount of money that has been put into Irish Steel over the years.  We can be proud of the plant we have in Cork harbour. I guarantee Senators that the staff, management, workers and everybody involved in Irish Steel are indeed very conscious of their commitment.  At the same time, we must always ask, why we should not be doing better.</P>
      <P>A rather frightening thing happened earlier this year because of Argentine steel coming into this country.  There was concern about the Irish Steel firm.  Is it possible, in relation to the deal we have with our EEC partners as regards steel imports, that a better deal can be negotiated? The Minister mentioned it but I think he is not completely right in saying that he can indeed get a better deal. I hope a better deal can be negotiated because I cannot see how we can say that we are able to compete when the Minister is saying that we uppped our prices by 2 per cent on 1 January to ensure our survival, thus giving third country producers greater scope for exporting to the EEC.</P>
      <P>That does not add up because I cannot understand why, as a partner in the EEC, we should be upping prices and at the same time be saying that we have a glut of steel.  Why can we not fight this type of thing by creating a situation where we should be decreasing the price instead of upping the price?  It is only right and proper to say if we are producing we should be doing what third countries are doing, trying to sell at any price.  I fail to understand why we should be producing, upping the price to protect our survival and at the same time these third countries come with steel into the EEC countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we are really fighting that.  More work must go into this type of thing.  We must decide whether we should be saying we must be selling the steel and we should be pushing the market where <Col N="726" /> we can, at any price.  If it is costing us money to keep the workers working &mdash; naturally we want everybody working &mdash; we should be finding some markets somewhere for the product at any price. The Minister, Senator Crowley and myself have visited this plant.  It is very encouraging to walk around a plant that is now so productive and, indeed, so up to date.  The people who work there are very proud of the fact that they work there.  It is only right to say that they are concerned about imports of foreign steel.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he is finding it hard to make new agreements.  He also said that our EEC partners are looking for final dates in regard to whether or not we are prepared to give these people money.  It is only right to say that we cannot back down on a thing we put £80 million into.  Is it fair to tell the Government that by 30 September 1982 they must say exactly what they are prepared to put into this plant?  The people and management in Irish Steel are indeed top-class people.  Is it possible that over the next three-year period they may find other areas they might want to get into? For instance, we have in Cork a dockyard yet we do not supply that dockyard with any flat steel.  Is it possible that Irish Steel over the next few years might be considering going into flat steel in some form and yet our EEC partners are asking our Minister to give approval by 30 September 1982 for moneys up to 31 December 1985?  That is a little bit unfair.  Is it possible that can be extended for the good of Irish Steel and for the good of everybody concerned?  Is it possible that we can create a situation where we can make our own flat steel to build our own ships? It is very unfortunate to say that we now produce 84 items in Irish Steel yet we still have to import flat steel to build our ships.  That is an area that should be looked into.  It is an area that is very important to Irish Steel.  I am proud that I am from Cork as regards this particular matter.  I am proud that the Oireachtas are giving money to the Cork area for the future of Cork and the future of the country.</P>

      <P>Ní choimeádfaidh <Col N="727" /> mé i bhfad sibh leis an mbeagán atá le rá agam.  Ar an gcéad dul síos caithfidh mé fáilte a chur roimh an Aire.  Is fear cumasach é, tá an-obair á dhéanamh aige agus, le cúnamh Dé, beidh i bhfád Éireann níos mó sna blianta atá romhainn.  Níl dabht ar domhan ach go bhfuil an-shuim agamsa mar Chorcaíoch ins an mBille seo agus ins an todhchaí atá in ann do Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>I wish to say a few short words on Irish Steel.  The company have experienced many vicissitudes.  They had to change their name a few times but still they are essentially the same business: they have the same skilled operatives and there is, I hope, a very rosy future for the mill.  Up to 1978 we were dealing with the sort of mill that is now out of date all over the world.  Thanks be to God, as a result of the replacement of the old plant and the installation of a smaller but very efficient mill we now have a plant there that is capable of doing great things.</P>
      <P>There is one point about the replacements and the costings.  I understood the cost would be about £13 million, but the actual cost is something in the nature of £70 million or £80 million.  This would concern other industries besides Irish Steel.  In recent years our advance estimates of replacement costings, modernisation and so on, seem to have been very far out when we come to the actual cost in the end.  Can anything be done to rectify that situation, to come nearer to an estimate of what the final cost will be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go on to say a few words about what I think the future may hold for us. We can have a certain amount of diversity. I hope we will have more as far as Irish Steel are concerned.  They can make up to 80 different types of products.  That is all to the good.  The more diversity we have in industry the better because in today's world changes come overnight in the need for certain commodities, certain types of things.  Even in the building industry changes occur very rapidly as regards the needs of builders in relation to the various types of buildings they are about to construct.  As we all know, possibly the greatest potential as far as the State is concerned is the development of <Col N="728" /> the construction industry.  Steel plays a very very important part in that industry. With regard to those steel bars and other articles which we imported from Argentina, some people will say, if I may say with a little bit of levity, that already we have too many bars in this country.  That is another matter.  As far as steel bars are concerned, they are an essential part in the building industry at all levels.  Can anything be done about those imports? Maybe the Minister will go into a little more detail when he is replying.  I am sure the Minister has done everything humanly possible to reduce these imports from Argentina and elsewhere, or at least to take steps to see that such a situation will not occur again.  In relation to imports from Third World countries, it is all right to support the Third World because they richly deserve support, but with labour conditions that do not exist here and with other factors taken into consideration they can produce at a far lesser cost than we can.</P>
    <P>With regard to the potential for industry in Cork we have a very well-trained work force in the Cork region.  I hope that the IDA, when the time comes for siting industry in that region, will give consideration to such ancillary industries that would arise from the proximity of an ultra-modern steel mill such as Irish Steel now are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to welcome the Minister to this House.  I wish him every success in his portfolio.  I welcome this Bill.  Its purpose has been dealt with by other speakers, but I would just like to express certain anxieties and reservations which I have in relation to it.  They, too, have been referred to by other speakers.  We all know that the steel industry, through the last eight to ten years, has been undergoing a most extraordinary period of turmoil and difficulty exacerbated, of course, by the fuel crisis, which has had an effect on the steel industry and, indeed, on building and construction, on steel processing and steel markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also very worrying when we hear that third countries are, in fact, dumping steel on our markets.  That helps to aggravate <Col N="729" /> what is already a very difficult situation. The basic question I see before us now is: can Irish Steel Holdings Limited, ever reach a point of economic viability? If not, how much, for how long and to what extent will the Government and, indeed, the taxpayers, be prepared to pay for the social and economic benefits of having our own steel production facility in this country?  It is a very serious question and one to which we must address ourselves.  It is one which it would be wrong of us to shirk facing up to.  Some very searching questions need to be asked and some continuous appraisals need to be carried out.  I am very pleased to hear that a team have already gone in to evaluate, that there will be a review and that reports will be forthcoming on the matter.</P>
    <P>The forecast of 1977 regarding the cost of the facility of £30.8 million and the fact that it will actually cost in excess of £64 million need a great deal of explanation and justification.  I must express my concern about this, lest we be foolishly and optimistically suggesting that we can export 70 per cent of the projected final production of 354 million tonnes into a market that is now over-supplied to the extent of 30 million tonnes, bearing in mind that 70 per cent of the raw material required would have to be imported from outside Ireland with all the consequent transportation costs to and from this country and its effect on viable sale prices.  We should face up to the fact that perhaps we are at the point of no return. I say this not in any spirit of criticism of the management of Irish Steel Holdings. Indeed, I praise the work force for their dedication and determination and the management too, to see that this plant succeeds.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable investment and encouragement given to this operation from successive Governments. I would like to place this on record.  The searching question from which I find it difficult to escape and which niggles away at my conscience and the consciences of all thinking persons who are charged with public accountability in the disbursement of finance is: do we commit the State to an investment of £40 million, <Col N="730" /> that is £25 million share capital and £15 million in guarantee without the absolute certainty that the company can be viable? I would like the Minister to comment on this question in his reply, please.  I am very concerned in assessing the matter in my own mind to understand how the various estimates and projections can be so very far out given the short period of time in which they were actually made.</P>
    <P>Some figures here may serve to show the areas which cause me to ask these questions which trouble my mind.  The accumulated losses to June 1981 are £26.3 million, which is greater than the existing share capital.  The projected losses in the year to June 1982 were £22.8 million and these were presented to the Minister on 23 April, based upon an output of 100,000 tonnes.  The projected output now for 1982 is only 41,000 tonnes.  Does this now suggest a loss of £30 million to £40 million?  If it does, as the facts suggest, then the matter needs to be fully investigated before any further State investment is made, though I would not dream of putting down an amendment to that effect because I feel the consultative committee have gone in already and that the matter is under review.</P>
    <P>The projected date of viability, according to Irish Steel management, is 1986-87 and this is based upon an output for 1982 of 100,000 tonnes.  Does this now mean that the viability date might be into the nineties with a consequent State subvention until that date, which could mean an eventual State equity interest and a ministerial guarantee of, perhaps, £250 million? This is for an industry which might not be able to compete on world markets because of its location from a sales point of view, and because of the difficulties involved in the procurement of the raw materials.</P>
    <P>The present suggested break-even output of 250,000 tonnes, which can now only be attained in 1990, is four times the present Irish requirement of the output available from the mill.  The whole exercise is at a very crucial juncture and it behoves us to examine it very carefully. Any decisions that we make have to be made in relation to the economic viability, to the social and economic consequences <Col N="731" /> of the area and the fact that the principal cost factor in a steel mill is energy the cost of which has soared to an unprecedented level and is causing great pangs and crises in every area of industry.</P>
    <P>Of course, if this were a private company, or a private corporation, one would be approaching it quite differently.  On the basis of information presently available I cannot see any board of directors giving approval for £40 million equity and guaranteed input, given the present economic climate, but I know, of course, that semi-State companies operate from different bases and with different attitudes in mind.  I look to the Minister for reassurance and for clarification.  While I know he cannot look into a crystal ball, nevertheless I feel that, given the accountability which must rest heavily on his shoulders, some reassurances are necessary. This side of the House would like to have them.  I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House, particularly because of his experience in matters of business and commerce.  These are useful qualifications to have as Minister for Industry and Energy.  I am pleased to see him here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only give a qualified welcome to this Bill because I am in favour of the main sections of it which involve finance but I take great objection to section 5 which I shall deal with later.  I am the Member who lives closest to this industry and who has always had an interest in Irish Steel.  I believe it is important that we give every backing to our own native steel industry which dates, under Government control as a semi-State body, from 1947.  It was built on the foundations of a private concern in Haulbowline and it employs, as the Minister said, a work force of 637.  It has in the nature of a steel industry considerable payoff in terms of downstream industries.  It gives us certain control over steel which perhaps in peacetime is not as great a benefit as it is when there is a crisis, but in an international crisis it is absolutely vital that we have control of our own steel industry.  Since the main function of the <Col N="732" /> plant is to manufacture from scrap, perhaps the Minister will tell the House what proportion of that scrap is supplied from Irish sources and how much we import. That is an important figure to know because if there was a crisis one of the likely consequences would be that the quantity of scrap we import would dwindle to zero.  Would we have enough native scrap to keep our steel industry going at a level at which it might have to produce our full quota of steel.</P>
    <P>The plant has had an interesting history. Irish Steel are a particularly interesting example of a semi-State body and, as I have said in the course of debates on semi-State bodies in this House, they are of great importance to us.  They not only affect our commercial and industrial life but they are part of our national life.  The decision to set up the first semi-State industry here, the Shannon hydro-electric scheme, was hotly contested in Leinster House.  It is a great tribute to the foresight of the late Mr. Paddy McGilligan, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, that he saw this first semi-State industry through its early stages.  It proved a great success and since that time, in general terms, we have been in favour of using the mechanism of semi-State bodies to fill in the gaps in our economy.</P>
    <P>Now we have a vast range of semi-State bodies of which Irish Steel is one.  Inside that range there is a division into commercial and non-commercial semi-State bodies.  It has been the practice to treat these separately.  The problems of the commercial semi-State body are different from, for example, those of the non-commercial bodies such as An Foras Talúntais which is a research organisation.  It is a semi-State body doing a very important job but which cannot be judged in any sense by commercial criteria.  When one looks at Irish Steel one is looking at it not just as an important national institution, which it is, but as a body which must be judged to a certain extent on purely commercial criteria.</P>
    <P>A brave decision was taken some years ago to modernise the Irish Steel plant.  It was a question of modernising or closing <Col N="733" /> down in the long run.  I have no doubt that the board of directors took the right decision and, as a consequence of that, we have now one of the most modern plants of its kind in the world.  It is a great tribute to the foresight of the people involved, but, of course, this decision has to be paid for.  I am certain it was the right decision and we now have a first-class plant in Haulbowline.  However, just as that plant came into commission, the world steel industry collapsed.  This brought about disaster in terms of income and return on investment and we have to face up to that fact.  This is what the main section in the Bill is doing.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to judge the prospects for the industry purely on the results of the last couple of years.  One has only to look at our next door neighbour to see the collapse in the nationalised British industry. That collapse has been much more serious, tragic and wide-ranging there than the setbacks in our industry which, fortunately, is not so big that it has a devastating effect like the cutbacks in British Steel.  The decisions taken to modernise were the correct ones.  We have to be optimistic in judging this industry.  We must not, in peacetime, neglect the importance of having control of the manufacture of steel sufficient for our own needs in times of crises.  I share the sentiment expressed by other Members concerning the financial provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are some other points I should like to put to the Minister.  He said that it was essential that all countries strictly adhere to the Commission rules, otherwise market chaos would ensue.  That is an absolutely correct and straightforward sentiment, but realities are different from theory.  The Minister is well aware that when it suits them, other countries do not adhere to the Commission rules.  The difficulty there is that their industries, relative to ours, are so vast.  Ours is only 2 or .2 per cent of the total steel output of the Commission.  We have to think of the possibilities in advance that Commission rules will not be adhered to.  Maybe we cannot make it public but we have to have a strategy up our sleeves for dealing with a situation like that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> I was one of those people who was vigorously in favour of our entry into the EEC but I was, I hope, always aware of the difficulties not just of obtaining agreements but actually putting them into effect between the Nine or Ten.  There is no doubt that a small industry like this is vulnerable.  We have to look at life as it is and be realistic and say, &ldquo;Well, people may not and will not always adhere to the rules, the quotas and whatever is set down on paper&rdquo;.  We have to be prepared to have a defensive strategy which can help our native steel industry to get over this.  I am sure the Minister, and his officials, must have taken this situation into account and will not be caught on the hop when someone breaks the rules.  It takes six months to haul them back.  They go before the EEC Commission and there is a complicated procedure to prove that someone has done something wrong in the first place and then work out some sort of penalties or some way of hauling them back.  However, by that stage the damage may have been done to our industry.  We have, in a sense, to take a rather aggressive posture of defence, if the Minister understands what I mean.</P>
    <P>Like the other Members who have spoken I welcome the financial provisions of the Bill.  I should like to refer the House to a very important historical work by G. P.S. Hogan who was executive director and chairman of the board of Irish Steel for a considerable time.  He had great experience of the industry and his history of Irish Steel, published by Gill &amp; Macmillan in 1980, is unquestionably the best work of this type in summarising the lifespan of the semi-State body, underlining its humble beginnings and the contribution it makes to our national life.  Similar studies could well be carried out, with great profit to all of us, on the other semi-State industries.  It certainly makes it easier to understand them.</P>
    <P>I noticed that one of the contracts to which Sarsfield Hogan referred with considerable pride was one for the steel work in a hydro-electric scheme in New Zealand. It was a very large contract for Irish Steel and I believe Mr. Hogan was intimately involved in securing this important export order.  It was connected <Col N="735" /> with his expertise as a rugby football legislator that this contract was obtained in New Zealand.  Certainly, the tributes to the production work of the Irish steel industry, when the steel work was delivered to New Zealand, were unambiguous and I have no doubt, absolutely deserved.  The New Zealanders were delighted with the finished product of the Haulbowline firm.</P>
    <P>That is the main thrust of my commendations and now for my distaste with section 5 which I have vainly protested about on every semi-State body Bill which has come before the House with very little support from other Members who do not seem to realise what is going on.  They do not seem to understand what Devlin is doing to the semi-State industries or the difficulties which section 5 presents, or even its milder parent, that it is amending, section 6 of the Irish Steel Holdings (Amendment) Act, 1979.  I have campaigned unavailingly against the principal recommendations of Devlin II. I am going to have yet another go and Members can put up with me for another while because I intend to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage.  Not only is this pernicious legislation but even the section which it amends, section 6 of the 1979 Act, went too far.  That was a sort of Devlin I and now we have got to stage 2.  I will deal with this on Committee Stage.  I want briefly to make a point, seeing that the Minister is from the commercial world and knows how important in a highly technological industry it is to appoint at the top the very best man one can get.  That is what made the semi-State industries we have today into the tremendous successes they are.  In the early days of the State there was no restriction on their salary.  They got the best men, for example they got the famous engineer who was in charge of the Shannon Scheme, Mr. McLaughlin.  I remember Mr. Paddy McGilligan saying to me, &ldquo;It was McLaughlin who made me because he made that scheme work&rdquo;.  He was the head engineer, he made the scheme work and he turned the Shannon Scheme from something which was bitterly criticised by the Opposition in the Dáil &mdash; I think it <Col N="736" /> was criticised by the Labour Party because Fianna Fáil were somewhere else at the time; they were unavailable for selection&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

      <P>Slightly unconstitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event it was the work of the head engineer on that scheme, Tommy McLaughlin, that made it into the tremendous success it is today, against terrific opposition.  It is interesting to read that debate which went on for months and months.  The Shannon scheme was written off as the greatest white elephant in Irish history.  The phrases were long and flowing.  There was obvious disagreement inside the Government party, but Mr. McGilligan stuck to his guns.  This scheme is absolutely vital to our salvation, one could put it in almost religious terms.</P>
      <P>What does section 5 do?  It ensures that the directors in a highly technological industry can choose the best man but they cannot pay him.  That is exactly what the section says.  In a highly technological industry which is a commercial industry &mdash; this is what really gets me &mdash; and is judged on commercial criteria we have a situation where we can only, to put it crudely, pay the chief executive civil service rates.  In terms of the money we are talking about, if we were really going for a good man to head a steel industry we would want to be paying him £50,000.  We would not even be starting at £50,000 to get the really good ones. What is that as a fraction of the money that the Minister is talking about?  It is 1/15,000 of the total sum that is being referred to.  I remember all the Minister said, absolutely sincerely, when he was appointed, that he was going to bring in business methods and we were going to have a good commercial operation.  Good for him, but here he comes in, having turned the full circle, and we get Devlin II in section 5.  It is nonsense, absolute nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the Minister one good illustration. I do not think he was here for the debate when I protested vainly against Devlin.  People say Devlin must be great. <Col N="737" /> That is nonsense and the philosophy behind Devlin is nonsense.  I remember protesting in the Seanad when Mr. Justin Keating was on the Labour Front Bench. He said that as Minister for Industry and Commerce he spent his time fighting these guys to try head this off, but the civil service, and the Devlin guys won in the end.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the bland phrase used by the Minister because it is too good to be true.  He said:</P>
    <P>The only other provision in this Bill is a minor amendment to provide that the company should comply with directives about remuneration and conditions of employment issued from time to time...</P>
    <P>If this continues the semi-State industries will be coming back to us every few weeks asking for money for the very good reason that we will not be appointing the best senior men.</P>
    <P>This provision ensures that the directors can choose the best man but they cannot pay him.  We know what is going to happen.  That was not the case when the semi-State industries were set up originally. They had freedom to choose the salary and the man; one cannot do one without the other.  This effectively ensures that it is ground right down to civil service levels.  I am not saying anything against the civil service.  What I am saying is that one cannot judge commercial criteria and expect to get the best men in industry and pay them administrative rates.  It is just not on.  Ultimately it is going to do infinite damage to the semi-State sector which is a vital part of our national life and it is becoming more vital every day as we have to pay out more money for its operations.  I am not against the financial sections of the Bill but I intend to move an amendment on Committee Stage which I hope the Minister will accept to rectify the situation.</P>

      <P>We find ourselves, as Senator West touched on, putting an extra £25 million into Irish Steel.  I wonder with this amount of money if it will then be competitive.  Since we entered the EEC we all know that Irish Steel were seeking orders.  I do not know how good their men are but as a person who does some buying in that world I know they could improve.  The type of attitude they have is that if one requires a load of steel from them one has to give them a number of weeks, or a number of months, notice before they prepare it.  I am ashamed to say it &mdash; and I am as good an Irishman in my own way as anybody in this House &mdash; that at the moment in my own business we are importing all the material because their prices are not competitive.  That is a serious situation.  Unless something is done it is wasted money.  I am a great believer in giving employment to our people but the Minister, or somebody, will have to look out after this because we will have every State company looking for money.  We are losing a good bit of time on this and the day of helping these terrible lame ducks is coming to an end very rapidly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity of thanking the Senators who contributed so widely to this debate and made some very interesting comments. Senator Reynolds said that Irish Steel products are non-competitive and asked me what I could do about it.  I want to make it clear that they operate totally on their own in their own management sphere and it is up to them to price their products.  The fact that prices were increased in Europe by 2 per cent in January this year was an attempt, and part of the overall Davignon Plan, to bring some sense of reality back into the <Col N="739" /> steel industry in Europe which, as we all know, had practically collapsed.  It was up to Irish Steel to consider whether to increase their prices by 2 per cent, to leave them as they were or, if they felt they could do more business, to reduce them by 2 per cent.  It is entirely a matter for the management.</P>
      <P>This brings me back to the point Senator West made about paying the man for the job and choosing the right man for the job.  From my own background I am very conscious of this aspect in the semi-State area.  In regard to the situation in Irish Steel, a new chief executive was appointed two years ago.  There is no evidence to suggest that anybody left because of the salary restrictions there. The points which the Senator makes can be valid in certain situations but this is not the way to approach it.  I have certain views in relation to certain operations.  I do not think it is correct to move it as an amendment here when most other semi-State bodies are restricted in this way.  It should be done at a higher level and it should be examined in detail to achieve a better result.  I have not a closed mind on the subject but I think that is a fair response to points made to me.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate and who made some very interesting points.  A viable construction industry is one of the areas in which Irish Steel can hope to prosper. Having said that and relating it to the recent importation of Argentinian steel, it is only right and proper to say that while Senator West made the point about being aggressive in your defence against EEC regulations &mdash; and they come up for review from time to time &mdash; I take the view quite strongly that in the first instance we have to protect ourselves when we see what is happening across the world and, indeed, across Europe, but we have to be seen to do it within the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make another point here in relation to the construction industry which will provide a very useful outlet for many of the products from Irish Steel.  In this situation of very high unemployment <Col N="740" /> and deep recession it is regrettable to have to record that so much foreign steel is being used in the construction industry right across this country and the sooner we realise that the better and return to patriotism in relation to the use of products of our major industries.  I would appeal to the construction industry and to those who are associated with it and to those who make out specifications for it to bear this in mind.  In my short period as Minister for Industry and Energy I have found it very difficult to reconcile the national interest with some of the specifications that go out from time to time and have gone out in recent months and of which I have taken particular note. I have taken a very strong line in this regard and I think it is only right and proper that I should do so.  There are certain restrictions on what I can do but where I can do anything I will certainly do it in relation to the use of home-produced goods right across the economy.</P>
    <P>This is one of the great ways in which we can help ourselves out of the present difficult situation.  If we take the easy way out and let other people run our affairs for us and let others come in and take over the market then we will have only ourselves to blame.  I would urge the construction industry and all associated with it to be very conscious in these difficult economic circumstances to look first at Irish products.  In many areas where imported products are being used Irish products could be used.</P>
    <P>The most recent example I can give is a local authority building scheme in County Cavan where 28 baths were installed at 48p cheaper than the Irish bath that was made in the same town.  In this day and age in our national development and while we are trying to further national development that is an absolute disgrace.  It is only one example.  In my short period here, I have seen many such examples and I am taking whatever action I can to prevent this sort of thing happening.  There is a limit to what one person or one Department can do.  It applies in every other Department also. One of the major items in the Government economic plan that we are putting together will be a determined attack on <Col N="741" /> our vast amount of imports.  We are buying them; we are making jobs abroad for others to avail of.  At the same time our hard-earned cash is going out in foreign exchange and making our balance of payments even worse.</P>
    <P>To get back to the subject of Irish Steel, it is worth commenting that I am not saying that Irish products should be sold at any price; they must compete on a competitive and quality basis.  Much can be done by the community and by every public representative in the matter of taking every opportunity to try to bring this to the notice of the public and especially the buying public.</P>
    <P>The question of the over-run in expenditure in Irish Steel is a very serious point.  It was estimated at the start that it would cost £35 million; the out-turn was £68 million.  I gave the reasons in my opening statement.  This is not the only area in which we found out too late what was going on.  It is quite clear that we need a monitoring system on this type of project.  We have seen others go far off the rails in the past and it is perhaps two years later before we find out about it.  It is history then.  It is too late and little can be done about it.  This is exactly what happened here.</P>
    <P>In the first weeks that I was in my Department I set up a monitoring system by which we can have information on a monthly basis about what is happening in the various projects within my responsibility. This will have to be continued.  It is the only way we can find out exactly what is going on in relation to the vast expenditure of public funds that is involved at present.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Senator Cranitch to see that the IDA would bear in mind in their IDA promotions in the Cork area industries that are complementary to the Irish Steel industry and I will certainly do what I can.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia asked if the company can be viable.  I would like to answer that but I have to be honest and say that if I did say it was viable I could be misleading the House.  That is precisely why I have appointed consultants in conjunction with the EEC to get in there immediately &mdash; they are in already &mdash; to try to produce <Col N="742" /> the evidence that will show whether it is viable or not.  We have to find that out. Furthermore, if the EEC allow any further aid to be approved, whether it is to be paid this year, next year or the year after, they too have to be satisfied about its viability and this is why I have gone into joint consultations with them so that we can establish whether it is viable or not.</P>
    <P>One of the major reasons for the over-expenditure was that there was no fixed tender for this job when it started, which is a dangerous way to go into any major contract.  It was started out on general design; there was no fixed tender and no fixed price.  Some of the design was subsequently found not to be the correct way of going about it; changes had to be made in the design.  Anyone who has any experience in that regard will know that the minute you move off a fixed line situation &mdash; Senator Durkan will be aware of that &mdash; the contractors or any people involved are only too delighted because the door is open then for the price to go up.</P>
    <P>I have discovered in investigating this that there is a possibility that there is a liability on the people who did the designing and did certain work there.  Irish Steel have taken up that with their legal advisers and if there is anything that can be recouped in that way it will be recouped. Basically, that is where the project went off the rails, in my view.</P>
    <P>How much would it cost to make Irish Steel viable?  The proposition that came before me in April for the next three years proposed a figure in the region of £80 million.  The Senator will recall, and she did refer to it herself, that the projections presented in April were based on a production of 100,000 tonnes and that now because of market difficulties those projections look more like being 41,000 or 42,000.  Naturally, that throws the whole prospect out of line and I could not put a figure on what it might take to make the concern viable.  The facts and figures on which the projections were based are now out of date and new projections have to be made and this will be part of the consultancy work that is going on.  It was envisaged that Irish Steel could <Col N="743" /> become viable in the years 1986-87. Because the bases on which all these projections were made have gone out of line, the whole exercise has to be done again. This is an area that has to be clarified in time for the EEC to see if the company is viable and, secondly if it is viable, what amount of aid will be needed and where it is to come from.</P>
    <P>Senator West commented on the fact that it is easy enough to talk about this industry in peacetime but not so many years ago the construction industry in Ireland was left short of steel because of the buoyancy of the market.  That is a factor to be considered at the end of the day when all the facts are being considered.</P>
    <P>On the matter of viability, I have made my position quite clear.  I have given all the facts I have.  I do not know the basis for the figure the Senator mentioned of £250 million.  The original figure was £80 million; £250 million might be stretching it a bit too far.  Whatever the figure is, we have to find it out, because we must all be concerned about whether we are going to pay that sort of money or whether we are not.  Both Houses will have the opportunity of looking at the matter again.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of borrowing, the situation about this £25 million we are talking about is that the banks were owed that amount.  Further borrowing was out of the question and so it was a matter of getting this measure enacted to keep Irish Steel afloat for this year and to decide on the question of long-term viability.  We have to produce all the facts and then let us, in both Houses, decide.</P>
    <P>The amount of scrap produced in Ireland that would be required for Irish Steel at 100,000 tonnes production capacity is approximately 40 per cent; 60 per cent would have to be imported.  If you are talking about a 250,000 tonne production, it goes down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  On a 100,000 tonne production, 60 per cent of it would be imported but at the level of production at the moment, none.  I take the point about the rules of the game and I think I have commented fairly extensively on them as to what we can do in relation to them.  Views come up regularly in relation to the agreements that exist between the EEC and the non-EEC members in relation to finalising both tariffs and quantities, and I might say at this point that before this steel was imported from the Argentine my Department lodged a complaint in anticipation of it coming because we heard through the grapevine that it was on its way.  The company lodged the anti-dumping complaint after the steel arrived, but in that situation it is very difficult to prove because you must prove that the price at which it is sold here is less than what it would be sold at in the home market of Argentina.  That matter is being pursued by the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism who are the people directly concerned with it, but from an industry point of view I lodged a complaint in anticipation of it coming in.  I have since spoken to the Commissioner concerned in relation to it, pointing out to him the effect that that sort of quantity arriving on the Irish market can have on a company like Irish Steel.  It is difficult to put that in proper context because this was a consignment of certain steel bars which although produced also by Irish Steel are not one of their most profitable lines.  In addition, they are not the only supplier to the Irish market, so the full brunt of the effect of the 11,000 tonnes would not fall solely on Irish Steel in the first place.  Secondly, their product line in that regard is not one of their best lines, and furthermore it is very difficult to identify the supplier. There are very considerable difficulties in that regard.  However, as I said before, if the people concerned in the construction industry and those affiliated to it did what the country might expect them to do in the national interest, the problem could well be reduced considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have covered fairly accurately the other points made to the question of <Col N="745" /> monitoring the continuing situation in Irish Steel, having the consultancy report available as soon as possible so that the Government can in the first instance make the decisions in relation to it, continue our discussions with the EEC in relation to the future viability and the aid that will be necessary for the company, and finally that the report will come back at the end of the day to both Houses for final ratification.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan asked about a better deal with the EEC in relation to it, and I have said that at the next meeting at which the quantities and tariffs are being reviewed the situation in relation to Irish Steel will carry our full weight, as it has done up to now, because we are very conscious of trying to keep our only steel industry here.  It certainly represents a very small margin of the total market in relation to EEC, 0.2 per cent, but nevertheless significant in the Irish context. Having said that the future viability of Irish Steel will rest to a large extent on their ability to export 70 per cent of their products, and indeed an area I think that they should be looking at very seriously, and I have passed this information along to them, is the Middle East where the major construction of the world is taking place.  There should and may well be opportunities there to be capitalised on.</P>
    <P>Part of the reason for the increase in price was part of the Davignon plan which did not demand that Irish Steel increase their prices &mdash; they could quite easily have kept them down &mdash; but they have to be the judges in the market place. Both Houses have given them that freedom.</P>
    <P>I have by and large covered all the points made.  If there is any point that I have left out I did not do so deliberately. We all have to recognise the difficulties in the market place for Irish Steel at the moment.  I was in America a couple of weeks ago and I spoke to US Steel, and in discussions with them in relation to the total steel market they said that one thing in our favour is that we are lucky to have a mini mill.  That is the only chance that any sort of steel mill has in the depressed market in which we exist and that it is now a question of trying to get the act <Col N="746" /> together, to try to get it right and it is in the national interest that we get it right.</P>

He knows the time constraints that are there, that the EEC are part of the consultancy examination that is going on.  There will be some leeway there, but not very much, because it is part of an earlier agreement drawn up under the Davignon plan that we would get derogation for a period but not for an indefinite period.  It is in the interest of Irish Steel, in the interest of the country and of national finances and so on that we know the precise position as soon as we can and take whatever decisions that are necessary at that point in time.</P>

      <P>I oppose this section for reasons that I outlined in my Second Stage speech but I should like to point out to the Minister that I was pleased <Col N="747" /> with what he said.  However, as we know only too well &mdash; I know very well from my experience in this House&mdash;it is one thing for him to say something; it is quite another for us to pass legislation and the legislation, once we pass it, is there and we must obey it or pay the penalty.  While I certainly welcome his sentiments and welcome the fact that as far as I can gather, he indicated that he was not entirely happy with the operation of this philosophy, if I may use the term, because it comes into every semi-State Bill and I protest on every occasion, I must oppose the section, as it stands.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer the House to the section that is being amended, and that is section 6 of the 1979 Steel Holdings (Amendment) Act.  That section provides that there shall be paid by the company to its chief officer, whether that officer is so described or otherwise, such remuneration and allowances as the company, with the approval of the Minister, given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, shall determine. When one looks at the section which is proposed to be substituted for section 6 in the 1979 Act it must be clear to everyone that it is much less restrictive.  Even then I think it is too restrictive, and what I intend to do is to quote what were the opinions of the board of Irish Steel Holdings. This comes from <i>A History of Irish Steel</i> by Sarsfield Hogan.  I would add that from my experience this has been the attitude of the board in the other commercial semi-State companies to whom this is applying.  I quote from page 189:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1972, a second report was published, that of the <i>Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.</i> That body was guided by the same chairman as the earlier <i>Review of Organisation</i>, so that the two reports were referred to as <i>Devlin 1</i> and <i>Devlin 2.</i>  The second report recommended the adoption of pay levels for the higher posts in the public sector as a whole, including local authorities, ministerial and parliamentary offices and the judiciary.  In the case of state-sponsored commercial companies, specific <Col N="748" /> limits of pay were proposed for the chief executive of each company according to the report's evaluation of the comparable importance of the various bodies.  These limits were to be mandatory on the appointing boards and were to include not only actual pay but also the value of any benefits, such as a company car, which might be received by the chief executive.  The proposals therefore meant that the board could select its chief executive but not decide how much he was worth to the company in terms of salary.  The most suitable person (possibly the only one suitable) could not be appointed if he were unwilling to accept the limit of pay prescribed by <i>Devlin 2.</i></P>
    <P>These recommendations in the Devlin reports caused concern to the Board of ISH.  The executive director, in sending comments to the departments, strongly urged the view that inclusion of a commercial company such as Irish Steel among `the public services' and thus within the domain of the executive functions of government would be a mistake.  He stressed the deterrent effect of the Devlin recommendations on the promotion in state enterprises of the spirit of initiative and risk-taking which were essential to commercial success.  The disadvantage which such an arrangement would impose on these enterprises in the comparision (which the Devlin report suggested should be the test of their success) of their performance with that of similar enterprises in the private sector was obvious.  So also was the danger that the restraints on remuneration of chief executives in state companies would be a disincentive in the recruitment of staff generally and condemn these companies to an artificial system of salaries out of line with the market forces which determined how talent and experience should be rewarded. Among the functions of company directors were those of hiring, firing, and remunerating their staff including above all the chief executive on whom they placed the primary responsibility for the success of the undertaking. That function was now to be curtailed <Col N="749" /> without, it was claimed, any compelling reasons.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, accepted without qualification the recommendations in both Devlin reports regarding commercial bodies and took steps to implement them as a measure of reform in the organisation and objectives of the public services taken as a whole.  Time will tell whether such arrangements will be applied with the degree of flexibility required by the commercial companies.</P>
    <P>During 1973 and 1974, following government adoption of the Devlin prescriptions, the ISH board fruitlessly sought approval, firstly from George Colley and later from Justin Keating, for somewhat better remuneration for their chief executive than the arbitrary limits allowed.  In the case of ISH the chief executive for this purpose was the general manager and not the executive director who, by terms of appointment and contract, was not a wholetime officer of the company.  At the end of the period covered by this chapter, the directors were still seeking to find some way out of the strait-jacket imposed by the Devlin formula.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very frank statement of the feelings of the board of Irish Steel Holdings, so I am not a voice crying in the wilderness.  I know that every other commercial semi-State company are worried about the increasing levelling out which provisions such as that in section 5 of this Bill are affecting.  I would reiterate the point that I made to the Minister, that is, that it is not sufficient to pay executives in commercial companies administrative rates.  In case my remarks are misinterpreted, I have no axe to grind with the civil service.  We have a first-class civil service.  I do not want any of my remarks <Col N="750" /> to be interpreted as being in any way disparaging towards them.  All I would say about the civil service, and it is a problem which other areas of life seem to suffer from, is that it is slightly over-manned. However, we are very lucky to have such a good body of men, but that is not the point.  The point is that an executive director in a high-technology industry cannot be regimentally fixed at a level described by the service, and I am encouraged to hear the Minister say he will look at this over a wide range.  I would be very happy to see something being done quickly before it really produces the consequences about which I am very worried.</P>

      <P>One cannot but sympathise with the case which has been made by Senator West.  It is a point that has come up in the Seanad many a time.  I agree with Senator West that it is welcome that the Minister says that the matter will be looked at in the round.  This is the way to tackle it.  There is no sense in rejecting a section of this Bill because of a problem that pervades the whole of the semi-State sector.  If the Minister would add that it will be looked at on a wide bases urgently, I certainly would be satisfied.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my voice to what has been said.  Reluctantly I have to disagree with Senator West.  He said that it was a frank statement by Sarsfield Hogan.  Of course it was a frank statement, but inaccurate because on the one hand we have a semi-State body attempting to compare themselves to an ordinary commercial concern and complaining about the restrictions being imposed on them in relation to or in comparison with commercial concerns, yet the very subject that we are discussing is the vast amount of money we are going to pour into Irish Steel.  I would like to know where the comparison starts and ends.  If I am in business, I cannot come looking to the Government for an injections of £30 million, £40 million or £50 million.  I have to abide by the economic and, indeed, the efficiency factors that <Col N="751" /> govern my operation.  It is my opinion also that our employees in semi-State bodies are very well paid.  I would say that there are very few people in private industry earning as much as are the executives in our semi-State bodies.  I would say also that very few of the executives in private enterprise enjoy the same privileges, rights and protection as those involved in semi-State bodies.  Therefore, I cannot for one moment concede that Senator West's proposal would do anything whatsoever to improve the calibre of the management of the semi-State bodies.  I know that any time there is a vacancy for high or low management in the semi-State bodies they have the best in the country applying because the applicants recognise that this is where the real financial cream is to be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Crowley has a point, but again it is only part of the truth, it is not the whole truth.  I am not talking about employees in semi-State bodies in a general sense.  I want to make that absolutely clear because I would agree that, in general terms &mdash; terms of salary and security on a general level &mdash; the employees in semi-State bodies are adequately remunerated.  The point I wish to make concerns perhaps one or two men at the very top.  Senator Crowley must be only too well aware of the number of private industries turning this point on its head, who pride themselves on being private industries and who come running to the Government seeking loans.  They are not semi-State bodies; they get Government help in terms of IDA grants, Fóir Teoranta grants and so on.  We have a structure ten miles wide of support for private industry.  So remember that the private industries benefit from support in direct ways and in indirect ways.  Therefore, it has become increasingly hard to make a distinction.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the recent position of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors in relation to extradition and urges the Government to reconsider extradition proceedings as the most effective means of combating cross-border crimes.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to be able to move this motion in the House this evening.  I welcome the Minister.  I am sorry the Minister for Justice could not be here.  I hope that the Minister will not &mdash; by the end of this debate &mdash; believe that it is right to extradite people for political speeches rather than for political offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extradition is an unknown word in the Irish political vocabulary.  Up to about 15 years ago criticism of the Churches or criticism of the men of 1916, criticism of that whole realm in Irish mythology was almost unheard of.  It was heresy, there was a long litany of gods and godesses to whom one had to genuflect; there was a <Col N="753" /> long litany of taboos.  One of the things that I resent about the Irish political scene is that for a long time it has been wrong to diverge from this mythology, to attack or to criticise this mythology.  I believe that extradition is one of the last taboos in this mythology because even now it is so little talked about.  I do not believe there has been a parliamentary debate on extradition in the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State.  The ambivalence continues when one raises the subject at any stage in Irish political life.  There is this tacit feeling which politicians of all parties seem to have that they baulk at the idea of lifting the lads and sending them over the Border.  The lads, I would remind this House, are normally and usually murderers.  Party leaders I think &mdash; for reasons which I understand &mdash; feel that it is unpatriotic and anti-Irish to take on these people; there is a silent, underhand connivance with the men of violence which still exists. Luckily, we have open condemnations of violence from all parties.  But I believe there is still this underhand feeling that this one can still not be tackled.</P>
    <P>At this stage I might say a word on the Fine Gael amendment, and I think this proves my point.  The Fine Gael amendment, unfortunately, is a very open and obvious attempt to duck the issue of extradition.  I respect and do not agree with the Government's view on extradition. But I would have thought that Fine Gael, who have made so much of the Constitutional crusade, who have made so much of putting their hands over to the Unionists in a gesture of friendship, might have been able to tackle this issue of extradition and not to avoid it by putting down an amendment which they know very well the Government will have to support, because it is Government policy, but which will in fact allow them to avoid taking a stand on extradition itself.</P>
    <P>One of the things I would like to hear in this debate is not so much the Government's view on extradition &mdash; I know what that is &mdash; I would like the Members of the Opposition here to tell us exactly where they stand on this and not to avoid it by talking about an all-Ireland court.  I would like the House to imagine what the <Col N="754" /> situation would be in the Republic of Ireland if the extradition issue was reversed.  Let us suppose that the UDA, the UVF, or any other Loyalist paramilitary organisation &mdash; for their own sinister aims &mdash; decided to do the opposite thing.  Say they decided that members of the Garda, members of the Army, even civilian targets in Sligo, Louth, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan &mdash; decided that these targets were legitimate, that they could come over the Border, murder these targets and then go back to the hills of Antrim and to Belfast. What would be our Government's reaction to that?  I suggest to the House that they would ask Britain, an openly friendly power, to hand over these men to them to face justice.  What would public reaction be here if the British Government said: &ldquo;We are very sorry, we shed very open tears for the wives and families of these men, it is a terrible sin&rdquo; and they condemned the murders in the strongest possible terms.  But if they also said: &ldquo;But we have a Constitution, unfortunately, which does not allow, according to international law, people to be extradited for political crimes and so these men who have murdered members of your security forces must, as a result, be allowed to go free in the streets of Belfast and be allowed to be given the opportunity to murder again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The problem of extradition was first recognised only at the time of the Sunningdale Agreement.  Before that it was regarded as a minor irritation but not as a major problem.  It took a bargain for an Irish Government in 1973 to recognise that there was a real bolt-hole in the Republic into which criminals could actually flee.  The Criminal Law (Jurisdication) Act was then introduced &mdash; I would remind the House not until three years later, it took three years for the Commission that was set up actually to come to a conclusion and to make a recommendation.  The Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act was recommended as some sort of a panacea for the problem of cross-Border crimes.  It was an ingenious Act in its inception.  It was theoretically extremely clever and was a very neat operation.  But the difficulties with the <Col N="755" /> Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act were foreseen by those eight judges, unanimously, both Irish and English, at the time of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act and at the time when they actually set it up.  They said that this was the compromise because the Irish judges did not agree with extradition.  They said that the difficulties with this Act would be the difficulties of getting civilians to cross the Border and to give evidence.</P>
    <P>These difficulties have been transparently open and obvious in the workings of the Act ever since.  Up to 1980 I think there were four prosecutions under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  Nobody in this House can suggest to me that there were not hundreds of cross-Border crimes in that time.  The present cases which no doubt will be quoted to us, the high profile cases and the prosecutions which have been brought recently, should not mislead us into believing that this Act is working; it is not.  Several of the present cases have been to do with members of the IRA escaping from legal custody in Northern Ireland and these men have rightly been brought to book. But the reasons it is easy to bring them to book is because it depended on RUC evidence and the RUC and the Garda are prepared to cross the Border to give evidence. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that civilians will do so.  As a result of this a tiny fraction only of those who are guilty of cross-Border crimes are still being prosecuted and have been prosecuted. One had only to see the recent &ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; film on BBC television which showed and interviewed people who admitted that they were guilty of cross-Border crimes and murders and were walking free in the streets of Dublin.  The names of these people are known to the RUC, to the Garda and they are certainly known in London.  But because successive Governments have conveniently hidden behind the guise of international law and behind the guise of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act there are men here enjoying immunity.  The Gardaí feel impatient.  The Garda see these men, know these men and know <Col N="756" /> that they are walking free having committed the most appalling crimes.</P>
    <P>In March of this year this edifice began to crack.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors put forward and passed a motion seeking an urgent review of the constitutional and legislative conditions governing extradition.  This was a direct result of Garda morale and Garda frustration with the fact that they could not arrest and bring to book people who had committed crimes for which they were suspected and which they were convinced they would be sentenced for and convicted of in a court of law.</P>
    <P>I find it strange, and I will say no more, that this Government &mdash; who showed such uncharacteristic sympathy and sensitivity for the case of the Garda on the issue of capital punishment while they were in Opposition &mdash; can now ignore and ride totally roughshod over the wishes of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors over extradition.</P>
    <P>I would like to come to the legal arguments very briefly.  The legal arguments no doubt will be and are put forward as an insuperable objection to extradition. I regard them more as a smoke-screen.  I do not want to get bogged down in them simply because there are very distinguished authorities on either side on this issue.  But the opponents of extradition say that extradition is contrary to international law and therefore it is unconstitutional. I should like to quote briefly here Chief Justice Maguire in the Supreme Court, the State (Duggan) versus Tapley.  I will give one judgment on our side of the House to try to justify this position in legal terms.  I do not want to give a large number because there are hundreds and there are hundreds on the other side.  But Chief Justice Maguire held &mdash; in the Supreme Court in the State versus Tapley in 1952 &mdash; that there was no principle of international law compelling a State to withhold surrender of a fugitive offender, and I quote here:</P>
    <P>...international law permits and favours the refusal of extradition of persons accused or convicted of offences of political character but allows it to each State to exercise its own <Col N="757" /> judgement as to whether it will grant or refuse extradition in such cases and also as to the limitations which it will impose upon such provisions as exempt from extradition.</P>
    <P>Nothing could be clearer than that.  What that says is that you can define when you regard them as political fugitives and when you regard them as actually suitable for extradition and not suitable for extradition.</P>
    <P>I accept the genuine arguments which will be put, undoubtedly, on the other side about this.  I believe that the legal arguments are something of a stalemate and the legal position is, if not untested, unresolved.  I think we should all accept that.  But what I would suggest is, if the legal arguments are the only ones, or if they are the principal ones about which we are going to disagree, then let us draft a Bill on extradition.  Let us draft a Bill, let it be an Extradition Treaty which would have to go through the Oireachtas. Let us then have it tested, no doubt, in the Supreme Court where it would have to be tested.  It is the function of the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There are an enormous number of armchair lawyers who say that things like this will be interpreted as unconstitutional and cannot be introduced because they are unconstitutional.  That is not our job and it is not our job to usurp it.  It is our job to make the law and then it can be referred to the Supreme Court if it is necessary.  This I regard as a red herring. I regard this as a terribly convenient camouflage for those who for other reasons do not like extradition.  At that stage if the judges find against the Bill, which I do not believe they would, but if they do, it is still open to the Government, any Government of the time, to take other action.  This Government certainly do not seem reluctant to hold referenda on less relevant and less necessary things.  If no Bill is drafted within a short period of time &mdash; which I suspect it will not &mdash; I will have great pleasure in introducing one in this House if I can get the necessary signatures.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the military and legal <Col N="758" /> aspects I should like to come now to the rather more important political effects which extradition would have.  I am privileged to be one of the six people in this House who actually has constituents who cross the political and religious divide in Northern Ireland, most of them, nearly all of them of moderate opinion on all sides.  I believe that the moderates of all communities find extradition the great running sore.  It is difficult to explain how strongly they feel about it.  There is no point in trying to appease the Paisleys or the extreme Protestants; giving extradition would in fact be an inconvenience to them because extradition is as useful to Ian Paisley as was internment to the Provisional IRA.  It is a propaganda weapon which he uses and it will not convince him of anything if we do it.  Take, for example, the Alliance Party, a party which crosses the political divide and has a large proportion of all religions in it. They say, quite openly, and have done for many years, that there can be no co-operation, no good neighbourliness with the Republic, unless we introduce extradition. They are the sort of people to whom the crusade introduced by Dr. FitzGerald was really trying to hold out the hand of friendship.  I find it regrettable again &mdash; and I cannot emphasise it any more &mdash; that the Fianna Fáil Party will not take a stand or are trying to avoid taking a stand on extradition today.  I can tell them without any doubt that ducking this running sore is not going to convince anybody in Northern Ireland.  If we are serious about unity of the country, if we are really serious about it, which is often doubtful, this is the <i>sine qua non</i> because they see us as possibly conniving with the Government.  They see us as possibly turning the blind eye on both sides of this House.  The onus is on us not only to condemn the Provisional IRA but to counter them.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind this House &mdash; and I think it is time that the House was reminded &mdash; that the Provisional IRA very cleverly have achieved one thing &mdash; abroad they give the impression that they act in our name, they claim to act in our name and they have succeeded outside this island in a great confusion of <Col N="759" /> identity.  In the United States this is particularly obvious, in Britain it is obvious, in Europe it is obvious &mdash; that there is confusion of identity between the Provisional IRA and the Irish people. The other thing which they have done which is so destructive is that they have discredited, successfully, unfortunately, the true tolerant pluralist republican tradition of which we should all be partakers. That is something which they have successfully achieved.  They have blurred the republican tradition which was an extremely tolerant noble republican one in this country.  I think there is nothing anti-republican or anti-Irish about extradition. Indeed I would see, if we united with the people of Northern Ireland in extraditing, that that would be a justifiable republican stance.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about Border security.  It is probably appropriate here to congratulate successive Governments for the last ten years on Border security.  There is no doubt that it has improved enormously.  Whether it is done out of any noble motives or whether it is done because successive Governments have seen that the threat from the Provisional IRA is as great to the Southern State as it is to the Northern State, I do not want to comment on, but I think there is probably an element of both in it.  I would have thought that one of the impetuses towards unity, the common interests which we could hold, is that if we identify and fight a common enemy we are much more likely to be a united people.  In this context I think I should make a comment on what Dr. Garret FitzGerald said in his Dimbleby Lecture and afterwards at the SDLP Conference in Belfast, both of which I attended, in which he suggested an all-Ireland police force and an all-Ireland court.  As regards an all-Ireland court &mdash; which I gather we will be talking about later &mdash; I personally feel that this is a non-starter, it is very long-term, it is impractical and has been dismissed unanimously by the Commission of Judges set up: in one page out of a book of 70 pages it was dismissed unanimously as impractical in immediate circumstances.  I believe <Col N="760" /> that this is the case.  I believe it is a procrastinating case and I believe that it will put off the day.  How many more murders are going to happen?  How many more men are going to go apprehended while we fiddle around waiting for civil servants and judges of all sides to come up with an all-Ireland court?  We would need to change the Constitution of the country for that.</P>

      <P>Well, the judges were of the opinion that we did.  I shall go on to talk now about an all-Ireland police force. The recent deterioration in Anglo-Irish relations, as a result of the Falklands crisis, has not in fact, luckily, disturbed in any way the relationship between the RUC and the Garda.  I do not want to say anything which is politically embarrassing to the other side but this is at a high point and a greater point of co-operation than at any stage since the foundation of the State.  On this we should build.  On this we should think seriously about an all-Ireland police force as a force towards unity.  If I may anticipate one of the more emotive points which will be made from the other side, I would like to anticpate the point, which I gather will be made, about the fear of the treatment that men will get in custody if they are handed over to the RUC, to the British Army or to the courts in Northern Ireland.  I do not think that we, in the Republic, should be casting the first stone on this.  Violence, of course, from all sides, whether it is from the Army or from the IRA, should be condemned.  But I do not think that the sins of the authorities in the past should justify the protection of murderers in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because I have been advocating extradition for several years I have been very interested and I have been attacked about this problem.  I have made investigations about it.  I am totally convinced that at present there is no organised brutality, there is no institutionalised brutality, ill treatment or torture going on in Northern Ireland.  Ever since the Bennett Report and the appointment of Mr. Jack Herman as Chief Constable there have <Col N="761" /> been few allegations even made in this regard, let alone any evidence of it.  Let us remember that the Government here, and successive Governments here, have quite rightly seen themselves as the protectors of those men in custody and, quite rightly, took Britain to the European Court in 1975 and, quite rightly got a result there.  The silence of recent Governments about what is going on with men in custody in Northern Ireland indicates surely that that is no longer the truth.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something also about the Diplock Courts.  I know that there are many who fear the handing over of men from here to the Diplock Courts. I believe, with many people in this House, that the Diplock Courts are wrong.  But remember that we operate in this country the Special Criminal Court which is an extremely effective but very undemocratic means of putting away terrorists. I should like to take this opportunity of asking the Minister if he would consider some time in the near future, and as soon as possible, abolishing the Special Criminal Court.  I believe that the Diplock Courts are wrong and that the Special Criminal Court is wrong.  Unfortunately, the price which we have to pay in a democracy is that our courts system is seen to be democratic, unfortunately, because occasionally &mdash; for the protection of the innocent &mdash; some guilty must go free.  It is a heavy price but I believe it is worth paying.  For instance, if the Diplock Courts were abolished in Northern Ireland would the Minister then consider extradition a more palatable solution?</P>
    <P>In summary, I would like to rest my case on extradition not on the legal arguments, because they are insoluble, but on the practical military value which this would have, on the fact that the people of Fermanagh, South Tyrone and Armagh could sleep easily in their beds; on the breakthrough and goodwill this would have with the moderate majority in Northern Ireland &mdash; I cannot emphasise that too much &mdash; the need to boost sagging Garda morale on this issue, which is quite obvious, on the changed circumstances in Northern Ireland where torture <Col N="762" /> is no longer practised, on the need to distinguish the noble republican traditions from the obscenities perpetrated by the IRA and another dramatic step forward in the long struggle for reconciliation. If we had this common objective we would begin to share a common identity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Representing an entirely different constituency from Senator Ross I am glad to support his motion, if only because the infirmities and inconsistencies of the present position should be pointed out.  Successive Governments, Coalition as well as Fianna Fáil, have not honestly faced up to the extradition issue. Only this week there are press reports &mdash; I cite the <i>Irish Times</i> of 6 July, 1982 &mdash; that the Government are still promoting their indefensible stand on this issue by putting pressure on all the Irish members of the European Assembly to maintain the present position on extradition. I do not know whether the non-Fianna Fáil members of the European Assembly will accept this pressure.  Although it is a British Tories' motion which is compelling us to face up to this issue, I suggest that there are times when our interests are identical with those of the British Tories. There are also times when they are diametrically opposite, as in the Falklands crisis, when there was no sense in our supporting a neo-imperialist adventure on the part of the British Tories.  On this issue we would do well to listen carefully to what the British Tories have to say in the Assembly this week.  It may well be that extradition is not a panacea for the ills of cross-Border terrorism.  This is a view which I heard the Northern Ireland Chief Constable express some months ago.  He is not necessarily rhapsodic about extradition as the final answer.</P>

      <P>His opinion was that the presentation of hard legal evidence is the nub of the problem, whether it is the Criminal (Jurisdiction) Act or whatever.  The difficulty of bringing evidence into court that will stand up is his problem.  I am not saying that I support this motion because I believe that extradition is a panacea.  Perhaps the situation calls for a combination of solutions of which extradition may be only a part. The important point is that our insistence on non-extradition for political offences must not be made a taboo or a sacred cow.  That is why I am glad we have an opportunity of discussing it freely and fully here.  No doubt Senator Robb will have more to say about the next point I make.  Northern Protestants regard our attitude on this matter as evidence of our real lack of interest in tackling the problem of terrorism and our lack of concern at the deadly predicament of their co-religionists in the Border area.  The perception of the Northern Protestants in this matter may be wrong, but there is no doubt that that perception is genuinely held and held with intense conviction. That is another reason why we must discuss this matter instead of fall back on spurious reasons why we cannot allow it to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important reason why I wish to support Senator Ross's motion is that I believe it is in the interests of this State that we should open our minds on the extradition issue.  Ultimately this is the State I am concerned about.  The most important reason for discussing this is that the terrorism we are talking about is, for the most part, not entirely &mdash; because we do not forget that our people have been the victims of gangs from the loyalist side &mdash; terrorism perpetrated by people who purport to act in our name, people who have a messianic conviction that they represent the real Irish people and some day in the future when all the horror is over the future Irish people will accept their obscenities as having been prophetically enacted in our name.  That is one of the most sinister traditions in Irish nationalism.  We in this State should do more to foil the designs of those whose actions contradict true republicanism and <Col N="764" /> whose ultimate strategy is the destruction of this State, whose ultimate objective is to create the wilderness of Eire nua and call it unity.  That is why I am glad to be able to support this motion.</P>
    <P>In both the present administration and its predecessor, the central constitutional argument is that non-extradition for political offences is the recognised principle in international law and, therefore, we cannot adjust our legislation accordingly. It would first of all contradict the prevailing norms in international law, it would also contradict the European Convention of 1957, and that it is unconstitutional. In regard to the first point, to practise non-extradition for political offences would be a violation of international law, I would cite the majesterial judgment of the then Chief Justice in 1952 in the State (Duggan <i>v.</i> Tapley) in which he argued compellingly that no principle of international law compels a State to withhold surrender of a fugitive political offender.</P>
    <P>We should make a distinction here between what is permitted and what is obligatory.  If one consults a cross-section of academic international jurists, who have no axe to grind, they will in all probability say that it has long been the practice in international law not to permit extradition for political offences but there is no obligation on any State to act accordingly.  The only thing which obliges a State to act in international law is the extradition treaty to which they subscribe bilaterally with another State.  We should look squarely in the face the spurious reason which successive Governments have given for not permitting the extradition of political offenders, that it would confound and violate the principles of international law.</P>
    <P>The other main argument has been that if we hand over so-called political offenders it would be in conflict with Article 29.3 of the Constitution.  If that is so it is another reason for looking afresh at our Constitution.  I never cease to be astonished at the number of occasions in Seanad Éireann when the infirmities and antiquities of our Constitution are revealed.  I do not accept that our present <Col N="765" /> practice about extradition, our refusing to hand over political offenders, is imposed upon us because of Article 29.3, although it is commonly put forward.</P>
    <P>In the newspaper report to which I referred already relating to the discussion in the European Assembly this week the phrase &ldquo;constitutional requirement&rdquo; was used.  On 30 April this year the papers carried a report of a discussion at the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly.  Once again, in relation to the reasons why we have not signed and ratified the European convention against terrorism, an omission which I consider to be disgraceful and scandalous, the weak excuse put forward was constitutional difficulties.</P>
    <P>Is this in fact true?  What does Article 29.3 of the Constitution say?  It says:</P>
    <P>Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States.</P>
    <P>Initially, in the 19th century the international conduct of States in matters of political offence recognised the desirability of protecting what one might call bona fide dissidents, that is to say those who were in protest against tyrannical regimes, whether they were the Bourbons in Sicily, the Romanoffs in Russia or, indeed, for much of the time the Pontiffs in the Papal States, but these were people so different from the latter day 20th century terrorist that they might as well be living in another planet.  I submit that the current interpretation of Article 29.3 is out of date.  Indeed, there may have been a time when the generally recognised principles of international law would have compelled us not to extradite political offenders.  We are a long way away from the world of early nineteenth century politics and the world of Sicilian tyrannies, we are into the late twentieth century with its unprecedented terrorism, with the appalling destructive power in hands of paramilitaries of various kinds who can not alone terrorise the citizens of their own State but who can terrorise the international community.</P>
    <P>There is another thing about Article 29 of the Constitution.  This may not be an <Col N="766" /> impressive judicial point but it is a commonsense one.  Sections 1 and 2 stress the specific resolution of international problems.  Surely to God, if we are talking about peace in sections 1 and 2 we must have a high regard for peace in section 3.  The constitutional argument simply does not stand up.  I know Senator Ross has said that this is a matter for the courts but I am beginning to wonder about this.  What is so sacred about the Constitution that someone with a reasonable degree of intelligence cannot spell out the commonsensical implications of it.</P>
    <P>I begin to be somewhat of a Protestant in my approach to Bunreacht na hÉireann and I believe in the value of private judgment.  You can amend the 1965 Act without falling foul of the Constitution. No one has ever actually put this to the test.  You could, for example, specifically amend it by saying &ldquo;OK, we will give sanction to political offenders, we will not tolerate a member of Sinn Féin, no matter how much we disagree with his philosophy, we will not tolerate him being pushed around because he holds the views he does, but by the same token we will more than willingly give him up if he has maimed and destroyed in our name.&rdquo;  I do not see why you cannot amend the Act by stressing the right of the political offender while absolutely insisting it is not to be done by any violence or, even if you have to permit some violence, you can then made a schedule of offences which you will not tolerate.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael amendment smacks of a deplorable moral cowardice entirely at odds with the high ideals professed by the Leader of the party when in this House he introduced his constitutional crusade which I enthusiastically supported.  Like Senator Ross I think the argument for an all Ireland court simply does not stand up at the moment.  It is a back door, anyway, to a kind of political unification and it is not acceptable for that reason, apart from the fact that it was convincingly dismissed unanimously by the Law Enforcement Commission.  The real reason why we do not want extradition is genuinely that we probably distrust the Northern Ireland <Col N="767" /> legal system.  It is not as specific as ours. There may be some grounds for that, but then we should say that.  We may be afraid that people may be extradited not to answer a specific charge but for questioning. I have misgivings also about the RUC.  Why should we assume that the mercies of the RUC are any less tender than our own Garda Síochána?  I am afraid that the real reason is the last Hibernian taboo &mdash; after all I know they have done awful things but are they not our boys and we cannot let them down like that.  Is that not the ultimate cop-out, to use a description which may be inelegant but very graphic?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Government&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;to consider urgently the best means of improving the position in regard to fugitive offenders and in particular to examine the feasibility of a single court with jurisdiction in all parts of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have been asked this evening to discuss the question of extradition.  We are not a debating society, we are a legislative House, we are part of Oireachtas Éireann.  We should approach this motion in a serious fashion; we should approach it in as calm a fashion as we can.  It was regrettable that Senator Ross spoke, in moving the motion, about those who had held responsibility in successive Governments as being guilty of &ldquo;silent, underhand connivance&rdquo; with the men of violence.  I do not think we can make progress in discussing this question if such accusations are to be made across the floor of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be careful in what we as Seanad Éireann say and place on the record and accordingly I am not prepared to vote this evening for any form of motion which does not unambiguously express a view that I hold.  I certainly do not hold the view that to reconsider extradition proceedings is the most effective means of combating cross-Border crime. There are many ways of combating cross-Border crime.  The high degree of <Col N="768" /> co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the RUC has, over the past few years, made remarkable and commendable progress in the control of cross-Border crime.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross has said that we are tolerating a position under which hundreds of men who should be extradited are walking around freely in this country.  I ask him whether he can substantiate the assertion that hundreds of men against whom evidence is available are walking around free?  That is the nub of this particular problem.  Extradition on evidence is something that can be rationally argued; extradition on suspicion is something that is not found in any State of our particular tradition.  We also are asked in this motion to take note of the recent position of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  Senator Ross referred to what they said in March at their annual conference.  Since then political parties have received a letter from the executive of this same association indicating what their present position is and their position in June certainly does not read in the same terms as their position in March.</P>

      <P>Indeed, the Garda have said in relation to the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act that the Northern authorities have not produced sufficient evidence for the South to proceed with prosecutions under this Act.  This has been the difficulty.  Would it be any better under extradition proceedings?  What is being sought?  Is it extradition for trial? Is it extradition as part of the judicial process which is what extradition legally is or are we being asked to consider extradition for questioning?  Extradition for trial is the only thing that properly can be considered and I think we have already seen a confusion here by Senator Ross in <Col N="769" /> this regard, or at the very best a failure to distinguish.  If we were, as both Senator Ross and Senator Murphy suggested, to introduce legislation which might alter the definition of political offence in regard to extradition we would have to be very careful on this point.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross said that extradition has never been debated in the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State.  I was in this House in 1965 when we debated an Extradition Bill and that particular measure makes a distinction between extradition to Britain or Northern Ireland and extradition to any other country.  In fact, the position of our law at the moment is that if we hand over an alleged criminal to Britain or to Northern Ireland we do it on the backing of a warrant, we do it without <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  Now, if we are to make any progress in this regard, if we are, in fact, to speak of any modification of the position in regard to extradition, it cannot be the handing over on the backing of warrants. We would have to bring our whole extradition law together in a uniform fashion.</P>
      <P>The problem of extradition is a most important and vital one both from the aspect of security and from the aspect of the relationships between the two communities in Ireland and between Britain and ourselves.  If we wanted to do something about extradition what could we do?  Well, one possibility would be to amend the Constitution.  Some people say it is the Constitution that stands in the way.  It is not.  All the Constitution says, as Senator Murphy pointed out, is that we adhere to the norms of international law.  I agree with Senator Murphy that the question here is &mdash; what is the norm of international law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could attempt to clarify this by judicial means.  The question has never been determined by the Supreme Court, only by the High Court and this could be remedied by taking a case to the Supreme Court from the High Court or by passing legislation which in my opinion would very quickly get to the Supreme Court, either referred to it by the President or else appealed to it on one of the first cases taken.  We would be in a better position <Col N="770" /> if we had a determination from our Supreme Court on this particular question.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of our amendment, we have put forward in our amendment that there should be immediate progress in an area on which immediate progress is possible.  Now it was said, both by Senator Ross and by Senator Murphy, that the idea which is being put forward by us was dismissed in a single page in the 1974 report of the Law Enforcement Commission.  That is not so.  The idea that is being put forward by us, the idea that was discussed between the British and Irish Governments during the term of the last Government, is something that was not at all considered by the 1974 Commission.</P>
    <P>Following the meeting of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in November 1981, they noted with approval the efforts being made under the criminal law (jurisdiction) legislation to ensure that those who had committed crime in one part of Ireland should not be able to escape prosecution and conviction by seeking refuge in the other and invited the two Attorneys General to consider what further improvement to this end might be possible.  Those discussions were held and discussion of the question continued up until the time that we left office.</P>
    <P>In this regard let me attempt to indicate what is proposed in this amendment. What is this concept of a single court or a joint court as distinct from the all-Ireland court which was rejected in a single page in the 1974 report?  It is an attempt to go beyond the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act of 1976.  That Act did establish extra territorial jurisdiction but, as has already been said, there were many problems.  There was the problem of taking of evidence which would have to be taken on a commission.  What is envisaged in this amendment is a court which would have twin jurisdictions rather than an all-Ireland court of single jurisdiction. An all-Ireland court of single jurisdiction, rightly dismissed in one page of the report would have to have an absolutely uniform system of law, would have <Col N="771" /> to have uniform procedure in regard to rules of evidence or it would not be able to operate, Quite rightly the Law Enforcement Commission indicated that the time which would be necessary to achieve this would indeed be far too long to think of in practical terms.  But this is not necessary; it would be possible to have a single court which would have jurisdiction throughout Ireland applying the laws and the procedures of this part of the country in this part of the country and applying the laws and the procedures of the other part of our country in the other part of the country.  Such a court could consist in any one case of two judges appointed from the place of sitting and one from the other part of Ireland. It would ordinarily sit at the place where the accused were in custody unless the accused consented to return to the place where the act of which they are accused was committed.  This proposal is something on which we can move.  This was something on which there had already been movement and this is something I feel that we must do.</P>
    <P>What we have put forward here is entirely in accord with the ideas which have been put forward by Deputy Garret FitzGerald and I would like to quote from his Dimbleby Lecture on Irish Identities, a copy of which I have placed in the Library.  He said there were two brief points he wanted to make before concluding:</P>
    <P>The first is that progress is most urgent, and I believed likely to be most acceptable, in the area of security.  Two lots of courts and two lots of police, divided by a Border which only the terrorist can cross with impunity, is a recipe for anarchy.  Surely we could put aside our differences and come together, under whatever umbrella of authority may be most effective for this purpose, whether Anglo-Irish or North-South, in order to face an all-Ireland terrorist movement with an all-Ireland judicial and policing system. No obstacles of constitutional theory or political prejudice, in either North or South, should stand in the <Col N="772" /> way of such a potentially effective step towards restoring peace in the island.</P>
    <P>What is proposed in the amendment is an organic growth from the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act of 1974 to a single court of the type described and then with increasing trust on either side further progress towards such questions as the joint questioning of suspects and with further development of trust and co-operation ultimately to a joint security force.  These are the directions in which we could move with profit.  They are the directions with which we should move without delay and I would urge the Government that the talks initiated by the last Government be continued with vigour and urgency.</P>

      <P>In urging the Government to reconsider in a cross-Border context the question of extradition, the sponsors of this motion appear to be proceeding on the assumption that extradition is solely a matter of Government policy &mdash; no different in this respect from any social or economic issue of the day &mdash; to be varied at the will of the Government if circumstances should so demand.  I want to say clearly and unequivocally in order to put the debate in context at the outset that if that is the assumption which underlies the attitude of the motion sponsors it is based on a very fundamental misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an instrument of mutual co-operation between sovereign states &mdash; this is what we are talking about here &mdash; extradition is rooted firmly in international law.  It cannot just be dismissed or gainsaid in any easy manner.  It is governed by well defined principles to which civilised states have generally given their assent.  It is as valid today as it was in earlier days.  Senator Murphy tried to draw some distinction between modern age and earlier times.  One of these basic principles that has withstood the test of time is that extradition is not granted for political offences.  That principle has <Col N="773" /> been widely accepted for a very long time and is now deeply embedded in international jurisprudence and, in particular, in regard to the international jurisprudence relating to extradition.  All the states of Europe, including the United Kingdom, accept the principle in full and, as far as I am aware, it is reflected in every treaty &mdash; whether of a bilateral or multilateral nature &mdash; that exists between the states of Europe.</P>
    <P>The most important of these treaties is the European Convention on Extradition which was concluded in 1957 between the member states of the Council of Europe and which came into force in 1960.  Article 3 of that Convention states that extradition:</P>
    <P>...shall not be granted if the offence in respect of which it is requested is regarded by the requested party as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence.</P>
    <P>The House will note that the Convention uses the mandatory &ldquo;shall&rdquo;&mdash; not the permissive &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; in this article, making it abundantly clear that extradition for political offences is not allowed under the Convention.  Eighteen of the 21 member states of the Council of Europe have either signed or ratified the Convention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. There is a special arrangement we have with the United Kingdom which was referred to by Senator Dooge.  Ireland ratified it in 1966, effect having been given to the Convention in Irish law by the Extradition Act of the previous year, 1965, which I was glad to have piloted through this House at the time.  Section 11 of the 1965 Act is in substantially the same language as Article 3 of the Convention, placing an absolute prohibition on extradition for political offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our section of the 1965 Act is in exact terms as the Convention ratified by the states of the Council of Europe.  In so far as extradition with the UK is concerned &mdash; here is the point &mdash; though this is not <Col N="774" /> based on the European Convention as such, the position in relation to political offences is substantially the same.  In other words, we have under that legislation a bilateral arrangement with the United Kingdom that is on all fours with the arrangements under the European Convention we have with other states of Europe.  Part III of the Extradition Act 1965, which contains the legal framework for the backing of warrants system that operates between the UK and ourselves, specifically prohibits the execution of a British or Northern Ireland warrant if that is for a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the passage of our legislation in 1965 through the Dáil and the Seanad corresponding British legislation passed through the House of Commons and the House of Lords, that is the Backing of Warrants (Republic of Ireland) Act, 1965, and it has precisely the same effect.</P>
    <P>We are not just talking about Ireland and other European states, we are talking about specific legislation enacted by the UK in the same year as we enacted our legislation and specific legislative arrangements that apply in the United Kingdom as much as in the Republic of Ireland and apply between Ireland and the European states to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>This is the statutory basis, both international and domestic, of our law relating to extradition for political offences.  It is not, however, the full picture.  The most important point for present purposes is that successive Governments here have been advised, whenever this question has arisen as an issue, that the principle of non-extradition for political offences is a generally recognised principle of international law binding on the State under Article 29.3 of the Constitution.  This means that the State is precluded, without breach of the Constitution, from entering into an extradition arrangement which would allow politically motivated offenders to be extradited.  Such a course would obviously be unthinkable for any Government here.</P>
    <P>Along with the statutory arrangement <Col N="775" /> of the Extradition Act we have our particular and specific adherence to international law written into Article 29 of the Constitution.  Those, in my view, are very important safeguards in our Constitution and matters not to be treated lightly in any way.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to emphasise in this regard the fundamental &mdash; because it is fundamental &mdash; nature of the obstacle to the course of action called for in the motion.  I also want to draw attention to the fact that this is not a new problem as far as Irish Governments are concerned. The legal advice available to successive Governments has been to the same effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">

      <P>It should be clear, therefore, that there is little point in the Seanad adopting a motion in terms which call on the Government to take action along these lines when it is clearly not within the powers of the Government to do that.  Moreover, at present there is in my view general acceptance that the non-extradition law for political offences, which, as I have said, is the general rule throughout Europe and, indeed, in many parts of the world, is the correct one.  We are not alone in this.  We are adopting a common view that has withstood the test of centuries in practically every democratic country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having dealt with the legal position, I now want to deal with another assumption implicit in the motion, that extradition is the key to the solution of the problem of cross-Border difficulties and crimes.  Extradition is only one method of dealing with fugitive criminals.  It is by no means the only one, and in the circumstances that prevail in the Ireland of today it is very debatable indeed whether it would be any more effective than the means which we now have.  The alternative of putting the offender on trial in the jurisdiction in which he is apprehended <Col N="776" />&mdash; which is the scheme enacted in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 &mdash; is also capable of dealing with the problem and gets over the major difficulty about politically motivated crime.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of loose talk about people wanted in Northern Ireland for serious crimes walking the streets here. It is a popular motif in the less credible organs of Fleet Street.  It is even said that there are hundreds of them.  Let us be clear on this.  There may be a small number of people who are at liberty down here and in respect of whom evidence is available that they committed offences across the Border before the 1976 Act came into operation.  We could not then and we would not now, or at that time, make such a piece of legislation retrospective. If such is the case, the regettable fact is that &mdash; as a matter of law &mdash; nothing can be done about it short of making the 1976 Act retrospective.  There are only one or two people in this category.  The reason for this is that the 1976 Act was not retrospective in its application, that is to say, offences committed in the North before the 1976 Act were not offences under our law, and we cannot proceed against any such people.  Indeed, there is a specific constitutional prohibition on declaring acts to be infringements of the law that were not so at the date of their commission.  So far as crimes committed after 1976 are concerned &mdash; that is the realistic position we are in now six years afterwards.  The position is that successive Governments have made it clear time and again that the 1976 Act will be used to deal with cross-Border offenders whenever the evidence &mdash; I emphasise the word evidence which Senator Dooge referred to earlier &mdash; is made available to enable us to put them on trial.</P>
    <P>When evidence has been made available &mdash; we should bear in mind in this connection that there is provision for the taking of evidence on commission in Northern Ireland under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act &mdash; the law has been invoked in recent cases to prosecute in our courts persons arrested down here for offences alleged to have been committed in Northern Ireland.  I have no doubt that the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) <Col N="777" /> Act will continue to be successfully applied so long as the necessary evidence is made available.  We are not talking about automatically arresting people and bringing them to trial but about arresting people on the basis of evidence on which they can be brought to trial.  No state would operate any jurisdictional exchange legislation of this kind except on the basis of evidence sufficient to justify arrest in the circumstances I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that with the particular type of crime involved it is often not easy to get evidence sufficient to put the offender on trial, but this is not a difficulty peculiar to proceeding here under the 1976 Act.  It also applies to extradition itself.  If one has to talk about an extradition method of dealing with it evidence would have to be the basis which an extradition application would be brought in the courts.  There is an effective alternative and, as I have said, we for our part have demonstrated our willingness to use it.  It is under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  The extradition issue has, however, been used in some quarters against us for political reasons as allegedly exemplifying that we are soft on subversive criminals and that we are deliberately allowing our territory to be used as a safe haven for those who perpetrate crimes of violence in Northern Ireland.  This again is part of the cheaper Fleet Street syndrome of criticism in regard to Ireland. Anyone who has bothered even casually to look at the legal measures which have been taken under successive Governments to combat subversive crime will know that that is not true.  We have, when required, taken the necessary measures. Such a person cannot be under any illusion about our determination to take every possible measure to ensure that fugitive offenders do not go unpunished if they are apprehended down here.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to mention that the Minister for Justice is not in the House today because he is unveiling a plaque to the memory of Garda Personnel in Castlerea who participated in a positive way in regard to subversives acting in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Our security forces have acted with full <Col N="778" /> authority whenever required, and all the communications and understandings we have with the British security forces are to the effect that security co-operation is working excellently between the security authorities of both jurisdictions.  In this context it should be stated that nine years ago we brought in the Special Criminal Court legislation.  There may be differences of opinion about it, but it was certainly strong legislation at the time.  We brought it in to deal with this problem and successive Governments have retained that court system with a view to dealing with it.  I want to emphasise those points because sometimes, under the thrust of a debate about extradition, it is not understood clearly that we are doing the positive things, in particular, in strengthening our courts system to deal with the problem and with regard to security co-operation with the Northern Ireland and British authorities.  In addition to those two positive areas we have the criminal law jurisdiction legislation. The first two areas, in my view, are more positive and of greater thrust and capacity to deal with the problem than legislation itself.  Extradition is a very small element in this overall equation, if any element at all.  I have shown that the criminal law jurisdiction legislation of itself is sufficient to fill that gap.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to the views of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  While the association did pass a motion at their annual conference at Bantry seeking, in their words, &ldquo;a review of the constitutional and legislative conditions governing extradition&rdquo; the Minister for Justice, Deputies and Senators, recently received a communication from the association which indicates that they have reconsidered their position on this matter.  After the Bantry conference the question of extradition for political offences was re-examined and they have now stated their position which, in fairness, I think I ought to put on the record:</P>
    <P>The refusal to extradite a person from one country to another, because the offence claimed is of a political character, is a fundamental principle of international law to which Ireland <Col N="779" /> unreservedly subscribes and has quite correctly provided for under her Constitition.</P>
    <P>They went on to say:</P>
    <P>It is not feasible for Ireland to consider unilaterally amending its Constitution, and consequently its laws, to exclude such a basic international concept, which continues to be observed by the rest of the international community. We cannot simply subscribe only to those tenets of international law that suit us.</P>
    <P>As regards the amendment put down by Senators Dooge and Reynolds which calls on the Government to consider the best means of improving the position in regard to fugitive offenders and in particular to examine the feasibility of a single court with jurisdiction in all parts of Ireland, we consider that this is a much more acceptable approach to the problem of cross-Border crime.  It is right in principle that we should look at the present position to see whether improvement is possible &mdash; of course, it is always possible in the area of security &mdash; in particular to see whether action can be taken by the Government in this regard on their own authority.  Again &mdash; and this is an ongoing matter &mdash; we can update our security, improve our arrangements and so on.  Accordingly, we accept what the first part of the amendment seeks.  As regards the question of an all-Ireland court, we agree, and always have agreed, that this would be a most desirable development. Indeed, it is something that this Government have consistently supported over the years.  However, it must be acknowledged &mdash; I believe the sponsors of the amendment will agree &mdash; that it is not a matter that could be attained by the unilateral action of the Government, indeed of any Government.  It necessarily implies consent on the other side.  The whole motion of an international court is one that, in my view, represents the only really fundamental objective to which we should seek to attain in our circumstances.  Such a court would act as an umbrella for all of the <Col N="780" /> police questioning and procedure problems, security problems and security aspects, all the matters that inevitably obtain within the two systems that operate in this island today.  All these matters would naturally fall within an overall all-Ireland court to be examined and investigated, if required, in a particular situation.  It is essential to have an all-Ireland court as a pre-condition or prerequisite of any further coming together in this whole area of policing and security.</P>
    <P>Of course, there must be consent in this matter.  This is not a matter for unilateral movement by Ireland, it is a matter for bilateral, trilateral or whatever number of arrangements one can envisage in regard to this matter.  It is a matter for the United Kingdom and Irish Governments and the two communities in Northern Ireland.  One is really talking about a quadrilateral type of arrangement and discussion that would lead to such an all-Ireland court situation to supervise the whole of this difficult and complex area.  That is the way we should be going.  We have existing procedures. We work in co-operation with the British authorities in regard to security in this area, and it is as well to strengthen aspects of co-operation on a pragmatic level between the two jurisdictions, the two Governments, to ensure that the system within our jurisdiction is as efficient as possible and that we work eventually towards an all-Ireland court that can supervise joint procedures in the future.</P>
    <P>In so far as the motion requests the Government to take action which could further the attainment of an all-Ireland court it is fully acceptable to us.  We join with the sponsors of the amendment in asking the House to endorse it as well as endorsing the earlier part of the amendment, asking that we urgently consider the best means of improving the position with regard to fugitive offenders.  This is a matter that can always be improved.  I ask the House to adopt the two elements in the amendment and reject the motion on the basis that it is not a practical way forward in our present situation.  Clearly, it runs counter to the international obligations <Col N="781" /> and international law to which a sovereign state must subscribe.</P>

      <P>In speaking to the amendment it is fair to say that we welcome the placing of the motion on the Order Paper to give us an opportunity to outline our stand on the emotive question of extradition as we know it.  It is a matter of deep concern to us that the Garda authorities at their conference in Bantry &mdash; I was closely associated with members of that body &mdash; talked about the possibility of reviewing the whole question of extradition.  It is true to say that because the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 could not be made retrospective the Garda authorities were aware that people who had committed crimes previously could not be apprehended under that law.  They felt a basic inability to be able to perform the duties for which we hold them responsible.  I am glad the Minister has referred to that aspect of the 1976 Act because we can see their frustrations in this field in that they were unable to carry on under the existing law and apprehend known perpetrators of violence.</P>
      <P>We welcome the opportunity to debate this motion because relations between Britain and Ireland at present are in need of some gesture of goodwill.  The fact that the Seanad debates a motion like this gives an opportunity to the press, and the British press in particular, to hear the sentiments expressed by the movers of the motion.  I respect their views because they have inbuilt fundamental philosophies about the reasons why they felt extradition is now a necessity.  Reading the Minister's statement, and Senator Dooge's contribution in putting the Fine Gael side, the British Government will realise that the question of extradition, although it can be used emotively by some sections of the British press, is not just a simple lack of commitment on our part to do something constructive about people who we all agree should be brought to heel as a result of some of the extraordinary crimes they have committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well that the British, and the British press, recognise the constitutional <Col N="782" /> embargo that is on us and accept that the non-implementation of extradition laws does not show a lack of concern for the problem we are faced with.  The Labour Party today discussed this important motion at length.  Our party is affiliated with many international labour and socialist groups and we are conscious of the fact that it is fundamental international law that political prisoners are not extradited.  We accept that law and as a party we are against implementing a law that would overlook the rights of political prisoners.  Political prisoners here can be of one description, but we can identify with some political prisoners in other parts of the world very easily.  In some countries people are oppressed by dictatorships or extreme right-wing movements.  It is important for us as a small party to ensure that fundamental international law is protected.</P>
    <P>There is a rather unfortunate situation here because of the political Border that divides our people in that so many people hide behind a smokescreen of political activities and carry out the most horrific crimes in our name.  Without our permission and a mandate from our people they bomb and kill off innocent people going about their ordinary everyday chores, whether they be at work, at play or shopping or other normal activities.  The people who carry out bombings and indiscriminate murders say they do so on the basis of a political crime, but that is something we all abhor.  It is one of the reasons why the sponsors of the motion feel they are justified in asking that action be taken in the field of extradition.</P>
    <P>Accepting the fact that there are meanings in the words &ldquo;political activities&rdquo; that allow these people to claim this privilege under the Constitution, our party went along in 1975 and 1976 with the Government in implementing the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  The Minister, Deputy Lenihan, was the Leader of the Opposition in this House at the time, and he opposed and defended certain rights of political prisoners during that debate on the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill on the basis that he felt it was coming very close to the rights and privileges of individuals who could be moved <Col N="783" /> across the Border or <i>vice versa.</i>  Our party went along with that Bill because we felt there was a crying need, particularly after the agreements at Sunningdale and the fall of all the institutions in the North of Ireland, for some positive gesture by the Government in the Twenty-six Counties at the time.  Indeed, Deputy Cooney, then Minister for Justice, in proposing that the Bill be read a Second Time on 24 April 1975, column 450 of the Seanad Official Report said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed primarily to deal with the fugitive criminal who is able to avoid being extradited by successfully claiming the political exemption which the extradition process allows. It has its genesis in the Sunningdale Conference of late 1973 when all parties there &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; and all parties were there representing the minority in the North, the Government of the South and the British Government</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash; which represented all shades of responsible constitutional political opinion in this island agreed on the dire necessity for an answer to this problem.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Deputy Lenihan I could quote several extracts from his contribution which would agree with that and talked about the possibility of an all-Ireland court or a court to serve the all-Ireland situation.  He quoted also from the Sunningdale Agreement which was very relevant at the time.  I feel that in fairness to Deputy Lenihan, as he is present today, I should quote from a contribution he made in that debate in which he said, and he was quoting paragraph 10 from the Sunningdale Agreement:</P>
    <P>Among them were the amendment of legislation operating in the two jurisdictions on extradition; the creation of a common law enforcement area in which an all-Ireland court would have jurisdiction, and the extension of the jurisdiction of domestic courts so as to enable them to try offences committed outside this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> It was agreed that problems of considerable legal complexity were involved and that the British and Irish Governments would jointly set up a commission to consider all the proposals put forward at the conference in Sunningdale and to recommend as a matter of urgency the most effective means of dealing with those who commit these crimes.  There is obviously a commitment on all sides in this House, whether we agree with extradition or disagree with it, that something needs to be done to bring the perpetrators of these crimes even if they are purported to be in a political cause &mdash; which all of us refute.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge has mentioned that recent discussions with the British Government would raise the possibility of a court dealing with these cases not in a constitutional way but in a non-constitutional way that could effectively deal with this matter.  I think the public would agree that something of this kind should be set up; some area should be agreed between us as political organs in this country so that as democratic political parties we outlaw violence completely and within the framework of our existing Constitution we try to ensure that whatever legal structures can be set up should be set up without delay.  My party would recommend that the amendment would be accepted in the hope that it would be a step forward in this fundamental area of constitutional law.</P>

      <P>I am sure if I were to ask the people of this part of Ireland &mdash; in fact any part of Ireland &mdash; if they <Col N="785" /> approved of murder, 99.99 per cent would pronounce their unequivocal disapproval. I am sure if I were to ask if the people of Ireland would like those who are guilty of murder taken out of society so they cannot repeat the act 99.99 per cent would say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  But if I were to point out that many men with legal training will state that extradition is the best way of obtaining conviction of the guilty &mdash; and I stress the guilty &mdash; and ask whether the people of Ireland would vote for extradition the percentage would drop quite dramatically.</P>
      <P>The reason for that is not hard to find, because extradition is not just a legal problem.  One has to weigh in the balance the moral issues, the emotional issue &mdash; that is the issue of extraditing into that part of Ireland which still represents, in the consciousness of traditional Irish republican thinking, the last element of British imperial control in this island &mdash; and also the political problem of extraditing into a part of Ireland where there is, as yet, alas, no consensus.  Should the forces of law and order come down as angels from heaven in Northern Ireland, at times of sectarian or social stress they would be perceived or perhaps even portrayed as the oppressors in one sense and the protectors of the institutions of the State in the other.  So, we have a problem then that is legal, moral, emotional, and in the final analysis I would suggest it is a political problem.  So, I would ask fellow Senators today to weigh with yourselves what proves you by conscience in relation to how you feel for your offended fellow-Irishmen and what proves you by consciousness in relation to your political historical consciousness before the bitter legacy of Irish history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go further I will hold up this map of the County of Armagh from which my fellow Senator here comes and who can speak much more realistically about what is happening.  The orange circles represent Protestant Irishmen who have been killed in the last ten years; the green circles are Catholic Irishmen who have been killed in the last ten years and the blue circles members of the British regular forces who have been killed in the last ten years.  No one will pretend <Col N="786" /> that all of these people or even more than a small percentage came from across the Border.  But I say to you that there is a great human tragedy being fought out and you have to ask yourselves in relation to the future of Ireland and to how we see a settlement in Ireland, as to what role you are now prepared to play to deal with the threatened vulnerable consciousness of those people in Ireland who are most reticent at the present moment to entertain the sort of Ireland which you and I would like to live in.</P>
    <P>I feel, therefore, before I get into the meat of the subject, that because I believe passionately in the creation of a new Ireland, because I see in that the opportunity for social change and because I have articulated the need in the North of Ireland for legal justice, I can therefore start by first appealing to INLA and PIRA to call a ceasefire to enable the sort of strategy which we have articulated this year &mdash; and which was mentioned at the recent SDLP Conference &mdash; to operate so that we can create a settlement in Ireland &mdash; because it is settlement, not extradition, that will finally lay this thing to rest.</P>
    <P>But in the meantime people die, people are murdered in front of their wives, coming out of their workplaces, coming out of their places of worship. They are murdered before their children in their front rooms, in their parlours. These are not wealthy people of great influence; these are the men and women of little or no property whose only crime may have been that as an unemployed member of the Irish polity they had uniforms on their backs.  I am asking Senators, therefore, to consider cross-Border crime but particularly to consider how we are going to stop cross-Border murder. You have your part to play and so have we.  We in the North have to look at the special rules &mdash; they have already been mentioned &mdash; in relation to arrest, the means of interrogation, the admissibility of confessions and the whole Diplock system as to whether cases should not be scheduled rather than descheduled as they are at present.  Therefore, we have reservations.  Certainly, you will all have reservations &mdash; your <Col N="787" /> consciousness as Irishmen, and lack of consensus in the north, the social alienation which is increasingly mounting throughout the island, north and south. We have our misgivings &mdash; I have mentioned some of them.  Then when we come to debate this we find that we look at the principle of asylum and we look across the water and we see that Britain has been the champion of political asylum for political offences for the last hundred years.  In the thirties the League of Nations extradition for political offences was unacceptable to the British.  In 1960, in reciprocal legislation at the time of Ireland's signing of the European Convention on Extradition the British stated again that they found extradition unacceptable for political offences.  In 1962 they would not even sign the United Nations convention on genocide because mandatory extradition was included in the statute, and in 1965 at the time of the passing of the Extradition Act, Sir Dingle Foot made the same point and pointed out to the tradition which went back to 1870.</P>
    <P>Extradition to Ireland, as quoted by him might be refused where the offence was in an act of a political character.  In Europe we have a European Convention on Extradition of 1957 to which some allusion has been made, and in the United States of America, as far back as 1792 Thomas Jefferson said treason was sufficiently punished by exile.  In Ireland the Taoiseach of 1955 made the same point.  So that there is, in fact, a substantial body of opinion which rejects the idea of extradition for political offences.  It is therefore easy to understand Article 29 (3) of the Constitution.  Ireland accepts the general principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relation with other States.  But it is far from certain that such a generally acceptable principle does in fact exist that forbids extradition of political offenders.  There is much divided opinion on this.  Let me mention the eminent Chief Justice Maguire and the various judgments following his statement. There is the judgment of Duggan <i>v.</i> Tapley 1952, O Laighléis <i>v.</i> the State <Col N="788" /> 1962, and in 1966 Sumers Jennings <i>v.</i> Furlong which make the same point.</P>
    <P>One aspect has not been mentioned here this afternoon &mdash; the fundamental change that has come about in Europe as a result of international terrorism.  Only one Member said it is a disgrace that Ireland has not signed the European Convention.  I would agree and endorse that.  No one has alluded to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. Article 1 of that Convention specifies those acts which can no longer claim political, immunity and in particular, in Article 1 (e) they specify the sort of acts which are taking place daily in Northern Ireland.  In case you have misgivings about signing it, if you go to Article 5 in the European Convention on the Supression of Terrorism there is a get-out clause &mdash; any State that is concerned about extradition into another State in which there is a risk that either punishment or prosecution will take place on the grounds of religious, racial prejudice or on the grounds of political thought can be excluded from the provisions of Article 1 and the extension of Article 1 in Article 2.  There is, in fact, considerable ground and increasing international opinion for the extradition of people who are claiming political immunity for offences which come within the definition of terrorism.</P>
    <P>Article 28.3.3 of the Constitution states that any law enacted by the Oireachtas which is expressly for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion cannot be invalidated by invoking the Constitution.  This Article goes on to define time of war to include a time when there is taking place an armed conflict in which the State is not a participant but in respect of which each of the Houses of the Oireachtas shall have resolved that arising out of the armed conflict a national emergency exists affecting the visual interests of the State.  This was invoked at the time of the assassination of the British Ambassador and this, I would maintain, exists today when Dr. FitzGerald, the Leader of the Opposition, stated &mdash; here I stand to be corrected &mdash; that either dozens or <Col N="789" /> hundreds of IRA men were being exported from the northern situation into the Republic.  If that does not constitute a slight emergency for this State then I do not know what does.</P>
    <P>Sunningdale has been mentioned, and I would remind Senators that at Sunningdale paragraph 10 of the joint communique states that it was agreed by all parties that persons committing crimes of violence however motivated in any part of Ireland should be brought to trial irrespective of the part in which they were located.  Therefore, we have to ask ourselves have people been brought to justice who have been guilty of crimes of violence?  Certainly, since the 1965 Extradition Act people who have committed ordinary crimes have been brought to justice.  Certainly, since the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act was passed in 1976 people who have committed crime, be it political or otherwise, are no longer immune no matter where they committed that crime in Ireland.  But the legislation has not worked, and it has not worked for a number of reasons.  One of these I would say is the problem of the reluctant witness.  Another is the problem of collecting the evidence that you need for a confession, and this brings about the next point.  How do you determine that a confession is voluntary?  If you look at the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 3, you will find that it is determined there that you must not contravene a code which excludes torture, degrading or inhuman treatment, and if you only stick to that code you have a lot of scope left for wrapping up and verballing, as it is called in the north of Ireland.  Therefore, if we are pursuing extradition we must consider on what grounds we are pursuing it and under what conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I would therefore conclude by saying that extradition is tied up with the need for an Irish settlement, with legal justice in Northern Ireland, but above all else it is symbolic to the people of Northern Ireland who <Col N="790" /> must be persuaded that you are serious when you want to woo them into Ireland. You cannot want to marry us and at the same time allow people to murder us.  It is as simple as that.  When you speak to the relatives of people who have been murdered or mown down in Northern Ireland you find that they feel deeply about the fact that people can come to the Republic and can have a haven there.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I will conclude, a Cathaoirligh, by saying that as far as I am concerned, and I feel very strongly about this, I will support Senator Ross in his introduction of a Bill to amend the Extradition Act of 1965, section 50, for the purpose of excluding from the category of offences in which the claim of political offences may be raised, all offences committed in Northern Ireland which are scheduled in the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  If passed, it may be referred to the Supreme Court by the President; if, however, the President signs it and it becomes law its application can still be challenged in the ordinary way before the courts.  Northern opinion will watch for the response to this in the Seanad as a practical, pro-life statement designed to counteract the murder campaign they are enduring.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that Senators Ross, Murphy and Robb have brought this motion before the House.  It enables us on this side of the House to clear up some misconceptions, to nail some canards and untruths and to state clearly what our attitude is to the question of extradiction for political offences to Northern Ireland or indeed to any other part of the world, the United Kingdom, Europe, America.  One thing bothers me about the motion.  That is the reference to the position of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors. I am the son of a garda and it was always a tradition that members of the Garda &mdash; particularly serving members &mdash; did not involve themselves in politics.  They have a special position in our society; they have a special relationship with all <Col N="791" /> Governments.  I say this with regret but it should be said: I do not believe that policemen should involve themselves in political, public controversies.</P>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Senators Dooge and Reynolds is one which we will not oppose because the concept of an all-Ireland court is one with which we would agree.  However, if Senator Dooge really believes what he said in the House, and I am sure he does, what he should have done is to have brought forward a motion of his own and debate it in this House rather than introduce it as an amendment to the motion in the name of Senators Ross, Murphy and Robb. This is a crafty amendment because if it succeeds &mdash; which it will &mdash; the motion will fall and Fine Gael will be saved from having to vote against extradition, thereby having the best of both worlds. Deputy FitzGerald will be able to continue as the darling and the favourite son of the British media and at the same time he will not have antagonised any sector of opinion in Ireland.  He can continue to appear as a custodian of the Constitution.  I would like some speaker on behalf of Fine Gael to spell out again for the benefit of this House what precisely their position is on extradition for political offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of confusion in the minds of commentators and people involved in Irish affairs as to what extradition is or what it is not.  Extradition is a procedure of international judicial assistance to enable states to obtain the surrender of suspected or convicted criminals who are or who have fled abroad.  Extradition is sometimes thought of as being an aspect of municipal law rather than a part of international law.  This is because until recently there were very few multilateral agreements covering extradition, and all of the agreements were bilateral.  The subject spans both national and international law and raises for many states, including our own, the complex questions of constitutional justice.  Our position and the position of our courts on extradition has been that Article 29.3 of the Constitution provides that Ireland accept the generally recognised principles of <Col N="792" /> international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other states.</P>
    <P>Our courts have considered that one of these generally recognised principles of international law is the principle of non-extradition for political offences.  The Irish extradition legislation is embodied in the Extradition Act, 1965.  That Act is based on the provisions of the European Convention on Extradition to which Ireland is a party but to which the United Kingdom is not.  The Convention enshrines the principle of non-extradition for political offences.  It has been ratified by and is applicable as between Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Federal Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.</P>
    <P>Before there can be extradition in respect of any offence covered by a statutory provision, there must first be a warrant.  One should be able to assume that no warrant is issued by any judicial authority for anybody's apprehension unless sufficient evidence has been adduced before that judicial authority to satisfy it that there is a case warranting the arrest of that person for an offence. To present warrants for extradition which are solely or principally for the purpose of interrogating the person sought would be a gross abuse of the process of extradition. Yet, that is apparently what some people seem to think that extradition is about when they come to speak of fugitive political offenders in their hundreds who are within our jurisdiction in this State.  When other countries seek the extradition of a person in a British court, not merely is such a practice not tolerated but under the British Extradition Act the requesting country is obliged to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case before any extradition would be contemplated or ordered.  It is believed that the reason the United Kingdom did not become a party to the European Convention on Extradition was because that convention did not require the establishment of <i>prima facie</i> evidence. Therefore, it would appear that among certain elements in the British establishment and Government &mdash; and not for the first time &mdash; the people who argue the so-called British case for extradition <Col N="793" /> have a double set of standards, one to apply to the Irish and one to apply to everybody else.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross mentioned that extradition was part of our mythology.  I say that it is not part of our mythology.  It is part of our law and our Constitution and is not in any way mythological.  All parties, from the beginning of this State, have accepted that.  In 1955, John A. Costello, himself a distinguished lawyer, stated in the Dáil that the question of extradition stands and is governed by the principles and practices of international law.  This is something which the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Parties have accepted, something which the lawyers who argued our case at the Commission on Law Enforcement and who made a report to the Minister for Justice and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, have accepted.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy made the point that the Tapley case went against this view.  In their arguments, Mr. Justice Walsh, Mr. Justice Henchy, and Mr. Doyle and Mr. O'Quigley who wrote that report effectively demolished that argument.  It is in that report if anybody wants to read it.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of extradition to Northern Ireland which are of a political rather than a constitutional nature.  There is the question of an impartial police force, an impartial Judiciary and of the whole structure of society in the Northern State.  There is the question of the way in which the jobs, the professions have been organised.  The point was made in this House that we should do more in this State.  In my view we have done an enormous amount over the years.  We have changed our laws; we have introduced special courts and we have introduced many other measures here towards the protection of human life along the Border areas.  We have spent enormous sums of money on our police forces, much more in relation to our resources than has been spent by the UK Government.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to move away from that area and to move on to the question of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act which is the effective instrument covering fugitive offenders in this State.  This was <Col N="794" /> set up after the Sunningdale Conference in 1973.  It is a system which was recommended by the Law Enforcement Commission to both Governments.  It is a system that has not worked as well as it might, perhaps, but we must ask ourselves why that is so.  My view is that for certain political reasons the authorities in Northern Ireland did not wish to see it working and for many years effectively boycotted the procedures.  There are questions that civilian witnesses might or might not have been willing to come forward, but there were provisions in this legislation which enabled evidence to be taken on commission.  In recent times this legislation has been used, and used successfully.</P>
    <P>Since 1976 nine persons have been tried for extra-territorial offences, and most of these in fairly recent years: six were convicted and three were acquitted. They were charged with murder, and the Supreme Court ordered that the three be released, nothing that the prosecution had not established a case against them.  In addition there are three other Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act cases pending at the moment.  The murder cases are being instituted under the parallel British Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  The first prosecution involved five persons charged with murder and two with offences connected with abduction.  These successful prosecutions for extra-territiorial offences are evidence of the view that the absence of extradition for political offences is not a bar to the successful prosecution and imprisonment of those who commit serious crimes in one jurisdiction and flee to the other.  There is no doubt in my view that the relevant legislation can continue to be successfully applied where the Northern Ireland authorities simply supply evidence that persons residing in the jurisdiction of the State have committed offences in Northern Ireland.  We are back to this question again which was raised by other Senators, that it is only where the evidence is available. If the evidence is available they will be tried in this country on foot of evidence supplied by the Northern Ireland authorities and if the evidence is substantial <Col N="795" /> and sufficient they will be convicted and put away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>What strikes me first in this discussion is that if 200 people had been killed in a single county on our side of the Border no obstacle would be regarded as fundamental in dealing with the problems of bringing the fugitives to justice.  I am not very impressed with all the legal arguments saying why we can or cannot take a particular course, because if we really desired to do something then we could find a way to do it.</P>
      <P>I believe that what motivates the movers of this motion is the desire to stop the hideous spate of killings along the Border. The movers of the motion were perfectly correct in suggesting that we should examine our extradition procedures and see if a modified form of extradition can be clasified as a constructive step towards stopping the hideous killings along the Border, and certainly for most of these crimes it seems that the hearsay evidence points to the fact that the murderers move back across to this side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of those people who believe that the fundamental political problems of this island stem from partition.  On the other hand, being absolutely realistic I do not see an immediate solution to our constitutional problem.  I would like to do so but I do not think it is on the cards for the near future.  Therefore, we must be realistic and then face up to the consequences. We must examine the problems which the Border poses particularly in terms of security, and if we can improve our legal practices we should do so.  I am in favour of the motion but I must say first that I interpret extradition as being extradition when there is sufficient evidence to justify such extradition. Not only that but I think there must be an examination of the available evidence by the country which is doing the extraditing. In other words I do not believe that you can just extradite suspects purely on suspicion.  One has got to have a <i>a priori</i> examination of the <i>prima facie</i> evidence. This means establishing some sort of structures.  I do not take the view taken <Col N="796" /> by Senator Ross and Senator Murphy in totally rejecting the Fine Gael amendment although the amendment itself as spelled out here would not commend itself to me: what Senator Dooge said in explanation of his amendment was something that we should examine carefully, because the feasibility of a single court certainly can include what members of Fianna Fáil have been referring to as the all-Ireland court and Senator Dooge drew a careful distinction between the concept he was putting forward and the concept of the all-Ireland court which was ruled out at the time of Sunningdale, not ruled out because there was anything inherently wrong in the concept of it but it does seem to be a political non-starter without the unification of this island.  I do not think we can have an all-Ireland court in the firmest possible way without making a great deal of progress on the constitutional problem.  I would welcome this but it is just not on the cards at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge talked about a court with two distinct rules of law, the rules of law which apply in the North and the rules of law which apply in the South, being used to examine evidence, being used to check whether there was a <i>prima facie</i> case for dealing with suspected terrorists. Some progress in that direction would have to be made before extradition was possible.  I say this because I do not think you can extradite on suspicion. There has been suspicion of the lack of impartiality on the part of the RUC.  One has absolute corroborated evidence as provided by the Bennett Report that suspects during their interrogation were ill treated.  Equally on this side of the Border, we cannot throw stones because there was corroborated evidence in the Ó Briain Report that suspects were ill-treated here.  I believe there is a good deal of evidence that IRA prisoners in custody have been ill-treated in Britain. All this means that you cannot have extradition without examining the evidence.  It is not enough to say that it must be assumed that anyone who issues a warrant for extradition has the evidence.  That is not good enough.  We have got to have the evidence and the evidence has got to <Col N="797" /> be examined by the extraditing country, and we should be working towards a situation of that nature which is more efficient than the extra-territiorial jurisdiction which is in operation at the moment. We could move in the direction that Senator Dooge has suggested.  I am not, because of his suggestions, totally opposed to the Fine Gael amendment, but I do think this problem is one of much urgency.</P>
    <P>We have one group of Irishmen killing another group of Irishmen in the name of and with the supposed approval of Ireland as a whole.  That has got to stop and we have got to do everything constructive that we can to stop it.</P>
    <P>The Falklands crisis has been referred to.  I believe that we were correct in maintaining our neutrality, in stressing it, but I do not think we did it in a very polite way.  It could have been done in a more civilised way, but basically the stance in maintaining our neutrality was correct. However, there is a lesson to be learned from the Falklands crisis, and that is that warfare, guerilla warfare or otherwise, has changed.  There are hideous devices available for only £200,000 which can deal death and destruction on a big scale. I would guess that the hatred and bitterness among many terrorist groups, including our own, is such that they will be at this very moment out to obtain, to get their hands on, some of these devices. The amount involved &mdash; £200,000 &mdash; would be the equivalent of two good bank raids, so it is certainly within the range of many of the organisations we are talking about.  What I do not want to see is &mdash; as I believe inevitably will happen &mdash; a terrorist organisation in this country getting their hands on one of these missiles, hundreds of people being killed, and then being shamed into changing our laws or getting over the obstacles which the Minister regards as fundamental.  The killing has gone on long enough.  We have got to do everything constructive that we can to stop it, and I support the motion in the names of Senators Ross, Murphy and Robb.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to listen to Senator West putting his point of <Col N="798" /> view forward in relation to evidence, and of course that is the fundamental difference between what he has been saying and what Senators Murphy and Ross have been saying, because they seem to think that just on foot of a warrant, we should willy-nilly agree with extraditing our people.  It is interesting also from another point of view: that here we have many people with a lot of knowledge talking in this Seanad about the violence that has been created in this country. There is no doubt about the fact that there is violence, but we on this side of the House wholly condemn this violence. However, there is also the institutional violence which nobody has mentioned, and indeed the perpetrators of that institutional violence are the very people that we are being asked to hand our people over to.  A few interesting statistics might not be out of the way here.</P>
      <P>At the moment there are 2,000 people interned, all from the one community in the North of Ireland.  Does that look like fair treatment?  More than 20,000 people have been arrested and interrogated for more than seven days, all of them from the one community in the North of Ireland.  There were 300,000 house searches in the North of Ireland.  There are 1,521 formal allegations of ill treatment while in custody against the establishment. Two million pounds has been paid out in ex-gratia payments to people who have been abused by these forces and 89.4 per cent of those people charged under the emergency legislation in the North are convicted on their own confessions. Of those, 90.6 per cent allege ill tratment.  There are 1,400 people in prison in the North as a result of involuntary confessions.  There have been 60 per cent refusals on bail application, of which 94.4 per cent are non-Unionist people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely we must take note of those statistics. While I agree with Senator Robb that symbols are important and that the type of image we give here is important to an eventual united Ireland, surely the basic problem that we have in this country is not extradition but partition.  We can introduce all the laws we like about extradition and bring in all the fancy legislation <Col N="799" /> we want but we will not change one whit the situation in this country. Until such time as we bring about a solution to partition we are not going to solve the problem which we are faced with.  We have got to be very careful also that we do not add more fuel to the British gutter press which was in ebullient mood in jingoism during the Falklands crisis. They are now looking to go back to the old warhorse again in Ireland to have another go.  But we know that there are moderates on either side of the political divide who are genuinely working to try and bring about a solution to our problems. We know it is not going to be easy, but anybody in this House who believes that putting down a motion here on extradition is going to have any effect whatsoever on the violence must be considered to be naive in the extreme.</P>
    <P>I resent very much the implication by Senator Ross and, indeed, Senator Murphy, that successive Governments have been tacitly backing the men of violence. Senator Murphy went so far as to say that he considered it disgraceful and scandalous that Ireland did not sign the convention against terrorism.</P>

      <P>I wonder is Senator Murphy aware of the fact that those people who did sign that convention put so many conditions and riders into their signing that the whole thing was castrated by the time it became a finished product?  But of course Senator Murphy in his usual unbiased way forgot to mention that.  Of course he is the paragon of virtue from the south, the man who lectures us here and tells us how unsullied and indeed pure and politically and morally chaste he is.  But of course we are not all as altruistic as Senator Murphy.  I would be the first to confess to that, but I think that the nonsense he has talked here gives plenty of ammunition to the British press to continue their verbal abuse of Ireland. This convention against terrorism that he extols and says that it was disgraceful and scandalous of us not to have signed would <Col N="800" /> have no effect whatsoever in relation to stemming the amount of violence that there is in this country.  I wonder if he is aware of the fact that France, Germany and Belgium do not extradite their own nationals at all whether the offences are political or otherwise.  Many other countries have reservations in this regard. Indeed there are very few countries in the world who have laws which permit of the extradition of their natives.  There has been criticism of the Fine Gael amendment, but I do not see anything to criticise so far as that amendment is concerned. I suppose it is not easy to say this, but I find the Fine Gael amendment totally acceptable.</P>

      <P>Where there is good sense you will always have an alliance, where there is stupidity you will not.  This may not suit Senator Murphy, who is fond of courting the media and getting the maximum publicity, but he is very much out on his own on this one.  As far as I can see, unless we in this part of the country start nailing the lies about all the hundreds of so-called terrorists who are roaming the streets of this country the better.  I do not believe, and I agree with the Minister for Agriculture, that so far as the Garda knew, there were one or two people who should have been prosecuted but who could not be prosecuted because of the fact that our legislation was not retrospective.  Surely Senator Murphy and others are not advocating that we introduce retrospective legislation, that we make it a crime after the event.  For a so-called liberal this would be the ultimate.  We must reject all the allegations and all the propaganda that are being foisted on us, some of it well orchestrated by the British to denigrate what we have been doing.  There are many people in this country who are of the opinion that we are spending far too much money on Border security, that we could find other and perhaps better ways of using that money.  The figure of £100 million is mentioned in this context.  I expect that the figure is much higher than <Col N="801" /> that.  It may be said that this is money that would go a long way in alleviating the unemployment situation, for example. However, we do not get any credit when we do our side of the job well.</P>
      <P>We must not let this occasion pass without citing the case of Ireland against the United Kingdom in the European Court of Human Rights and to look at the findings of that court, which held by 16 votes to one that the use of the five techniques which I will describe constitutes a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment, and held unanimously that there existed at Palace Barracks in the autumn of 1971 a practice of inhuman treatment.  The court also held unanimously that it cannot direct the respondent state to institute criminal or disciplinary proceedings against those members of the security forces who had committed the breaches. Are we going to hand over to those authorities some of our people?  How many of the people convicted in the North have been guilty?  Regarding the Diplock Courts &mdash; this is where Senator Ross let the cat out of the bag when he was making the case for extradition because in the wind up he said, &ldquo;of course, the Diplock Courts are there&rdquo;&mdash; we know what they mean.  We know that there are no courts there, that there is no justice being administered in the North as we understand justice.  The Senator may be briefed by Senator Murphy even further but I still say that Diplock Courts are not courts in the proper sense of the word.</P>

      <P>The European Court came to the conclusion also that the inhuman treatment had occurred in September, October and November 1971 at the Palace Barracks.  They found these cases combined with other indications showed that there had been in these barracks in the autumn of 1971 a practice in connection with the interrogation of prisoners by members of the RUC which was inhuman treatment.  The British Government did not contest these conclusions.  And as I said earlier the five ways in which they were found guilty of inhuman treatment were, (a) wall standing, (b) hooding, (c) subjection of continuous noise, (d) deprivation of sleep and (e) the deprivation of food and drink.  The wall standing was forcing the detainee to remain for periods of some hours in a stretched position described by those who underwent it as being spreadeagled against the wall with their fingers high above the head against the wall, Their legs spread apart and feet back, causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers.  The hooding, according to the report involved putting a black or navy-coloured bag over the detainee's head and at least initially keeping it there all the time except during interrogation.  On subjection to noise, the court found that pending interrogation, the detainees were held in a room where there was a continuous loud and hissing noise.  The court found also that pending interrogation, the detainees were deprived of sleep, food and drink, that they were subjected to reduced diet during their stay at the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is Senator Murphy serious when he asks us to introduce extradition to the RUC in the North?  The condemnation of those forces is here for all to read in the report of the European Court of <Col N="803" /> Human Rights in the case of Ireland against the United Kingdom in Strasbourg on 18 January 1978.  Anybody who has even a passing knowledge of what constitutes fair and just treatment would not alone be slow to send anybody for trial there but would want to be malicious or sadistic in order to agree to such a move.  Consequently, I strongly oppose any such move as proposed by Senators Murphy and Ross.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the motion we have before us there seem to be two main purposes in the motion as it reads and as its proposers have spoken. The first one seems to be to propose or support some technical method by which we can deal more effectively with cross-Border crime.  The second purpose, which is not directly included in the motion but has been referred to in the speeches of the proposers and supporters of the motion, is a feeling that we should make some kind of gesture to the North indicating our concern at the gravity of the crimes with which we are dealing. When we talk about cross-Border crime it is very clear that we are not talking, for example, about butter-smuggling.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the motion, as it stands it not a very satisfactory one.  Senator Dooge has explained that the position of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors is not one of unrestricted support for extradition.  On the contrary, the latest position of the association very much indicates their understanding that the matter is a complex one and that extradition is possibly not the most effective method of dealing with it.  The amendment that is being proposed by the Fine Gael Party does attempt to take cognisance of that position and also to put forward something practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It ill behoves Senators Mara and Crowley to lecture this side of the House, anybody in the House or indeed anybody outside the House, on the subject of ambivalence or ambiguity.  This is something about which Senator Mara was particularly concerned.  He referred several times to what he called &ldquo;political offenders&rdquo;.  I believe that phrase which <Col N="804" /> he used without any restriction or reservation indicates a certain understanding in his mind.  Senator Crowley spoke about so-called terrorists.  He was a lot more sophisticated about his definition, but that phrase alone, &ldquo;so-called terrorists&rdquo;, indicates a stance or attitude towards the whole problem which would be easily enough interpreted, maybe unjustly, in a particular way.  I was saddened by Senator Crowley's contribution, not because we must feel that much of the data he brought forward was in any way inaccurate or that it was lacking in impact or indeed in some quality of justice or humanity, but because his contribution was one which was fixed permanently and irrevocably upon the past and, unfortunately, upon a very selective interpretation of the past.</P>
    <P>If anything is clear about the whole problem it is the fact that all of us, North and South, failed to deal with the Northern problem in the years up to 1968-69 and, as a consequence, have to deal with this kind of situation now.  In particular, I might point out &mdash; without meaning in any way to be offensive &mdash; that the party to which Senator Crowley belongs placed then and places now, as one of their principal objectives, more important indeed than the welfare of the ordinary people of this part of the island over which they have jurisdiction, the question of resolving partition.  Yet, though their Leader himself has spoken eloquently upon the fact that Northern Ireland has failed as a political entity, they did nothing about it and did not lift a finger until, at the beginning of the last decade, it became apparent that something very drastic was happening there, that the people of that part of his island had had enough.</P>
    <P>It is important that we indicate our concern in some way that goes beyond just a simple ritual debate leading nowhere.  I am glad to say that some Members of this House have tried to indicate, in a very clear and unambiguous way, their detestation of violence and detestation of murder as a method of political change.  I choose these words with some care because there is, in the situation, a temptation for all those who <Col N="805" /> are concerned about the situation there to look upon violence as a solution to their problem.  Stormont certainly looked upon violence, in the end, as a solution to its problem, and that failed.  Other people have looked upon violence as a solution.  This is a point to which I wish to revert in conclusion.  However, what I would like to say here when we talk about expressing our concern to the North and to the people in the North, particularly to those people who are under pressure as a result of what, possibly Senators Mara and Crowley would like to call &ldquo;so-called crimes&rdquo;&mdash; like, for example, bombing a nurses' home or murdering a public representative in the course of his carrying out a clinic or possibly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was trying to say, <Col N="806" /> before I was interrupted by Senator Crowley &mdash; who seems to have brought from a another place habits which are not, possibly, customary in this House &mdash; that when we are addressing ourselves to people in the North, when we are trying to express our concern, we should do this in a way that is neither mealymouthed nor gratuitously insulting. Unfortunately, the majority of our attempted communications with the people of the North seem to fall, in most cases, into one of those categories.</P>
      <P>When certain representatives or so-called representatives of Northern public opinion &mdash; and I am thinking here of the more extreme Unionist or so-called Loyalist opinion &mdash; speak of this part of this island as a foreign country and speak of the possibility that there are hundreds of criminals wandering around here, I believe they cannot have it both ways. They must realise that if they want a solution to the problems of this island they must be prepared to think in terms of this island as an entity.  That does not mean a surrender to the idea of a 32-county Republic.  But it does mean a realisation on their part that if they have an opinion to express about what goes on in this part of the island then they must be prepared to consider the problems of this island as a whole.  They cannot have it both ways, and I believe it is for us to make this position quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, they must come to realise &mdash; and it would not be easy for them, particularly in view of the siege mentality which has been built up mainly by people in the South, the siege mentality of the Loyalists and the Unionists &mdash; that the reason there is substantial violence and substantial crime, of whatever nature, whichever epithet we like to use for it, political or otherwise, the reason is that during the course of the 60 years in which the present political division of this island has existed, they did nothing to prevent the creation of an alienated minority there.  They did nothing, or very little, to bring that minority into their community. Consequently, if there is violence and crime there, a large part of the responsibility is theirs and they must accept responsibility for this.  I would like to <Col N="807" /> repeat that this will not be easy for them to realise or admit, though there are indications that some of the more thinking and forward-looking representatives of Unionist opinion are beginning to come to that realisation.</P>
    <P>I should like, in context, to make this particular point, particularly since the police force of this part of the island has been brought into the discussion by the motion, that when a police force comes to address itself to the question of crime, to a large extent society and even that police force is admitting failure.  Crime is something that a good police force does not try to hunt down, try to identify or bring to the courts; it is something that a good police force tries to prevent.  In this context, if we are considering the most effective ways of dealing with cross-Border crime, we are going to have to address ourselves, as the people of an entire island, to the causes of this.  We are going to have to try and get away from the hard cast-iron, rigid categories of the past to which Senator Crowley and his associates are so addicted.  We are going to have to look to the future and to new ideas.  In this context too I would like to place on the record of the House my belief that the problem is a 32-County problem and that we in the South will, in our time, have to face an alienated minority, not coloured in green or anything like that, but a socio-economic minority which we have progressively, in our part of the island, helped to create during those 60 years.  I believe that those people too will eventually be forced into violence and into crime and terrorism.  It will be only if we are prepared to look into the future in a constructive way and get away from these cast-iron categories, that we will be able eventually to deal with this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was somewhat surprised, in the course of this debate, at the rather cavalier way in which some speakers seemed to be willing to treat the Articles of the Constitution and our obligations under the European Convention on Extradition.  It is usual in this House, when matters affecting the Constitution or obligations to Conventions, such as the European Convention on Extradition, that Members urge that our obligations should be strictly applied, no matter what may be the short-term advantage of ignoring our obligations, or ignoring <Col N="809" /> the Constitution, we should nevertheless abide by the Constitution or by any such Convention.</P>
      <P>In this debate there has been a tendency for what would be short-term or for what would be an effort to deal with a particular problem, that we should abandon our obligations under the Constitution or under these Conventions.  There is no doubt whatever that Article 29 of the Constitution states that our rule of conduct should be in accordance with the generally recognised principles of international law.  There can be very little doubt that it is a generally recognised principle that people should not be extradited for political offences or offences connected with political motives.  There is no doubt as to what are the provisions of the European Convention on Extradition, the fact that it also provides that there should not be extradition for offences connected with political objectives.</P>
      <P>Consequently, it seems to me that we are perhaps moving very far away from our normal attitude to these matters in this case.  In my view there is no justification, in all the circumstances, for taking this point of view.  In both international law, in the European Convention and in the Extradition Act of 1970 &mdash; under which the UK regulate their attitude to extradition &mdash; this same principle applies. Accordingly, it seems to me that we have to have regard in this question, to these generally recognised principles and to these institutions under whose laws and principles we normally act.  Consequently we must be very slow to do anything, unless the case is made and made is such a way that there is virtually no answer to it, that we should depart from these principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The demand for extradition, the demand that is made in the motion before us, is based upon demand which arises in two separate ways.  We have had in the past, on frequent occasions, demand following some murder, some bombing, some outrage of that kind.  There is immediately what I think can fairly be described as an emotive demand for extradition on the spot.  It should be pointed out that that kind of demand is usually a demand to extradite suspects <Col N="810" /> rather than to extradite people against whom there is evidence.  It has been pointed out, and it is no harm to point it out again, that there is no law, there is no country anywhere which is prepared, certainly not in the western world, to extradiate people merely because they are suspected of a crime.  I do not think anybody would really support extradition in the context in which we are talking merely because people were suspected. Of course, if they were suspected and extradited on that basis then they would be subject to interrogation with consequences which have already been dealt with by other speakers.</P>
    <P>I can understand very well, the feelings, the frustration, the feeling of outrage of people in the North of Ireland, Unionists in the North of Ireland, when offences, murders and other bombings and so on have been committed.  I can understand their demand for extradition, their feeling that people who have committed these acts have fled across the Border and the only answer to that is extradition.  I can understand people who think that this has happened, who think that the offenders have fled South and that extradition is the only way of dealing with it.  But, of course, there are many people who do not really think that but pretend to think it.  I remember on a certain occasion being in the House of Commons listening to a debate on the North of Ireland when one of the Unionist MPs referred to a murder that had been committed that morning in his area in the North.  He said, &ldquo;The person who perpetrated this crime is at this time sitting in a public house in Dundalk, or somewhere south of the Border, telling his friends about the great act he has done.&rdquo;  The fact was that the Member of Parliament who was making that categorical statement had not the remotest proof that the person who committed the crime had fled South or was in a pub in Dundalk or anywhere else.  But his immediate reaction and his categorical statement was that that had happened. That is in the category not of people who think that that has happened but who pretend to think that that happened and who use it as a means of trying to undermine <Col N="811" /> relations between the two parts of the country and trying to ensure that this part of the country is seen in the blackest possible light.  But there are people who genuinely believe that extradition would be an answer to the problem.</P>
    <P>I have said that the British regulate their attitude to extradition by the 1870 Act.  It is of some interest to look at that Act, to see how careful they are; not only do they say that a person who is alleged to have committed a political offence shall not be extradited but, for anybody to be extradited, there has to be a <i>prima facie</i> case against him.  There must be evidence produced which would be the same as is required in this country before a district justice will send a person forward for trial.  It is a very strict test.  It is one which in the United Kingdom is operated in regard to any question of extraditing anybody.  But of course they do not extradite people for political offences. Nevertheless spokesmen in the United Kingdom, politicians and lawyers, suggest that we should do what they would not dream of doing in their own country.  Consequently, when we deal with the second kind of situation &mdash; in which the demand for extradition is made in a sober and mature way &mdash; people are talking about a situation in which there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  Of course the fact of the matter is that if there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence, if there is evidence against somebody who committed a crime in the North of Ireland who is down in this part of the country, then if that evidence is available, the person can be tried, found guilty and convicted under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  The effect will be exactly the same &mdash; a person will be convicted if he is found guilty and he will be sent to jail exactly as he would be in the North of Ireland.  If the demand for extradition is a responsible one, to apply only where the evidence is available, then this can be done under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act and the same effect can be obtained.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb asked us about murder: does anybody approve of murder?  Would anybody stand over murder?  Is everybody against murder?  Of course we are <Col N="812" /> all against murder.  There is no question about that.  He went on to describe the kinds of ways in which murder occurred in the North of Ireland and the harrowing scenes connected with it.  But this did not all add up to the fact that extradition was the answer to it.  It did not add up to the fact that if we were willing to adopt this motion, if the State was willing to extradite people who were alleged to have committed offences in the North, that that would stop murder and that that would solve the problem.  The fact of the matter is that there is no proof at all that the introduction of extradition would stop a single murder, would stop a single crime of this kind.  There is no proof. There is the suggestion that, on the one hand you have these crimes being committed, on the other hand, you do not have extradition, that this adds up to the fact that if you did have extradition then that you would not have the crimes.  The fact is there is no such proof that one would lead to the other.</P>
    <P>For that reason I cannot accept this motion.  I cannot accept that extradition would in fact play any part in preventing crime of this kind.  Either we are talking about extradition against suspects, which is totally unacceptable, or we are talking about the situation in which evidence is available, in which case the person could be tried under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  In these circumstances I maintain that a case has not been made for this motion.  In these circumstances we should abide by the principles which are in our Constitution; we should abide by the principles of international law; we should abide by the principles in the European Convention on Extradition upon which our Extradition Act is based, an Act which we cannot ignore without breaking our obligations to the Extradition Convention.  I fully appreciate the frustration and the feeling which has motivated putting down this motion, but nevertheless I do not think the case has been made and I cannot support the motion.</P>

      <P>Could I thank you very sincerely for the opportunity to speak on this motion?  Unfortunately I had my baggage <Col N="813" /> almost packed because I was almost coming to the conclusion that another case of British legislation had been implemented and that I was the subject of an exclusion order.  Despite that it is very important that Northern voices are heard on this motion.  I make that point in reference to Senator Larkin, who is more Northern probably than anybody who has spoken on this motion.  I certainly would like to register the fact that it would be a shame if that did not happen. I know the little arrangements that are made within this House are very important to someone who lives in the middle of that map that Senator Robb has already shown, but this motion and indeed other considerations arising from it may be just slightly more important.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put my views on record in relation to this motion. Much has been said in relation to the constitutional position about extradition. It is about time we dealt in facts.  There will not be extradition from this part of Ireland to the North of Ireland because that involves a constitutional change. Irrespective of the niceties one might use about it, the fact is that that is where the reality lies.  That involves political parties within this House and within Dáil Éireann making a decision to present a change in that Constitution on extradition to the people of the Republic of Ireland.  That is why there will not be extradition, because that question should not be put to the people of Ireland.  If we look at the situation it would involve enormous upheavals.  I will refer to those as I go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The alternative to that is to try to get an acceptable legal alternative.  I suggest, that in terms of the 1976 legislation, the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, effective legislation exists.  Of course, there is the third alternative.  It is the one which is not mentioned in the motion or the amendment, the one that has hardly been debated today at all.  That is the real answer to the problem.  The real answer to the problem of political violence is not political legislation, it is not repressive legislation.  I suggest that if you had 100 <Col N="814" /> such extradition arrangements between this part of Ireland and the north it would not fundamentally change the problem that exists there nor would it fundamentally change the violence, which has not just existed there for this past 12 years. One must ask oneself why indeed, since the foundation of the six county State there has been internment every decade &mdash; that is forgotten about &mdash; there has been subversion every decade and, indeed, there has been repression every decade.</P>
    <P>Let us not talk about this motion in relation to what is happening at the present time or indeed over the past 12 years. Let us discuss it in relation to the solution to the problem.  That solution must lie in finding a long-term lasting political solution to a problem which has existed for over 60 years and which will exist for another 60 years, irrespective of the amount of repressive legislation which is brought in here or by Britain in the North of Ireland, or whatever extradition arrangements are made, whatever arrangements will be, for the simple reason that when you have that inherent instability within the State, when you have the type of identity crisis which leads to alienation on the one hand and a supremacist attitude on the other which lead to confrontation instead of consensus, which lead to a position where a section of the population say the process of enforcing law is theirs not ours, we are the sufferers from law, they are the people who implement it.  That is what we have to solve in the North of Ireland, not through this type of legislation, not through extradition but through creating a lasting political system with which people can identify.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one point on the constitutional position.  It is often talked of as if the refusal to have extradition is solely the position of the Irish Government. Let me quote from Dingle Foot, whom Senator Robb mentioned earlier, when he said, speaking in 1965 about the British Extradition Act:</P>
    <P>The exception relating to events of a political character is thoroughly familiar and has been included in our <Col N="815" /> extradition legislation since 1870. Indeed the tradition that we do not return to the country of origin persons who are accused of political offences goes back to the Napoleonic Wars.</P>
    <P>That is a British statement about a British piece of legislation.  However, one must also face the fact that there is this problem.</P>
    <P>There are three ways of dealing with it. We change the Constitution, and, sooner or later, the question has got to be asked in relation to this type of motion, why is it not done?  The political realities in the Republic of Ireland will provide the answer to that, not the legalistic niceties. The gut political realities are that the balance of probability would suggest that whoever presented that to the people of Ireland would not win it.  You can imagine the field day there would be in Britain in relation to that.  You can see the editorials in the <i>Sun or Daily Mirror</i> even now.  You can see what it would do in the North of Ireland, the way in which certain clerical gentlemen in the North of Ireland would use that for God knows how many years to come.  You can see the way in which the paramilitary groupings would use that.  Can you see the blood transfusion it would be for some of the paramilitary groupings to be able to campaign on that?  That is the damage it would do. That would be the net effect.  You would end up with a very big minus in relation to something which can only be dealt with in another way.</P>
    <P>In relation to the 1976 Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, I would like to make one point.  I am told there were 82 requests since 1971 for extradition of people from this part of Ireland to the North.  There have been nine cases brought under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act 1976.  The central fact is that exactly the same weight and quality of evidence is required to have a person extradited if extradition existed as it does to have him prosecuted under the 1976 Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  One must ask the question: What has happened to all of these other claims?  Have they suddenly disappeared? Must we not come to the conclusion <Col N="816" /> either that that evidence did not exist at all, that the British authorities knew that it did not exist and for that number of years they were playing with this for propaganda reasons, or that they had the evidence and, for whatever reason, chose not to implement it through the existing legislation?  If the third point is the relevant point, then we are dealing with a very cynical situation.  My view is that it was a propaganda exercise whose bluff has been called by that Act.  If that Act did nothing more, it would be of benefit in that it has done that, it has said to the British Government and to the Northern Ireland authorities, &ldquo;If you have the evidence, present it, and we will proceed.&rdquo;  It is a dramatic decrease from the number of claims for extradition to the number of cases brought under that Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act.  Therein lies the nub of the claims to extradition.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is another claim, that is the claim made consistently by Unionist politicians in the North of Ireland, claims that there are hundreds of people roaming about here being harboured in the South of Ireland for offences committed in the North of Ireland.  I will deal with those in relation to the point I made previously, because I regard those claims as being utterly spurious.  If we look at the most recent question in the House of Commons on 9 November 1981, volume 12 of Hansard, columns 45 and 46 we will see Mr. Dunlop, the MP for Mid-Ulster, asked the Secretary of State how many suspected murderers, informers or perpetrators of other crimes are now believed to be living in the Republic of Ireland and how many applications have been made by the Royal Ulster Constabulary for the extradition of suspected terrorists.  Surely, in 1982 people have a right to be considered innocent until proven guilty.  That is a perfect example of the way in which suspicion is used, not just for making a debating point but being used in such a way that the ordinary people in the North of Ireland believe that there are many people living here in those circumstances and they believe that if only the Republic of Ireland had extradition the problem would be over.</P>
    <P>That is where the basic dishonesty of <Col N="817" /> that Unionist position comes in.  It is dishonest and hollow for that reason.  It is propagandist because, as you will find, especially in July, it will be trotted out again in many places.  It is very insincere.</P>
    <P>One of the facts of life that we ignore is that the majority of sectarian killings in the North have been committed by loyalist paramilitants.  That is a verifiable fact.  Are those people harbouring in Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Louth or Meath?  I doubt it.  How do we deal with that problem if extradition is the key to the other problems?  That is a problem which must be faced.  That is why I say that those calls of loyalist politicians are insincere.  They are also contradictory because they are contrary to their own basic political philosophy which says to the south of Ireland, the SDLP, the British Government and everybody else: &ldquo;We do not want anything to do with the south of Ireland, you have no role to play but there is a role to play here&rdquo;.  They recognise it.  If that is the case &mdash; I accept that it is &mdash; then surely that role must translate itself into the central role which we have all got to play, that is, finding a lasting solution.  The contradictory nature of that is something which must be made obvious to people.</P>
    <P>I want to make this point as unemotionally as I can because it is not a time for raising emotions.  If one is considering extradition, one must ask the nature of the State to which one is going to extradite. That must surely be the responsibility of any responsible State.  One must ask oneself about the track record of the State to which one is extraditing.  Let us forget about the years before 1970.  We know what internment without trial created, we know how long that lasted, we know what happened to the families of those 2,000 people who without any evidence against them were incarcerated for up to four years.  That is over.  We went from that to the searches and arrests &mdash; I will ignore that because Senator Crowley has made the point about it, the ill-treatments and the way in which confessions are sought and got in places like Castlereagh and Armagh.  That did not happen many years ago.  That happened a short time ago.  It is on record and <Col N="818" /> proven by Amnesty International.  It is on record in the report of Lord Justice Bennett, a British judge.  Do not take my word for it, do not take what was alleged as propaganda, take the word of a British Lord Justice who investigated it.  Let us see what that does to the attitude of people and to the attitude of the families who suffered that.</P>
    <P>I have been in Gough Barracks in Armagh night after night.  I have not seen what happened but I have seen the people coming out of it after four or seven days.  That did not happen by accident. There is something else we cannot ignore when we look at the record of the people involved.  We had a deliberate policy initiated by Roy Mason, which could best be described as shoot, not question.  Nine people were killed by the security forces. They were shot dead in circumstances where they could have been arrested. They were unarmed.  There is the situation at present, about which there is controversy, where 24,830 plastic bullets have been fired in the North, 12 people have been killed, seven of whom were under 15 years of age.  I am trying to put on record the type of State we are talking about extraditing to.</P>
    <P>There is another factor which does not get the headlines.  It is the arrest, detention and interrogation of people who are known to be innocent so that they can fill in the interrogation jigsaws on other people.  That happens in a very widespread way, which adds to the alienation which will prevent any type of solution on a security line.</P>

      <P>Could I make a final point which I may get to speak on at some future date?  There is no security answer to the problem.  There is no answer in extradition.  There is an answer in the creation of a long-term lasting political solution, which is equitable and fair to all of the people within this island.  Is it not time that, instead of reacting to what the British do in Ireland in relation to that solution, we, the elected people of this island lead for a change rather than <Col N="819" /> do as we have done for the past 12 years, simply react to whatever Mr. Whitelaw, Mr. Mason. Mr. Atkins or Mr. Prior do? That is our challenge.</P>

      <P>If I were to be crude I would say that my attitude to the amendment and to Fianna Fáil's criticism and defence of our present attitude to extradition would be almost to say a plague on both your houses.  I grew up in a staunchly Fianna Fáil household and it was only when I left home that I realised how misguided was the conception of what was required to produce Irish unity which was the traditional view of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Therefore, while I would, in principle, accept the view &mdash; I will give reasons why extradition is unacceptable to me &mdash; I would not in any way wish to appear to be allying myself with the views of the Fianna Fáil Party on extradition.</P>
      <P>Extradition is unacceptable because I do not believe there is a security solution to any of our crime, whether it be terrorist or otherwise.  I also believe that there is, whether one like it or not, an oppressed minority in Northern Ireland. While I have enormous sympathy for the position and the aspirations of the majority, I do not believe it is part of my job to ignore the minority.  My political predecessors in this House have ignored both communities.  I will ignore neither.  I will go to Northern Ireland quite happily and defend my position on extradition to anybody who wants to hear me.  I will tell them why I will not support extradition. I challenge my friends in Fianna Fáil to say that they will join me in meeting people in Northern Ireland in all areas of Protestant Belfast and tell them why they will not support extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, we have the amendment.  Unfortunately, Fine Gael disappoint me.  I am sure it will not break their hearts.  I would have thought they would be able to make up their minds about extradition.  They are in favour of it or they are against it.  They should not avoid the issue.  It is a cute political trick, <Col N="820" /> which works well inside this political club, but as far as I am concerned it will cut no ice with the population outside. They do not see our political games in here in quite the same light we do.  So as not to give credence to Fine Gael defending their own position or protecting their own interests, I will not support the amendment.</P>
    <P>It ill behoves anybody down here to cast too many aspersions on the security forces in Northern Ireland notwithstanding the excesses.  If I were suspected of a serious crime I would prefer to be in the hands of the RUC than in the hands of certain elements of our security forces, having witnessed their appalling performance during the H-Block demonstrations when, no matter what provocation they were subjected to, their reaction was gross, crude and excessive.</P>

      <P>When I heard the Minister's speech I was beginning to think that maybe what he was putting forward as the objections to extradition were purely a legal problem.  He did very well and quoted chapter and verse about something which is definitely in dispute.  I began to think it was probably a camouflage. I was delighted to hear what I thought was the most honest contribution from the Fianna Fáil side of the House later on when I heard Senator Crowley speaking, because he came out with the real reason why Fianna Fáil do not support extradition.  Other speakers, like Senator Mara and Senator E. Ryan, made genuine speeches about it and they made me believe in the legal case against it, but Senator Crowley came out with the emotional reasons, with the reasons out of the cupboard and he came out with the reasons that the Minister did not give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crowley quoted cases of torture which existed in 1971.  He gave us a long litany of very emotional things which <Col N="821" /> had happened to people in custody in Northern Ireland under the guard of the British Army.  We had already agreed that nobody in this House condoned that behaviour but no one answered, no one on the other side of the House said and nobody gave evidence that there was any ill-treatment, that there was any torture or brutality going on.  Nobody disputed that this was happening since the Bennett Report or since Hermon took over as Chief Constable.  Nobody came up with any evidence of that happening, and no Government as far as I know protested about that happening for the last few years.  So, we have to accept that that is the <i>status quo</i> now.  I am tired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator could have had an opportunity to speak earlier.  Senator McGlinchey's Government surely would have made a protest about it by now if that was happening, because successive Governments here have been the guardians of people in custody here and have taken the British Government to court on that situation.  We did not hear from Senator Crowley anything about the atrocities of the IRA.  At least those of us putting forward this motion are quite prepared to condemn violence on either side.  We heard nothing from him about the people of Fermanagh, the people of Tyrone, the people of Armagh and the sufferings that they have had to put up with under the auspices of the IRA.  I do not like to hear this element of Fianna Fáil that comes out with a one-sided anti-British anti-Loyalist attitude.  The Loyalist are the people they are meant to beholding out the hand of friendship to, but they ignored their opinions.  They feel a territorial right and nothing else towards them.  They have nothing in common with them at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act because a great deal has been said about it.  The Minister said that the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act can continue to be applied as long as evidence available. Then he went on to say that evidence is not available.  That is exactly the problem <Col N="822" /> with the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act. The Act is clumsy and does not work.  It is no good people from the other side of the House standing up and saying that we have had six convictions in six years under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act I do not know how many cross-Border crimes there have been, and nobody else does.  There have been an enormous number of unapprehended people in that time.  It is quite obvious that if we only have half a dozen convictions in half a dozen years that it is not working and it is not bringing people to book.</P>
    <P>As regards the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the statements that have been made, there seems to be a certain amount of confusion about it.  The annual conference passed the resolution that they called for a review of the constitutional conditions regarding extradition.  What has happened since then is a decision of the executive, which is not the annual conference, not the guards.  The executive have certainly backtracked.  I do not know why but I suspect that it is something to do with political pressure, I suspect it is something to do with this motion and I suspect that they were slightly embarrassed by being mentioned in this motion.  It is wrong for us to say that that is now the position of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  Let us wait until next year and see what the delegate conference decide and not say what the executive decide, for reasons we do not know.</P>
    <P>Very little was said in this debate about the actual amount of goodwill that extradition would have on the moderate opinion in Northern Ireland.  It is an extraordinary facet of southern politicians that they can talk about Northern Ireland and ignore the Protestants and the moderate Catholic opinion there.  What must be emphasised is that this, once again, is such an emotive matter for them.  They really believe that this is important.  This is the one issue which you come across time and time again up there.  Whether you believe it is going to work or not you have to acknowledge it as a problem and a problem which they believe is extremely important.  That is why, once <Col N="823" /> again, I oppose the Fine Gael amendment because I think it is an issue on which every politician in this country should take a stand.  Fianna Fáil's position is quite clear, Fine Gael's position should be made clear.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan said that extradition would not stop any single crime although there was no evidence of this. I find that almost impossible to believe with so many cases of people coming over the Border after committing political crime.  I find it difficult to believe that in many cases it has not happened that those people have gone back and committed several more crimes.  Had they been extradited, arrested and put in custody this would not happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Mallon spoke about the track record of the RUC, the track record of the British Government and the track record of the forces of law and order up there.  I accept that track record, I accept that it has been deplorable but I think, once again, Senator Mallon should stop looking to the future: look to the present and what is happening at present and accept what will happen in the future.  It is very difficult for people from Northern <Col N="824" /> Ireland not to look back and not to remember but I think we are in a new situation now, we are in a situation where there is no torture and we should bear this in mind.  I think that it would probably not happen again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been talking about our children almost as long as I am an adult or slightly less.  To my knowledge the Care memorandum in 1968 initiated debate on the problems of our children, particularly about our deprived, oppressed or underprivileged children depending on which terminology one chooses to use.  We had the Kennedy Report in 1971, the Care Report on Children and the Constitution in 1977 and Hope, the voluntary organisation which deals with homeless children, produced more.  The Government response commenced in 1974 when the task force on child care services was set up.  It took seven years to produce a report, which must be close to a record for even a Government commission.  It does not reflect well any passion in our commitment to the welfare of our children. The problem has come and gone, surfaced and disappeared on and off, and it resurfaced recently again with the position of eight travellers' children in Cork. We had great concern about them, the fact that there was nowhere to put them and nowhere to keep them in spite of the fact that much of this work has been done, much has been promised, much has been held up and much has been waited for.  We focused in on the fact then that they were sniffing glue, and I should like to endorse the opinion of a member of the senior medical staff of the Southern Health Board that glue sniffing is probably the least of their problems.</P>
      <P>The fundamental problem is that they were homeless and that in spite of much promising, in spite of much undertaking and goodwill nothing so far has been done.  It is because nothing has been done that various trains of events have followed from the delay and lack of urgency in this area.  According to the figures supplied to me &mdash; indeed, I would welcome it if the Minister had authoritative figures on these problems &mdash; there are probably around 50 or so totally homeless children living in the Dublin inner city area.  I will talk in a moment about why this problem has arisen and link it to the unnecessary delay, in my view, in providing any sort of services for them.  It is not a huge number but it is a pathetic problem that we should leave one of our children on the street.  The small scale of the problem has got nothing to do with the gravity of it, that we should leave our children on the streets is obviously terrible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is linked largely to the problem of travelling people and the conditions in which travellers are living in the Dublin urban area in particular. Indeed, the children who came to the surface, or came to light, in Cork had strong Dublin connections.  The reason why the delay is so critical is that in recent <Col N="827" /> times there has been a collapse in what was heretofore a very rigid family structure in the travelling community.  I say this without any disrespect to the travelling people.  In the past family discipline was very tight, family unity was very strong and, therefore, children did not roam abroad unprotected, unsupported and unaided.  It is estimated that there are somewhere about 60 travellers' families with serious psychiatric and alcoholic problems in Dublin city.  Those are estimates that have been supplied to me and I cannot vouch for their authenticity but I do not think we are going to get into an argument about numbers &mdash; that is not the problem.</P>
    <P>There has been a growth in this problem. The number of children who are homeless has got worse because of the collapse in the family unit.  I have heard horrific stories about 14-year-old girls giving birth to babies in the back seats of abandoned cars, as testified to me by one individual.  I hope he is wrong.  The frightening thing is that we do not need new legislation to do something about this problem.  That is why I am critical again of the delay.  It did not need legislation, indeed, it did not even need the Task Force.  The powers are there under the 1908 Children's Act which people like myself are often given to maligning.  The powers are there under that Act because it makes it obligatory on the police to intervene where a child is at risk and bring a child to a place of safety.  That is not a discretion.  I understand that is an obligation on the police.  Therefore, that is the first stage, that is the protection. Obviously, the problem is what we do with them then.  I understand it is possible to have a fit persons order made under which a child is put into the care of an individual.  My authority on that is, again, the Task Force Report which states that under certain sections of the Children's Act, 1908 a child may be committed to the care of a fit person for his own protection.</P>
    <P>The legislation is there but it is not being implemented.  This legislation, I understand, is often used against children or to assist or support children of the <Col N="828" /> settled community, but there are widespread allegations to my knowledge that it is avoided if at all possible for the support of the children of the travelling community.  The reason I have been given is that there are too many children from the travelling community to be catered for within the existing institutions. Hence the need and the problem with the delay.  There is also the reason that travelling children are alleged to be rather difficult and awkward to deal with. Consequently, the solution is to avoid at all costs using this legislation.  The consequences, of course, are that we have children living on the streets in a country which currently attaches great importance to the sanctity of human life.  Children do not have votes and, apparently, they are not that close to the centre of our consciousness.</P>
    <P>There are procedures which could be used.  There are procedures used under the amended Children's Act in the United Kingdom whereby any child who comes to the attention of police is brought to a place of safety, assessed and whatever is deemed to be necessary for the child is done.  It is the least we can do for our children.  The suggestion sometimes put forward that travellers' children are too numerous, too awkward or too difficult to deal with hardly deserves more than passing notice.  Surely those of our children who are the most difficult, the most problematic come from the most scandalous backgrounds are those whom the existing legislation should be used on, not to mention further legislation to defend children living in circumstances which are not ideal for bringing up children, and it is not good enough for us to wash our hands clean.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned to me that what are called serviced sites usually incorporate a hard surface and a single tap while an unserviced site is the side of the road. Neither circumstance is exactly ideal for bringing up children, but surely it is not good enough for us to wash our hands and say we will not use even the existing legislation, not to mention bringing in new legislation, to defend children just because they are too numerous or too difficult.  The Task Force also made recommendations <Col N="829" /> which suggest that when it is clear that parents are not willing to take responsibility for their children there must be intervention.  I am aware that there is a school of thought of a minimum intervention theory.  That is all very well but if a child has been abandoned, effectively, by its parents, who is to intervene to defend that child but ourselves and who is to look after him but ourselves?</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a political football out of our children's problems.  I have deliberately refrained from any emotional language.  It is not particularly the fault of this Minister or this Government that the proper custodial facilities for difficult children, for children with problems, for children with no homes, for children who need support, counselling and advice and a substitute for the family that no longer wants them, are not there. That is not a problem that should become a political football.  I would imagine it is a problem on which there is a consensus. I fail to understand the long delay and why, since I was a student in Dublin ten years ago until now, there are still children begging on O'Connell Bridge.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that any constitutional, legal or financial problem, or any other problem, should stand in the way of our helping those children.  It is wrong for a Christian society to claim that any reason, financial, administrative or, indeed, constitutional, can prevent us from implementing the sort of support services, protection, assistance or educational facilities that will, at least, show us to be attempting to deal with this difficult problem.  I do not want for one second to minimise the problem.  Dealing with difficult children is a highly specialised and demanding area of work.  It is not an area which can be entered into easily, and many voluntary organisations, to my knowledge, have launched into this area and collapsed under the strain of the burden of dealing with difficult children.  That, however, is not an excuse for delay and for doing nothing. It is simply an indication that we need serious thought, hard work and a programme of care, custody, support services, properly funded, properly <Col N="830" /> maintained and adequate follow-up services to ensure that this problem will never happen again.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to give us an indication that something will be done quickly about the problem of homeless children, not the children who have been thrown out but the children who have abandoned home and who need to be dealt with in a different way from the children who are prepared to stay in alternative accommodation.  That is why I deliberately used the word &ldquo;custodial&rdquo;. We must intervene on these children's behalf.  We cannot let the culture that has forced them into the lifestyles they have to dominate them if anything can be done to change it.  I appeal to the Minister to take whatever action is necessary to ensure that the provisions of the 1908 Act can be met as widely as possible.  If that is not satisfactory he should amend the legislation accordingly.</P>
    <P>We are still waiting for a Children's Act.  I look forward to its coming and reading it and I will be terribly upset if reasons of financial consideration, and the present state of the public finances, are to prevent us properly looking after our children, particularly those children who are the most deprived, largely the children of our travelling people.  It is bad enough to be a child of a homeless travelling family, but to be without the sort of thing that passes for a home among travelling people is even more appalling. I raise the matter in the hope of adding to the sense of urgency I am sure the Minister has about the matter, and in the hope of highlighting it in public so that public opinion can be further stimulated. I have revived it because I believe it is the duty of public representatives and legislators to be concerned about all the vulnerable groups who often go unnoticed because they do not have the voice, the clout or the political consequences.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the problem is not glue sniffing, as the problem ten years ago was not cider.  The problem is, effectively, homeless children who have no family, no support and who are living by their wits.  Consequently, they are difficult, awkward and quite hard to handle, but that is no excuse.  We have an obligation <Col N="831" /> to protect them from the consequences of their own environment, from the fact that they are deprived almost from birth. Shortly I hope we will not have the spectacle of when children such as these come before the courts all the State services can do is say: &ldquo;We have one place for them in Dublin, but if they will not stay there there is nothing we can do.&rdquo;  That is clearly unacceptable.  There must be alternatives.</P>
    <P>I await the Minister's response with interest.  I believe there are numerous ways of dealing with the problem, with or without the co-operation of voluntary bodies, but, quite simply, the delay is unacceptable.  We have been talking about this problem for ten years.  Everybody has indicated that something must be done but nothing has been done.  It should never happen again.</P>

      <P>I should like to agree with Senator Ryan at the outset that we are dealing with essentially a very deep rooted social problem.  Perhaps that is one reason why its ready solution has evaded so many people in the past.  It is one of the reasons why the Task Force spent so much time discussing it and why various other review bodies have been so deeply involved in trying to find solutions to this problem.</P>
      <P>The fact that Senator Ryan raised this point indicates that there is no simple solution and, consequently, we have to approach it on a fairly broad front in a number of ways and try to get at the roots of the problem where we can.</P>
      <P>There are a number of things happening which are very important, and they have only started recently.  I would like Senator Ryan to appreciate that there are people working in a very dedicated way currently, specifically in relation to the problem he has raised.  Perhaps the coverage in the media recently has not given fair treatment to the work that is being done in this area, but I will cover some of the points which were raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Task Force did, of course, take some time to report.  As Senator Ryan is aware I asked the Task Force to conclude <Col N="832" /> a report, putting in their differences of opinion at the back of the report.  That is the reason why there are such substantial differences of opinion in the large part of the report at the back.  There were differences of opinion about what should happen but at least it brought the Task Force's report to a conclusion early in 1981.  It was published then and on that basis we are in a position to use the information and take decisions where necessary.  Senator Ryan also raised the question of a Children's Bill.  I should like to make it clear that that will be brought in in the autumn session.  It is near completion. It is very complex and it will deal with a lot of the issues raised here.  I am hoping it will be ready about August or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of custodial care generally, we have, of course, a considerable amount of residential care for children at risk.  We have 1,400 places in what we call residential homes. The position at the end of March this year was that there were about 1,100 children in these centres.  The experience has been that they are never full to capacity. One of the main reasons that this arises is because the present day approach is to maintain the children in the community or in foster homes or in some other way as near to the family as possible.  That is the position with the global provision of facilities for residential homes.  In addition, of course, there are about 220 places in special schools. These come under the responsibility of the Minister for Education.  They are related more directly to children who have come into conflict with the law.  In this instance there is, I understand, an adequate number of places for boys but there is some difficulty about providing special facilities for very difficult types of girls particularly.  That would seem to be the position there presently.</P>
    <P>The Senator's question relates particularly to an incident which occurred recently in Cork, and which related to Cork and Dublin and where a District Justice recently complained about the absence of a place willing to detain travelling children who had in effect been <Col N="833" /> sniffing glue.  Of course, the answer to the sniffing of the glue problem is certainly not locking up children.  I think from what Senator Ryan has said he would agree with that.  The children were sent to Dublin to Exchange House &mdash; I will come back to Exchange House in a moment &mdash; by the justice concerned. The locking-up of the children might prevent them from getting the glue but there is no guarantee that this is going to stop them returning to the practice as soon as they are released because of the social environment and the problems there.</P>
    <P>The question of placing the children in custody because of this practice raises serious social and ethical issues.  Apart from the lack of any known therapy it would be entirely contrary to our philosophy of caring for the children to place them in confinement.  The problem of glue sniffing among the travelling children is only one of the external manifestations of the deeper social issue.  That issue is the lifestyle of the travelling people as a whole and the squalor and deprivation to which they are often exposed.  I am glad to say that the review body on the travelling people has completed its consideration of the revised policies which should be adopted in regard to this whole social issue.  The review body was established jointly by myself and the Minister for the Environment about a year-and-a-half ago. Shortly we will be receiving the report of the review group.  I would like to assure the Senator that I will be looking at all the issues affecting travelling children in association with the recommendations of that report.  That report is now imminent; I expect it within a very short time; certainly within a month we will have that report published and available.</P>
    <P>Obviously, if we can develop a more effective policy regarding the housing and education of the travellers and secure a greater sympathy and support from the public towards the travelling people, we will go a long way towards removing the problem of glue sniffing and the other evils associated with these much abused children.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised the question of facilities generally.  I would like to mention <Col N="834" /> that Exchange House is a resource centre for young travellers run by the Dublin Committee for Travelling People. It was established only as recently as 1980 following discussions between the committee, the Department of Health and the Eastern Health Board.  The building, which is a former presbytery, was made available by the Archbishop and is located at Exchange Street.  The centre is financed through the health board and provides day care, overnight accommodation and work training.  Last year the centre received £157,000 in grant-aid to run that centre specifically related to the problem which was occurring in Dublin at that time.  That in itself was an experiment; and that experiment is being assessed.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, we also have Trudder House down in County Wicklow, a special residential centre catering for up to 24 travelling boys.  It was established by the Dublin Committee for Travelling People with the support of the Eastern Health Board and it followed an interim recommendation of the Task Force on Child Care Services.  Again, there is action following an interim recommendation there.  The unit is operated through the Dublin Committee for Travelling People and the health board has a representative on the management committee. Last year, Trudder House received £110,000 in grant-aid from the health board.</P>
    <P>As it transpired I was in Wicklow last weekend having discussions with people who are concerned with running Trudder House on the progress of Trudder House at present.  It is progressing very happily and satisfactorily catering for the number it does.  But it does not cater for girls at all.  They are very anxious to see a centre for travelling girls on similar lines. Indeed, they submitted a proposal very recently to the Eastern Health Board and the Eastern Health Board have again submitted that to us in the last couple of days.  It is proposed to get a second premises in that general locality and to provide places for girls in a similar way to the way in which Trudder House is operating at present.  The question is just immediate at this point in time.  I can assure the <Col N="835" /> Senator that I will be dealing with it as a matter of considerable urgency.  Progress recently at Trudder House has been particularly encouraging.  There are some difficulties earlier on but certainly in recent times the progress has been very encouraging.</P>
    <P>There is also a day centre at Strand Street for travelling children in Dublin, from pre-school age to 13 years of age.  It is classified as a special school by the Department of Education.  It provides a programme of remedial education and social training.  It also provides recreational facilities.  At the moment it caters for 28 children and in 1981 received £75,000 in grant-aid.  There is also a special school for travelling children at St. Thomas's Training Centre which is located near Booterstown.  There is a hostel for the younger travelling children in Rathmines.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have a task force operating in the Eastern Health Board, set up very recently to look at the urgent need for facilities.  That relates to substance abuse generally and will take in the question of providing care for children who have become involved in any form of substance abuse.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Senator that it is something which is considered as a matter of great urgency.  We are very much involved in the situation at the moment.  The Senator has made quite clear that he appreciates that it is a deep-rooted social problem.  In fairness to others who have been attempting to find solutions in the past it is this nature <Col N="836" /> of the problem that has evaded people. Certainly recently, both from the point of view of the review group and its work, I would be very hopeful of the study which has been done by the review group over the past 18 months and of the approach of some of the people more recently to the need for a smaller kind of accommodation and arrangements generally which are more suitable.  I would be hopeful that we would have a much more suitable and enlightened programme in tackling this problem, which is a very complex one and which I fully appreciate.</P>
    <P>The Senator raised the question of the fit person order.  Some of the children who are in Trudder House are there on fit person orders.  They are in effect used in that, but not to any great extent.  Senator Ryan is quite right in saying that generally speaking it is not applied in the case of travelling children.  Of course, part of the difficulty there is to find suitable places or people to take on a fit person in some of these instances.  A number of the children in that particular kind of care are on a fit person order.</P>
    <P>I think that is all I can say at this stage in immediate response to the question raised on the Adjournment, but I hope it will indicate to the Senator that I do consider it as a matter of considerable urgency and I will apply myself diligently and urgently to any solutions which we can find.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 13 July 1982.</P>
