      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The decision of the Department of Justice to open a hostel for young offenders in Audley Place, Patrick's Hill, Cork.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

I suggest that we do not break for lunch today so as to get business done as early as possible and finish early this evening if possible but this is a matter for the House.  If there is agreement, I propose that we do not break for lunch.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that we are setting up this committee as a matter <Col N="1087" /> of urgency with a specific purpose, to investigate Údarás na Gaeltachta.  In view of the recent controversy, I wonder if the wording is strong enough &mdash;&ldquo;...make recommendations for the better functioning of Údarás na Gaeltachta&rdquo;. The setting up of this committee to deal with the problem of Údarás was agreed but I wonder if in spite of their restricted terms of reference further action will be taken if necessary.  Does the Leader of the House envisage that the terms of reference are strong enough in view of the widespread controversy about Údarás na Gaeltachta?</P>
      <P>We want to make sure the proper machinery is set up to look at all the accusations that have been made against this body.  I support Údarás, all they stand for and all they have tried to do, but unfortunately so many things happened outside their terms of reference that worried us that I am extremely concerned that the terms of reference of this committee will be too restricted and that they would not have the power to make other recommendations.  For instance, if they found something that would necessitate referring the matter to the fraud squad would they have the power to do so?  I want confirmation that that is included in the terms of reference.</P>

Ní fheicim cad tá ag déanamh buartha don tSeanadóir Ferris mar tá na tearmaí tagartha atá scríofa síos anseo scóipiúil go leor.  Má aimsíonn an comhcoiste nithe áirithe go measann siad dá mbarr gur cóir moltaí neamhghnáthacha a dhéanamh don Rialtas, níl aon rud ag cur isteach orthu faoi mar a léim na téarmaí tagartha anseo.

Má fhéachann tú ar na focail atá ansin, &ldquo;treoir leis seo don Chomhchoiste um <Col N="1088" /> Chomhlachtaí Stát-Tionscanta scrúdú a dhéanamh ar ghnóthaí Údarás na Gaeltachta mar ábhar práinne&rdquo;.  Gan dabht, tá práinn leo agus tá dithneas ag teastáil láithreach agus in a theannta sin, moltaí a dhéanamh chun feabhas a chur ar fheidhmiú Údaráis na Gaeltachta.  Sílim go bhfuil an cheist an-phráinneach mar is scannalach ar fad na ráflaí a bhí ag gabháil timpeall le tamall anuas; do scannródh sé thú.  Is cúis náire agus ceann faoi do gach éinne bheith ag éisteacht leis na ráflaí sin. Chomh luath a chuirfear an comhchoiste seo ag obair is é is fearr, mar má tá rud níos tábhachtaí ná an tÚdarás féin, is é, todhchaí na Gaeilge agus todhchaí mhuintir na Gaeltachta.

      <P>In relation to Senator Murphy's and Senator Ferris' observations, the terms of reference are very wide.  This motion is deceptive in a sense, because it is so short it might give the impression that it was not very wide in its reference.  Its very shortness means it is extremely wide because it enables the joint committee to examine the affairs without any restriction, certainly in the context of the recent publicity.  It also enables the joint committee to make recommendations, again without any restriction.  The fact that it is so short means that it has virtually no restriction on what the joint committee can do.  The terms are as wide as is necessary.</P>

      <P>I would like to suggest to the body setting up the membership of the joint committee that they should consider the inclusion of an Independent from this House.  There has been a motion on the Order Paper for quite some time in the names of Senator Brendan Ryan and myself with reference to the cost of building land.  We both share the widespread concern of the public at large at what is a continuing scandal. Some people suspect that the setting up of this joint committee is a diversion from the real business of getting on with legislation and facing up to the constitutional nettle if it has to be grasped.  Such as it is, fearr é bheith ann ná as.  I am not sure who decides on membership of the committee, but here is a case where an Independent should be considered for inclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion but I want to ask two brief questions. Will it mean there will be some changes in the Constitution?  Do I take it the chairman of the committee will not be a member of the Government party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion set-thing up this joint committee of the two Houses of the Oireachtas to investigate the scandal of what has happened to building land, particularly in and around the city of Dublin.  It was because of a Labour Party Private Members' Bill in the other House requesting that certain legislative action be taken in this field that the Houses agreed to the setting up of this committee.  We agreed, as a party, to withdraw our Bill at that time in the hope that this committee might deal with some of the problems that might arise particularly those referred to by Senator Reynolds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Constitution the rights of private property must not be protected at the expense of the poorer sections of the community in need of housing.  The price of building land can determine the ultimate cost of a house and the local authorities must provide housing for people who cannot provide or service sites for themselves. As a party we have agreed to the setting up of this committee but if we are <Col N="1093" /> not satisfied with their progress in a reasonable time we will have no option but to circulate a Bill in both Houses, if necessary, to ensure that action is taken by some Government in this field, because there is discrimination against people in need of housing.  The previous Government agreed on the need for legislative action on this front and there was a motion on a previous Order Paper welcoming that commitment.  Unfortunately, politics change Governments and because of the change of Government that commitment no longer exists.  We are hoping that this committee will serve some useful purpose in highlighting the problems of the cost of building land, particularly building land available to local authorities in and around the city of Dublin.  We will be watching this committee very closely.  It is important that our party in this House are represented on this committee and we will be watching the functions of the committee very closely but we are not prepared to wait indefinitely for their report.  We want action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of this committee.  There can be little doubt that this is a major issue so far as public opinion is concerned, particularly in built-up areas and those areas which it is proposed to build up.  It is not just a matter of frivolous public opinion.  It is also a matter of principle which is enshrined in Christian social teaching and philosophy to which the majority of our people give at least nominal allegiance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation that applies at the moment, and that has applied for a number of years, is that very substantial profits have apparently been made on the sale of building land, in particular developed or serviced building land, and these profits have come in the form of a windfall. We would not necessarily oppose the idea that people should have a reasonable profit or a reasonable return from an input made by means of investment, skill or hard work, or even the ability which some people appear to have to look efficiently and effectively into the future, but when that profit is made at the expense of ordinary people, and when those ordinary <Col N="1094" /> people then have to spend the rest of their lives working off that profit, often in circumstances of very great emotional strain, financial strain, with great social and psychological cost to themselves, their families and their neighbours, then it is time our society had a good hard look at this situation.</P>
    <P>I personally welcomed the general principles behind the Bill put forward by the Labour Party, but it is fair to say that this party had some reservations about the effectiveness of the measures proposed and the ability of that Bill, as then drafted, to address itself effectively to these problems.  That is why we gave it less than full support.  I am not excessively happy at the idea of postponing immediate action on this very urgent problem.  It is part of the joking apparatus of politics that when one does not want to deal with something one appoints a committee.  I would be very unhappy if I thought this committee were going to be a means of postponing action.  I would like to assure Senator Ferris that we will be watching very closely the activities of this committee and trying to assess their willingness to address themselves urgently to this matter.  I note in that context that a date is set &mdash;&ldquo;That the Joint Committee report before 30 September, 1983&rdquo;.  I hope that would be the absolute and literal ultimate date upon which they would report, but I also hope they will report sooner.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the motion to the Constitution.  I am glad that the Constitution has been mentioned in this context. The committee are being set up in such a way that they will have to confront those sections of the Constitution which are concerned with the rights of property. Members will possibly recollect that many years ago a distinguished member of our civil service, appointed not directly by our own people but nevertheless somebody whose record proved he had the interests of our people at heart, said that property had its duties as well as its rights.  The whole question of private property is a complex one because on the one hand, property is, in our kind of society, the means by which we assure security to people, and, on the other <Col N="1095" /> hand, a means by which the weak in our society can be exploited and inequities and injustices underlined and perpetuated.</P>
    <P>I wish this committee every success and hope they will have the courage and the perseverence to address themselves to their task and produce a result which will rectify the grave injustice that exists at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of this committee.  Like the previous speaker, I would like to set out a number of areas where I feel there may be limitations in the motion.  It is desirable to introduce some system whereby the cost of building land to the house purchaser would be reduced, or that as a constituent of the cost of house prices it would be seen not to increase at the same rate as over the past number of years.  There are, however, a number of matters relating to building land and development generally which do not come within the ambit of this committee and which I feel are very relevant to the whole sphere of development: I speak, of course, of planning and development strategy.  There is a reference to the Planning and Development Act in the document before us.</P>
      <P>Anyone who looks objectively at development as it has taken place in the greater Dublin region for the past ten years cannot but ask how and why development has taken place in that fashion. There are financial implications, but the major financial implications is that large scale land acquisitions have been entered into by business interests &mdash; which they are quite entitled to do, and I have no objection to that &mdash; but by their acquisition they and they alone have determined where development will take place.  In my view it is entirely wrong that development should be at the behest of vested interests and not of the elected representatives or the Government of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that we introduce planning and development strategy objectives.  When this committee are sitting there should be some attempt to ensure that when development takes place in the future it will be purely as a <Col N="1096" /> result of Government or local authority objectives and not large scale acquisition by speculators who by sheer pressure will ensure that the land they have acquired will become much more valuable and will eventually become development land.  If we continue our present spate of development, in about 50 years time we will finish up somewhere on the outskirts of Mullingar with a concrete jungle behind us.  That would be entirely undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their welcome to this motion.  In the Dáil debate on the Local Government (Building Land) Bill, 1982, the Government made a commitment that this Joint Committee would be set up.  Considerable discussions have taken place since then with the Opposition parties and the terms of the motion on the Order Paper are the terms that were agreed.  I am surprised to hear Senators, particularly Senator Ferris, refer to the fact that his party wanted action.  Action has been taken and the time limit is set out in paragraph 7 which states &ldquo;That the Joint Committee report before 30 September, 1983&rdquo;.  This was agreed with by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy and Senator O'Connell said they were afraid this was just a long fingering exercise.  I can assure them that the Government are very anxious that this nettle of land and the cost of building land will be firmly grasped. There is no point talking about it any longer.  It is something that governments have to take action on, and we want the action to be positive and lasting.  That is why the terms of reference are as drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as membership of the committee is concerned, this is a matter for the Committee of Selection of this House.  I am sure the committee will take note of the fact that Senator Murphy and Senator B. Ryan had the motion on the Order Paper. Senator Reynolds raised the question of constitutional change.  That is covered in the terms of reference as drafted and I have given that assurance in the House. The chairmanship of the committee is a matter for the committee, but there are precedents for the chairman being from another party than the Government <Col N="1097" /> party.  That is the tradition of joint committees.</P>
    <P>The question of planning and the development of the greater Dublin area, the urban areas generally and the urban sprawl, comes under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976 and is one of the items to be examined by the joint committee.  I fully agree with Senators that the whole question of land banks being bought by the private sector should be tackled, and it is the root cause of the problem that the committee are to examine.  I have no doubt the joint committee will concentrate very much on this question.  I will be coming back to the Seanad later today with the planning Bill and we may take that opportunity to discuss in greater detail the point made by Senator Durkan, if he would care to come in at that stage.</P>
    <P>Just in case the Seanad is under the impression that nothing is happening and that we are merely setting up a committee and in the meantime the Government have taken no action, I would remind Senators that in order to crack down on exorbitant profits from dealings in building land and to ensure that a significant proportion of windfall gains resulting from the provision of services are returned to the community, significant changes in capital gains tax were announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, in the budget statement on 25 March last.  I would like to remind Senator O'Connell that a capital gains tax rate of 50 per cent on gains from disposal of development land was announced; a new rate of 60 per cent for gains within one year of acquisition, and a 40 per cent rate where land is compulsorily acquired were also announced, as were new restrictions affecting indexation relief, roll-over relief and the right to set off losses.  A lot has been done, and a lot remains to be done.  I have full confidence that with the terms of reference of this committee, their report will be important to the future, to property values and to housing prices.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment, I look forward to receiving that report from the joint committee before 30 September <Col N="1098" /> 1983.  I wish to say to Senator O'Connell that it is not a date for which they have to wait: if they have their work finished before then all the better.  However, the terms of reference are very wide and they have a lot of work to do.  I can assure the members of the committee that they will receive full co-operation from all Government Departments in the matter of documentation and files.  I would like to thank the Seanad for the welcome they have given to the terms of reference.</P>

      <P>This Bill comes to the Seanad after a very thorough consideration in the Dáil.  During its passage a number of amendments were agreed which I think have strengthened the provisions and have helped to clarify the objectives of the legislation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a National Community Development Agency on a permanent, statutory basis.  The agency will be given wide-ranging powers to promote and encourage community development, self-help and voluntary activity with the object of creating a genuinely caring community and eliminating poverty and inequality.</P>
      <P>The term community development has a number of different connotations.  In the context of the Bill it is intended to encompass the voluntary efforts of groups and individuals who are seeking to improve their local areas or are working on behalf of underprivileged and disadvantaged members of society.  The primary purpose of the agency will be to support and assist voluntary effort in all its forms and, in particular, those actions and initiatives directed at alleviating poverty and social deprivation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency will act as a resource, consultancy and activating centre to these groups and organisations and will be able <Col N="1099" /> to provide both material and financial assistance.  Indeed, it is my intention that the bulk of the moneys at the disposal of the agency will be filtered into local groups and projects.  In most cases, the initiative for projects and activities will come from local groups themselves.  In addition, however, the agency will be empowered to undertake experimental programmes aimed at developing community action and eliminating poverty and social deprivation.  I see this as one of the most important features of the legislation.  It will enable the agency to devise and test out new strategies and techniques in the fields of community development, poverty, self-help and social services.</P>
    <P>However, it is not my intention that the agency should become involved in providing services or in undertaking action on a long-term, continuous basis. Rather the approach will be that where an experimental programme has revealed an unmet need or has proven a new approach to meeting need, responsibility for dealing with the situation on a long-term basis will be assigned to the relevant statutory body or voluntary agencies, where appropriate.  Otherwise, the agency would quickly become bogged down on the detailed administration of services and would not be able to take the broader view of social policy with which it is charged.</P>
    <P>The agency will, at all times, work in close consultation with health boards, local authorities, vocational educational committees and other statutory bodies whose functions impinge on community development, poverty and social deprivation. Indeed, the Bill contains two provisions to facilitate and, where necessary, ensure co-operation between statutory bodies and the agency.  First, it extends power to any board or body established by or under statute to co-operate with the agency in the performance of their functions. Secondly, it provides that a statutory body shall co-operate with the agency where so directed by the appropriate Minister.  I would, of course, expect that the latter provision will be rarely used but it has been included in <Col N="1100" /> order to overcome any possible obstacles to the effective working of the agency.</P>
    <P>An important function of the agency will be to advise and make recommendations to the Minister in relation to community development policies and programmes and on the social aspects of national economic and social planning. The agency will also advise on the development of the social services and community-based services generally.  It is clear that the agency will play a key role in the formulation of government social policy and in helping to ensure that our social services are continually reviewed to cater for the changing needs and aspirations of our expanding population.</P>
    <P>Many of the functions which are to be assigned to the agency are already being discharged by the National Social Service Board.  I established the National Social Service Board in June 1981 in place of the National Social Service Council which had been set up in 1971.  The board is an informal, unincorporated body.  It is charged with stimulating and encouraging the formation of voluntary social service councils and supporting the expansion and development of existing councils.  The board also co-ordinates the work of the network of community information centres and provides a central information and advisory service to voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>Following a detailed consideration of the position, it is my view that these functions are inseparable from the whole process of promoting community development and alleviating social deprivation which is to be undertaken by the new agency.  The Bill, therefore, provides for the dissolution of the National Social Service Board and transfer of its staff, functions and responsibilities to the agency.  There will, of course, be full consultation with the staff involved and I would like to take this opportunity to assure them that their existing rights and entitlements will be protected.  I am hopeful, however, that the staff will welcome this development which will give them the permanent status and security of employment which they have been seeking for some time.</P>
    <P>In addition to the staff of the National <Col N="1101" /> Social Service Board, the agency will be empowered to recruit other staff and to engage consultants and advisers.  I want to make it clear that I do not intend to allow the agency to become a top-heavy, bureaucratic organisation divorced from the reality of community life and social deprivation.  I will expect the agency to keep their permanent staffing to the absolute minimum and, as far as possible, to avail of the skills and experience of the many professionals and volunteers already engaged at local level in community development and social services.</P>
    <P>Community development is about self-help and the elimination of social deprivation.  When we talk about community development we are talking about the development of people as individuals, about giving people a sense of self-worth, a sense of identity, and a realisation of their collective strength.  What community development does not mean is a return to the <i>laissez-faire</i> concept.  It does not mean that people will be expected to solve by themselves the major social and economic problems with which they are faced.  These may demand major structural change to find long-term solutions. Community development envisages the efforts of people being linked to those of government in a search for these solutions. In other words, a new relationship between people and government.  There is a wealth of evidence to suggest that such a partnership can release a major source of energy and ability which has been largely untapped up to the present.</P>
    <P>What is being proposed will not in any way discard what has already been achieved by voluntary agencies which have a community development approach.  These include Muintir na Tire, Foróige, social service councils, local development associations, community associations and community councils.  I hope that their experience and expertise will be available to the new agency.  The agency will build on their experience and on the lessons of the successes, and indeed fortunes, of the past.  I hope to see developed through the National Community Development Agency a new and dynamic approach to tackling the serious social problems with which we <Col N="1102" /> are faced and developing our full potential as a community.</P>
    <P>It is in that spirit that I commend the Bill to Senators for a Second Reading.  I will listen to their comments and suggestions with great interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreBolger" hpid="Mrs. Bolger Mrs. Bolger">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bolger</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill but I feel bound to say that I am slightly disappointed in many aspects of it.  In particular, I regret that the Minister has not made poverty the heart of the Bill.  This agency will have to face a real challenge, given the enormity and the complexity of the problems we have in this country today.  There are too many generalities and vague terms used in the Bill.  I am concerned that remedial action and research will be lost.  Research and remedial action should be the main aim of this very important Bill.</P>
      <P>The agency's duty in order to eliminate poverty in our society should be critically to appraise the Government's policy in every single Department in order to get at the root cause of poverty, and the fact that one million of our people are poor. This research, should spread over all Departments.  I take the Department of the Environment as an example.  We have extraordinary problems in this country, with substandard housing, overcrowding and lack of sanitation.  It is unbelievable in this year of 1982 to canvass around this country and see houses without running water, toilets or electricity and worse than that, no way of getting any of these facilities in the near future.  All politicians have seen such houses.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education could help in many areas in the battle against poverty.  We have so many poor families who often have to get their children to leave school at a very early age to go out and supplement the family income. Indeed, the poor financing of our educational system does not allow for the development and maturity of our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency should also examine the problems experienced in low income households.  With inflation and ever-increasing unemployment, many of these people live in fear and dread of tomorrow. There are problems, too, for one-parent <Col N="1103" /> families and for homeless children. We saw many such children during the Dublin West by-election, wandering the streets at night, glue-sniffing and vandalism everywhere.  It is all a result of our lack of concern, understanding and willingness to come to grips with the problems in these areas.  The itinerant families, the widows and the widowers also have a certain kind of poverty in our society today.</P>
    <P>No one should be more aware of the extent of poverty in this country than our politicians.  It is enlightening and horrifying on a canvass to encounter all the difficulties caused by poverty.  I would like to quote from Sister Stanislaus' book &ldquo;One Million Poor&rdquo;.  She states:</P>
    <P>Change must be brought about by courageous political leadership allied to hard and patient political and technical work.  Above all, it must be brought about by harmonising the skills and insights of people themselves, and especially of poor and deprived people.  Policies for people rather than policies for administrators and institutions must be developed.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this country in recent years has done more to help the poor than Sister Stanislaus and certainly I regret she was not re-appointed to the health board where she had a tremendous contribution to make.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am disappointed in the Bill.  We start off by looking at the Title of the Bill.  It is an Act to provide for the establishment of a body to advise the Minister.  I suggest that the Minister, and Ministers of various Departments, have been advised over and over again of the reasons for poverty in this country and the way to rectify it.  We come again to self-help.  Self-help is a very vague term.  I suggest that the real poor are so busy trying to live from day-to-day that they do not have the time or the knowhow to help themselves.</P>
    <P>We go on to talk about community development.  As the Minister has said, this could mean many things in many areas.  For example, in the town that I come from community development <Col N="1104" /> started the scout movement, the girl guide movement, gymnastics, and has opened a town park.  I do not think in that context the term &ldquo;community development&rdquo; could be seen as helping the poor.  It is very important to be more specific about community development because there could be much misunderstanding in this area.  The matter needs to be clarified.  I am extremely worried that there will be overlapping and duplication of the work of this agency.  It is hard to see how the agency will not overlap work already being done in the community and work being done by voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the administrative costs of the agency.  I would like to ask the Minister how much of the £2 million will actually reach the poor people?  Will most of this money be spent on setting up the agency and paying the staff?  I am afraid that very little of this £2 million will actually get into the homes of the poor.</P>
    <P>I hope that as the agency grows the Minister will look very carefully and monitor very carefully the geographic effectiveness of this agency.  I know there are very serious areas for concern in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and the big cities in Ireland but I am extremely concerned about the awful poverty that exists in rural Ireland today.  I would like to see a balance kept here, to see that the agency will be geographically spread over the whole country, particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to know, also, if there is a real commitment to continue and pursue the pilot schemes originally commenced by the Combat Poverty Committee and by the National Social Service Board.  I feel the Minister should consider having a representative of the poor on this committee.  It is extremely important that they have a voice to speak on their own behalf.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister inform us how binding the recommendations of the agency will be on the Government in regard to policy-making, thereby helping to alleviate and abolish poverty?  I believe &mdash; and perhaps the Minister may correct me &mdash; that in the setting up of this agency <Col N="1105" /> and in the drafting of the Bill there has been no communication whatsoever with the National Social Services Agency. How sure is the Minister that they will co-operate and that they will knit in with this new structure?  I believe this area of community development in itself has not been one of their functions and I would imagine that it will be rather strange for them in this area.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 5, which deals with appointing the members of the agency, perhaps the Minister will give us some outline as to the qualities and expertise he will be looking for on this committee. I am quite sure that the Minister will appoint Sister Stanislaus on this because she is, as I have already said, one of the most experienced people in this sphere in our society today.  When Committee Stage is taken I will go further into the different aspects of the Bill but in the meantime I look forward to hearing the other contributions and the Minister's remarks on the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, as the other speaker has done, to welcome this Bill to the Seanad.  I think that perhaps despite some excellent points made by Senator Bolger she overlooked the main thrust of the speech of the Minister.  Senator Bolger instanced the Department of the Environment and the Department of Education as areas where such social deprivation exists and which should be probed.  I see quite clearly that the Minister aims in his speech and in his Bill to do such a thing.  He said &ldquo;The agency will be empowered to undertake experimental programmes aimed at developing community action and eliminating poverty and social deprivation&rdquo;.  He takes up that point: where such an experimental programme shows a need, the statutory bodies in those particular areas &mdash; and the hopes they do not have to or that they will not have to be compelled to do so &mdash; will be empowered to work with the agency in bringing forth those programmes and to provide action where action is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Bolger, I have seen where social deprivation has had an enormous effect on the lifestyle of the people. <Col N="1106" /> First, I instance the Department of the Environment.  I remain firmly convinced that the shortcomings in people's habitats, in their houses, in how they live and what they have to put up with, have an enormous effect on how they are able to cope with the tensions and stresses of life. I am glad to see that the Minister in his speech has spoken of the statutory agencies and of the local authorities and how this agency will be empowered to work with them.  More importantly, the local authorities, the VECs and the various statutory agencies will be compelled, if they do not do it voluntarily, to work with the agency and to carry out its experimental programme if the programmes show deprivation in any particular area. This is very much to be welcomed, and I think this area was not explored fully in the previous programmes.</P>
    <P>We have spoken of poverty.  There is poverty of very different kinds.  To speak about the poor as poor is in fact denigrating them in the very words you use. There is poverty of mind, of spirit and of physical needs.  I see the primary thrust of this Bill as enrichment, perhaps of people's spirits and of their minds, and of enabling them to see their own problems to assess them, and to see what they can do.</P>
    <P>Here I bring in the Department of Education.  I was very interested last year to read of the Rutland Street experiment in Dublin which was, I understand, an inner-city development involving young children who might later be perceived as children who could become drop-outs or whose environment and upbringing would lead them that way.  A novel experiment was tried out in collaboration with the Dutch authorities, perhaps even funded by Holland, where the parents at the early stages came in and mixed with their children and were free to move about the classrooms in a very unstructured, non-academic way.  I understand they are now evaluating this Rutland project.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the informal approach to education adopted in this instance was of great benefit to those young boys and girls when they came to later stages of their schooling and of <Col N="1107" /> deciding what they would do with their lives.  When this agency find their feet perhaps they might see the Department of the Environment and the Department of Education as two areas where they might initiate their experimental programmes.</P>
    <P>I would like very much to see something of this done in a semi-urban/rural area to evaluate the effect of the lack of decent housing on the lives of people. We are all convinced that it has an effect on people, on their later diminution of spirit and of mind, but it would be valuable to know the precise extent.  I would like to know the effect of social deprivation on the education of children.</P>
    <P>Poverty has so many aspects to it. Equality is important.  It is very easy to say there is free education, that nowadays everybody who wants to can go on to second-level or third-level.  They can, but if their environment is not of the proper nature it will militate against all, other than the tough, resilient young people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has given a commitment in this matter. He said that the statutory bodies shall co-operate with the agency when so directed by the appropriate Minister.  I shall return to this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister does not intend to allow the agency to become a top-heavy bureaucratic organisation divorced from the reality of real life and real deprivation.  We often feel there are far too many officers and not enough foot soldiers in many areas of life.  I ask the Minister to stick to what he has said, to make this a really effective Bill.  I ask him to monitor it closely.  We will be monitoring it closely as public representatives. It is a fine Bill, with a fine feeling for people behind it and I wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that our two major parties between whom effectively government has been shared in this country for the last 60 years are now agreed that we have a problem of poverty in the country and are now disagreeing among themselves about how we should deal with it.  That must be counted as <Col N="1108" /> progress, even if the previous poor generation had to emigrate because neither party could manage to give them a living at home.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary, really, when you think about the scope of this Bill.  I do not think the Minister has finally given approval to the accepted figure, or the widely accepted figure, that there are 1,000,000 poor people in the country. Later on I will take some exception to the words &ldquo;poor&rdquo; or &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; as they are usually and widely defined and what they are taken to mean.  Something else is involved.</P>
      <P>There are around 1,000,000 people who, by any standards, are poor.  It is important to identify in some detail who are the poor, because the poor are not a homogenous unit of 1,000,000 people. They are an extremely complex mix of marginal groups, all of whom have, for one reason or another, been discarded or left aside or who never had capacity to produce and hence are marginal to the central fundamental role of the economy we have, which is to produce.  At the top of the list, but by no means exclusively so, would be the recipients of long-term social welfare benefits, and while it is popular &mdash; and quite right &mdash; to talk about the inadequacy in many cases of the income of pensioners, it is interesting to note that in 1973 the average pension was about 22 per cent of wages in manufacturing industry.  By 1979, despite five or six years of fairly considerable growth, the average pension had reached 23.7 per cent.  At that rate of going it will take a long time to bring pensions into line with the accepted standard of living of those who are engaged in the productive process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not so popular to talk about another very large group who depend on social welfare, which is our 150,000 unemployed.  It is not often that you will hear politicians of any party say that the level of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance is inadequate because we, as a society, have become conditioned to the propaganda which suggests that even though we have an unemployment problem, basically a large number of the unemployed are not the <Col N="1109" /> deserving unemployed; they are the &ldquo;chancers&rdquo;.  Consequently, we have a fairly vocal, consistent, widespread and highly sophisticated well-funded campaign which is chipping away at aspects of the social welfare code, in particular as they affect the unemployed.  I would not deny that there are abuses and anomalies, but surely out of 150,000 people the anomalies and abuses must be recognised. It is a good indication that the sources of these campaigns and allegations about this section of the poor never had to deal with the labour exchange, never had to deal with the humiliations involved in &ldquo;signing on&rdquo; or they would know how difficult it would be to pursue any long-term abuse of benefits.  It is disappointing to see the Government &mdash; and I presume the Minister was involved &mdash; agreeing to a review body to look at the anomalies to do with the things that have been highlighted.  There are all sorts of anomalies in the social welfare code.  To highlight the anomalies which lead to allegations of abuse while not looking at the anomalies which can lead to great hardship and great humiliation for people is a totally one-sided view of poverty and of the problem.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat here, in case it should go by default, that among the groups that are poor in this country the unemployed loom second to our old people as the largest single poor group. They are entitled to dignity and they are also entitled to proper treatment.  They could well deserve to be left without the constant harping week after week from employers' bodies, from industrialists, from occasional politicians and from many people who should know better.  As recently as yesterday there was another propaganda publication from the Federated Union of Employers about a worth-while and necessary improvement that the Minister for Social Welfare is bringing in, and included in that were three or four other suggestions for modification and improvement.  That is not the way to create a climate of compassion and concern in this country for those who have fallen out of the competitive rat race that most of us have managed to benefit from.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> Central to any strategy to deal with poverty must be a fundamental, real and substantial increase in the level of social welfare assistance.  If we do not give people decent incomes all the other services that we provide will lead us nowhere.  The unemployed is one of the prime areas of need, because it seems to be an area where fewer and fewer people are willing to defend their rights because of a very sophisticated campaign.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that we should have such appalling services for single parent families, particularly in the light of the opinions about the sacredness of human life which is &mdash; I use the word advisedly and with some consideration &mdash; much touted in this country at present.  If we really cared about single parents and their children, born or unborn, we would do something tangible about it and something which costs money.  I would respectfully suggest that any Government which provided a comprehensive service for single parents and their children and identified that as the cause of another penny on a pint or another 2p on a packet of cigarettes would not run into much political opposition, particularly in the climate of the present mood about constitutional amendments.  Yet our single parents are left out.  They are not planned for by local authorities.  I recently had a letter from a voluntary organisation specifically highlighting that problem.  Local authorities do not plan for the fact that we now have large numbers of single parent families and that small units are not provided for them.  They are discriminated against in the private accommodation sector.  As previous speakers have said, if you do not provide people with the basic fundamental housing rights then nothing else will be of any benefit.  The basic fundamental requisite for the abolition of poverty is a home and an income, and if those two things are not provided or only one without the other then you will not do anything reasonably fundamental to help people.</P>
    <P>Our single parents are under-supported and are discriminated against.  We have nonsenses in our regulations about technicalities like cohabiting which I believe means that if a person of the <Col N="1111" /> opposite sex stays over two nights it is a casual affair but if it is three nights that becomes cohabiting.  Perhaps that is not in our regulations but I understand it is in the British regulations.  We tend to copy them, but perhaps the Minister has a different definition of cohabiting&mdash;it is no reflection on the Minister.  It is a nonsense that services that are provided and ought to be directed towards the children of single parents can be cut off because of the sort of relationship the parents choose to enter into.  I do not think that is good social policy, and it will create further problems later on.</P>
    <P>There are 80,000 old people living alone in this country.  There are 40,000 in the Republic.  Of those in the Republic almost 60 per cent do not even have hot water.  Interestingly enough, the percentages in the North of Ireland who lack these basic amenities are much smaller. I have taken these figures from the St. Vincent de Paul Society's report on old people living alone.  The extraordinary thing about that report &mdash; I am aware that this Government, to their credit, have set up a task force to improve the quality of accommodation for old people living alone &mdash; is that most of these old people express themselves as relatively happy with the conditions in which they live.  I find it very distressing that we can have so many of our old people living in what are accepted to be appalling conditions. They are so conditioned by our neglect that they have learned to put up with what anybody else would regard as primitive standards of accommodation.</P>
    <P>We have 13,000 travellers: that is the latest figure I could get.  Fifty per cent of them are children.  I suspect that very few of those are living in serviced sites.  I think the term &ldquo;serviced site&rdquo; is often a misnomer. I do not want to go over ground that the Minister and I went over later one night here last week.  There is no doubt about it that the programme that was set up ten years ago or 20 years ago has not come anywhere near reaching the objectives that were set.</P>
    <P>There is a good question to be asked about whether a general medical service based on the idea of people living at home <Col N="1112" /> can properly respond to anyone who is homeless however flexible it operates. Then we have a group to which I have a certain particular commitment, and they are the homeless.  The way in which, with the best intentions in the world, public and statutory services and Government Departments can go about identifying a problem always bothers me.  It has come to my knowledge that there is an <i>ad hoc</i> working party involving the Department of the of Health and the Department of the Environment, also local authorities and health boards, and that they are investigating the problems of the homeless. What I find quite extraordinary is that the voluntary group with which I am closely associated, which I would have thought would have been identified as one of the major voluntary groups working in this area, has not been consulted at all about the problem of homelessness, the scale, the extent, the need of anything else.  Not one branch of the organisation, in one area, was consulted in Dublin, Cork or Dundalk, and the national office of the Simon Community has not in any way been contacted by this <i>ad hoc</i> working party.  It is that sort of experience that makes me a bit sceptical when Ministers of different and successive Governments talk about the role of voluntary groups and the importance of voluntary groups and the contribution of voluntary groups. There is a lot of codswollop talked by people in the statutory services about voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>A group often forgotten in the discussions about who is poor and what is poverty in this country are those who are in institutional long-term care, particularly long-term patients of our psychiatric hospitals. Figures show about 14,000 people in long-term institutional care.  It has been estimated that the total cost to the community of maintaining those people for an average lifespan in long-term institutional care will come to something close to £2,000 million.  We need some imagination and courage to deal with these people.  I would like to say something here which will bring down on me the wrath of a body with which I am closely associated and that is that I think the role of the trade union movement in the psychiatric <Col N="1113" /> hospitals and the trade unions in particular has not been of any credit to the trade union movement or to those trade unions.  necessary worthwhile improvements like the integration of the sexes in long-stay psychiatric hospitals have been held up for years by the unwillingness of the trade unions involved to accept that simple innovation.  I find that objectionable.  It embarasses me as a committed supporter of the trade union movement and as an active trade unionist. It is terribly wrong to the people involved.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that even if that were done many of our psychiatric hospitals are acceptable.  There are about six long-term psychiatric hospitals in the country that I am aware of where the only realistic policy would be to close them down.  It was suggested in Cork that the long-stay psychiatric hospital, Our Lady's Hospital, should have been converted into offices for the officials and the staff of the health board and that the money that was spent in developing offices for the health board be used to open a new psychiatric hospital.  That particular proposal made very little progress, because I assume that the accommodation which was satisfactory for phychiatric patients would not be satisfactory for officials and senior management staff of the health board.</P>
    <P>Another problem that the trade union movement tends to ignore is that there are many people in rural Ireland who are poor.  In 1979 there were 40,000 cases of farmers where the family income was less than £2,000 a year.  Can I say here that I for one think that what is called the rural dole is a fine, worthwhile innovation?  It has been described by somebody as a subsidy to stay on the land: it is right in itself and it has probably minimised or reduced migration to the cities which would have produced further serious social problems which would have been wrong in themselves and would also have imposed enormous cost on our society.</P>
    <P>It is also worth mentioning that in a society which believes itself to have provided free second-level education, 9 per cent of our children leave school before they are 15 years of age and 15 per cent <Col N="1114" /> leave at 15.  In other words, close to 25 per cent of our children leave school at or before they are 15.  When I found that out I was surprised.  I thought I had some idea of what was going on in our society. I suspect that many people in our society will be surprised to learn that 25 per cent of our children do not progress beyond the compulsory education stage.</P>
    <P>That is an attempt to put some of the facts of poverty, the scale of poverty, the extent of poverty and the range of problems to the House.  They are complex and complicated and they do cover all sorts of groups with different and possibly even conflicting interests.  They are there and they need to be considered.</P>
    <P>There is another group, somewhat more difficult to identify but they are there.  They are the badly-paid and the poorly-paid.  Horrifying stories surface every so often about the payment of people in, for example, solicitors' offices, in the hairdressing business, in the catering industry, particularly in the smaller branches of the catering industry, of people being paid literally £15, £20 and £25 a week.  It is quite astonishing, and in the context of those who would claim the incentive to work is being destroyed by welfare, it is an extraordinary reflection that people still work for that sort of pittance.  That is all it is, a pittance.  Mark you £25 a week is near the £29 a week that we expect a single person to live on if he is unemployed and drawing unemployment assistance.  Pittances are pittances no matter whether we as a community provide them as a form of social welfare or an exploiting employer provides them in the form of wages.</P>
    <P>People are poor because their income is inadequate, because the services that are provided, whether educational, medical etc. are inadequate and because the environment in which they are expected to live is inadequate.  In other words their housing and their surrounding environment are inadequate.  We could talk about this forever.  These are facts, but that is not the end or anything like the end of the problem of poverty.  The question arises then, why do poor people put up, as they do, with inadequacies of income, appalling services and often appalling <Col N="1115" /> environment?  The one common denominator to all poor people is their effective powerlessness in our society.  This is usually preached sanctimoniously in the media in terms of the farmers' lobby and the trade union lobby and all of that.  It is not an accident that the poor are powerless. It is not an accident that they are inarticulate.  I would like to elaborate on this powerlessness first of all.  Is it not worthy of more comment than it gets that in our urban areas the poorer the area the lower will be the participation in parliamentary elections?  Dublin's inner city, for instance, has probably the lowest percentage poll in the country.  People can produce excuses about out-of-date registers and so on, but, in fact, I would say that the real poor of our urban areas do not see political parties in any way as part of their interest or support or part of their services.  I think recent electoral changes, particularly in the city of Dublin, have suggested that perhaps they are beginning to see groups other than the major political parties as being more committed to their interests.  I doubt very much if the poor see the Churches as being in any way on their side.  I doubt this very much. I do not want to get involved in a long harangue about the Churches here but I do not believe that the Churches would be seen in that light.</P>
    <P>I regret to say this, and I will get myself a reputation for bashing the Garda if I say it more often: I am convinced that in most of the large urban areas, for large groups of people the Garda are not seen as a protection but as an instrument of oppression.  I think people see the Garda as people who turn up when there is something being lifted, when there is somebody in trouble but not really a presence to be welcomed as a sign of protection and support.  We could argue about this forever but there is a fair amount of evidence that this is true.  What is unquestionably true is that the procedures and the atmosphere of a court of law would be overwhelmingly oppressive to anybody from a poor background.  The commonalty of interest between prosecutor, defendant, garda and justice would be far in excess of any commonalty of interest <Col N="1116" /> that the poor might feel between himself or herself and those who are there allegedly to protect him.  The law is not equal: people are not equal before the law; the poor suffer before the law.</P>
    <P>Indeed, those of us in the Simon Community discovered in Dublin recently that when it comes to the planning laws the poor are not equal because when seven poor people move into a house that is a change of use, but when a landlord rents out a house to seven relatively prosperous people that is OK and you do not need planning permission.  When they are poor people, to whom others can object, then it becomes a change of use.</P>
    <P>Finally, the social services, as they are delivered, as they are organised and as they are run could be nothing other than an instrument of oppression against the poor.  Apart altogether from the inadequacy of the services, the quality and standard of delivery must have a humiliating impact on anybody.  Our major labour exchanges are disgraceful buildings. Let nobody tell me that it is merely a question of shortage of finance.  They were disgraceful buildings in the days when the country had a relatively high level of prosperity.  I remember when I was a student visiting the labour exchange in Werburg Street in Dublin, and the eternal presence of a garda, obviously there to make sure that all these poor people would behave themselves and that all these unemployed people would do what they were told, did not exactly convey the atmosphere of support, service, care and consideration that ought to be the atmosphere of social services.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary rigmarole involved in things like getting a medical card, and there are extraordinarily insensitive decisions made by people about running labour exchanges.  For instance, in my own city of Cork the women's section is upstairs.  No buggies are allowed upstairs; therefore, married women abandon their buggies and carry their children up.  There is practically nowhere for a pregnant woman to sit down.  The queues can take an hour or an hour-and-a-half and I understand that the chaos between screaming children <Col N="1117" /> and everything else is enormous and apparently cannot be changed.  I do not believe that that is an untypical example of the way our poor people are treated. The quality of delivery of the social services is scandalously inadequate.  One only has to compare, for instance, the quality of the office accommodation provided for offices of a health board and the quality of the accommodation often provided for the recipients of the services of those health boards to understand what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>The social welfare appeals system is another classic example of the oppression of poor people.  It is loaded against them. The person about whom a judgement is being made can never confront the person who has provided the evidence on which the judgment is made.  People cannot use the legal aid centres if they have complaints about the social welfare code. They are specifically excluded from the range of services provided by the Legal Aid Board.  All this I suspect &mdash; and I am not accusing anybody of deliberate design, &mdash; is in consequence of a philosophy about the social services which is influenced more than a little by the campaigns against welfare that have been sponsored by people who, in my opinion, would spend more on cigars in a year than a single person on unemployment assistance would get in about three years.  Still they can campaign about welfare and so on.</P>
    <P>What causes poverty?  I think I shall cease to use the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; because it is the wrong word.  Poverty is not just an accidental misfortune that befell people because those of us in the relatively prosperous upper working-class, middle-class and further up classes, forgot about them, but now that we have noticed them and discovered them, it is all going to go away because we have discovered our conscience and it is &ldquo;all going to happen.&rdquo;  It is not like that.  They are there because of the way we have organised our society.  They are there because of the values our society has enshrined in its <i>de facto</i> living as distinct from the noble aspirations that our Constitution might give us.  For instance, we enshrine competition.  We recognise the <Col N="1118" /> role of competition and the competitive factor in economics and in all sorts of areas.  But if you have competition you have winners &mdash; who are all of us here &mdash; and you have losers.  If you have winners you must have losers and you must have contrasts between them.  If you enshrine material benefit, material gain and the accumulation of material goods over and above what we would all recognise as a reasonable standard of living, if these are enshrined as the measure of your success, as the measure of your achievement, as the measure of your winning in the competition of life, then quite obviously those who do not win must be seen to be less well off.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what I would say is that poverty is not an accident but a necessary consequence of the way we have chosen to organise our society.  If it is a necessary consequence of the way we have chosen to organise our society then they are not under-privileged, they are not disadvantaged, they are people who have to be like that because we want to be the way we are and they are, therefore, oppressed.  It is not an accident: it is a necessary consequence of the way our society is organised and, therefore, they are not really the poor: they are the oppressed.  They are the victims of the way our society is organised.  It is fundamentally, before all else, a question of values.  I do not want to dismiss the new poor, the people who are talked about frequently, the middle-class people who are victims of redundancies and so on.  That is a separate and very serious problem and could be dealt with by services in a way that the structural poverty, which is oppression, cannot be dealt with.  But the poverty of the new poor could be dealt with by services, income maintenance, income support and so on.</P>
    <P>I am talking about the children who are born into a poor family.  They are poor because of unemployment or are poorly paid or because of some family problem.  Because they are unemployed and because they are poorly paid their housing will be inadequate.  Quite likely, as a consequence they will be poorly fed. It is quite likely in spite of the successes &mdash; and they are successes of the general <Col N="1119" /> medical services &mdash; that they will receive poor medical care.</P>
    <P>I would like to record here, in passing, the comment of a young married woman from Dublin's inner city about the services available to her, trying desperately to survive on an inadequate income.  At one stage when she discovered the price of tranquillisers she said if they gave her the price of the tranquillisers instead of the tranquillisers she would not need the tranquillisers.  She needed the tranquillisers because she could not afford to pay electricity bills and so on.  That bears thinking about.  I have heard it said so often that the one thing we can deliver in unlimited quantities to poor people are drugs on prescription; it sort of mitigates their own feelings about the hardships they are under.  We cannot even deliver on the payment of an electricity bill in a guaranteed way.  I have heard too many stories about social workers going from the St. Vincent de Paul Society to some other body because somebody in the supplementary welfare system had decided that they had paid last month's electricity bill: &ldquo;These people are obviously not trying and we will not pay this one&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To get back to the family cycle, they are poorly housed, poorly nourished and consequently the children are pressurised to leave school even before they reach the legal limit and they probably have not been attending school in the last couple of years anyway.  Where does this lead to?  They end up in dead-end jobs, poorly paid jobs with no prospects.  Therefore they remain poor and they are back into the cycle again.  There is a myth &mdash; and it is often attributed to people who come to the Simon Community &mdash; that these problems strike everybody evenly and that one will meet all sorts in the Simon Community.  You will if you look often enough, but the facts are that 95 per cent of the people who stay in the Simon Community night shelters were poor from the day they were born, are victims of poverty and are the products of poverty.  It is not some sort of an extraordinary phenomenon that hits everybody equally.  It hits the poor most of all, the <Col N="1120" /> products of broken families, the products of broken homes.  That is what poverty does to people and that is what we do to people.  There is no point in pretending that poverty is just simply something that happens to people.  The extremes of poverty are also produced by the experience of poverty and there is no other way of looking at it.</P>
    <P>It should be said that there are vested interests in poverty.  People need people to take poorly-paid jobs.  People need people to take the jobs I was talking about in the service industries in particular. They are needed.  A proper comprehensive campaign to abolish poverty will run up against that particular vested interest very quickly.  So what can be done?  I happen to believe that a real, final and fundamental solution to poverty will not be produced as long as we maintain our present social and economic system because its fundamental values are contradictory to any aspiration to abolish poverty.  A real poverty agency would have as its primary object to lead the poor to challenge the existing social and economic order which has caused them to be poor in the first place.  I should like to quote the former Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, in Kilkenny at the poverty conference last year.  He said:</P>
    <P>A poverty agency and the final objective of people working to abolish poverty would be to subvert the existing order.</P>
    <P>I agree with him.  A proper poverty agency ought to be in capital letters, subversive to the present social and economic order.  The word &ldquo;subversive&rdquo; has been taken over by paramilitary terrorists and nasty people like them and therefore people do not like to use it anymore.  A poverty agency would have to lead those who are poor, one-quarter of the population, to challenge the existing structures, the existing attitudes and values and the processes which create poverty.</P>
    <P>If the Minister really wants to do something about poverty he would leave out of his Bill the various caveats, cautions and protections which effectively allow him to intervene at any stage in any area of the work to get rid of any member of <Col N="1121" /> the board who might be pushing too far in any direction.  There are many points there that we can come back to on Committee Stage.  A real poverty agency would be cast-iron, independent and given the role of leading the poor to challenge the structures and systems which create their poverty.</P>
    <P>Even so, a lot can be done.  For instance, I do not believe this country has reached saturation taxation.  The report of ESRI, Paper No. 109, published last year &mdash; The Distribution of Income in the Republic of Ireland: A study in Social Class and Family-Cycle Inequalities &mdash; says in the conclusion:</P>
    <P>As taxation on capital and inherited wealth drifted towards the inconsequential, an awareness of social class would have alerted policy-makers to the possibility that Ireland may enter the twenty-first century with an upper middle class so privileged and so securely entrenched as to harken back to its nineteenth century predecessors.</P>
    <P>That is not a country which has reached saturation levels in taxation.  Therefore, any suggestion that even on the services level we have reached saturation point is simply giving in to the lobby of the rich and powerful, a lobby which was seen at its most effective in 1973 when the wealth and capital gains tax proposals first appeared, and which Deputy John Kelly described as probably the most vigorous, broadly-based and intense lobbying that any government were ever subjected to, a lobby incidentally which was facilitated and assisted by a national newspaper which would lay claim to have a strong streak of social concern, that is, <i>The Irish Times</i> which became a platform for every interest group opposing that legislation. We do not have that sort of taxation because their lobby is so powerful.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind people that we could cut military spending.  Because we need certain forms of security forces to deal with terrorism it does not necessarily mean we need the kind of army we have. If we have social priorities I suggest we could investigate them.  We could introduce a graduate tax similar to that in operation in eastern Europe for those <Col N="1122" /> who benefit from the services of the State's educational sector.  They could pay an extra 1 per cent of their income in tax to pay for that education.  That is not a particularly objectionable thing.  It is better than a loan system because it would be related to people's ability to pay.  I would also like to remind people that a country like Cuba &mdash; one previous political figure nearly lost his political life because the mentioned Cuba in a political speech &mdash; has a national product per capita of about one-third that of this country. They have managed to provide free, full, comprehensive education to the highest levels of technological education to anybody who wants to avail of it.  They have managed to provide similar services in the area of health.  As one who has visited Cuba, let no one tell me that it has been at an enormous price in personal freedom. I admit there are things that are wrong.  That has been done at one-third of the national product of this country.  I do not believe that we cannot afford it. We do not have the political will.  I do not blame Governments alone.  I believe there is a climate of opinion which the Church, unfortunately, has contributed to which does not make that sort of thinking acceptable yet.  Therefore, we have postponed, temporised and joined the take-it-slowly-brigade. This Bill is a start with £2 million.  It is funny the way £2 million becomes a big sum when it is being spent on the poor but it can be the sort of thing that is lopped off a budget in times of cutbacks without a second thought.</P>
    <P>We need to change the political climate of our society.  In that context, voluntary bodies should begin to look a little bit more carefully at their roles.  They have been shamelessly exploited by the State. I continuously read reports where health boards claim to be funding particular projects here, there and everywhere.  The words they use is &ldquo;funded&rdquo;.  When you ask them what &ldquo;funded&rdquo; means they mean &ldquo;it was assisted by&rdquo; usually to the tune of 15 per cent, 20 per cent or 25 per cent of the running costs.  A health board usually say &ldquo;We funded this project or that project&rdquo; but what they are doing in fact is getting off cheap on what should be the responsibility of the community <Col N="1123" /> and the State through taxation and through the various welfare agencies.</P>
    <P>Voluntary bodies provide all sorts of services.  They have certain functions. Why is it that all the members of these voluntary bodies who have seen all the appalling scandalous abuses and inadequancies in poverty in our society have never really shown any political willingness to raise those issues?  Why have they never made political issues out of the problems they knew in their home towns and their own areas?  Who benefits most from the activities of voluntary organisations? The people who are being helped with the service are people like myself who get far more out of their work with the voluntary body than ever they put into it.  That is true of 95 per cent of people who work with voluntary bodies. The personal satisfaction they get out of it probably far exceeds the sacrifices and the efforts the people put into them.</P>
    <P>People who are in voluntary bodies need to have a look at their reasons for being there and whether a slight redistribution of their time into areas of political activity within their political parties and within the trade unions might in the long term contribute more to the welfare of the people they are trying to help than an uncritical continuing of providing more and better service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be finished by then. I would like to say a few things about the Bill.  There is no way, incidentally, that Bill could meet the objectives that I would set for a poverty agency because it is so constrained by ministerial powers to intervene, ministerial powers to sack the board if he so feels.  I suspect that the powers of the Minister with respect to the National Community Development Agency are far in excess of the powers of the Minister for Labour with respect to the Youth Employment Agency.  I would <Col N="1124" /> be interested to know why in the case of the Community Development Agency the Minister for Health needs more power than the Minister for Labour needs for the Youth Employment Agency, which is, after all, spending in the order of £60 million a year.  We can discuss this at great length on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt there are many things that I would like changed in the Bill.  The Minister has indicated &mdash; we can talk about it at length again &mdash; that he intends that the major function would be combating poverty and social deprivation. I am bothered that what is identified as a proper function in combating poverty and social deprivation will depend on the membership of the committee. The Minister's decision to substitute TDs of his own party for Sister Stanislaus on a health board does not give me any great confidence that the Minister will choose the sort of quality of people for the National Community Development Agency.  This is not an argument necessarily about one particular individual. It is the decision to eliminate somebody who has a long identified role in the area of combating poverty and to replace that person not with somebody else with an equally identified role but with two public representatives.  That makes me a little sceptical about the quality of the future membership of the board.</P>
      <P>One aspect of the final report on the Combat Poverty project was that the new agency should give a forum for poor people to speak.  That is the only one of the long lists of proposals that could not be interpreted as being included in the functions of the Community Development Agency.  I would identify that one as being most in need of an answer.  I fully agree with Senator Bolger that not just one but a number of people from areas which in the Bill's words would be identified as having a high level of poverty or social deprivation should be on the agency and they should preferably be people who are dependent on statutory services for their income.  They are the sort of people who will talk realistically about poverty and the consequences of being poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> I welcome the fact that we are talking about poverty.  I recognise that the Bill is regarded as a start.  I will not get involved in what would be appropriate in these matters for the Committee Stage.  I repeat my general conclusion that poverty is not an accident, it is the direct consequence of the way we have ordered our society.  The poor are oppressed. They are not just happening to be there. It is only when the poor are encouraged and led by political or other action to speak for themselves and demand the sort of changes that will be necessary that we can really begin to abolish poverty.  I hope that the agency will be given the sort of membership which will began to act in that direction.  If not, it will be nothing but a sham, a gesture and another pointless exercise which will not begin the political deliberation of the oppressed which is what really the abolition of poverty is about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not keep the House very long, even though this is a most inviting topic to speak on.  You could speak here for the rest of the day on the poor, poverty and this Bill and all that goes with it.  At the end of the day we would still be only starting.  We read in the Gospel that the poor we have always with us.  The poor we always had with us and the poor we always will have with us.  There is not a language in existence that has not a word denoting the poor.  Most languages, too, have many words denoting the rich.  If you have rich you will have poor, if you have victors you will have vanquished and if you have winners you have losers. The question comes to mind: how can we define poor and how many different kinds of poor are there?  Is poverty an entirely undesirable position to be in? Nearly all of our religious take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience.  Is there anything necessarily wrong with being poor?  As Our Lord said in the Sermon on the Mount &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in <Col N="1126" /> spirit for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We would want to be more precise when we are trying to define poor.  We hear the word poor so often nowadays when we hear the phrase &ldquo;the poverty line&rdquo;, that somehow or other the idea has come up that if we have poor in Ireland &mdash; we have &mdash; it is because of our political system.  I put it to the House that no matter what the political system is, no matter what part of the world you are speaking about or referring to, you will have poor.  You will always have poor because, as I said, where you have rich you will have poor.</P>
    <P>There are many kinds of poverty.  You have financial poverty, social poverty, educational poverty, musical poverty and political poverty.  I could give many examples of these things but in view of the fact the Minister will be temporarily leaving us at 12.30 I will try to get on as fast as I can.  To get myself and all of us back to the important things let us have a look at the purpose of this Bill so that we will not be ranging too widely from it.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a body to be known as the National Community Development Agency whose functions will include fostering and financially supporting community development and activity, facilitating and encouraging the mobilisation of self-help and community effort, co-ordinating the work of statutory bodies and voluntary agencies in the field of poverty and social deprivation, undertaking research and advising the Minister on community development policies and programmes and in relation to self-help, poverty and social services.</P>
    <P>Let us take the self-help first.  Most poor people are proud people.  Most of us in this House, or a good many of us, myself personally, know what it is to be poor, but we always kept our pride.  I can never look back with any anger or resentment on the days when I was much poorer, even poorer than I am at present. On the question of self-help, we have a splendid seanfhocal in that great repository of philosophy and wisdom, our seanfhocail Ghaeilge.  &ldquo;Is olc an cearc <Col N="1127" /> nach scríobann dí féin&rdquo; Then we have an attempt in the English language, &ldquo;God helps those who help themselves&rdquo;.  I am afraid there are many people in this country at the moment who seem to suggest that so-and-so and all the people living in a particular area are poor and they should be protesting to the Government to provide this, that and the other for them without making any effort themselves to do anything about it.  Self-help is a thing that should be promoted and because of its inclusion here specifically in this Bill I am very happy.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator O'Rourke who referred to the educational system.  I intend to deal at some length with it. Therein, to a large extent, could lie the key to this question of poverty, our attitude towards poverty and our training to deal with poverty when poverty strikes. To come back to a seanfhocal again as regards the wealthy and the humble, the seanfhocal goes like this, &ldquo;ní uasal ná íseal ach thuas seal agus thíos seal&rdquo;.  It is not uasal agus íseal but up for a while and down for a while.  Well-to-do families in bad times have to face poverty.  People living in impoverished circumstances for quite a while manage to rise above that and become reasonably well-to-do.  That is the way of life.</P>
    <P>Poverty is not a static thing but I think it is the attitude above all towards poverty that we must come to grips with.  Our educational system to a large extent is working all right but I am afraid since the proliferation of facilities for post-primary education for everybody we may be neglectful of these things.  Education could possibly be geared to achieving prominence in some field of industry, some field of administrative employment. The object might be to seek the best paid job as quickly as possible and to live according to a certain standard of life.  These are false concepts.  They need not necessarily give any happiness to anybody.  A person who is happiest in this life knows what he would like to do.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of wealth should not be encouraged in any educational establishment or in any educational system.  There are many things we may be rich in even <Col N="1128" /> though we may be financially poor.  There are many dimensions to life and these things should be emphasised in our educational system.  Above all, teachers being trained in the various training colleges and establishments and the various colleges of education should get a good training on their priorities as regards the quality of life they would enjoy and that they would lead their pupils and students to enjoy.  If that were done we would have fewer victors as opposed to vanquished and we would have fewer vanquished as opposed to victors.</P>
    <P>Our educational system then could do quite a lot to uplift people.  There is great scope in one particular area.  I am referring now to the itinerants.  Many of these itinerants, who are at the stage where they cannot even read or write, have great intellectual capacity and they can proceed far beyond the point of reading or writing.  More emphasis should be placed on the things that will uplift a person in the field of education.  True enough, it is good to train a person to earn a living but there are other things. There is music and art.  These things will uplift a person.  There are sports, athletic developments and so on.  These things should take their rightful place.  We should have a good look at our system and see could we expedite the movement towards a proper sense of values and the inculcation of that sense of values in our students.  It can be done.  We might recall, too, with pleasure and maybe with a little troubled conscience the ideal set forth by a former President of this country and a former Leader of my own Party, the great Eamon de Valera.  His ideal was that we could live in modest comfort&mdash;no question of poor or rich there&mdash;everybody could live in modest comfort, enjoying the joys and enjoying the wonderful things that God has given us in this country just for nothing at all, which will cost nothing.</P>
    <P>The Church can do quite a lot and is doing quite a lot.  The two good precepts of charity are love God and love our neighbour.  As we all know, there seems to be a movement on for some time to try to dispense with God.  If you dispense with God you will automatically dispense <Col N="1129" /> with your neighbour.  We have a great tradition in this country because an interesting thing about ourselves and our language is that probably we have the only language where the verb &ldquo;to have&rdquo; is not found.  We have not got such a thing as the verb &ldquo;to have&rdquo; in our own language. We refer to our share of things.  You do not say &ldquo;my cattle&rdquo;.  You say &ldquo;my share of cattle&rdquo;.  You do not say &ldquo;my food&rdquo;. You say &ldquo;my share of food&rdquo;.  We have that tradition of sharing.  No matter what the political system is, as I said already, we will have the poor as we will have the rich.  There will be unhappiness and there will be deprivation.  There will be agitation, and so on, unless we develop what we have within us, this quality of sharing our joys, our sorrows, and our wealth with each other.</P>
    <P>The Minister paid tribute to a number of organisations.  If I mention one in particular it is because I have long association with that organisation.  The name of that organisation is Muintir na Tíre, surely one of the greatest organisations ever founded here.  Unfortunately they are not as prominent at the moment as they used to be.  They did tremendous work.  The greatest credit should go to Father Ryan and the men who worked with him, and who worked since then in Muintir na Tire.  They brought people of all sections together, in the parish and in the community.  The well-to-do and those who were not so well-to-do sat down together and solved their problems, as a unit and as a community.</P>
    <P>I have come to the end of my few scattered notes.  I did not intend to speak at all.  A number of things said by other speakers prompted me to do so.  I question one matter mentioned repeatedly by various people.  How do they arrive at the figure of one million poor?  Again the question of definition comes in.  How do they define poor?  We have the old figure trumped up, 150,000 unemployed.  What is meant is 150,000 on the register.  A large percentage of those people are far from being unemployed.  However, that is beside the point and I will not pursue it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish every success to the Minister with this Bill and in his work in <Col N="1130" /> general.  This Bill, when it is fully implemented, will certainly do a great deal.  It has a great potential to eliminate what are euphemistically called the problems of poverty in our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to say most of what I have to say on this Bill on the Committee Stage and to confine myself to a few brief remarks now.  It seems clear from the Bill and from the Minister's comments that the agency proposed will take over the functions of the National Social Service Board and that most of their concern will be with functions already being carried out by that board.</P>
      <P>It is clear that this agency is an alternative to the proposed national anti-poverty agency recommended in the Final Report of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty.  It is an alternative to it, not only as an institution but as representing an alternative philosophy.  This Bill marks the end &mdash; for the moment at least &mdash; of the antipoverty philosophy which emerged in the mid-seventies and struggled to survive ever since against serious political odds. The fact that this Bill is before us at the same time as Sister Stanislaus has been removed from the South Eastern Health Board is a further indication that the philosophy of poverty which had been concerned with structural inequality and powerlessness is now dead at Government level.</P>
      <P>This Bill is not concerned with poverty. It is concerned with the nebulous concept of community development.  As such, it reflects a cultural theory of poverty which was discredited more than a decade ago. It is clear now to anybody who has researched the meaning of poverty and its causes, that poverty derives from the class basis of society.  It derives from the structures of our economic and social system which create and consolidate inequality.  Therefore, in my view, any proposal which purports to be concerned with the problems of poverty, and which does not make explicit the need to change economic structures, is not only a waste of time, but is hypocritical and dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill in some way institutionalises <Col N="1131" /> the idea that the poor are poor substantially through their own fault and, if we give them the means of self-help, or if we engage in community development, whatever that might be, their poverty will somehow or other be alleviated, and somehow or other we can have what the Minister described in his opening statement as a caring community.  I do not believe that, I think it is a mistake.  It derives from a particular political philosophy which seeks to maintain the existing order, the economic and social structures, and which seeks to avoid dealing directly with the problem of poverty and the people who suffer from it.</P>
    <P>The problem of poverty is a problem of powerlessness, the powerlessness of poor people in a market, individualistic economy.  Nobody chooses to be homeless. Nobody chooses to have a low income.  Nobody chooses to have an inadequate education.  Nobody chooses to be on the margin of society.  Yet people are in that category.  They are in that position.</P>
    <P>One million of them are in that position. It is no accident.  It is simply that they do not have the power to avoid that position.  They do not have the power to insist that the structures of society which create the inequality are changed, so that they can share on an equal basis in the wealth and resources of the community. Poverty, therefore, as Senator Ryan said, is no accident.  It has to do with inequality. It has to do with structural problems in society.  It has to do essentially with the political powerlessness of poor people in a market, individualistic economy.</P>
    <P>The notion that community development can do something about this seems to me to be extraordinary.  Community development, in so far as it means anything, means, presumably, that people come together in a locality or a region to generate increased economic prosperity. That can happen, and does happen.  It does not do anything about the inequalities which exist within that community or locality.  To conceive of community development as a strategy to deal with the problem of poverty seems to me to <Col N="1132" /> be grossly mistaken, wasteful and harmful.</P>
    <P>Poverty at the end of the day is a political question.  The question is how can poor people organise themselves to take on the system which oppresses them? How can poor people organise themselves to go to City Hall and say: &ldquo;Where are the houses we need?&rdquo;, or to go to the Government and say: &ldquo;Where are the jobs we need?&rdquo;, or to go to the taxation people and say: &ldquo;Where is the equitable taxation system we need?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The initial idea in the setting up of the National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty was that for the first time the State would make resources, funds and people available to the poor in our society to help them to organise themselves to take on the system and the State which were paying for the services and for the programme in the first place. It was a strange idea in many ways that the State should actually be prepared to give money, indirectly through this committee, to poor people to organise themselves to take on the State which was oppressing them.  Yet that philosophy was accepted and was at least embryonically implemented.  That is the only way through for poor people, it seems to me. That political philosophy has now been formally rejected in the form of this Bill before us.  This Bill does not refer one way or the other to structural problems, or inequality, or powerlessness among poor people.  It does not indicate any possibility that poor people will be financed and given resources to help themselves to take on the system which is oppressing them.  If the Bill goes through, as I am sure it will, it is no harm. It may help on the margins.  It may be of some value to some people, but it has nothing to do with dealing with poverty. It is important that the point be made that, in so far as dealing with poverty through the agencies of the State is concerned, that is now off the agenda.</P>
    <P>I admire some of the work which Deputy Tony Gregory has done.  He has used well the political position in which he finds himself for the people of the inner city area.  He has made a mistake with this Bill.  The comment made about <Col N="1133" /> Deputy FitzGerald's statement in Kilkenny that the business which has to be undertaken now is to subvert the system in the interests of poor people is right.  That is what we are now about. There is nothing here today concerning that.  That is the task.  It is not enough to say these things.  One has to come through with the policies which reflect that idea, and I have not seen those policies yet from Deputy FitzGerald or indeed from anybody else outside the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with this Bill.  I am disappointed that it has come through as a replacement for an alternative political philosophy which struggled to survive, and which is now dead, but in so far as it will help anybody on the margin it is to be welcomed.  There are a number of proposals which I should like to put on Committee Stage.  I hope I have made the central point I feel I should make.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I am delighted to welcome this Bill not only as a member of the Seanad but also as a member of a voluntary organisation, The Irish Country-women's Association.  This Bill is a very positive step in the right direction.  The agency will act as an activating resource and consultancy agency for all the groups and organisations already in the field, and will make both material and financial support available to them.  We are very fortunate in Ireland to have an already well-established community movement through the active participation of community organisations, residents' associations, social clubs, sports councils, youth clubs and social services councils as well as many national organisations such as Foróige, Muintir na Tíre, Macra na Feirme and, of course, my own ICA. They have been doing fantastic work in this field.  This Bill will help to co-ordinate their efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the initiative for community projects should come from the communities themselves.  They should feel in no way crowded by this new agency.  On the other hand, they should be concerned with areas of activities not already covered.  It is important <Col N="1134" /> for the agency to discover areas of overlapping activities and to direct the organisations concerned into the areas where a need really exists.  It is very important that the agency will not be looked on as a Dublin-based project, divorced from rural Ireland and the communities they are set up to serve.  All too often in my travels around the country I have heard the remark: &ldquo;Them ones up there in Dublin&rdquo;.  This agency must be concerned with the grassroots, and seen to be so.</P>
    <P>The community is about self-help.  We should not spoon feed people, but rather encourage them to feed themselves. People must develop themselves as individuals. They must feel important, not just to themselves but to the community. They must identify with the community in which they live and be prepared to work for it and develop it.  The agency must be seen to encourage that idea.  As a result of this involvement the country will certainly be a better place in which to live.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to see a marriage of the statutory and voluntary organisations, the efforts of the various statutory bodies and the voluntary agencies to achieve more effective action in relation to self-help, poverty and social deprivation.  This is an approach which has to be applauded.  The agency have the job of carrying out research and may, in fact, employ consultants and advisers in this area.  There are many areas in which research is badly needed, for example, in the case of a single pregnant girl.  She needs support.  She needs help to prevent her from taking the abortion trail to England, which 4,000 of our Irish girls took last year.  She needs a change of attitude in her community.  They must be supportive.  They must encourage her to keep her baby, and when she finally has that baby, she must have the financial support to give her some degree of modest comfort in which to live and bring up her child.  If that girl finds that she must work to support herself, she must have creche facilities available where she can leave her child and be satisfied that it is well looked after while she is at work.</P>
    <P>Many years ago we heard that our itinerant problem was finally to be solved. <Col N="1135" /> Looking around the country I feel it is far from solved.  Camp sites can be seen on practically any main roadway.  These people are living in substandard conditions, and this must be rectified.  Some of them choose to live on the side of the road but, if they do, they must be allowed to live with dignity, and we should find out what we can do to help them.</P>
    <P>What about the stay-at-home wife who, in my opinion, is carrying out the most important job in this country today? She is rearing our future citizens and the future of this country will depend on how she does her job.  She feels isolated.  She is not getting the support she needs.  Men can go out and get permanent and pensionable jobs.  Women are not even assured of that.  In the good old days at least you were assured that, once you were married, you were married until you died.  Now a woman can be divorced or separated.  She has not even got that sort of security.  At the end of her day she has not got a pension.  She needs support. Women are now taking to drink and tranquillisers. There is a problem.  We must discover the reason for this and we must do something about it.</P>
    <P>Child and wife battering are on the increase.  Why does it happen?  How can we prevent it?  We must ensure that women and children so affected have a place to live and are not living in fear of the husband coming in roaring drunk and beating them up just for the physical satisfaction of doing so.  Research should be carried out in this area.  I hope that the £2 million earmarked for this agency will not be misused but will be filtered back to the areas of greatest need.  I do not want to see a large staff or plush offices. The agency must not be a top heavy organisation with too many chiefs and no indians.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the staff of the National Social Service Board for the trojan work they have carried out.  I am glad the work they have done and the expertise they have accummulated during this period will not be lost, but will be carried on in the new agency. Continuity in this area is all important.  I welcome the Bill.  I wish it a successful <Col N="1136" /> passage through the House and I hope it will soon be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceOConnell" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Bolger has indicated fairly substantially our unhappiness with this Bill and some of our reservations about it.  Reading the Bill and listening to the Minister's speech, and considering the approach of the Minister and the Government to the question of poverty, I am reminded a little of what happens when a very young and rather frightened dog sees a strange object, approaches it timidly and tentatively, sniffs around it for a couple of minutes and then, when there is the slightest movement from the object, disappears very rapidly whimpering and yelping with its tail between its legs.</P>
      <P>Reading the Bill and listening to the Minister, one is struck by how infrequently the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; is mentioned. It has already been indicated by other speakers that there is in this whole approach by the Government an unwillingness to consider the concept of poverty. By removing poverty from the name of this agency, or not putting it in, there is a feeling that poverty is something with which we should not concern ourselves, that we should get away from it, and that by trying to remove it from our language and vocabulary we will avoid the concept and somehow poverty will one day disappear with as little effort from us as possible.</P>
      <P>I was slightly amused by the opening parts of Senator Brendan Ryan's contribution. Senator Ryan is a very worthy Member of this Assembly.  In this debate he contributed extremely eloquently, with a wealth of statistical background, a background of experience, rising at times to considerable eloquence, considerable passion, and clearly indicating no small degree of commitment in this area. I would even go so far as to suggest that every assembly of this nature &mdash; perhaps I am misquoting Monsieur Voltaire in this respect &mdash; should have a Senator Brendan Ryan and that, if Senator Brendan Ryan did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Senator Ryan, as is his wont, takes his stand on the high moral promontories <Col N="1137" /> of his independent position, and design to look down from that position upon us lesser groundlings who are operating at lower levels of political reality, parts the clouds in the mist and with a condescending wave of his hands proceeds to lecture us on how things are to be done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Ryan lectures us who have the misfortune to belong to substantial political parties, and are possibly intellectually and philosophically deprived as a result he is presuming on his position.  The reality of politics, the reality of Government is, as he indicated from time to time in phrases he used, a question of approaching what is to be done.  When we are considering the question of poverty and considering the place of poverty in our society at present, it is no harm to consider political developments over the past century.  Senator Ryan indicated &mdash; and in my eyes redeemed himself slightly in this respect &mdash; that ultimately the question of poverty is a political question.  Whereas I would join with the Senator in giving great praise to those members of voluntary organisations who have given so much of their time, energies and resources over the years to the practical problems of poverty, ultimately Senator Ryan and I would agree that this is a political question which has to be addressed in a political way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan will recollect from his studies of history that the national movement here always had, to a greater or lesser extent, often fluctuating, a social dimension in that it was concerned greatly with the social and economic status and condition of our people as well as with the political institutions.  One of the unfortunate consequences of events which occurred around 6 December 1921 and in the two or three months immediately  <Col N="1138" /> after, was that the unity of the national movement, its coherence, its willingness to address itself to all the problems of the country, and to that particular phrase in the Proclamation of Independence which refers to the cherishing of all our children equally, was broken and the main stream of politics diverted into other channels and into other interests, to what people of my generation and of subsequent generations would regard as the detriment of the people.  I am not in any way saying that these issues that divided politics at the time were not important, but it is certainly true that the great weight and attention of our political parties and of our political system were diverted into matters in which the social and economic interests of the people were not foremost.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan and, in a passing reference, Senator O'Mahony, implied that we in this party were not particularly concerned with the problems of poverty as a major issue.  The facts are that it was this party &mdash; the present leader of this party and another man who is no longer part of this party but has moved into another area of national life, Mr. Justice Declan Costello &mdash; played a very substantial part in trying to return politics to consideration of social and economic issues.  It is not quite right to say that they rediscovered poverty, or that they came to the conclusion that ours was an unjust society, but it was this party who came forward with the concept of a just society as an objective political activity.  It was this party who addressed themselves to trying to find some form of practical political approach to this problem of injustice in our society, within the realities of the Irish political climate and what is practical in terms of Irish society.</P>
    <P>Both Senator Ryan and Senator O'Mahony referred to the place of poverty in our society.  If I may rephrase what they were trying to say I would put it that poverty is part of the structure of our society as it is and until we realise that this is the case, until we face up to the fact that we must have structural changes in our society and changes in our attitudes and our values, we are going to find ourselves in a situation in which a measure <Col N="1139" /> such as this will make an honourable attempt to deal with the surface manifestations of this situation but will go no further.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with Senator Cranitch when he indicates that the poor will always be with us but I think I know what he means.  He believes and anyone who has a practical grounding in history or politics must realise that the poor are likely to be with us for a great length of time.  If we consider the history of our people and those traditions and philosophical principles about which there would be some consensus in our society, we are quickly drawn to the conclusion that one of the objectives of political activity must be the elimination of poverty. The elimination of poverty is not something that we are going to see in our lifetime, or something that our children or grandchildren are going to see.  When we approach this question it seems to me that poverty is not something to be contained or is permanent but is something to be eliminated.</P>
    <P>There is a very real danger emerging from the research that has been done in this area, from the kind of statistical picture that is building up in the experience of social workers and researchers in this area.  What we are doing is not creating a vast proletariat of the deprived of the classic Marxist model but we are creating a society in which something like two-thirds or three-quarters of our populations see themselves as relatively well off, and the remaining third or quarter, are permanently deprived and see themselves as deprived.  We might well say that so long as the dimensions are of that nature there is nothing for those of us in the upper parts of society to fear.  I feel that very much the contrary is true when we consider this development and political developments in our society.</P>
    <P>We have had references to various minority or independent groups which have emerged in recent times in our society and in our political system.  There is a very real danger that we could find ourselves in a situation very similar to that which occurred in the northern part of the country where there came into <Col N="1140" /> existence as a result of various deliberate policies, a different political context or different causes maybe, a permanent minority of the deprived who saw themselves and still see themselves, as alienated and excluded from the system and who see no gain, profit or share for themselves in tolerating that society or working within it, and who are driven inexorably to conflict with it.  This is a real danger in this part of the island.  It is something we will have to consider in our Government policies, our politics and in the alignment of our parties.  Unless we are prepared to make this kind of radical approach, far removed, I regret to say, from the approach in the Bill before us we and the generations that follow may find ourselves in the kind of perpetual institutionalised conflict, economic and social decline in stagnation that is unfortunately the lot of our brothers and sisters in the North.</P>
    <P>I do not wish it to be felt that I am being negative in my approach to this Bill.  I know that the vast majority of those people who were concerned with the formulation of the Bill, the proposals in it, those who will operate the institutions set up within it, mean the very best. I do not wish to cast aspersions upon the Minister who I am sure intends doing the best he can, but unless we approach this problem with a much more radical, structural attitude, one day we will find this Bill was not enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senators on this side of the House who have reservations about the fundamental reasons for initiating a Bill to establish a National Community Development Agency.  When Deputy Cluskey was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare he set up a specific agency, chaired by Sister Stanislaus, to identify the fact that whether we like it or not there are poor in this country.  It is a little disturbing to know that because this problem was specifically identified by the Combat Poverty Committee, under the auspices of Sister Stanislaus, and because of fundamental ideological differences between that committee and the existing Minister, it was not seen fit to continue the poverty <Col N="1141" /> committee in their present form.  If that is so I have reservations about what this agency will attempt to do.  As a member of the South Eastern Health Board, I would like to pay a special tribute to Sister Stanislaus, with whom I served for up to ten years on the board and on various sub-committees and committees dealing specifically with this area, particularly the care of the elderly in which she had the most fantastic input.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister is not with us at the moment although I accept the reasons for his absence.  I wanted him to hear what I have to say, because at the board meeting in Kilkenny last Thursday I said that it was a deliberate political act not to re-appoint Sister Stanislaus to the health board.  This is borne out by the fact that she was replaced by a professional politician and because she identified an area which obviously is embarrassing to this Government, or any Government&mdash;that there are one million people in need of some kind of care and attention.  Even when we identify the problem, what can the statutury bodies do if they are starved of the necessary finance.  As a member of many statutory bodies, both in the region and in my own county, I can say that without fear of contradiction.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his opening statement said that this agency would</P>
      <P>devise and test out new strategies and techniques in the field of community development, poverty, self-help and social services.  However, it is not my intention that the agency should become involved in providing services or in undertaking action on a long-term continuous basis.  Rather the approach will be that where an experimental programme has revealed an unmet need ...responsibility for dealing with the situation on a long-term basis will be assigned to the relevant statutory body or voluntary agencies...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan does not like to hear the word &ldquo;poverty&rdquo; used to describe people in our society who are less privileged than others, people who are not fortunate enough to have two or three meals a day, or to have a roof over their heads.  We <Col N="1142" /> should consider it intolerable that there are people in this country who have not the minimum living standards in this day and age.  This is a condemnation of society, of the particular ideological philosophy of many of our political institutions which have been in Government for so long.  If they had a real commitment to do something about this problem, why was it not done in the past?  I object to the rhetoric that the poor will always be with us, or that there are no poor nowadays, or God helps those who help themselves. That kind of comment from people who are never in need always annoyed me, because if they opened their eyes or looked over their shoulders or were involved in voluntary bodies, they would see there are poor people in the inner city of Dublin, in built up areas and in rural areas.  There are poor people in isolated areas, particularly country areas, where their nearest neighbour is the most important person.  The day we move away from the fact that a good neighbour has a responsibility is the day old people will die alone, neglected and will not even be missed for days.</P>
    <P>Because of this unfortunate situation the South Eastern Health Board have set up the care of the elderly committee.  We published a report, which is probably a very important document when all this is taken into consideration, and which has been submitted to health boards though-out the country.  We have identified that that particular section of our community are alone, lonely, and in an isolated house without proper facilities.  Some of them do not have electricity, many do not have a proper roof over their heads; many others not alone do not have hot water but do not have cold water; nor do they have bathroom facilities.  They do not have what we now consider the minimum requirements for a housing scheme in a built-up area.  There are many people living like that.  We as a health board have initiated a register of old people so that these people will be known to the gardaí, the community welfare officer, the home assistance officer, the public health nurse and so on.  If they do not turn up for Mass on Sunday, or if they do not go out for the paper, or bottle of <Col N="1143" /> milk, or whatever they might need, then these people will be alerted immediately.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes further statutory requirements on the health boards.  Our health board have a budget of something like £80 million this year in non-capital costs &mdash; pay and non-pay areas, in the provision of drugs, medicines, staff, ambulance service and so on, and out of that allocation the vast majority of the funds are channelled into hospitalisation &mdash; acute hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, welfare homes and all the other institutions we consider vital once a person is in need of care, whether institutional or acute.  Most of the health board funds are channelled towards that particular section, whereas the greatest need &mdash; and this has been identified by Nurse Butler in the South Eastern Health Board whom I would like to commend for her continuous fight on this subject &mdash; is in the public health nursing section.  There are not enough nurses in the public health service.  She is the first link between the unfortunate person who is isolated, alone or ill, and is unable to fend for himself or herself, but because of the shortage of nurses in the service, the Minister's ban on the employment of additional staff, the continuing demands being made by the hospital services, and because of the lack of community services, we find ourselves unable to match the demands made on us at local and community level. There are 40 vacancies for public health nurses in the south eastern region.  That is unacceptable if we have any commitment to the people who are alone and need help.  If the board as a statutory body were able to provide facilities at that level it would cut down the demand on acute hospitals where the greatest cost is involved.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed concern about the escalating costs of hospitalisation and the cost of providing a hospital bed.  For too long we neglected our people and did not identify their problems early enough, or provide enough day-care centres and discovered too late that these people were in need.  I wonder if we can now meet the challenge of this Bill which is requesting us, statutorily, to do something <Col N="1144" /> for which we have not allocated an appropriate amount of funds to cater even for the existing service we are providing for the poor.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to take time off from his very busy schedule to read the report of the Care of the Aged from the South Eastern Health Board.  He will find it a useful document, when this Bill becomes law, in identifying old people who are poor, but not merely poor financially. These people come from a generation that were thrifty, and always put something aside because they were afraid that eventually they would need money to look after themselves in their old age and they made sure they had enough to bury them.  But in the process of saving, they often neglected themselves and did not have enough food and clothing.  Now these old people need someone to advise them.</P>
    <P>Socials workers are also in short supply, as are people involved in the home help scheme.  This is another interim step to assist people who can, with a limited amount of help, stay in their own homes and so not make any demands on an institution.  I agree with Senator Ryan when he said that many people in our institutions could be termed to be poor psychologically because their relatives, unfortunately, decided they could not or would not look after them in their homes. We had a generation when people who were not mentally ill were put into mental institutions.  These people have now become institutionalised and have an institutional mentality.  They have no homes to go to; they are perfectly sane but they cannot leave the institutions.  We might take down the walls or open the doors, let them walk around the garden or go to town to shop &mdash; which now, thankfully, happens &mdash; but they still lack love and are too attached to the institutions. I am told on my visits to these institutions throughout the south east that many of these people could not survive outside the institutional system because they have become dependent on it.  If their families had been capable of looking after them they need not have been institutionalised.  Possibly there were many social reasons why people did <Col N="1145" /> not keep at home their old relatives who were sturdy and healthy &mdash; and who nowadays are living longer &mdash; but the answer is not to keep them in institutional care, in psychiatric care or geriatric care.  The facilities provided in these institutions could be provided either in a day centre on a temporary basis or in a community centre where they could be looked after for the day and taken home again.  They could certainly be looked after in their own homes by social workers, public health nurses and people employed in the home help service.  Those people would be proud to be in their own homes because basically that is where they want to be.  If any agency ignores that and the fact that the existing services are unable to provide this facility, that agency will have failed.  In Sister Stanislaus' words, the poor have rights.  They are not just entitled to handouts.  They have the right to life and the Constitution states that they have a right to sustenance and to be looked after.  They are not looking for something that is not their right.  If this Bill purported to give the poor something they are not entitled to, it would be wrong.</P>
    <P>There are other agencies which ignore the poor.  Take CIE's expressway service as an example.  We see the CIE advertisement of the glib woman who says this is how she likes to travel &mdash; without stopping or without concern for anybody else. She can afford to buy a ticket to go some place and when she gets there she has money to spend.  CIE, for some unknown reason, seem to be catering for that type of passenger, but when the expressway bus passes, one wonders how many passengers are on it.  These buses pass many people on the road who have free passes but for them there is no service.  They go for their few messages to the nearest village five miles away and the bus passes them.  We gave these people free bus passes but we took the bus service from them.  It is wrong to ignore people's rights and we should not ignore the rights of poor people to transportation.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to see in Clare, the Minister's home county, in recent days the initiation of a new service.  I hold no brief for those who object to it because <Col N="1146" /> people who object to these services usually do not require them.  Anything that can help people to get about in country areas or on roads where there are express services, is a good thing because that is an area of poverty and we are taking from them the right to transportation.  I would like to see this identified as an area of neglect.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister paid tribute to many of the agencies already involved.  First, he paid tribute to the staff of the National Social Service Board, and I would like to join with him.  He assured us there would be full consultation with the staff involved, but in recent days, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, this Government seemed to be initiating legislation which has the fundamental rights of staffs enshrined in the existing structure.</P>
    <P>We are informed by trade union representatives and staff that even when Bills are going through this House consultation has not taken place with members or staff of these areas.  Certainly there was no consultation with the staff of the committee on poverty.  They were scrapped without consultation.  We compliment the staff of the National Social Service Board.  I would like more than an assurance that there will be full consultation with the staff.  We must have consultation if we are to get the best co-operation from all our staffs.  In several instances this Government introduced various pieces of legislation in which staff were involved but there were no consultations. In this connection I mention the Bill relating to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the National Heritage Bill and now this Bill.  We say we want full consultations and wish to settle any difficulties that may arise but it is difficult to do that when the matter is a <i>fait accompli</i> as far as the staff are concerned, if the Bill has gone through and becomes law. I hope sincerely that there will be the fullest consultation that will satisfy the members of the staff of the existing council which is now being incorporated into this new development agency.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the agency will be given wide-ranging powers to promote and encourage community development, <Col N="1147" /> self-help and voluntary activity.  The vast majority of community councils and community development associations need absolutely no encouragement from any section of Government.  They are doing the most extraordinary deeds at the moment and embarrass those of us on statutory bodies because of their drive and enthusiasm.  Senator Ryan had slight reservations about why they carry out this work; he thought it was because of a sense of self-satisfaction in helping people.  To do such work on a voluntary basis is the best motive of all.  They give a lot of their spare time to helping people without getting any financial recompense. Of course, the same thing could be said about local representatives at community level who involve themselves and who are condemned quite a lot by the media and by the public as working for a financial consideration.  All county councillors do their work on a voluntary basis.  They do so for the satisfaction of helping people who cannot at times help themselves because of their inability to grapple with bureaucracy or otherwise.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not necessary to encourage any further community development. There is an extraordinary amount of community development throughout Ireland. The people involved have made their local areas more pleasant for people to live and play in and they provide amenities such as seating, scenic areas with flowers and a whole range of community development.  The question is how that can be transmitted to rural areas outside of villages where these people are still living.  There are people living in isolated boreens who can never benefit from the efforts of people on national community development councils or voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>Of the voluntary agencies, Muintir na Tíre was the first agency.  It was started by the late Canon Hayes in my own native village.  It involved everybody working together for the common good.  They were the very first to pinpoint areas of need and they have now pinpoint further areas in this sector.  I am glad they are included because they have a wealth of knowledge and expertise available as <Col N="1148" /> a result of their past total commitment. They were the first to start the philosophy of the penny dinners, as they were affectionately known to people.  For one penny at that time, a person was given a quantity of food which sustained him for the day and that later developed into the &ldquo;Meals on Wheels&rdquo;.  Many people in a voluntary capacity are involved with the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Lions Clubs, Muintir na Tíre or any of these social service councils and meals on wheels are now transported to people in isolated areas.  They arrange all sorts of other facilities like old folks' parties at Christmas.  They deal with all the problems in the community.  They deal with the social drop-outs, alcoholics, the men of the road, people from broken homes and with cases of unwanted pregnancies. Irrespective of what amendments or laws are passed, unless we tackle the problems of society there will be unfortunate girls who will have to go on the abortion trail because society does not readily accept or help them in the way which many of us would wish it would.  We should forget old prejudices in this area and be really Christian in our outlook to people and not just pass piously worded amendments which are sectarian.  I say that in the knowledge that I am totally against abortion being legalised but to attempt to put sectarian provisions in the Constitution ignores the real problem.  If this community development agency can tackle that problem it would be a useful exercise.</P>
    <P>There was an underlying reason for the abolition of the previous committee.  I have identified the reason as I saw it but I would be sorry if my interpretation were correct.  I would like to have seen a continuation of the philosophy that had become part of the previous committee's work.  To me, the provision of £2 million is just a pittance because if we have one million poor people it will have very little impact.  It can be of assistance only if it identifies the problem which has already been identified and if it identifies the agency that can deal with it.  Unless the agency is funded adequately it will have been a fruitless exercise to have set up the structure, irrespective of the Minister's <Col N="1149" /> commitment that it will not be a bureaucratic structure.  Were it not for the people who are working in this area already, we would have had to resign from our positions in disgrace.  They deal with problems to a certain degree themselves and when they cannot deal with them any further we should deal with them.  We already have identified the problems ourselves at another level but we do not have the funds available to remedy them.  It is a catch-22 situation.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the poor will not always be with us because if they are we will have failed.  I think everybody has become socially aware of the fact that there are people in need of care and attention&mdash;not just money, not just hand-outs.  They are proud people.  They are people who might resent even at times the good neighbour checking up on them or asking them how they are.  So it has to be handled very carefully and diplomatically.  The most important person in all of this is the public health nurse. This service is totally understaffed in my area.  The public nurse is the acceptable person who has knowledge and expertise and we would find it very difficult to replace her.  I hope the agency will not decide to replace the public nurses.</P>
    <P>While I have reservations about the reasons for introducing the Bill I will give it my support to see that it works on the ground.  I will voice the same opinions that I voiced here on the various statutory bodies in my area of which I am a member regarding any deficiencies in our budgeting because of the demands that will be made on us.  I will do that in the hope that the Minister will listen.  I identified the structure and the need for financing it to deal with the problem.  If that is not forthcoming we will have failed these people. With the way things are going probably all of us will finish up in this bracket at some future date, and probably we are just providing for our own old age.  It is appropriate that we should all look to the future when we see what is being done now for people.  I hope that the situation will be better then than it is now, because many of these old people will tell you that they are basically very lonely and unhappy.  They feel unwanted and they <Col N="1150" /> feel that society has forgotten about them.  They listen to their radio and listen to politicians arguing about the economy and foreign borrowings and hear all the present day catch-cries of electioneering. They get disheartened and probably are of the opinion that we have really forgotten about them.  If Sister Stanislaus has identified the number at one million people, then certainly we have our work cut out for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMallon" hpid="Mr. Mallon Mr. Mallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mallon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one slight omission that I see in this Bill to which I would like to draw attention.  I refer to the section which defines as one of the aims of the agency the promotion of greater public understanding of the nature, causes and extent of poverty and social deprivation and the measures required to alleviate them.  I know that the Minister made the distinction between the contribution that would be made by community groups as envisaged in this agency and the structural and political changes which, of necessity, are at the heart of the real question of poverty and social deprivation within the whole of this island.  If the agency is going to be concerned with the nature, causes and extent of poverty and social deprivation, then it certainly must be concerned with the effects of the same problem. I am of the opinion that &ldquo;effects&rdquo; should be included in that section, because otherwise it would make the assumption that we are looking at something which may happen rather than something that is with us at the present moment, the effects of which have already been seen in all parts of this island.  We should ensure that the agency itself has responsibility to deal not just with the causes but with the effects of the problem.  It is very obvious to people looking at this growing problem that the effects are there to be seen and they are worrying, if indeed not frightening.  They are seen not just in relation to voluntary contributions but in almost every facet of governmental involvement.  It was right that the Minister stressed in his speech that structural and political decisions are necessary if the root cause of the problem is to be dealt with. <Col N="1151" /> One aspect of environmental deprivation can be seen in the way we plan our public housing.  The priorities seem to be the number of houses that one can squeeze into an acre of land rather than the quality of the houses and the quality of life.  I have been one of those who has seen what has happened in the North of Ireland and especially in Belfast city.  I would never again like to see in any part of this country a situation where country jungles are built, where you have got high-rise monstrosities and where we condemn people to a quality of life that no person on this island should ever be asked to endure.  I hope that that type of attitude from this agency will transmit itself into the political and structural views which alone can solve this problem.</P>
      <P>The other area of governmental administration which must be concerned with this problem is the Department of Education.  In the Rutland Street experiment which was referred to earlier by Senator O'Rourke it was shown very clearly that young people from areas of social deprivation and poverty, people who had higher IQs than those living in other areas, had a built-in disadvantage from the word go.  That, allied to the degree of under-nourishment that existed within those schools, resulted in a very dangerous educational reaction, namely, that those children were under-performing right along the line during their school years.  Not only that, but it led to a situation where those young people who had the ability to go ahead and avail of academic careers or professional careers did not and could not, not because of their deficiencies in terms of their ability but because of the environment in which they lived and because of the restrictions that arose from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that inequality is going to be built into people from the very word go, from the time even before they go to school, then we are talking about a lack of justice and a lack of equality for a substantial number of our people.  The educational implications of poverty are very strong and impressive.  A country such as ours must be concerned with social justice and we cannot allow that to escape our notice, <Col N="1152" /> nor can we allow ourselves to be diverted from dealing with that problem.  Again, I will come back to the central point: the problem will not and cannot be dealt with by voluntary organisations.  It cannot be dealt with directly by this agency but one would hope that the agency would be able to channel that type of problem back to where it belongs, and that it is on the Minister's table, because that is the only place to deal with it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the effects of poverty I would like to make reference to probably the greatest growth industry that we see in the western world, and that is the recreational industry.  It is a fact that unemployment increases &mdash; and it is not going to change in the immediate future &mdash; the need to provide a means whereby people can use constructively that enforced leisure time.  This is something we have got to deal with whether we like it or not.  I wonder if in this Bill there is sufficient thinking or sufficient concentration on what is the reality that is going to be with us for some time.  Within that sphere there may well be areas where the voluntary organisations and the agency itself could make some provision for the young people who are going to face many years without jobs.  It is something I would like to see included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In terms of employment I think we have got to face up to another fact.  Is our educational system, our youth training system, adequate to the type of changing structures that we are seeing in employment? I had a very rude shock recently when on a visit to a building site &mdash; I was there in relation to a youth training scheme &mdash; I was told that given one or two more years bricklayers will be a thing of the past because bricks will not be laid and houses will be pre-fabricated.  That shock was added to when I was also told that plastering would be a thing of the past, and joinery would not be needed in these new houses either for the good reason that for the sake of durability aluminium would be used instead of wood.  When we see those openings in employment opportunities closing day after day we must wonder how we can relate this type of agency and this type of provision for social deprivation and poverty <Col N="1153" /> to our training structures.  We are looking at something that is changing very rapidly.  It is not going to be an area where we can provide the type and the scope of employment that we have done in the past.</P>
    <P>I started my speech referring to the effects of poverty and social deprivation and I would like to finish on that point. There seem to be two areas of poverty that, because of their nature, we do not give enough attention to.  One is in relation to old people.  The statistics on the number of people who have died in Ireland from hypothermia are quite staggering. I know that in the North of Ireland, because of the inflated prices of gas, electricity and coal it is a frightening figure year after year.  It is an indictment of any society that old people can die from the cold in a society which looks upon itself as a modern and a Christian society.  This is something which is ideally suited to the efforts of voluntary groups because they are the closest to the people and they have local knowledge.</P>
    <P>There is also what I would call the &ldquo;lace curtain&rdquo; poverty.  This is a band of poverty which exists, which is not obvious within the urban areas, which is not tied to inner city development or redevelopment or lack of it and which is not tied specifically into rural areas.  It is a band of people who have enormous pride, who had a certain amount of well-being during their earlier lives but which does not exist any longer.  I know I am expressing it badly, but when I call them the &ldquo;lace curtain&rdquo; poor maybe I will get across what I mean.  There is a substantial number of people in those circumstances right throughout the country who, because of their pride and because of the fact that they did not need during their lives to avail of social services now do not know how to avail of such services and are somehow ignored.  I have seen many such tragic cases.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider inserting the word &ldquo;effects&rdquo; in section 4(b).  I came from an area where I have seen the effects of poverty, and where I have seen what happens to such people.  There is extreme poverty in this island, North and South. It is a statistical fact and one can see what <Col N="1154" /> that does to a people's morale in terms of alienation from the rest of the community.</P>
    <P>The North of Ireland is a case in point. One of the effects of that alienation has been towards paramilitary violence.  No one will ever be able to equate how much of that is related to social deprivation, but one cannot deny the fact that were it not for the social deprivation that has existed for years in inner Belfast and inner Derry, there would not have been the same amount of violence and alienation. When one weights the cost of that alienation and the cost of that violence against the stability that could come from a proper grappling with the problems of social deprivation and poverty, then I think one must say that any effort that can be made by an agency like this, and all efforts that must be made by Government, will have to be made.  Otherwise one shudders to think what might happen in a small island if this problem gets out of hand.  If we do not look at the effects we cannot deal with the causes properly. I would ask again, respectfully, that the word &ldquo;effects&rdquo; be included in that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Among the courses I teach is one on the history of Irish nationalism.  Perhaps the most dominant trait of Irish nationalism &mdash; whether it be of the physical force variety or the constitutional variety &mdash; is the assumption underlying various nationalist leaders, thinkers and writers from the late 18th century and throughout the 19th century, which is that Ireland free would be Ireland prosperous, that Ireland free would be Ireland just, that poverty and squalor were the consequences of the English landlord and the English garrison, and that once you removed them there would indeed be built a new Jerusalem in Ireland's green and pleasant land.  This naïve assumption runs almost without exception through the writings of nationalist thinkers and politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the long-term causes why our progress in establishing social justice has been such a bitter disappointment. Only the most perceptive of thinkers, like James Connolly and before him Fintan <Col N="1155" /> Lalor, saw beyond the superficial assumption that a native Parliament would create a native paradise.  We know better now.  We know it is not a question of drafting laws.  We know it is a question of profound social and economic conditions. When we talk about the problem of poverty in Ireland some of the things we have to shift, or attempt to shift, are the popular attitudes born, if you like, of our historical legacy.  We have not yet realised that it is not a question of legislating for social justice.</P>
    <P>There are other things in our history that explain the obstacles that face people working towards the elimination of poverty and the establishment of social justice. One is the preponderant influence of a particular kind of religious attitude in this country over the best part of a century and a half.  It was very dominant up to the early sixties and one might say that it emphasised the brevity of human life, the inevitability of divine providence, that whatever injustices might reign here below would be righted up above.  I happen to think that the repeated doctrine of this kind from pulpit, missions and retreats over a long period induced a fatalism in people about poverty and social injustice.</P>
    <P>There is another factor as well, that is, what we might call peasant materialism. It is a very fundamental facet of the Irish character, as it developed throughout the 18th and 19th centuries.  The individualistic greed for possessions began as a desire for security.  It went on, if you like, unbridled as a desire for more and more individualistic possession.  We have been told in the last ten or 15 years &mdash; we have been told in the last five years or so &mdash; that there is a new materialism in Irish society, a new lack of caring, a new callousness that says &ldquo;I do not care as long as I am all right, Jack&rdquo;.  There is nothing new about this, nothing whatsoever.  Our ancestors had their eye on the main chance as much as any of their latter-day descendants.  What is happening now, of course, is that the lower classes are having the temerity to ape their betters in this respect.  It ill behoves the better off <Col N="1156" /> and the comfortably off to chide the working class for their expectations.</P>
    <P>We have to realise that these attitudes are there and they are real obstacles to any move towards social justice.  There is no evidence in this Bill or in the Minister's statement introducing it that there is any sign of an understanding of this, no hint of a new philosophical or theoretical approach to the problem of poverty.</P>
    <P>Again and again in the Minister's speech there is the false assumption that somehow out there there is the underprivileged and disadvantaged class and we go through certain administrative and institutional manoeuvres and we get rid of that class.  It is rather like the false assumption underlying much of our thinking towards the Third World.  We are deceived by words like &ldquo;developing&rdquo; and &ldquo;underdeveloped&rdquo;.  In those cases, in the domestic model and in the international model, the same fallacious logic obtains.  We do not face up to the fact that people are disadvantaged and underprivileged because other people are extremely well advantaged, extremely privileged.  The same is true in regard to the relation of the north to the south in global terms.</P>
    <P>I see nothing promising whatsoever in the Minister's speech.  I share the fears of some other Senators who believe that this £2 million which is really no more than chicken-feed and that much of it will be wasted away in administrative spending. Here again is a parallel with what is going on in the developed world's attempts to aid the Third World, the appalling waste in terms of administrative expenditure. This Bill is insincere and I do not normally make this kind of criticism about legislation.  I believe a lot of it is meaningless flapdoodle.  For example, there is a sentence in the Minister's speech which talks about &ldquo;a new relationship between people and Government.  There is a wealth of evidence to suggest that such a partnership can release a major source of energy and ability which has been largely untapped up to the present&rdquo;.  Ráiméis &mdash; total, meaningless ráiméis.</P>
    <P>One of the basic questions we have to ask ourselves is: Is this country potentially a rich country?  Within these four <Col N="1157" /> green fields, or even the three green fields, is there enough potential to sustain a population, all the population in a reasonably frugal economy?  I put that question to economists.  I asked them: Is there enough in this country in its potential and resources, agricultural, mineral and so on if properly managed under a particular kind of political economy to eliminate poverty?  The answer is, yes.  What would you need to achieve it?  A total mobilisation of the economic resources of the country.  We can stay here for the next couple of weeks talking about this Bill and talking about poverty but unless you have a total mobilisation, I might almost say a stalinisation of the resources of this country, you might as well be talking to the beautiful ceiling.  I consider section 4 of the Bill a total waste of printers' ink. It runs from subsection (a) to subsection (k) and every one of these subsections is already with us.  We already know what is wrong.  We already have the voluntary agencies.  The Minister, God knows, has enough advice already.  It is rarely that I would dismiss a Bill as totally and as negatively as I do this one.</P>
    <P>I spoke a while ago about popular attitudes which were so pervasive and so obstructive towards any real, radical social change.  One of the most widespread popular attitudes, even among the poor, is that the rich have every right to be rich provided they can get away with it &mdash;&ldquo;Would we not all be doing it if we could?  More power to them&rdquo;.  There is a total lack of morality in the social and economic spheres and in our social and economic attitudes.  That is where we should have referenda on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In my book, a millionaire is a criminal. I do not believe that any man can make that kind of fortune by the sweat of his brow.  I do not care how superior the sweat is, it simply will not generate that kind of money in a lifetime.  By expenditure and thrift a man indeed may put by a sizeable sum, even in these hard times, but a man who becomes a millionaire in five or ten years by a number of strokes and moves in my view is a criminal.  Even if that language is too harsh then let me say that people who have that kind of <Col N="1158" /> money are not proper models to put before the people and to be talking about social justice.  There was a time when the party from which the Government are drawn did have genuine aspirations to establish a just society in this country. That time has long since past.  This Government is a rich man's Government. The Taoiseach is an extremely rich man: he has refused to disclose to us how he made his wealth.  It is the bounden duty of a Taoiseach above everybody else, of every legislator indeed, and of every Government Minister but particularly of the head of a Government to disclose the sources of his wealth.  In my view it is a scandal that in a small State like this which ideally should be a model for the Third World there should be such enormous disparity between wealth and poverty and that that disparity should be so glaringly obvious at the highest political levels.</P>

      <P>The Chair did not take it as being a personal attack.  It seemed that the Senator was developing a point.  I remind the House that we are discussing a Bill to provide for the establishment of a body to be known as the National Community Development agency to advise the Minister for Health on national policy relating to community development, self-help, poverty and social deprivation, to support voluntary action by the community in relation to those matters and to promote greater public understanding of them.  The scope of the debate is extremely wide and we have had in the discussion, as I was listening to it in the House and on the monitor, a very wide-ranging debate from the different Members of the House who spoke.  I did not take it, in listening to Senator Murphy, that he was making a personal attack on an individual, on the Taoiseach as an individual.  He was certainly highlighting the fact that anyone with a few bob is not really a saint in his <Col N="1159" /> book.  Perhaps Senator Murphy might like to continue.</P>

      <P>This Bill is not credible coming from this Government, which is the first millionaire Government in the history of the State.  If we have a million poor and we have a millionaire Government on the other hand, how can you take this Bill seriously?  Some Members of this Government have been conspicuously and ruthlessly successful in eliminating their own poverty.  It does not follow at all that they are serious about eliminating poverty in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came into this House I have conscientiously, I hope, contributed to legislation.  I have always welcomed the positive aspects of each Bill.  I see no positive aspects whatsoever in this Bill. For a Government which, when in Opposition had no intention of tackling the scandal of building land when in Government, whose concern for social justice is only a sop to the left wing on which they are presently propped, a Government which has no intention of tackling an antiquated Constitution which over-stresses the right to private property against the common good &mdash; for such a <Col N="1160" /> Government to put such a Bill before us is a fraud and a humbug.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill in the hope that it is a positive step at pinpointing areas where the services, statutory and in some cases non-statutory, which are already in existence will receive help that they should have.  This Bill was passed by the Dáil on July 14 &mdash; Bastille Day.  I wonder if there is any significance in that.</P>
      <P>I hope this Bill does not involve the setting up of an umbrella structure which would become nothing more than a further bureaucracy or a rubber stamp.  We have enough of that already.  We have already in existence quite a number of statutory bodies which are there to provide the services this Bill purports now to augment.  If we are able to get around some of the red tape and bureaucracy that exists already, we will then have served some of the purposes for which this Bill was intended.</P>
      <P>It is essential that both statutory bodies and the voluntary organisations which will be encompassed within the meaning of this Bill will be consulted &mdash; and indeed should have been consulted before embarking on putting the Bill on paper &mdash; in regard to its implementation.  It is essential to have the full co-operation and support and the expertise which is available from those areas in the beginning and not to proceed on the basis of providing a remedy to some problems and perhaps overlooking others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can look at the area of health which covers a multitude.  We can have regard to the health of the elderly &mdash; already mentioned by many speakers &mdash; who in many cases are committed to our institutions, geriatric hospitals and so on, and almost invariably there is very little accommodation of that nature.  There is not the financial means to cater for these people at home.  Many of them are living alone and are in need of help.  Welfare assistance is not sufficient for a number of reasons, for example, insufficient staff and, more important, insufficient finance to provide them with the kind of services that they need and deserve in their old age.  Unfortunately, on many occasions <Col N="1161" /> these people are committed to psychiatric institutions.  It is a sad reflection of our society that when we visit some of these institutions we see people there who are not psychiatric patients and who are there purely because there is no alternative accommodation for them and nobody to look after them.  It is a terrible indictment of our society that we should have this situation.  We can look at the youth; we can look at how the terms of this Bill can assist the attack on poverty which we hope it will make.  We can examine the cases of large families, whether they be living in urban or rural areas, and we can ask ourselves whether or not the children of those families will have the same opportunities to reach the same standards as their better-off counterparts.  If we can ensure that those areas of deprivation are pinpointed perhaps something can be done to ensure that we do not have the overcrowded classrooms and as a result the neglect of children from large families, who may not be in a position to have individual attention at home as others do and who when they go to school have not individual attention there.  This is something that needs careful consideration and something I hope the Bill will cater for and be able to make a realistic contribution to.</P>
    <P>There is also the area of sporting facilities. Some attempt is being made to provide facilities for the children of the less well-off areas, but it is only scratching at the surface.  It is essential that the sporting facilities that children require and that the public believe they should have should be available to all of our children and not just to the few who happen to be living in a particular area.  Unless we address ourselves to this type of problem we will neglect the spirit of the Bill and as a result the Bill will be entirely irrelevant.</P>
    <P>There is another area which I feel deserves mention.  Despite what people believe, not all of those who are gainfully employed are living in the lap of luxury. A number of people in this country who are employed and have been in constant employment for many years and in many cases are employed by the State do not receive a colossal wage and are deprived. <Col N="1162" /> I have had personal experience of this. Many of those people are living in rural areas in houses that have no sanitary or other services in conditions which, to say the least, are eighteenth century conditions.</P>
    <P>Again it is deplorable and a terrible indictment of our society that this situation should exist in this enlightened age. These are not isolated cases.  They are well known to the social workers and to the health board staff and also to the various local authorities.  Those bodies are at present hindered in resolving the difficulties of those people by lack of finance and by a terrible bureaucracy.  A person suffering from some physical incapacity could be living in sub-standard accommodation and be automatically entitled to a disabled person's grant but the procedure of qualifying for such a grant is becoming so involved that it is almost impossible for the ordinary individual to set about it himself.  Hence there is necessity for the involvement of an agency such as the one set out in this Bill, or, failing that, involvement of politicians.</P>
    <P>It has often been said that politicians are purely messengers and that they are not doing the job that they should do; that they are not legislating; they are spending too much time doing constituency work, writing letters and answering telephones and so on and so forth and they are not doing the work for which they were elected.  In fact, the type of work they spend quite a lot of their time doing is covered in this Bill, if the Bill is successful.  If the Bill is not successful and if it does not do what we hope it will do, the work of combating poverty, then the Bill will have failed and in turn we as politicians will still be faced with the continuing problem of trying to resolve that difficulty.</P>
    <P>In a country with a million people who are poor it is one of the most important Bills that has come before this House since I became a Member.  I hope that when it is passed we will see some evidence within a realistic time of the effect if it will have.  It will only be effective if there is a will to put into operation the <Col N="1163" /> spirit set out in the Bill and also if there is sufficient finance to ensure that it is implemented.  A figure of £2 million has been mentioned.  In these difficult times I need not comment on a figure of that nature: it would build approximately 100 houses.  When you think of the magnitude of the problem that we are faced with we should also think in terms of realistic financial aid.</P>
    <P>The other matter I would like to mention is the itinerant problem.  I use the word &ldquo;problem&rdquo; for want of a better word.  This issue has been bandied about for quite a long time.  With the passage of time the need for resolution of this issue has become more and more obvious.  One cannot travel through any of our towns, cities or villages now without seeing evidence of the abject poverty of these people.  While I accept that not all the itinerants are poor in the true sense of the word, it is valid to say that by far the greater majority of them are poor.  They are poor for a number of reasons, poor in the financial area, in educational facilities, social facilities and all the other things that the rest of the community take for granted.  Everybody says that something should be done about it.  Everybody says that we should be charitable towards them.  Everyone says that they should be housed, but almost in the same breath everybody says that if they are to be housed they should be housed beside somebody else.</P>
    <P>Again this illustrates the hypocrisy of our society.  We all have a duty to try to bring about a change in that area.  Almost without exception, when one attends health board meetings and local authority meetings the problem of the itinerants and its possible resolution arises.  We have talked about it for quite a long time. Various people have spoken about it and I am sure will continue to speak about it, and will continue to condemn the conditions under which those people are forced to exist.  At the same time, even to this day, nothing realistic has been done. Until such time as a concerted attempt is made to provide halts or serviced sites for these people and at the same time provide housing the problem will remain. <Col N="1164" /> Despite the fact that some local authorities have already embarked on a programme to rehouse some of the itinerants and their families I do not think that it is making a sufficient impact on the numbers that are on the roads.  Until we do these things we will only scratch the surface of the problem.</P>
    <P>I hope that as a result of the implementation of the measures in this Bill we will be seen to be tackling the problems that I and other Members here today have referred to.  If the Bill succeeds in attacking our problems and if the financial assistance is forthcoming then it will be a good Bill.  If it does not and if it is merely the introduction of a further tier of bureaucracy then it will be a total failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to congratulate you, a Leas-Cathaoirleach, on your appointment as Leas-Chathaoirleach. It is my first opportunity to do so and I wish you well.  I am grateful that the Bill has been given such a thorough consideration.  I want to thank the Senators for the many useful comments and suggestions which they have made. At the same time, however, I am somewhat disappointed that this measure which is aimed at the most deprived and vulnerable members of our society did not attract more widespread support in the House.  &mdash; I was listening earlier to Senator Murphy speaking about the Government and the main Opposition, about the millionaires that are supposed to be there.  I am not among them, I can assure you.  Many people would know that.  I regretted that the Senator did allude to matters of that nature.  When the present Taoiseach was Minister for Social Welfare, the increases he gave in social welfare to the deprived were unprecedented in the history of this State I have to get the record right.  Many others were represented in Government also down through the years from the main parties.  I want to put that matter right now.  I have a task force now carrying out repairs to houses for the elderly here in the Dublin area.  Before the end of the month we will be moving into other areas <Col N="1165" /> throughout the country.  I shall be looking forward to the co-operation of the local authorities and to the health boards in this matter.  There will be a limit to the money I will have available to me because in every Department today there is a limit to the money that is available.</P>
      <P>Senator Durkan referred to disablement housing grants for the repair of houses.  I want to say that last year when I was in the Department concerned I asked managers at the time to be as flexible as they could to give the benefit of the doubt, but it is the medical officer of health who gives the necessary go-ahead to the county councils.  I have asked them to be flexible and still keep within the Act and the conditions laid down.  I asked them to be as helpful as they possibly could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that Senators will agree that the various amendments that have been made have improved the Bill and make it clear that the agency will concentrate on the most disadvantaged communities. In this connection there is one important provision which has not received sufficient attention during the debate.  The term &ldquo;community&rdquo; in the Bill is intended to encompass geographical communities as well as the groups or categories of people suffering from high levels of poverty or social deprivation.  In looking after housing I come up against problems in regard to itinerant families, where they need to be rehoused.  I regret to say that in parts of the country, even to house one family in a housing estate, members of the local authorities, Members of this House and of the Dáil come up against opposition from local residents' associations. Sometimes, I regret to say, the politicians take the easy way out.  They expect us to do all the good things, but to leave it to somebody else when there is opposition to this.  We are aiming at striking a balance.  If we can strike a balance in regard to this it will be most helpful.  I will be looking forward to all local authorities and all Members of this House and of the Dáil to help out in any way they can in this matter.  I am most anxious to help out because we would be going a long way to bring about a change in that direction.  I want to put it on record <Col N="1166" /> also that some of the local authorities, and also the public representatives, have been most helpful.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the agency presents us with many opportunities and many challenges.  It will provide us with a new, energetic and dynamic approach to promote and foster community projects. The £2 million, which was mentioned earlier, is to get this off the ground.  It is not confined to this national community agency.  In the Departments of Health and Social Welfare millions of pounds are being poured out to help those who are deprived, to help the aged with regard to the maisonettes and old people's homes that are being provided by local authorities throughout the country. I am most anxious to see this happen.</P>
    <P>I admit there is a lot to be done.  The Government are depending on the community collectively and on the many voluntary organisations to help out here. They are most helpful and do a lot in the community to help out in this way.  The Government look forward to the co-operation of everybody in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister had another engagement and could not be here to reply.  I can assure the Senators that on Committee Stage the Minister will deal with the many questions that have arisen in the debate. Senator Mallon raised a point under section 4, and others raised it also.  I will bring that to the attention of the Minister. I would like to thank Senators for their support of the Bill.  We look forward to the co-operation of Senators on this very important Bill which will be enacted very shortly.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1982, is meant to deal primarily with matters that require urgent attention.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill gives details of the individual sections.  These can be grouped under five main headings, as follows: (1) duration of planning permissions; (2) validity of certain permissions; (3) general policy directives: (4) penalties for planning offences, and (5) fees for applications and appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 29 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, provides that all planning permissions granted since 1 November 1976, cease to have effect five years after the date of the granting of the permission unless they have been extended by the planning authority.  The same section provides that all permissions granted before 1 November 1976, would cease to have effect on 31 October 1981, unless they were <Col N="1171" /> extended.  Last year numerous representations were made from individuals and from legal and other professional interests regarding the operation of this section. In addition, defects in the section came to light.  The previous Minister examined the situation and, on 16 December last, announced his intention to introduce legislation to repeal and replace section 29.  His proposals were that all permissions would have a life of six years instead of five and that all permissions that expired on 31 October 1981, would be automatically extended for a further year.  However, the legislation necessary to give effect to these proposals had not been completed when the Coalition Government left office last March.</P>
    <P>The Government have now reviewed the situation in some detail and have decided to repeal section 29 of the 1976 Planning Act and to replace it with sections 2, 3, 4, 11 and 14 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that permissions granted before 1 November 1976, will expire on 31 October 1983.  This allows for the lapse of time since the announcement by the previous Minister in December last.  The Government are, however, satisfied that the life of permissions granted in the future should not, in general, exceed five years and section 2 provides accordingly.  As I have already stated, the previous Government had intended to extend the life of all future permissions to six years but I do not consider that this is either necessary or desirable.  It is, however, necessary to make some form of tapering arrangement in respect of permissions granted between November 1976 and November 1982.  Section 2 provides for this.  Permissions granted during that period will last until 31 October 1987, or seven years after the granting of the permission, whichever is the shorter period.  In addition extensions for any longer period already granted by planning authorities under existing legislation will continue to have effect.</P>
    <P>I consider that the new provisions of section 2 will achieve a reasonable balance between the objective of encouraging <Col N="1172" /> early development and redevelopment and the practical problems encountered by developers of all kinds in commencing and completing their developments. I hope that they will encourage speedier development, particularly in urban areas, thus reducing the amount of dereliction and urban blight.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill allows planning authorities, as part of a grant of permission, to specify a period of duration longer than the normal five years in cases where they consider that the nature and extent of development warrant this.  This provides for a greater degree of flexibility in regard to the duration of permissions than existing legislation provides for. Section 3 could be used in the case of large complex development which could take a considerable time or for continuing development such as quarries.  A refusal by a planning authority to exercise this power or a decision to specify a particular period may be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>Under section 4, the procedure in relation to extension applications is specified, criteria are set out for the granting of extensions and a time limit is specified for dealing with applications for extensions. No such provisions were specified in section 29 of the 1976 Act and this has led to a considerable amount of difficulty. However, section 4 and the regulations to be made under section 11 should eliminate these difficulties.</P>
    <P>I turn now to section 6, the purpose of which is to remove doubts about the validity of certain permissions and approvals granted on appeal before 15 March 1977 when An Bord Pleanála took over appeals functions.  The need to do this arises from the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>The State (Pine Valley Developments Limited)</i> v. <i>Dublin County Council</i>&mdash; judgements delivered 5 February 1982.  In that case, the court held that the Minister for Local Government had no power, in determining a planning appeal, to grant permission for a development which contravened materially the relevant development plan.  I should emphasise that the Minister was not a party to the case and had no notice that the important point of law involved was <Col N="1173" /> to be raised or decided in the Supreme Court in the case.</P>
    <P>In determining planning appeals, successive Ministers for Local Government had always been advised that they had power to grant a permission even in material contravention of a development plan.  A significant number of such decisions were made between 1964 and 1977, when the function of determining appeals passed to An Bord Pleanála, but it would not be possible to attempt to identify all of the cases involved.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision has given rise to unease and uncertainty in the legal profession, the construction industry and among the financial institutions.  It is particularly undersirable that purchases of land, dwellings and other buildings have been made, and that contracts and commitments have been entered into, in good faith, on foot of permissions which are now open to challenge in the courts. Serious problems are arising not only for builders who have developments in progress but also for owners of completed buildings.  Problems are also arising in closing sales of new houses and other property.  The Incorporated Law Society have been in touch with me to express their concern about the effect of the Pine Valley decision.  The society feel that many innocent parties would be involved in considerable hardship unless the situation is altered.  As the society see it, this hardship would affect people changing house or buying a new house, who could be on bridging finance and unable to complete a mortgage or sale because of the doubt now cast on the planning permission for the property.  For this reason, the society have urged the introduction of legislation to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>Before deciding to introduce legislation to deal with the matter, an effort was made to have the relevant point of law reviewed in the course of another case which is before the Supreme Court but that case will not now be taken until the term commencing in October 1982 and I cannot, of course, be certain as to the outcome of the case even then.  In these circumstances, and having regard to the disruption and hardship which has arisen, the only sensible course at this stage is to <Col N="1174" /> enact a provision which will put the matter beyond doubt.  Section 6, accordingly, makes it clear that a permission or approval granted on appeal prior to 15 March 1977 &mdash; when An Bord Pleanála took over appeals functions &mdash; shall not be invalid by reason only of the fact that the development concerned would materially contravene the development plan.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the Minister shall, from time to time, issue such general directives as to policy in relation to planning and development as he considers necessary.  Essentially, this is a reenactment of section 6 of the 1976 Act extended to apply to planning authorities as well as to An Bord Pleanála.  The terms of section 6 are otherwise unchanged.  It is made clear in subsection (3) that the power conferred by this section may not be used in relation to particular cases.  In 1981, planning authorities received approximately 54,200 planning applications while An Bord Pleanála received over 4,500 planning appeals.  It is anomalous in these circumstances that planning authorities are not required to have regard to ministerial policy directives as to planning and development which apply to the board.  Clearly, the same criteria should be applied at local level and at appeals level and the new section will enable this to be achieved.</P>
    <P>Only one directive has been issued under section 6 of the 1976 Act.  This directive was given by me to An Bord Pleanála in May 1981, and related to policy on large retail establishments. When this Bill is enacted, I intend that that directive will be re-issued to planning authorities and to the board.  This will be consistent with the Government's commitment to the continuance of a policy of freedom of choice for consumers as between large-scale and independently owned retail outlets.</P>
    <P>Sections 8, 9 and 13 are concerned with the level of penalties for offences under the Planning Acts.  The wider question of enforcement will be considered as part of the general review of planning law which I am carrying out at present.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 8 is to increase the monetary penalties for all offences under the 1963 and 1976 Acts to take <Col N="1175" /> account of the fall in money values.  For the less serious summary offences, a maximum penalty of £100 is now being provided for.  The more serious offences which now attract fines of £250 on summary conviction will carry a maximum fine of £800.  The legal advice available is that this is the maximum penalty which can be prescribed at present while retaining the offences within the category of minor offences which can be dealt with in the District Court.  The offences which will attract the new maximum fine of £800 include failure to comply with the conditions of permissions in regard, for example, to housing estates and other development.  The penalties for further or continuing offences related to the basic offences are being increased pro-rata.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 8 makes provision, for the first time, for indictable offences in the case of two basic offences under the Planning Acts.  These are the offences under section 24 (3) of the 1963 Act of carrying out development in respect of which permission is required, save under and in accordance with a permission, and the offence under section 26 (4) of the 1976 Act of failing to comply with a warning notice, or knowingly assisting or permitting development in contravention of a notice, or damaging or removing a tree to which such a notice relates.  On conviction on indictment for either of these offences, a person will be liable to a fine of up to £10,000, or up to two years imprisonment, or both.</P>
    <P>These penalties are intended to be a real deterrent in the case of flagrant breaches of the Planning Acts and are an indication of the seriousness with which the Government view such breaches. Clearly, however, every contravention of the relevant sections will not warrant such large penalties or, indeed, being dealt with as an indictable offence.  It will be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide when to press for a trial on indictment and when to consent to a summary trial in the District Court. Where an indictable offence is tried summarily under section 9, the section provides for maximum penalties of £800, or six months imprisonment, or both, plus <Col N="1176" /> further fines and/or imprisonment for continuing offences.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is consequential on the provision in section 8 for indictable offences. As it stands, section 80 of the 1963 Act provides that any planning offence may be prosecuted by the relevant planning authority.  Since the Director of Public Prosecutions is responsible for the prosecution of indictable offences, it is necessary to confine the planning authority's power under section 80 (1) to summary offences and section 13 provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer to the provisions of the Bill in relation to fees for planning applications and appeals.  The question of charging such fees has been raised at intervals over the last ten years and has been considered in detail in more recent years in the context of other changes in the system of local finance.  In May 1980, for example, a paper on local government finance prepared by the County and City Managers Association recommended that local authorities should be empowered to charge for the &ldquo;investigation and determination of planning applications&rdquo;. Last December, the Coalition Government decided, following consideration of proposals submitted by the former Minister for the Environment, that legislation should be prepared to enable planning fees to be introduced.  This intention was confirmed at the time of the January 1982 budget.  The provision of this Bill in regard to fees are the same as those decided on by the former Government and I hope that this will be borne in mind in the debate.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that the cost of planning control at local level in 1981 is estimated at £6.86 million.  The total number of planning applications in that year was 54,200.  The average cost of dealing with applications was about £280 in County Dublin and the four county boroughs, and £85 in the other counties. In areas outside of Dublin and other major growth areas, a high proportion of total applications relate to housing &mdash; either extensions to existing houses or proposals to erect new single houses or small groups of houses.</P>
    <P>The main provision in this Bill in regard <Col N="1177" /> to fees is section 10 but sections 5 and 12 are also related.  Under section 10, the Minister for the Environment will have power to make regulations, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, providing for the payment of fees to planning authorities and to An Bord Pleanála in relation to the various categories of planning application, appeals, etc.  Where fees are prescribed in relation to a planning application, the two months period during which the planning authority must determine the application will not begin to run until the fee has been received by the planning authority.  Similarly, where fees are prescribed in relation to appeals, provision is made under which the appeal will not be valid unless the fee is received by the board within the period specified for the making of the appeal.  In addition to enabling fees to be prescribed for payment by the main parties to applications and appeals, the section makes provision for the payment of fees by other persons who wish to make submissions or observations either to the planning authority or to the board as regards an application, appeal, etc.  Provision is also made under which additional fees could be prescribed in respect of requests for oral hearings of appeals or references to the board.</P>
    <P>The power to make regulations under section 10 is deliberately framed in a flexible manner.  In particular, it is made clear that the regulations may provide for the payment of different fees in relation to cases of different classes or descriptions. This power could be used to require relatively small fees to be paid for single house applications or for other minor developments as compared, for example, to the fees for major commercial developments.  The power to allow for complete exemption from the payment of fees in circumstances specified in the regulations, or for the waiver, remission or refund, in whole or in part, of fees in specified circumstances could be used to make special provision in relation to certain categories of applications at local level or to make special provisions in relation to appeals by prescribed categories of persons or bodies.</P>
    <P>References and appeals are made regularly <Col N="1178" /> to An Bord Pleanála and not proceeded with.  In some cases there may be a request to hold an appeal in abeyance. If such requests are reasonable, they will be acceded to by the board.  Section 5 is not designed to interfere with that system. However, when an appellant simply does not co-operate in processing the case, or, in effect, abandons it, the board have no way of dealing with that situation, except to determine the original application, involving a commitment of time and effort which should go to more pressing cases.  What section 5 proposes is, in effect, to confer a power on the board to enable them to clear off from their books cases where the appellant has clearly lost interest in pursuing his appeal.  Before exercising their powers under section 5, the board will be required to serve appropriate notice on the parties and to invite submissions in relation to the matter.  Any such submissions will have to be considered by the board before an appeal is formally declared to be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Section 12 will allow the fee for a copy of an entry in the planning register to be increased by regulations.  The fee fixed by section 8 of the 1963 Act is ten shillings which, under the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, must now be construed as 50 pence. In fixing the new fee account will be taken of the fall in the value of money.  The planning authority register is used for the purpose of recording all entries required under the Planning Acts in relation to all land within the area of a planning authority. Copies of entries are required mainly for conveyancing or other legal purposes and are sought primarily by solicitors, auctioneers, architects and estate agents. It is reasonable to increase the fee having regard to rising production costs.</P>
    <P>Section 15 will enable the existing requirements as regards appeal deposits to be repealed when fees regulations are made.  The deposit of £10 is no real deterrent to frivolous or vexatious appeals.  In the past number of years, only a very small number of appeals have been declared by the board to be vexatious &mdash; 14 in 1979 and 13 in 1980.  This does not mean that a much higher proportion of appeals may not have been without <Col N="1179" /> substance but is a consequence of the legal interpretation of &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; as used in the 1976 Act.  It appears that &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; in that sense is held not to include, for example, causing unnecessary delay and is not synonymous with being frivolous or without foundation. The fact that only a small number of appeals are formally declared to be vexatious cannot be taken as an indication that all others are reasonable.  In practice, the true nature of an appeal which is vexatious, or frivolous, or without merit, may not emerge until processing of the case is well advanced or almost completed. Each appeal is, of course, dealt with on its merits, and experience has shown that few can formally be declared to be vexatious, given the legal interpretation of that word.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should make it clear that the Bill now before the House is regarded by me only as a short-term measure and that I see a need for further legislation to bring about the improvements required in our planning system. A general review of that system is being carried out so as to enable us to decide what changes are necessary to improve the performance of the system and to speed up the decision-making process at local and at appeal levels.  Clearly, it will take some time to complete this exercise and to introduce and enact whatever legislative proposals may be decided upon. In the meantime, I will be asking planning authorities to review their own approach to planning control so as to ensure that the system will not have the effect of causing delays in the commencement of worthwhile development and in the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>Work on the preparation of a substantial memorandum containing advice and guidelines to assist planning authorities in reviewing their procedures is well advanced in my Department.</P>
    <P>Although the present Bill is an interim one, it provides for some necessary and desirable modifications of existing law. In addition, some of its provisions are urgently required for reasons I have explained earlier.  In these circumstances, I trust that the House will co-operate with <Col N="1180" /> me in giving the Bill a speedy passage through all Stages.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. P. Reynolds Mr. P. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it would be right to say that this is a technical Bill and could be dealt with on Committee Stage but I would like to make a few remarks. The planning board, since they were introduced in 1963, have completely changed in so far as week in week out we have court case decisions being handed down.  The Minister said there is delay. What is being done about it?  I do not think there is anything in the Bill to get these decisions speeded up.</P>
      <P>We are now at a stage when nearly every developer and anybody who is involved in development are more concerned with legal matters then with the actual planning.  That is understandable. I am not trying to criticise these professional people who have contributed so much to the development of our infrastructures. Local needs do not seem to get sufficient attention and circulars issued by the Department of the Environment seem to be much more acceptable to the planning officers in each local authority than recommendations that are made by local representatives.</P>
      <P>I agree that it is right that we protect our waters from pollution.  I further agree that it is right not to allow people to build new houses at dangerous bends on our roads.  The safety of people must be taken into consideration.  It certainly is going a bit far when a private individual or a farmer is prevented from building a house on his own land because somebody has decided that it is a high amenity area. A person wants to build his own house which he is prepared to occupy himself. Not many sites are available to him on his holding.  Perhaps only one site is available. It is going a bit far to deprive that man of this right because it is a high amenity area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned at the fact that there is nothing in this Bill about afforestation. The Department of Forestry can buy or acquire land and afterwards, particularly in the west, a number of farmers may feel that that land should not be planted, that it is more suitable for agricultural <Col N="1181" /> purposes.  The Department should have to get planning permission not alone for the development of the forestry but also because they damage the roads leading into the forests.  At the planting stage, at the cultivation stage, at the trimming stage and at the harvesting stage, these roads are sadly abused by the Department of Forestry.  The local authorities have not sufficient money to repair them.  No local authority would give planning permission to the Department without a commitment to leave the roads in the condition in which they found them.</P>
    <P>Let us take an ordinary developer, an individual who wants to develop a quarry: he has to apply to the county council for planning permission and there is a condition that the roads must be left in the condition in which they were found.  If that is good enough for the private individual, it is good enough for the Department of Forestry.  The only way to get at them is through the planning permission.  It would prevent many a row with the local farmers who feel the land should be taken over by the Land Commission and divided among small holders. If the Department had to apply for planning permission, the local people would know about it and this would prevent trouble.</P>
    <P>Other people can build without planning permission.  I am thinking of county councils, local authorities.  It is not necessary for them to apply for planning permission.  That may be all right.  Some people may ask why it should be necessary for a local authority to apply for planning permission.  If the local authority want to build a fire station, a courthouse or something else, how can a local person object?  If he wants planning permission himself he has to go through the whole machinery to get it.  The local authority are not required to do that.  The Office of Public Works can build a national school without planning permission. They can build a Garda barracks without planning permission.  They can build a barracks for the Army without planning permission, but the individual has to get planning permission for everything he does.  That is most unfair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> The Minister is to issue instructions that main roads and secondary primary roads are to be cleared.  No planning permission is required.  Road clearance is understandable on some of our roads.  I am thinking of the roads from Dublin to Cork and from Dublin to Sligo.  On our secondary roads, roads connecting towns with other areas, there should be no big developments, but if farmers living beside these roads want to build houses for themselves, they should not be deprived of that right.</P>
    <P>Some appeals are with the Planning Board for as long as 12 months before a decision is made.  Something must be done to speed them up.  I do not know how it will be done, I do not want to pass judgement on the Planning Board, far from it.  If there is an awkward case, human nature being what it is, it is read, looked at, and left to one side for investigation, and a number of straightforward appeals are dealt with immediately.  The delays are becoming very long.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that permissions granted before 1 November 1976 will expire on 31 October 1983, a period of seven years.  Permissions granted after 1 November 1976 and before 31 October 1983 will expire on 31 October 1987, again a period of seven years now.  Permissions granted after 1 November 1982 will have a life span of five years.  Section 3 enables the planning authority or an appeals board to specify a period of more than five years.  A number of planning applications with various local authorities are now out of date.  It will be a mixum-gatherum business with some people thinking the specified period is seven years and others thinking it is five years.</P>
    <P>A number of planning permissions became null and void on 31 October and people will have to apply again.  The Minister said he would have to look at this. What the situation is, I do not know. Older planning permissions have a life span of seven years and new ones have a life span of only five years.  Each planning permission should have the same life span, be it five or six years, otherwise it will be very complicated and people will misunderstand it and think they are being victimised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> Section 7 empowers the Minister to issue general policy directives to local authorities and planning boards.  This goes back to my reference to building beside the national primary roads, and the national secondary roads.  On a number of our national secondary roads, sewerage is available and telephone wires are available.  With regard to the national secondary roads the Minister's instructions to the various local authorities should be flexible, but not in the case of the national primary roads.  I have one particular road in mind in my own county, the secondary road from Dromod into the North.  The volume of traffic that road is carrying is not great.  I can see no reason why there should not be individual development there.</P>
    <P>Section 8 increases the penalties. Something will have to be done to get quicker decisions from the board and the courts.  Section 10 introduces charges for planning permission.  This is an old proposal and, as the Minister said, it was made by the previous Government.  I can recall it coming before my council.  I do not know what happened in the case of other local authorities but Leitrim County Council did not favour it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the cost of processing a planning application in County Dublin is £280, and the cost in other countries is £85.  When he is replying could he give us the reason for such a very big difference, almost £200, between County Dublin and other counties?  In rural Ireland, a big percentage of people who are doing private development are about to get married or are not long married.  The prices of materials, wages, and so on, are high enough without adding on a further £85. These people have commitments.  They find it hard to keep going.  I am sure the Minister will admit that in nearly every county the number of planning applications from private individuals is falling. People are going to the local authority for housing because they are unable to house themselves.  We should be helping them.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude on the question of the finances of local authorities.  They are <Col N="1184" /> in a mess.  The former Minister had some ideas about how the local authorities could get finances to pay their way.  We all know what happened to the finances of local authorities.  I will not go into that, but it created problems.  There should be some method of financing local authorities. At the moment it is not being done. We are now having an increase of 11, 12 or 15 per cent while the cost of materials increased last year by 20 per cent, with wage increase running at 18 per cent. An increase of 15 per cent for local authorities will not and cannot work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little disappointed with the Bill in so far as it does not amend the existing legislation.  As Senator Reynolds said, it is a technical Bill.  It is not designed to eliminate the undesirable elements in the Planning Act as we know it in most local authorities.  A different Planning Act appears to be operated by each local authority.  Mayo is the greatest county for invoking section 4.  Because of the administration of the Act in Mayo we felt we had continually to bring in section 4s in order to give local applicants their rights.  It is a very unusual procedure, but a very effective one.  You bring in a section 4, remove the power from the county manager and give planning permission. The objector can appeal to An Bord Pleanála and they, in turn, may decide that an oral hearing is required.  In my view, that oral hearing is only a window-dressing operation for the Department.  I know a case where our technical staff blatantly refused planning permission.  Their technical staff, the health people, the engineers and the sanitary people, spoke against it.  When the oral hearing was held the same people had to go into that oral hearing and speak for the granting of the application.  I find that totally confusing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was chairman of Mayo County Council when we had to adjourn an oral hearing while our county solicitor was speaking against a planning application. When the solicitor got up to speak we had to call for an adjournment immediately to take her into a room to brief her. We had to tell her she should be speaking for the planning application, and not <Col N="1185" /> against it.  After half an hour's briefing the county solicitor came down and spoke in favour of the development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The county council were erecting some buildings where we felt they should not be erected.  They do not require any planning permission.  Neither do the Land Commission.  They built a house between the road and the sea in a very scenic area at Lecanvey.  The following week a local farmer tried to do the same and was refused planning permission. That was the type of application and administration we had of the Planning Act.</P>
      <P>For that reason we took the law into our own hands, and we now have a case pending &mdash; it has been pending for 14 months &mdash; with An Bord Pleanála.  When everybody in Mayo decided that this house should be erected &mdash; and portion of it was &mdash; those self-elevated people in the body called An Taisce, retired lords, ladies and colonels in our locality, decided that this development would contravene the Planning Act.  They objected, and the case is still with the Department of the Environment and An Bord Pleanála.  No decision has been taken on it.  I regret that the Minister has not got more power to intervene in such cases and ensure that proper decisions are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the decision was taken by the Coalition Government to introduce fees for planning applications and processing it was turned down flatly in Mayo.  It was also turned down in Leitrim.  Most local authorities throughout the country did the same.  The name of the Bill includes the words &ldquo;planning and development&rdquo;. As I see it, retarding development seems to be the role of most planning officers. They should be developing the county to <Col N="1186" /> provide employment and bring up the standard of the buildings, roads, infrastructure and so on.  There is a development plan which is reviewed from time to time, but it is not put into effect.  It is a controlling plan, rather than a development plan.  That is what I have against the planning regulations.</P>
    <P>Flexibility of the administration on the ground is the keynote to all development. We tend to be very rigid in giving decisions. This prevents people from developing their own land.  It is very sad that people who want to develop their own county are restricted by delays in processing planning permissions.  There is supposed to be a two month period, but if a query is raised inside the two month period by the planning officers, that extends their period of decision, with the result that a planning decision may not be fully processed for six to nine months. That is too long to wait and, if we could have some speeding up in decision-making, it could be very effective.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the increase in the case of appeals.  It should be roughly £100 in my view.  It will put a stop to the activities of people who have no rights whatever to object to development. Quite recently when we were developing a car park at the foot of Croagh Patrick, An Taisce decided that there were three trees in the development park that should be retained.  They will be an obstruction there.  An Taisce got away with it.  Possibly some night somebody will remove the trees because they are an obstruction, and there are plenty of trees in the location at any rate.  An Taisce decided that the three trees should be retained in the centre of this park, which will be a beautiful car park.  The same applied at the seaside resort of Old Head.  There are two large trees which are decaying because their roots have not got room for expansion.  An Taisce asked to have them retained.  The council fear An Taisce so they will take the easy way out.  They will leave the trees there.  If there is an objection to any planning application they take the side of the objector rather than the side of the applicant, because they do not want to get into any hassle.  A common-sense application of standards should be <Col N="1187" /> the keynote.  The time of officials examining sites would not be wasted, and confusion, appeals and oral hearings would be eliminated if we had people with commonsense dealing with applications.</P>
    <P>In Mayo if you dig the trial hole for a septic tank in inclement weather, you are refused planning permission because of the high level of water.  The sanitary people feel there is not enough of a filter bed to take the effluent from that septic tank.  My own view &mdash; and it is the view of experienced people who already have septic thanks &mdash; is that you could put a septic tank in the Seanad Chamber, provided you had proper ventilation, and provided that you extracted the effluent into a filter bed.  In the final analysis that effluent could be recycled into drinking water.  That has happened in other countries. You could build a septic tank in the middle of a tarred road, take the outlet from it, and the inlets, and have proper aerial ventilation.  It has worked very well down the years.</P>
    <P>For such reasons people are being refused planning applications.  I have one section 4 coming up on Monday night and I will be successful with it and I will give permission to this man to build his house in my location.  He will have his house built inside six months with a properly planned septic tank in operation. Years ago we needed baffled walls.  Now you take the septic tank on a truck.  You dig a hole with an excavator.  You drop down your pipes and you have your septic tank completed inside an hour or two. That is the modern type of septic tank which is being used at the moment. Years ago it was a big operation to have an effective septic tank working from the engineering point of view.  All of that has gone by the board.  It is about time that there was reason in the application of planning appeals.  I will have something more to say about them.  I do not want to hold up the passage of this Bill.  There are many things I would like to say about planning.  I will have more to say on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's comment that this is an interim Bill.  The <Col N="1188" /> whole area of planning, especially to county council members, is a very emotive subject.  Very few of us are entirely happy with the Planning Act which I was instrumental in formulating in 1976 and having some useful amendments made to it.  Since then with experience we have discovered that many areas leave a lot to be desired if we are to develop in a reasonable way.  I accept that the Minister is faced with a dilemma arising from the Supreme Court case, and because of the disquiet in the building industry, and the fear that jobs could be at stake as a result of pending court decisions.  I and my party will give the Minister all stages of this Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I welcome also his commitment in the other House to implement the building regulations before the end of the year. That is also a necessary part of the construction industry.  It is essential that we are allowed to build, and that we build correctly.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister had the courage in the past to issue a directive to An Bord Pleanála in regard to the development of large retail establishments.  This directive met with widespread support throughout rural Ireland, particularly in many towns with experiences of family type retail outlets independently owned.  If the large retail groups had a monopoly of the market the consumer would suffer eventually.  I am pleased that the Minister has given that directive to An Bord Pleanála.  I should like him to continue to monitor that situation. When a planning authority give permission for an extension to an existing large retail establishment this developer, who could be the wealthy owner of a chain of stores, should make a contribution to the cost of providing off-street car parking for that development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased demands for car parking will result from this development.  When my council inserted such a requirement, it was appealed by the developer to An Bord Pleanála and the figure was reduced from £2,500, as a reasonable contribution to provide car parking space, to £25.  That is an insult to the planning authority who were trying to deal with the matter in a way which would have a desirable effect on the town and its amenties.  Off-street <Col N="1189" /> car parking could have been available if the local authorities had acquired a derelict site and used it as a car park.  This would also have been of financial assistance to the authority.  If the board deal with that kind of request in that way one must question the thinking of some people in An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>I share the concern of other Members of the House about the delays in processing decisions by An Bord Pleanála.  I welcomed the decision to set up An Bord Pleanála because in my view it was removing planning appeals from the political sphere, because there was evidence that political influence was being used when it came to decisions on appeals.  The setting up of an autonomous board like An Bord Pleanála, with power to make decisions, was very welcome but whether it is a lack of staff or something else, the long delays involved in getting decisions from them justifies any complaints any &ldquo;cribber&rdquo; might make.  We have many &ldquo;cribbers&rdquo; in this country and there are many people to whom the word &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; could apply.  These people get tremendous value for their £10 in the delay they cause to legitimate acceptable development in agricultural and industrial development.  I have no objections to people's constitutional right to lodge an objection.  The previous Planning Act stipulated that people had the right to go to the High Court within a time scale of two months.  This was a welcome decision. At that time some people were threatening industrialists, particularly American industrialists &mdash; I am thinking of Shearing Plough &mdash; with taking High Court actions, but never intending to do so.  They were frightening away what could have been welcome developments in an area in need of industrialisation.</P>
    <P>Lodging a fee of £10 with An Bord Pleanála is almost as useful as going to the High Court, because for £10 you can hold up development for 12 months although there might never be any justification for objecting.  There would be an exchange of correspondence between the appellant and the developer and the county planning authority, until such time as the date for an oral hearing was set.  Senator O'Toole outlined the fiasco <Col N="1190" /> an oral hearing can be.  It is unbelievable that there should be this delay when the statutory planning authority have processed the appeal, listened to the objections and made a decision.  At the end of the day when the conditions are written in which are fairly restrictive but acceptable to the developer, the objector has the right to go to An Bord Pleanála, and there the matter rests for a further eight to 14 months.</P>
    <P>There are some developments that cannot wait that long, especially in the agricultural sector if a grain crop is involved.  If somebody at this time of the year lodges an objection to An Bord Pleanála, the grain crop is gone because the board cannot process it quickly enough.  If they are dedicated to the task they have been given statutory powers to carry out, there should be immediate consultation with the local authority who have already processed the complaint and listened to all the objections.  Many of these people are abusing the system. It would be useful if it was generally known that, like the local authority, a two months time limit was imposed on the board.  In some future Bill the Minister could look seriously at the possibility of setting a time limit on the hearing of applications.  The number of appeals made is not very great and they could be processed much faster than at present.  We will have to streamline the situation so that we can overcome this problem.</P>
    <P>I share the view that some people resent the fact that local authorities, semi-State bodies and others do not have to get planning permission to carry out developments which are not allowed to anybody else.  This is looked on as one law for ourselves and another law for the ordinary people.  This area should be looked at.  There should be some period in which the developing authority would have to advise publicly people that they intend to develop and if there are any objections they should be made within a certain time.  There should be some process in which the State or semi-State developers would have to comply with the same conditions as ordinary citizens.  In County Mayo there is one law for the <Col N="1191" /> authority and another for the ordinary person.</P>
    <P>The cost of planning applications is an emotive issue.  Senator Reynolds said how his council dealt with them.  No matter how the Houses of the Oireachtas decide, the operation of this legislation at local level will create problems.  There will be a minimum charge for the ordinary household development.  A person should not have to pay an exorbitant fee to a local authority to build a house. Already he has to pay for an ESB service and a water connection.  Before he is finished, he will be paying something like £1,000 or more to acquire a service he will have to pay for later.  If there is a fee envisaged, it should be a minimum fee for a small development.  The Minister has not ruled that out; he talks about a tapering cost for development.  I have no objections to large scale development, superstores or even industrial developers, paying a reasonable sum towards their applications, because it is possible the council may have to employ expert advice to deal with them and go to a lot of necessary expense.  Planning permission for an ordinary small house will involve the planning authority in a minimum amount of effort.  They will have to visit the site, the plans will be submitted and there should be no reason for a very large fee to be charged.  I ask the Minister to deal fairly with this development so that we will not be discriminating against people who are put to the pin of their collars trying to provide homes.  Because of the high cost of loans from local authorities, whether IDA loans, Housing Finance Agency locans, or bridging finance, these people have to make up the deficit and we should not penalise them under the Planning Act for trying to comply with the regulations laid down.</P>
    <P>I am glad penalties have been covered. This will ensure that people comply with planning regulations.  Some people, particularly developers, when providing a group of houses in an estate or other private developments often leave without completing the job.  They do not carry out the landscaping they promised and which is written into their contracts and <Col N="1192" /> they rarely finish the roadways, paths, lawns and so on in their plans.  Eventually local authorities are faced with demands from the people occupying these houses for amenities like public lighting and pathways.  I would like this penalty to apply to speculators who are involved in such developments and leave the sites before they fulfil their obligations.  All they are interested in is making as much profit as they possibly can.  If this kind of clause is in operation we can follow them up and insist that they provide the services they promised.</P>
    <P>I support these measures and look forward at some future date to a more thorough Planning Bill that will give us an opportunity to deal with the problems facing us as members of local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I, too, welcome this Bill.  I do not agree with everything in it, but I agree with its principal objectives.  This Bill was introduced as a result of the delay in granting planning permissions, and the Minister rightly took this opportunity to bring in other matters he felt should be tidied up. Planning is of great interest to local authority members.  It is an emotive issue.  Some counties are notorious for section fours and issues of that kind.  My own opinion is that section four should never have to be used.  The 1963 Act clearly said that the elected representatives are the planning authority.  They are the people who make the laws, and have the final responsibility in the control of planning development and making the county development plan.  I accept that the local authorities have technical people to give technical advice, but it is the members of the local authorities who should have the final say.  If we do not clearly state our position to the country managers and the planners the situation will get out of hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of aspects of this Bill which I find interesting, for example, in 1981 there were over 54,000 applications. I have always felt that many applications should not have to be made.  In future legislation &mdash; I not this is an interim measure &mdash; exempted development should be looked at very carefully. <Col N="1193" /> There was a time when an application for planning permission had to be made for porches, small buildings at the back, and so on, but that is no longer the case.  Even here, we should go further and hope for more exemptions in any plan we adopt in the future.  The administration costs involved in an application for a porch costing £500 or £600, is the same as for a scheme costing £50,000, £60,000 or £100,000.  Enforcement of the legislation should be looked at in the future.</P>
    <P>In Athlone and County Westmeath there were notorious developers who came in, developed and got away without carrying out the conditions laid down in their planning applications.  A strong enforcement officer should be at the beck and call of the council and he should inspect these developments to ensure that every condition is complied with. That must be one of the most important features of any future planning development legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of the local authority being exempt is wrong too, because the ordinary citizen who might want to object has no rights.  Justice must be done and be seen to be done.  While the local authority would not be doing something that was illegal, nonetheless, the fact that the ordinary man in the street has not the right to object is wrong.  This is an area the Minister might look at when he is introducing future legislation.  There are different standards in different countries. Roscommon is on one side of the River Shannon and Westmeath on the other. In Westmeath we are notorious for screening development on the lake itself. We tend to shy away and refuse permission to develop there.  On the other side of the river, that is not the case.  In the past permission was granted to develop the shores of lakes.  That would not be allowed in Westmeath.  There should be a national standard for development of major roads, lakes and scenic areas generally.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are the planners. There should be flexibility in every plan and if the spirit of the Act is adhered to sufficienty, there should be no reason for section four.  That is not to say we have not had them in Westmeath in the past <Col N="1194" /> and maybe we will have them in the future but I hold a personal view that with the kind of flexibility the Act allows there should be no reason for a section four.  The plan is clearly for the people and it should be flexible.  That should be the aim of any future legislation in this area.</P>

      <P>I will not speak at length on this Bill, but section three in particular seems rather worrying.  It seems, on casual reading, to give an open-ended licence to authorities to give permissions in perpetuity.  Maybe I am misreading the Bill.  I would like clarification on that point.  The second point I would like to raise is the extraordinary remarks of Senator O'Toole as regards An Taisce, a highly responsible body which has the interest of the public at large and which is trying to do its best.  If we are to have that kind of comment on An Taisce which has proved its worth to most of us, it bodes ill for the National Heritage Council if and when that comes into being.  Obviously, there is a certain proportion of frivolous objections or objections made by cranks and people like that, but there must remain the right to object which is reasonably practicable. If you create obstacles or settle fees which are prohibitive this must work against the ordinary citizen in favour of the more wealthy and more powerful sections of our community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I give a conditional welcome to this Bill.  As the Minister rightly pointed out the need has been obvious for some time.  Unfortunately, a matter as complex as planning and developing generally cannot be dealt with adequately in a Bill of this nature.  While I accept on the one hand that it is an interim measure and is absolutely essential by virtue of pending court decisions that some interim action must be taken I feel it will be necessary to follow this Bill up with a more far-reaching and comprehensive Bill.  That is absolutely essential, and I would like the Minister to give an indication of that when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the duration of the planning permission, which has already been <Col N="1195" /> referred to by Senator O'Connell, there could be some difficulties in relation to continued extensions.  It could mean that developers, as opposed to individual applicants, could have unnecessary influence, or could bring unnecessary pressure to bear on the powers that be, whether they be the local authorities or the Department, thereby ensuring the continued existence of planning permission. In this Bill it is proposed that the local authority will have the power to extend or withdraw as the case may be.</P>
    <P>A couple of speakers mentioned applications made by individuals for their own dwellings.  We should differentiate between large scale planning applications where large amounts of money are involved, and applications made by ordinary individuals who wish to provide themselves with dwelling-houses. Unfortunately the regulations are so complex, particularly the manner in which they are interpreted by some local authorities, as to make it almost impossible for the average citizen to obtain planning permission without a two month period, but large scale developers have both the financial where withal and the technical assistance to ensure that they receive adequate consideration and get planning permission.  If a similar application were made by an individual he would not receive the same favourable consideration.  This is something that has been brought up again and again by members of local authorities.  Members of local authorities, of which I am one, are the people who have the closest working knowledge of the Planning and Development Acts.  This is one area where careful thought should go into a future Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposal to charge a fee is necessary and desirable.  If we expect the staff of a local authority to undertake the necessary investigation related to a planning permission, it is absolutely essential that there be some recompense paid to that local authority.  This will mean the local authority will be able to recover some financial control over their own destiny. I would not like that to be taken as a free licence to increase, at the whim of the <Col N="1196" /> local authority or of successive Governments, that fee indiscriminately, because then we could arrive at a situation when again we would have to differentiate between the individual and the large-scale planning applicant.  There is absolutely no way we should do this.  When we set the fee we must ensure that it will be in line with the scale of development as opposed to an application for the single house.  I would like the Minister to refer to that in his reply.</P>
    <P>I live in an area which has ample urban and rural development.  We should have a second tier in a Planning Act which would deal more readily with applications in the rural area.  The restrictions imposed on the average individual applicant in a rural area seem to delay the decision to such an extent that in many cases the applicant gets tired of the system and gives up.  Consequently, we have to revert to the section 4s which have already been referred to.  That is a bad thing.  It is unfortunate that members of local authorities should have to introduce section 4s to get an average and straightforward planning application through the system.  We will have to come round to thinking about a two-tier system, which would simplify the situation from the point of view of the average citizen making an application for his or her own use as opposed to the highly technical type of application which has to be made and the highly technical type of response needed when large-scale development is involved.  I am concerned about the possibility of a planning authority &mdash; and this relates entirely to large-scale development &mdash; making a decision which, in the opinion of the courts, reduces the value of the lands concerned, whereupon a purchase order can be served on the local authority, putting that body under serious financial pressure.  A number of these cases have already been referred to and more, I understand, are before the courts.  They have very serious implications. One could have a situation where a planning authority can refuse planning permission, but invariably that involves large-scale development.  It does not seem to affect the person or persons who make applications for their own use.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> When a large-scale development takes place we have had a number of cases where the applicant on finding that the local authority did not wish to grant permission, or accede to the request for permission, then appealed to An Bord Pleanála who in most instances also agreed, and rightly so with the decision of the local authority.  The courts can view the matter in a somewhat different light, and a purchase order can be served on the local authority, which in itself can have serious implications.  The valuation arrived at by the courts may bear little relationship to the actual value of those lands a number of years previously.  I accept that this has been covered in another Bill relating to taxation but there are, unfortunately, loopholes which are being circumnavigated at present.</P>
    <P>There is another point to which serious attention should be given, and if it were, would eliminate a lot of the mischievous objections which have been referred to by a number of people.  The validity of planning permissions granted on the basis of insufficient information in the original public notice should be seriously questioned. I have come across a number of cases where the public notice did not in any case or to any extent give sufficient information as to the proposed development. A number of these cases have come before An Bord Pleanála.  Having regard to the previous decision, the board in their wisdom decided to approve the decision already taken by the local authority.  This is something to which greater attention should be given.  If it was, it would eliminate problems whereby residents and residents' associations who suddenly find themselves with a development they did not anticipate arriving on their doorsteps.  Usually such development takes place on foot of a notice in a newspaper, and often in a section of the newspaper which will not be read.  Unfortunately this has been the case and it has had the effect of creating unnecessary alarm.  Residents and residents' associations then seek to object to a development without knowing all the facts.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned section 7 (2) <Col N="1198" /> and (3) in relation to general directives. While I accept that the general directives which will be required from time to time are necessary, at the same time there is a danger, despite what subsection (3). says, that this will not apply to any particular case.  There is a danger that clout, influence or the sheer insistence of a powerful lobby may be exercised, and &mdash; I say this without any criticism of the Minister or his predecessor &mdash; I have seen evidence, as I am sure have all members of local authorities, of this type of problem. There is a great danger that these people would force a decision to be taken that might not have a bearing on a current application but which could at some future date have a very strong bearing on their own applications.  That is something I would like to have considered and I hope amended at a later stage.  That is one area I am worried about and I hope the Minister will take cognisance of it.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála generally has done a good job.  It has taken a great deal of the pressure off successive Ministers and has taken away a lot of the political tag that attached to planning and development. However, there are shortcomings, and some of them have already been dealt with by the previous speakers in relation to delays in processing applications. Again, unfortunately, this has the greatest impact on the individual applicant. The individual in almost all cases seems to be forgotten and seems to miss out on the careful and compassionate consideration he or she should get under the Planning and Development Acts.  The large-scale operator seems to be able to command greater control and greater attention and seems to be able to insist on the expeditious processing of his application.</P>
    <P>In relation to oral hearings and An Bord Pleanála, oral hearings are very useful because they tend to illustrate to some extent to the general public the manner in which the decision is arrived at on a particular application.  It also tends to give them an opportunity of making a submission.  There may be instances where a submission may be mischievous or not well-founded but by and large appeals that go before An Bord <Col N="1199" /> Pleanála go there for a very good reason. The only qualification I would make there is that I would like to see oral hearings granted more readily, particularly where a large community or a large number of objectors lodge an objection. It does not necessarily follow in all cases that when a large number of people object to a particular type of development that an oral hearing is granted.  In fact, the reverse may be the case.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier, in relation to another Bill, the need for overall planning and development strategy.  That need still exists and will exist, as I am sure the Minister will agree, after the enactment of this Bill.  It is something which successive Governments have neglected, and I am not attributing blame to any one individual or any one Department. It is something which we have failed entirely to come to grips with over a number of years.  I suppose it is understandable that the development explosion that took place in what I regard as the eastern region was not anticipated and, consequently, the effects of such development explosion could not have been anticipated.  It is now long past the time for the careful consideration of long-term and medium-term planning and development objectives.</P>
    <P>It is the job of the Department of the Environment, through the aegis of local authorities, to ensure that in the future we will not have the type of planning development that has been so much criticised over the past number of years and the extensions of what are referred to as the concrete jungles.  That would be deplorable.  The only way it can be resolved is by setting out clear development objectives both on a regional and on a national scale.  It will entail the provision of the infrastructure in areas outside of those which are currently coming under most pressure for development.  It will entail the provision of hospitals, schools, telecommunications, roads, rail and all the necessary services in order to encourage the population, which is expanding, to remain in their own communities, as opposed to what we have at <Col N="1200" /> present when we have the continuous increase in the population in the greater Dublin area.  This results in continuous development to facilitate that population and the continuous need to provide more jobs, something which we are finding great difficulty in doing.</P>
    <P>All of this stems from the massive increase in the population in the eastern region.  As a member of the Eastern Regional Development Organisation, I have strong views on the matter.  I know the Minister has received submissions from that body and I hope he will consider them favourably in due course.  We hope that as a result we will seek to put an end to the social and economic difficulties that are attendant on unlimited development in any one area.  I will go into this in more detail at a later stage.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's response on some of the queries already raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Raphael Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Senators for their contributions to this debate which were very interesting and, in particular, the fact that contributions were coming from men with a background in local authorities and local government.  They know exactly the operation of planning and development on the ground in their own local areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Reynolds mentioned planning permission for single houses, and that theme ran through all the contributions made here today.  I share the frustration of Members in the way the Planning Acts have been interpreted with regard to construction of single houses.  Sites have been provided by fathers for sons to stay near their homes but planning permission has been refused by local authorities.  It is with this in mind, and I refer to my opening remarks, that I will be asking planning authorities to review their approach to planning controls to ensure that the system will not have the effect of causing the delays in the commencement of worthwhile development and the creation of jobs.  I will be looking for a uniform system and interpretation of the Act rather than the system we have at the moment, where one county uses one set <Col N="1201" /> of rules and another county has another set of rules.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Reynolds on local authorities not having to apply for planning permissions, of course, if they want to build houses, fire stations, libraries or courthouses, all new works of that type have to be approved by the council themselves and by the elected members.  If there is a body of opinion within an area that feels strongly on, say, a fire station being built in their area, it is up to the people involved to make representations to their local councillors.  The councillors can air their views on behalf of the objectors at local authority meetings.</P>
    <P>As far as the Office of Public Works are concerned, section 84 of the 1963 Act covers the question of consultation by State authorities before undertaking the construction or extension of any building where it states that a State authority shall consult with a planning authority to such extent as may be determined.  It also states that if any objections raised by the planning authority are not resolved, except where the construction or extension is being undertaken by the Minister, they shall consult on the objections with the Minister.  There is a consultation process there.</P>
    <P>At the moment the period for extending planning permission is seven years. From 1983 the period will be five year. There is no question of two sets of rules, one for existing and one for new permissions. It is generally agreed, and it is incorporated in the Bill, that many people were caught out by the withering that took place on 31 October 1981 and we are trying to get over this anomaly by extending it to 1983.  The original intention was October 1982 but by the time this Bill will be finished it will be the end of July and that would leave only two or three months if we went for the 1982 date.  We are going for 1983 instead and after that it will be five years.</P>
    <P>There is no intention whatsoever to have directives with regard to secondary roads.  There is no such directive there at the moment.  A letter went out to local authorities in 1972 which asked them in the granting of planning permissions not <Col N="1202" /> to allow permissions which would front on to national primary routes.  There was in the last paragraph of the letter a passing reference to secondary routes but it was only a passing reference.  As I have said in my opening speech, the directives I have in mind refer to the freedom of choice between large and small retail outlets. I intend to forward a directive to the local authorities and to the board, similar to that of May last year, which set out guidelines to be followed with regard to the decisions by An Bord Pleanála and it will apply also to local authorities when making decisions on applications for multi-stores and for large supermarkets.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators who welcomed the provisions in the penalties area.  A number of Senators mentioned the fees and charges; some Senators welcomed them and others were not too happy.  I gave the figure for the processing of planning permissions.  It is costing the country £6,800,000 at the moment.  I can assure the House that the scheme being introduced is purposely flexible.  This was a point that was worrying a number of the Senators.  It will be on a sliding scale &mdash; a very small sum of money for a single house and for an extension but it will rise for major commercial developments, for office blocks and other commercial developments. The Senators need have no fears whatsoever about the type of scheme of fees to be introduced.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole highlighted the different approach that prevails in different counties.  For this reason I am anxious to give the local authorities the type of information to help in the matter of planning permissions.  Personally I feel that in many cases the authorities can be too restrictive.  The Bill, as the Senator rightly said, is called the Planning and Development Bill.  There should be room for development especially in single houses in rural areas.  That is something I would encourage very much in the smaller villages and also in the rural areas.  It is with that sort of background that I intend to forward these guidelines to the authorities to try to get some sort of uniform interpretation of the rules.</P>
    <P>The single republic of Mayo I will leave to another day and as a half Mayo man <Col N="1203" /> I will not comment on it.  I know that they have not only their own rules and regulations in that but they cannot even play a decent game of football.  Having seen them last Sunday, I say they disgraced themselves.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris mentioned the delays in the board and we all regret those delays. In many cases the delays cannot be avoided because of problems when appellants will not send in the necessary information or refuse to submit enough information for the board to make a decision.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon mentioned the important role of local authority members in the whole of this planning area and I could not agree with him more.  There is too often an attempt by Government to take away the powers of local authorities. I am against that and I share his concern that local authority members should be listened to more in the planning area. Too often a local authority member says a particular item is right but if an official says it is wrong, the official's view is automatically taken.  The official may have been in the county for only six months or six weeks whereas the local man knows his county and represents the people.  Of course, account should be taken of the technical advice available but technical advice on its own should not be the main criterion.  It is the technical advice, plus the wisdom, experience and the local knowledge of the local democratically elected member that should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon mentioned the case of extending the exempted developments on such thing as porches.  Last year I exempted porches and back-kitchens of a certain size from having to get planning permission.  I will look again at extending the number of exemptions in the smaller areas.  He also mentioned the very important point of the completion of housing estates.  I have increased the penalties for non-compliance with conditions of planning permissions and I had in mind particular housing estates.  Too many housing estates are left by developers in an appalling condition and not just private developers.  We have many examples in <Col N="1204" /> the city and county in which I live.  The Dublin Corporation, for example, develop in the county council area and leave their estates in an appalling condition and if a private developer did this under the terms of this Act he would be in jail.  I hope that the public bodies as well as the private sector will complete their estates and meet their obligations under the rules of planning permissions. Last year I brought in a scheme for financial assistance to local authorities to pay up to two-thirds of the sum involved where a local authority, having used all the means available to them through the courts and so on, could not succeed in getting an estate completed.  The scheme I introduced allows for a local authority to finish the estate themselves.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell mentioned the case of section 3.  The local authority can extend only if justified by reference to the criteria laid down.  The point is something that we can tackle in detail on Committee Stage.  Senator Durkan and others asked for a more comprehensive Bill.  I can assure Senators that a more comprehensive Bill is on the way.  It will not be in the next session but there is much work going on on it at the moment.  I was surprised to hear Senator Durkan mention that he did not want further extensions. He was afraid of the larger planning permissions having a longer life than the five years.  I would remind him that in the Dáil the direct opposite view was taken by his colleague, Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, who had an amendment down which asked that the life of a planning permission would only start&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I may have given the wrong impression.  I was speaking in relation to extension of individual applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Raphael Burke Mr. Raphael Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Raphael Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We can come back to that on Committee Stages.  The question of the life of a planning permission was discussed in the time we had available last night.  There was a request that the life of a permission would only commence when all conditions had been met, such as the provision of water and sewerage, and that the five-year period <Col N="1205" /> would only start then.  I accepted the amendment in principle; but I will come back to it at a later stage in a more comprehensive Bill.  I did not accept the amendment as it was down.  I have already covered the point made by other Senators of the sliding scale with regard to development.  It was suggested that a two-tier system be used, with the single house and large-scale development being treated differently but, I do not think that would work.  It is a matter for the managers to operate their own administration so that every application receives proper and careful attention.</P>
      <P>On the question of compensation claims, that seems to be more relevant to the motion and to the Joint Committee that is now being set up with regard to building land.  One of the terms of reference of that committee refers to the operation of the Planning and Development Acts of 1963 and 1976.  Those Acts include the question of compensation, and is a matter for the committee to look at.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Senator and the House that there is no question whatsoever of any attempt to bring the Minister for the Environment back into planning on a day-to-day basis.  These are general directives on the lines with regard to such things as the right of choice on shopping and between smaller and larger schemes. Subsection (3) of the section specifically excludes the Minister.  It precludes him from involving himself in the day-to-day affairs of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the long- and medium-term planning is concerned, I agree fully with the Senator that there is a need to have a comprehensive plan, perhaps through the regional development organisations for each region.  For example, it is to me a bit ludicrous to prepare a plan which takes no account whatsoever of the sewerage and water facilities available.  Why should Dublin expand continuously outwards? Why not develop some towns such as Naas, maybe up to Drogheda, maybe into Navan?  These towns should be developed.  We should have a proper transportation system into the city centre.  It should not necessarily mean <Col N="1206" /> just a continuous sprawl out from the city.</P>
    <P>From now on we will have to look at planning on a regional basis rather than just a county-by-county basis, especially in places like Dublin, Galway and Limerick, which would be an obvious one with a Clare connection.  This is particularly relevant to Dublin.  It is time that the regional development organisations came into this whole area of regional planning in the medium and long term. It is something that I am very much in favour of.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Seanad for the welcome that they have given to the Bill.  I look forward to Committee Stage next week when we can go into greater detail on some of the points that were raised.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, 1971 to ensure that a mandatory regime for disposal of the production of the Whitegate refinery can be established under the Act, as amended.  The Bill also includes an amendment removing a legal doubt as to the applicability of the Act to stocks of oil in retailers' premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, 1971 enables the Minister for Industry and Energy to control the supply and distribution of fuels whenever the Government declare by order under section 2 that the exigencies of the common good so require.  When an order under section 2 is in force the Minister may be order under section 3 provide for the regulation and control of the supply and distribution of fuels and for the control, regulation, restriction or prohibition of the import or export of fuels.  An order made by the Minister may empower him <Col N="1207" /> to issue such authorisations, licences or directions as he considers necessary for giving full effect to any provisions of the order.</P>
    <P>At the time the Act was introduced energy demand in Ireland and in the western world generally was steadily increasing and then, as now, political developments threatened the flow of oil supplies.  It therefore became imperative for oil importing countries to prepare to deal with any supply disruptions or other developments in the energy situation. Later events, including the Middle East conflict in 1973-74 and the Iran revolution in 1979 showed the wisdom of such preparations. The Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, 1971 was invoked by the Government to control the supply and distribution of oil during the shortages in Ireland's oil supply which followed these events.</P>
    <P>Today, oil still accounts for the major proportion of Ireland's energy requirements although the impact of Kinsale gas and increased use of coal reduced this proportion from 75 per cent in 1978 to 63 per cent in 1981.  A major element of the Government's energy policy is further to reduce this considerable dependence on imported fuel to a reasonable level.  As this reduction must take place in a manner which will least disturb the economy of the country, it is a medium term goal.  Until that goal is achieved oil will continue to be the major energy source.</P>
    <P>Given the constant risk that oil supplies may be seriously disrupted it is important that our requirements are made as secure as possible.  There are three main elements to a proper policy on oil supply security.  These are (1) diversification of sources and channels of supply; (2) maintenance of adequate stocks of oil; and (3) availability of oil refining capacity.</P>
    <P>Until 1979, Ireland's oil requirements were supplied by the Irish subsidiaries of the international oil companies and by small home-based independent importers. These supplies originated from the international companies' procurement systems, from supply contracts with other <Col N="1208" /> oil companies or from the product spot markets.  In 1979, the Government set up the Irish National Petroleum Corporation to take advantage of the growing preference on the part of oil producing states to by-pass the international oil companies and trade directly with the oil consuming countries.  In this way our sources and channels of supply are supplemented and diversified.  The corporation have concluded supply contracts with oil producers and disposal of the products refined from this oil is carried out through Ireland's existing distribution system.  I intend to introduce legislation in the near future to provide a statutory basis for the capital structure, organisation and functions of the corporation.</P>
    <P>Ireland, as a member of the EEC and of the International Energy Agency, maintains, as required, a minimum of 90 days' stocks of oil.  Ten days' supply is held at the Whiddy oil terminal on behalf of the Government and the remainder is held at Whitegate refinery and at the terminals and depots of the oil companies and of large oil consumers.  I am concerned that about a quarter of these stocks is held abroad even though it is held under completed or pending agreements with EEC member states. However, I have this matter under examination.</P>
    <P>The third element of a policy on oil supply security is the availability of operating oil refining capacity.  A country with such capacity has greater freedom to negotiate supplies of crude oil from whatever source than if it had none.  Furthermore, it reduces dependence on foreign refineries and provides an alternative channel of supply.  In the absence of refining capacity an alternative is to have storage capacity for oil products capable of maintaining at the very minimum, 90 days' stocks of oil in the national territory. The capital cost of building storage facilities and filling them with oil to meet our national requirements would, it is estimated, be of the order of £2.5 million per day.  Therefore, if we wished to have an extra 25 days' stocks on Irish soil it would cost at least £80 million.  The companies are understandably reluctant to <Col N="1209" /> incur such costs and retention of operating refining capacity partly reduces the scale of such stocks and the urgency of providing them in full.</P>
    <P>Ireland's only oil refinery, at Whitegate, County Cork, commenced operations in 1959 under the joint ownership of Esso, Shell, Texaco and BP.  It operated for several years from start up under an element of protective duty.  Total refining capacity is 2.77 million tonnes per annum which, at current consumption rates, represents over 50 per cent of the Irish oil market.  Last year the four companies advised the Minister for Industry and Energy of a decision by their principals to close the refinery permanently. Their decision was on the grounds that the operation of the refinery was resulting in substantial costs as compared with a situation where they would be free to import all their requirements.  Processing at Whitegate ceased in June 1981. The owners envisaged retaining the tank farm at the refinery as a storage depot to meet stock obligations and as an operating terminal for the south and west of the country.  This would require the retention of a relatively small number of personnel. There were about 155 direct employees of the refining company and an additional 150 employed in ancillary services such as tug-boats, fire watching, pilotage and a coastal shipping company which was substantially dependent on the refinery.</P>
    <P>As the absence of operating oil refining capacity is considered unacceptable on strategic and other grounds, discussions with the refining companies pursued the possibilities that some mechanism be found to meet the dis-economies which they saw in continuing to operate Whitegate. It became quite clear that the companies' decision to abandon refining at Whitegate was irrevocable and that, if the Government's objective of retaining a minimum strategic refining capability were to be preserved, the State would have to acquire and operate the refinery. The subsequent events in this matter have been widely publicised and I do not think it is necessary for me to say more than that the previous Government shortly before going out of office, took a decision in principle to purchase the <Col N="1210" /> refinery.  Final negotiations were concluded with the owners of the refinery and the present Government, on assuming office, confirmed the decision to purchase.</P>
    <P>On 1 April last the Dáil approved a Supplementary Estimate for the sum of £10 million to cover the purchase price, refurbishing costs and other costs arising up to the start-up date.  The planned date for resumption of production is early next month and, as is known, the refinery is being owned and operated on behalf of the Government by the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.</P>
    <P>When it became clear that the four oil companies which jointly owned Whitegate were not prepared, and could not be persuaded or induced, to continue operating the refinery, and that the only basis for continuing operations would be under the aegis of the State, consideration was given to the manner in which off-take of products from a State-owned refinery could be disposed of.  This matter was discussed at considerable length with the companies marketing oil in Ireland with a view to finding out whether a system of voluntary off-take of products would command general support.</P>
    <P>It was, of course, recognised by the industry that it would be unacceptable, both in operating and economic terms, to envisage a system whereby the State would operate the refinery but would have no assurances that the products would be taken into the Irish market.  If that extremely risky course were adopted, products from Whitegate would have to be offered for sale at prices which would be competitive with the lowest prices prevailing on the international spot market.  Notwithstanding that the marketing companies themselves, for the security of their own supplies, would have to rely on term contracts rather than the spot market for the larger share of their suppliers, no assurance emerged in the discussions that the companies would off-take from Whitegate other than on a marginal basis; indeed bearing in mind the relationship between the Irish marketing companies and their UK supply companies, there could be no guarantee of off-take from INPC ex-White-gate <Col N="1211" /> at any price.  In times of glut, such as we experienced recently, spot prices for products could be lower than the official price of crude oil being put through the refinery.  Such a situation would be totally incompatible with an operation designed to provide the Irish economy with a minimum level of refining capacity in the interests of national security.</P>
    <P>While there was some recognition of this position by the oil marketing companies, they expressed strong concern that any off-take arrangements introduced should operate equitably across the board so that there would be no question of some companies having freedom to opt out while others might be disposed to co-operate.  It was clear that the criteria of general application of off-take obligations and equitable operation of the arrangements involved could not be achieved unless there was a statutory backing to the arrangements.  The companies which formerly owned the refinery and the other oil marketers were, therefore, aware that a decision by the Government to purchase the refinery would entail a system of equitable off-take of Whitegate products, backed by legislation.</P>
    <P>The mandatory off-take concept has been considered at length by the Attorney General both in relation to Irish law and EEC obligations.  There have been also a number of detailed discussions with various divisions of the EEC Commission. The best advice available to the Government is that, taking due account of the position in domestic legislation and of our obligations in the EEC context, the Government are entitled, in the interests of national security, to take steps provided for in the Bill now before the House.  In relation to the Treaty of Rome, Article 36 clearly entitles a member Government to take exceptional measures to protect essential aspects of national security.  The House will be well aware that, in the decision of both the previous and present Governments to acquire the refinery, this criterion of national security was very much in mind. International events of recent occurrence have, I need hardly say, strongly underlined <Col N="1212" /> the importance of having within our jurisdiction refining facilities to meet at least our basic national oil requirements in an acute emergency.</P>
    <P>Senators will naturally be concerned about the legal basis of the Bill and they may be asking me to provide categoric assurances that this cannot be challenged. The Bill and, indeed, the 1971 Act, are largely enabling measures.  The provisions of the Act have been invoked a number of times over the years and the changes proposed in the Bill do not alter the essential nature of the legislation.  In the circumstances, there appear to me to be no grounds whatever for reservations about the Bill in relation to domestic law or EEC requirements.  If any substantive legal issue arises it would appear to relate to the action proposed to be taken under the Bill.</P>
    <P>In this regard, since both national and supra-national courts have jurisdiction, nobody can provide cast-iron guarantees. However, I repeat that the best advice available to me and to the Government is that the measures proposed are in accord with relevant law and EEC obligations. An off-take regime is an essential element of the totally legitimate objective of maintaining an operation refinery to cater for our minimum emergency oil needs.</P>
    <P>The purchase and operation of the refinery and a satisfactory system of equitable off-take of products are not separate concepts but are interdependent elements of one strategy.  The Bill is, therefore, a necessary extension of the decision to purchase the refinery on grounds of national security, a decision on which there is a large measure of consensus.</P>
    <P>As regards the use of the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Act, 1971 as a basis for the mandatory off-take regime, the Attorney General has advised that it is an appropropriate instrument on which to base the regime, subject to certain amendments of that Act.  The Bill now before the House incorporates these amendments.</P>
    <P>I had considered that, if it became necessary, an alternative approach to the mandatory off-take obligation would be <Col N="1213" /> to make a wider order under section 3(2) of the Act, as amended, under which companies would be required to submit a supply plan for their supply proposals to the Irish market for each period of 12 months ahead.  Part of this supply plan would embrace the requirement that the proportionate level of product, as proposed above, would be drawn from the Irish refinery; secondly that broad information would be given on the sourcing of the remainder of their supplies being imported, on the balance between term contract and spot supply in the latter, on the guarantees lying behind any over-dependencies on supply from one country or one company in one country, on the acceptability of any restrictive agreements compelling supplies to be drawn from particular foreign companies and on the arrangements for stock holding.  It could be a feature of such a plan, under statutory order, that a marketing licence would be required and that the grant of such marketing licence would be conditional on observance of the requirements of the approved supply plan.</P>
    <P>I am aware that at least one other European country has felt it necessary to adopt meaures of this kind in the interests of ensuring central control over security of supply.  The approach has merits and I would not rule it out as something we may wish to consider in certain circumstances. However, my present view is that in prevailing conditions such measures might be considered as going beyond what was essential.  I have, therefore, opted for the more limited approach which I have outlined because it is my opinion, and I am sure the oil industry would agree, that intervention in the operation of the market should be confined to the minimum necessary to achieve the limited objectives which State acquisition of the refinery is intended to safeguard.</P>
    <P>Measures introduced by Governments in various parts of the world to cushion their populations against the ever-present risk of a serious disruption of supplies on the international oil market frequently go beyond what would be considered normal commercial criteria.  Perhaps the most widely-known measures are obligatory <Col N="1214" /> oil storage conditions to which I referred earlier which operate in almost all oil-importing countries including those in the EEC and the more widely representative International Energy Agency.  Under these storage regulations, oil trading companies are required to make arrangements, which involve costs of various kinds, to maintain stocks of oil to meet at least 90 days' requirements and these measures need not take account of whether or not the stocking levels and locations of the stocks would be considered by the companies to be necessary or desirable on strictly commercial grounds.  Both the previous and present Governments have concluded that, like strategic stocks, a minimum capacity for domestic refining is important on grounds of national security.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that most Governments in Europe, or indeed elsewhere, if faced with closure of 100 per cent of their national refining capacity, would take a similar view even though continental countries would not have the additional risk factor which applies in our case as an island economy.  I would emphasise, however, that I am committed to ensuring that the entire off-take regime, both as regards quantities and applicable prices, will be operated with the greatest degree of fairness and equity that will be humanly possible in administrative terms.  It there is a limited burden, in terms of dis-economies of refining at Whitegate or of inconvenience, to be borne by the oil industry to maintain a minimum limited strategic refining capacity, I will make every effort to ensure that this is fairly shared by all concerned.</P>
    <P>The dis-economies of operating at Whitegate, as compared with importation of oil products on the most favourable terms available on the open market, arise for a number of reasons.  First, there are physical limitations.  The maximum size of ships which can gain entrance to Cork harbour, and therefore Whitegate, is such that transfer of oil from larger crude carriers at sea to smaller vessels is necessary.  In addition, Whitegate is further from the main markets in the Dublin area than are certain refineries owned independently by the major oil companies <Col N="1215" /> at Pembroke and Milford Haven. The major factor which contributes to the dis-economies of Whitegate is the technical nature of the refinery which yields between 45 per cent and 55 per cent of its output in heavy fuel oil, compared with less than 30 per cent in refineries with more modern technology. Fuel oil is a relatively low-value product and the present market for it is vulnerable as a result of the switch to coal for electricity generation and heavy industry and the effects of conservation measures.</P>
    <P>There are certain investments which can be considered to up-grade the facilities at Whitegate so as to produce a better yield of the higher value refined products. There are certain stages of up-grading which can be considered and which vary substantially in cost and there are technical options within some of these stages. At the moment, the efforts of the INPC are being concentrated on getting the refinery back into efficient operation on the basis of its present technical capability. I can assure this House that, in association with the INPC, I will be examining urgently and critically the technical advantages and economic feasibility of all the options available for up-grading. While I am not at this time putting forward specific proposals for up-grading I can say that arrangements are being made to reduce the lead content of petrol produced at Whitegate without having to continue to depend upon our derogation from the EEC directive in that regard.</P>
    <P>Given that there are dis-economies associated with operation of the refinery, the question arises as to how they should be treated.  The decision of the previous Government in this regard has been confirmed by the present Government, that is, to have the refinery operated on a cost-recovery basis.  This approach of cost-carrying by oil users is seen as more appropriate than one involving a direct subsidy.  The prices proposed to be charged by the INPC to its customers will therefore recover capital, crude oil acquisition, shipment and storage costs and, of course, the operating costs of the refinery. At first, the cost disadvantages as compared with the present 100 per cent <Col N="1216" /> importation of products may be of the order of one to two pence per gallon on all oil products sold in the country.  I am not in a position, at this time, to suggest what effect this may have on the price of particular products such as petrol or diesel. It will be appreciated by Senators that this will depend on a number of factors some of which are related to ongoing discussions with the trade on the offtake arrangements and, of course, the inter-play of competition in particular market sectors will affect the issue.  I must, indeed, emphasise that any calculation of the dis-economies is only valid at the time it is made because of the volatility of conditions in the oil market. There is a reasonable expectation that, in time, the dis-economy can be reduced.</P>
    <P>The current oil market surplus, with depressed market prices, which has caused losses even on the part of modern refineries, is beginning to diminish, and already market prices have begun to rise. In these circumstances the gap between the Whitegate prices and the prices of imported refined products is reduced. Another factor which may help to reduce the dis-economy is price of the crude oil being processed at the refinery.  The Irish National Petroleum Corporation will have at least three separate sources of crude oil.  Two of these sources have already been arranged, namely Saudi Arabia and British North Sea oil.  At first there will be a high proportion of Saudi Arabia crude oil processed at the refinery. In the current oil market situation this crude oil is relatively expensive but in time the Corporation will be expecting to achieve some economies in their crude oil procurement, having reasonable regard to the objective of supply security.</P>
    <P>The proposed offtake regime will operate on the following lines.  All oil importers, including undertakings which import directly for their own consumption, will be obliged to purchase a proportion of their oil product requirements from the refinery.  For two major reasons an upper limit on this obligatory proportion will be set.  This upper limit, roughly matching the minimum operating level of the refinery and representing about 35 per cent of the Irish market, will minimise <Col N="1217" /> the burden on the economy generally and on the oil companies, while any dis-economy exists.  Secondly, in discussions with representatives of the EEC on the compatibility of the proposed regime with the Treaty of Rome, it was suggested that such a limit was desirable as indicative of the minimum strategic national requirements in an acute emergency situation. There may be scope for operating the refinery with improved economy at higher levels of throughput without adversely impinging on the mandatory offtake arrangements, and this will be fully explored by the INPC.</P>
    <P>The INPC are currently engaged in discussions with the oil industry on the methodology of implementing the off-take arrangements.  In general, it is intended that the amounts of Whitegate oil products to be taken for each quarter will be based upon data provided by the companies in respect of their sales or requirements in the preceding twelve months.  I have emphasised to the INPC that the arrangements should be agreed as far as possible and should be as flexible as possible, consistent with an equitable operation of the scheme.  It should be possible to agree arrangements to cover such situations as where the allocated quantity of a product might be unrepresentative of the importers' anticipated requirements or where the lifting of an entire allocation of any product in a particular quarter might create special difficulties.</P>
    <P>Apart from the trading companies, there are certain major oil users who import their requirements directly and in bulk, mainly supplies of heavy fuel oil. There may be about a dozen of these large oil consumers, and it would be necessary to make appropriate arrangements for these within the general scheme. Because of the effects of oil prices on the costs and competitiveness of Irish industry, the price to be charged for the Whitegate proportion of their heavy fuel oil requirements will be an important consideration. Although final prices will not be known until the arrangements are further advanced, I will be concerned to ensure that the heavy fuel oil price will be pitched at a level which would not give <Col N="1218" /> rise to significant difficulties for Irish industry, both those who have direct import facilities and those supplied through the national distribution network.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the major provisions in the text of the Bill.  The 1971 Act enables the Minister for Industry and Energy to control the supply and distribution of fuels whenever the Government are of the opinion and declare that the exigencies of the common good so require.  The legal opinion is that the words &ldquo;supply and distribution&rdquo; must be read together.  This description therefore is unsuitable for the offtake regime as it is not proposed to control the actual distribution of oil.  The Bill therefore provides for the amendment of that description where it appears in the Act to read &ldquo;acquisition, supply, distribution or marketing&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo; is inserted in order to make certain that the purchase obligation is comprehended in the Minister's powers.  The word &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; is also inserted since it is a relevant aspect of the operations involved in getting Whitegate products into distribution. With the inclusion of these amendments the Minister will, while a Government order under section 2 is in force, be in a position to make an order under section 3 applying the Whitegate purchase obligation to oil importers. Such a Government order, made in 1979, has been kept in force by continuance orders in view of the instability of the oil market since then.</P>
    <P>Included in the amendment of section 2 of the Act is an extension of the maximum periods of operation of Government orders and of continuance orders from six to twelve months in each case. A period of six months is considered inadequate for oil supply planning, particularly in relation to the disposal of products from Whitegate refinery.  The Bill also includes new provisions which may be of assistance in administering the offtake regime.  One such provision may enable the Minister to require a person to furnish relevant information to him in order to enable him to implement an order.  There is also provision for the authorisation of officers to inspect premises, <Col N="1219" /> obtain information, examine and take copies of documents and so on.  The other provisions of the Bill are the updating of the construction of the penalty provisions and an amendment of the definition of petroleum oils in order to ensure that stocks of oil in retailers' premises are included.  There has been a legal doubt as to whether such stocks are covered in the existing definition.</P>
    <P>I now commend this Bill to the House. I emphasise again that it is an essential consequence of the decision to retain refinery operations at Whitegate.  I believe that Senators will concur in the view of successive Governments that every prudent step must be taken to maintain and improve our ability to safeguard the public and the economy against the worst effects of an acute oil supply emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive address.  That is something very often lacking in relation to Bills before this House and I thank the Minister for going to the trouble of covering the Bill so adequately in his address.</P>
      <P>It was necessary to take the steps which are now being taken because otherwise the Whitegate oil refinery would become obsolete.  We are all aware of the necessity to ensure that we can process as many products as possible at home and thus give employment to our people and be able to have some control over the supply in this case of very essential fuel.  We have over a number of years had unfortunate experience of what can happen when problems arise whether it be difficulties in distribution or otherwise, and the community has suffered as a result. In most cases it has been as a result of difficulties which exist outside the bounds of this State but at least in this case the State is taking action which should result in ensuring that once the crude supplies arrive here we will be in a position to refine them and make them available to the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that as a result of this Bill and as a result of the trading difficulties experienced by Whitegate in the past <Col N="1220" /> there will not be an increase in the cost of fuel supplies to the Irish consumer.  If that were the net result the Bill would be counter-productive.  The Minister has already covered this in his speech and he has set aside sufficient contingency plans should such a situation arise.  At the same time it is no harm to point out this possibility at this stage.  In the Minister's speech there is information which is very heartening.  He says:</P>
    <P>Today, oil still accounts for the major proportion of Ireland's energy requirements although the impact of Kinsale gas and increased use of coal have reduced this proportion from 75 per cent in 1978 to 63 per cent in 1981.</P>
    <P>It is a relief to the economy and to the people of the country generally that this information is available.  It will cause industry generally to be more at ease knowing that we are not as dependent as we were on one source of supply.  Refining difficulties were experienced by Whitegate and there were difficulties with regard to the economic running of the refinery.  I would agree with the decision of this Government and the previous Government in relation to the acquisition of the refinery, but I would emphasise that if it were found at a later stage that these difficulties were to arise again and that as a result, the cost to the consumer would be increased, then further attention would have to be given to ascertaining by what means we could circumnavigate that problem.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we have control of the distribution of supplies once we get the crude supply into the country as opposed to waiting for an end to some kind of strike or international shipping difficulties.  We could arrive at a situation when supplies would not be available and that might be outside our control to a great extent even at this stage.  Even the best-founded plans can come up against unforeseen difficulties.  While we will have 90 days' stock at all times we will still have a situation to some extent outside our control when if large tankers found that it was not possible for them to deposit their crude supplies with us, we would still be in the same position as at <Col N="1221" /> present.  That is unfortunate.  I am sure the Minister and everybody else will endeavour to resolve matters of that nature.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the employment content.  It is important, particularly at this time when we have a recession, that the Government is taking a decision showing that it has a certain amount of belief that a sector of an industry has the power to survive.  By introducing this Bill the Government is showing that it has confidence that that sector can survive.  It is most important at the moment to be able to indicate that we have confidence in industry and in society in general as regards survival.  It is most important because there is a grave danger in times of depression and recession that the impression might go abroad that we are not capable of surviving.</P>
    <P>This Bill serves to underline that we are capable and that the Government are putting their money where their mouth is and are attempting to give good example.  I wonder if the time has come to try to ensure that we can provide stock which will last somewhat longer than at present.  I know there are all kinds of difficulties inherent in such a proposal. One would have to have more sophisticated refining techniques and perhaps greater investment.  Despite what was said in the Minister's speech, modern requirements should serve to indicate the need for greater stock-piling of such products here and would also serve to cushion the consumer against sudden price rises.  We do not want a repeat of the situation we had a number of years ago when supplies that were already in storage tanks in the country, for which lower prices had been paid by the oil companies, enabled them to gain a fairly substantial windfall.  We would not have a repeat of this if we could ensure that supplies on hand for some considerable time were sold off at the same price at which they were acquired, or at least on a sliding scale to a new price when an increase takes place or, alternatively, when a decrease takes place.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned two sources of crude oil supplies, one from the Middle <Col N="1222" /> East and one from Britain, the North Sea.  I wonder, in relation to the third source, what that source of supply will be and when it will be named.  Perhaps the Minister might go a bit further on that. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we wished to have an extra 25 days' stocks on Irish soil it would cost at least £60 million.</P>
    <P>On my copy of the speech it is £60 million, I thought the Minister said £80 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">

      <P>The last point I will make is in relation to safety standards.  It is something which needs to be heavily underlined in relation to refining and the collection and distribution of anything even remotely associated with oil or gas. We have had unfortunate instances in the past where a very high price in terms of human life was paid purely because the standard procedures in relation to safety were not observed.  It is absolutely essential that the Minister insists on the highest possible safety standards in relation to the conveyance of crude supplies, the refining and the eventual distribution of all oil supplies whether they be refined or crude.  Again I would like to thank the Minister for his very detailed introductory speech.  Such introductions do not always accompany Bills in this House.  As a result my job is much easier and I hope that ultimately his job will be much easier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. J. Daly Mr. J. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>When fuel oil came from Whitegate previously when it was opened it had a very high sulphur content.  The result was that it was very damaging to diesel driven cars.  It was very expensive for the owners of diesel cars because they had to change their oil filters at every 5,000 miles and change their lubricating oil at every 2,500 miles whereas they would normally change the lubricating at 5,000 miles and the filters at 10,000 miles. One company, the Jet Oil Company, have complied with the EEC standards. All other companies have the high sulphur content which is very injurious to diesel cars.  Diesel cars are now becoming <Col N="1223" /> very popular because of economy.  I would like the Minister to ensure that when the diesel starts to flow again from Whitegate the sulphur content will be kept to the EEC levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to thank the Senators who have contributed.  Also, I would like to thank them for their very kind and courteous remarks in relation to the handling of this Bill.  It is always my intention to supply the maximum amount of information for Senators on any Bill.  As Senator Durkan rightly remarked, it leaves the job much easier rather than having to drag the information out of somebody.  It is better to have it presented in the first place and it leaves everybody in a better position to appreciate what is involved in any particular Bill.  The first question Senator Durkan asked was about the third source of supply.  At the moment, as I said in my speech, two major sources of supply representing a third each of the requirements of Whitegate come from an existing contract with Saudi Arabia which, incidentally, in recent times has been one of the most expensive crude sources around because it was set at $34 a barrel.  While a glut of supplies has existed from many other sources the Saudi Arabians, as the mainstream of the OPEC regime, kept their prices up high.  There will be a fair amount of Saudi Arabian oil in the initial stages at Whitegate because of the existing contract.  The second source, representing approximately one third, comes from North Sea Oil.</P>
      <P>Part of the third source will be left flexible so that the INPC will be able to take full advantage of any fluctuation in the market.  If there is a very low spot price they will be able to get the best possible mix.  The aim is to get the best possible mix and at the same time ensure that we have secure sources of supply. That is really where the third source is. It may come from three or four different places, depending on the best and cheapest sources in relation to the quality of the crude that can be supplied.</P>
      <P>On safety and maintenance standards,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1224" /> I want to take this opportunity of congratulating the staff at Whitegate.  I visited Whitegate and the first thing that struck me after entering the premises was that they were European award winners of safety standards.  It has been kept at a very high safety standard level.  It is a compliment to the management and staff there.  The House can be fully assured that those safety standards will be maintained. The maintenance standards too, have been of a very high standard, even more so than when the consultants examined the refinery on behalf of the Government.  They put the lifespan, based on their assessment, at something around five or six years.  Since the Irish National Petroleum Corporation took it over a full assessment has been made.  It is ready to go back into operation in August because of the maintenance and because of the spending of reasonably modest sums on refurbishing and doing certain other jobs.  It has been possible to confirm that the lifespan of the Whitegate refinery will exceed ten years and more likely reach about 15 years, provided that the high standard of maintenance continues.</P>
    <P>We are bringing lead content down to EEC levels and we do not need to keep the derogation that we have in that respect at the moment.  The Senators will be aware that the high lead content coming out of Whitegate was of great concern to environmentalists and many others. We were always led to believe that it would cost a considerable amount of money to reduce it.  I am glad to say that the INPC, with the spending of a modest sum of money, can reduce the lead content.</P>
    <P>The sulphur content mentioned by Senator Daly is a factor of the source of crude supply.  It has little to do with the refining in Whitegate.  I would point out that North Sea Oil has a very low sulphur content.  There are other sources of crude which have a very high sulphur content, but it is a factor of the sourcing and it is one that we have in mind.  The INPC are very conscious that somebody driving a diesel car or diesel truck on the Continent can come over here with a different sulphur level in the vehicle and find that it <Col N="1225" /> does not operate as efficiently as it should.  In some cases it does not operate at all.  I have personal knowledge of this happening.  I know that Senator Daly, who is in the trade, probably had the same in mind when he raised this problem here.  It is a factor of the source of supply. INPC are well aware of it.  We want to keep it as low as possible, but in regard to the sources that are already supplying Whitegate there is no need for concern.</P>
    <P>Basically, these are most of the questions raised.  There are a few other items I was looking at while I was listening to the debate.  It would be no harm to put them on record if Senators would bear with me for a few moments.  Originally, this was an extremely important and difficult decision for any Government to take.  If you want to take the pure economic argument on this then it is very doubtful if you would come down on the side of purchasing Whitegate.  As we know there are other arguments involved.  One has only to cast one's mind back to 1979 when everybody was queueing madly at petrol pumps around the country, and if petrol could be got at any price they were prepared to pay any price for it.  We have only to cast our minds back to what the supply situation heretofore was, look at the world today and look at the Middle East.  There are two wars going on there and one has to be conscious of it.  It is a very important element in the strategic supplies to ensure that the lifeblood of the economy, which is oil, is intact, especially in an acute emergency.  That is basically why the decision comes down in favour of buying and operating Whitegate.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad that this decision, because it was made so close to election date, was a function of an election propaganda on one side or the other. This is far from being the case.  I would not like anybody to think that anybody was playing politics with it.  It was a decision taken in principle by one Government and it finally fell to me to carry it through.  The previous Government had a deadline for a decision by the companies after they decided to close last summer. The first deadline was set by the companies in October 1981, three to four <Col N="1226" /> months before any question of an election was in the air or even a prospect of one.  Considerable effort went into persuading the companies to try to extend the deadline for a further period.  An absolute guarantee had to be given by the previous Government, including an indemnification by the Government to the selling companies against any further expenses or financial outlay in order to gain this extension of time.  The decision was taken and the final date was allowed to the Government.  That was the basis on which the decision was taken and no other.</P>
    <P>It was an extremely difficult decision. There has been an extensive volume of comment by public representatives and by media analysis and commentators for over 12 months into the pros and cons of this decision.  Those opposing the decision to buy take an understandable, though, in my view, an over simple, line of argument.  They argue simply that supply security in this country is no longer pressing.  Evidently 18 months of sufficient supply in the world markets and some easement in prices are to them sufficient evidence to enable them to reach that conclusion, notwithstanding the enormous volatility of the oil market and the very unsettled state of affairs within OPEC and the uncertain state in the Middle East as well.  As the continuing tensions in the Middle East clearly illustrate to us today, we can no longer come down on that side of the argument.</P>
    <P>Secondly, those people are prepared to rest content in a situation in which we would have no refining capacity, no early increase &mdash; by that I mean within two, three or four years &mdash; in stocks of products in this country.  They would appear to be content absolutely with a supply line to this country almost totally from one other country with all the risks attendant on such a supply line, not only of labour and shipping difficulties but indeed also of shortage of supply, even temporary in any country, which might cause the withholding or restriction of supplies to this country.</P>
    <P>Those holding this simple view think and speak as if the supply to the Irish market was procured and would continue <Col N="1227" /> to be procured by the main Irish marketers, the four large companies, and a number of smaller ones in total independence of the corporate structures to which they belong internationally. They believe that supplies would come at best prevailing prices from best European and other sources.  This is not the case.  These companies are in the main, if not totally, a part of the UK oil refining and supplying industry and of their parent companies there.  There is nothing wrong with that, but it suggests a degree of further dependence concentrated on one single supply source, which increases risk.  There have been known delays of up to three or four weeks in procuring the release of restrictions for shipments from these sources in recent years when there were threats of difficulty.  It is only a very short time since customs officials in the UK chose to restrict exports to this country in the process of an industrial dispute.</P>
    <P>The same commentators seem to leave out altogether the fact that the INPC were brought into existence by a deliberate decision of the Government in 1979 for a particular purpose.  That purpose was to meet a situation, not of this Government's choosing, whereby the main oil producing states were showing a strong preference for dealing on a state to state company basis in their crude oil and other oil products.</P>
    <P>There were clear signs, perhaps slightly less now but still significant, that these countries would continue pressure to market a growing proportion of their output through their own state companies and would supply, as a matter of preference, to importing state companies such as the INPC.  Very many European and other countries have brought into being state oil companies for this and other very often admittedly productive reasons. INPC's role was to set up relationships and contracts with these state producing companies and thereby try to ensure that if cuts were made in supply to the private international marketing oil companies at least such cuts would not be made to state owned oil companies.</P>
    <P>There is no reason known to me or to <Col N="1228" /> the Government which would cause us to depart significantly from that line or point of view.  It still remains valid.  It is a brave commentator who would assert that we can now confidently leave that logic behind.  The INPC therefore intend to procure oil supplies by contracts widely placed with several such producing countries and to ensure the lay on of these supplies in the Irish market.  Because the marketing companies control the downstream to retail level of the market here the Government and INPC were content to reach an understanding with the marketing companies to put the product into the Irish market from such contracts through the systems of these oil marketing companies here.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, in a situation in which the oil companies themselves, through their international corporate structures are in production refining and marketing integrated systems it was not felt necessary to increase the INPC share of procurement which they were endeavouring to put through the oil marketers' own system beyond a modest level.  This modest level was set at a level which would give the INPC a reasonable impact on security of supplies on the one hand, a reasonable standing with the companies to whom they were providing it side by side with such companies' own direct integrated imports, and an experience and an ability to extend their activities as skilled people should state to state trading be a growing requirement in the future.</P>
    <P>Members of this House, and indeed any commentators who profess a deep interest and concern for the safety of our economy, will accept that these were very reasonable lines of approach and reasonable lines of argument.  While supplies were tight and prices tending to rise INPC supplies were welcome in the market.  It was the experience over a year-and-a-half ago that the minor companies in particular were pressing for a guarantee of 100 per cent supplies for INPC and even wished to enter into long-term contracts to ensure this 100 per cent.  Now that the supply situation and price situation have eased companies naturally wish to return to spot and other types to avail themselves of the temporary advantages which <Col N="1229" /> undoubtedly exists.  The Government, however, cannot plan and operate on what is an understandably commercial posture for an oil company or any other company trying to maximise their own self-interest.  Not only that, but there have been growing difficulties for the INPC in achieving sales in the Irish market on a voluntary basis.  Anything other than marginal supplies are virtually spot prices.  All marketing companies naturally prefer to buy along their own integrated channels and some of them may not even have the freedom to do anything else.</P>
    <P>INPC mainly dealt in crude oil contracts, refined it, admittedly at foreign refineries and put it into Irish market or systems here on a voluntary basis hitherto. The foreign refining was caused by the fact that neither the quotation nor the yield offered by the then owners of the Whitegate refinery was satisfactory to INPC.  As I said yesterday, the processing cost expected at Whitgate in the future is confidently believed to be lower per barrel than the processing quotation which had to be got at any other European refinery at the time INPC were trading as a trading company only.  That is not to say that there is not a dis-economy.</P>
    <P>The dis-economy will be in the additional cost of processing itself which, as I have said, is expected to be lower but in the divide of the barrel of crude into a higher proportion of heavy fuel oil than a more upgraded refinery would give.  It is there the main dis-economy of Whitegate is and will be until such upgrading can be made as will abate that significantly or until the relativity of heavy fuel oil price to crude and to other lighter products in the barrel improves.  The present situation is a totally abnormal one which may, indeed, persist for some time.</P>
    <P>Because questions continue to be asked as to what extra security Whitegate confers I have to say that the extra security exists in a couple of principal strands. First of all, INPC can continue to buy crude, bring it directly to Cork and refine it there.  They can store it there also and refine it later.  They will have the crude contracts which it is hoped will survive <Col N="1230" /> any cuts or any other changes.  It will avoid the risk of doing what the INPC could otherwise do, that is, procure the crude, ship it to European refineries, store it and refine it there and then ship the refined product to this country where and when it is required.</P>
    <P>This broken chain of supply and the difficulty of integrating the crude through the system of other refiners, and doubling of the shipping difficulties and the delays, is not an attractive route.  Two, three or four weeks disruption, even of 10 per cent of supply, within a modern economy could totally ruin us.  Commentators who take a different view must have already forgotten the miles of queues, loss of work hours and risk of civil disturbance in the streets which touched us within the last few years on two occasions.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there is a point that in procuring crude and being able to import it directly and refine it up to a modest ceiling within which I am pledging to act on a mandatory basis there are undoubted additional safeguards against a further aspect of disruption, that is the risk and fear of a shortage of supply.  It can cause prices to rise inordinately, and these price hikes are enormously damaging to any economy.  Both the EEC and the IEA have seen stock and security of supply as having a significant role to play in avoiding unwarranted price increases and disruption of economies.</P>
    <P>That brings me to stocks, which are worth mentioning at this point.  Again, comments made yesterday assert that the alternative to operating Whitegate is simply an increase of stocks on Irish soil.  I am prepared to admit and recognise that if there was a significant increase in stocks we would have a great cushion against several months of shortage.  The real situation, however, is that we do not have, even as of now, on Irish soil the 90-day mandatory requirement of the International Energy Agency or of the EEC, that 20 to 25 days of this is and has always been stored at depots abroad under agreement with the companies by certain foreign Governments.  That, of itself, while good, is not a perfect situation.  It is a long-term objective to have these repatriated.  Indeed, I as Minister would <Col N="1231" /> be happier if they were already repatriated, but even that repatriation would not be enough.  A further ten days or thereabouts would probably be essential. The cost of such extra stock on Irish soil would be enormous and would outweigh the cost of operating Whitegate with the potential procurement of crude from different sources even at lower stock levels which that operation at Whitegate would make possible.</P>
    <P>Every aspect of this entire question was explored with them over the past 15 months and no company were willing to increase stocks on Irish soil.  In fact, their commercial instincts prompted them, as they have said, to reduce stocks further. Secondly, the cost of the construction of tanks would be around £40 million. No company expressed agreement to do this.  They wanted a State central storage pool and this would require three to four years to build at the cost I have already said.  These facts are worth putting on the record.  A loss of Whitegate would be premature until we know if we have an Irish oil find.  I think there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic.  That is another valid reason for having held Whitegate apart from the cost.  When one compares the economic costs of buying and keeping Whitegate against what it would cost to replace the storage we would need on Irish soil there are many valid reasons for having taken the decisions we have taken.</P>
    <P>It strengthens the hands of INPC.  It gives them a stronger hand in the market place in negotiating contracts.  If they can be successful in balancing the two-thirds of security of supply with one-third at right prices there is no reason to believe that, as the consultants put it, in a period ahead the dis-economies of Whitegate cannot be reduced.  There are investment options to be looked at.  The first one will be in the region of 17 million dollars which will give us a higher output of lighter fuel and less heavy fuel costing approximately 17 million dollars which would have a pay-back period of about two years which, in economic terms, is worthwhile.  The next stage could be a coking plant which would give us an even <Col N="1232" /> higher output of higher grade product and involving a pay-back period of approximately three years.  Those are the options that are there.  I feel the right decision has been made and I think this House agrees with it.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill now before the House is a straightforward one in itself.  Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta are, as Senators will know, in most respects a company like any other.  They are incorporated under the Companies Acts, and their liability is limited by shares.  However, they are distinguished in law from other companies by the fact that their freedom of action in regulating their affairs is circumscribed by the Sugar Manufacture Acts, 1933 to 1973.  This body of legislation obliges the company to deal with a certain number of matters in their memorandum and articles of association in a manner specified by law. These matters include the voting rights attaching to shareholdings in the company, the nomination and election of directors, and the volume of the company's authorised share capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be apparent to Senators that the main concern of the Oireachtas in enacting this legislation was to provide a framework for sugar production which satisfied two criteria.  First of all, the framework had to admit of commercial operation, and had to furnish the yardsticks against which trading performance could be evaluated.  Hence, the ready choice of the format of the joint stock company.  Secondly, the framework had <Col N="1233" /> to be at once tight and transparent in view of the substantial State interest in the company.  Hence the restrictions in the legislation on what, for any other company, would be matters for themselves to settle.</P>
    <P>The present Bill, as I have said, has a purpose which is straighforward enough. It is designed, for the most part, to broaden the company's capital base, and to allow them to increase their authorised share capital from its present level of £10 million to a new level of £75 million.  This will appear to Senators to be a sudden, not to say dramatic, increase, and I will come back to the reasons underlying it in a moment.  Before doing so, however, I think it would be useful to place a number of considerations before the House.</P>
    <P>First of all, no one who has had anything to do with the development of argiculture in Ireland can fail to be impressed with the role that the company have played in their 50 years of existence. They have been in the forefront of change and innovation for most, if not all, of the adult lives of most living Irishmen.  They have spearheaded the creation of most of the services that make it possible for the agricultural sector of the economy to function.  In so doing, they have been a major employer, building on native capital and resources the foundations of a local and regional economy whose effects are felt well beyond the sugar industry itself.</P>
    <P>Over those 50 years, the company have turned in a profit on all but a very few occasions.  In fact, the majority of those occasions have presented themselves over the past two or three years, and it is in the climate of the past two or three years that the roots of the company's difficulties are to be found.</P>
    <P>What those difficulties are has already been the subject of examination and debate in this House.  Some 16 months ago, the Seanad debated the affairs of the sugar company, using as a basis an excellent and informative report from the Joint Committe on State-Sponsored Bodies. That report has, I believe, proved to be a vindication of the Joint Committee's establishment.  Apart from its clarity and conciseness, it is the starting point of the <Col N="1234" /> review of the company's affairs that has culminated in the Bill which the House is now discussing.</P>
    <P>To place clearly on record just what the company's problems are, I think that a brief review of the report's contents and recommendations will be of value to the House.  Senators will remember that the Joint Committee began their examination of the company's affairs at a time when a series of inter-related problems were coming to a head.  The most prominent of these was an anticipated loss in the year ending September 1980 of substantial proportions.</P>
    <P>As the committee noted, the company had been implementing a substantial programme of capital investment and plant renewal since 1975.  Total capital investment since 1975 had amounted to £70 million, financed almost entirely from borrowings from commercial financial institutions.  The company's purpose in undertaking the investments was to achieve nothing less than the survival of the sugar industry.  Plant was obsolescent, and there was a risk that the efficiency of the company's production units would be seriously impaired at a very bad time.  The committee's report was unambiguous in pointing out the financial consequences of this state of affairs.  It stated unequivocally that large recurrent interest charges were constituting a serious drain on the company's resources.</P>
    <P>The debt-equity ratio, the committee noted, was in excess of commercial norms to an unusual degree, and interest charges had to be met from operating profit.  The committee pointed out that a large company in the private sector would long since have taken steps to raise additinal capital to correct this state of affairs. The committee accepted that the situation should not continue.  They expressly supported the company's view, put to them during their hearings, that some £25 million of new equity capital was needed as a first step.  They believed that further calls would have to be made on Exchequer funding in future years in order to ensure the development of a prudent and stable capital structure for the company.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the company's very real financial problems, the committee <Col N="1235" /> did not feel justified in attributing all of the current difficulties to them.  Among the causes of the reversal in the company's fortunes, they identified unfavourable price developments on the cost front, and the effects of the recession on demand in the company's markets.  However, the committee made it quite clear that the principal solution lay in Government action to correct the debt-equity imbalance.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the committee's report was considered by the Seanad in early 1981, and Senators contributed substantially to the reflections that were going on both in the company and in the Government Departments concerned.  The Tánaiste, who was Minister for Agriculture at the time, informed the House that the report was the basis for that reflection, and that he would be inviting the company to put their views to him on the means by which full viability might be restored rapidly to the company.</P>
    <P>In May 1981 the company responded. They stressed, as they had to the Joint Committee, the need for new capital. They had three purposes in mind in doing so.  First, they emphasised the need to deal with the erosion of the company's financial base brought about by continuing food sector losses, and by the necessary investment being carried out on the sugar side.  Secondly, they pressed the need to continue with the modernisation programme.  Thirdly, they put the point that the debt-equity ratio had to be brought more into line with commercial norms.  For these three reasons, the company asked that their equity capital be brought up to the level of £75 million.</P>
    <P>After examination in my Department, the company's response fell to be considered in July 1981 by the Coalition Government.  That Government, quite rightly in my view, decided in principle to make new capital available to the company, but reserved a decision on the amount, manner and timing of the capital injection until they obtained the results of an independent examination of the company's financial affairs to be carried out by a firm of consultants.  In this way the company's creditors were reassured <Col N="1236" /> as to the Government's intentions, while the hasty commitment of public money, which might not have taken account of all the factors involved, would be avoided.</P>
    <P>In March of this year the consultants reported, and, as a result, the Government believe they are now in a position to make a rational and considered response to the company's needs.  They have decided therefore to make £30 million available to the company in 1982.  They anticipated that the need for further capital may arise over the coming three or four years.  Accordingly, they are proposing enabling authority for this in the present Bill, in line with the usual practice for Central Fund issues of this kind.</P>
    <P>I will now come back, as I said I would, to the substance of the Bill before the House.  I said earlier that the increase in the legal limit of the company's authorised share capital would perhaps strike Senators as sudden and dramatic.  It will put the increase into perspective if we recall that the company's authorised share capital has been at £10 million since 1973.  In 1973 the company employed fixed assets valued at some £6.3 million.  In 1981 that figure was £38 million.  As the company's modernisation programme progresses, that figure will also increase.  Had the statutory limit on the company's authorised share capital not existed, there would no doubt have been a gradual adjustment of the company's capital structure to bring the gearing ratio back into line with commercial norms.</P>
    <P>The statutory limit does exist, and only the Oireachtas can expand it.  In amending it, the Oireachtas is sanctioning a process which, in a commercial concern, would have begun some six or seven years ago, and, is therefore, in a certain sense allowing the company to get on with a backlog in their financial restructuring.  A certain measure of flexibility for future years is also being given.  Were it not for the confidence that lenders have in the State sector, this would have proved problematic for the company.  As it happens, however, there has never been any serious doubt about the Government's commitment to the company as a shareholder and as a sponsor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> The £30 million which the Government propose to make available in 1982 will be subject to conditions.  The main one will be the submission by the company of a clear and specific programme for the rationalisation of their food processing activities and of the beet-growing and sugar industry.  I should like to emphasise that it is for the company to determine the details of that plan, and to demonstrate to me that is is satisfactory.  The yardstick will be that of increasing overall efficiency with a special eye on the restoration of financial balance to the company's affairs.</P>
    <P>The figure of £75 million does not imply an immediate injection of that amount.  It is the kind of figure at which the company's share capital might reasonably be set once the investments they have undertaken are completed.  It represents the share capital some years hence of a sugar company with up-to-date plant and assets, with their sails set for the kind of competitive operation which characterised their earlier years.</P>
    <P>Expansion for a food processing concern can only take place if their suppliers are committed to it as well.  It is disappointing that our EEC sugar production A quota of 182,000 tonnes has hardly been reached in any recent campaigns. Renegotiation of production quotas is only two years away.  If we do not fill our existing quota, we are undermining our own position in that re-negotiation. There is, therefore, a very heavy onus on farmers.  We must be able to preserve our slice of the action if the sugar company are to survive.</P>
    <P>If we apply this reasoning to the Tuam factory, it still holds good.  In deciding that the factory should remain open, the Government had two things in mind. First of all, they recognised the factory's pivotal position in the regional economy of Connacht.  Secondly, they wished to see to it that agriculture in the west &mdash; in this instance beet-growing &mdash; has the greatest number of outlets possible.</P>
    <P>Finally, as far as food processing is concerned, we must recognise that the hopes of the early sixties have not been realised.  Food processing in the past few years has been at the root of the company's <Col N="1238" /> inability to turn in consistent profits with which to fund re-investment.  In saying this, I do not wish it to be thought that the Government have doubts about the future of food processing as a company activity.  They have not.  There are problems, as the joint committee noted. The home market is small, and export markets are subject to fierce competition from trans-national enterprises.  The solution for the food division lies in developing a strategy suitable for the scale of their operations in order to turn their activities around.  The need to do this as soon as possible is apparent when we consider that this year, for the third year running, losses will be in the £12 million bracket.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House limits itself to amending certain financial provisions of the Acts.  Its immediate function is to authorise the Minister for Finance to make certain issues out of the central Fund.  This authority will be drawn on in 1982 to the extent of advancing £30 million to the company.  Future advances will be made in accordance with the circumstances then prevailing.</P>
    <P>The main shareholder in the Sugar Company is the State.  The main beneficiary of those holdings when profits are returned is the State.  In passing this Bill into law, the Oireachtas will be enabling the Exchequer to perform a duty which lies upon shareholders and to correct the under-capitalisation which besets the company at present.  The State is now, as it has been in the past, a willing shareholder, and the Government have no wish to change that.  Therefore I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Bill is welcome for a number of important reasons.  One of the most important reasons referred to by the Minister is the very difficult if not impossible position in which the Irish Sugar Company could find themselves if this capitalisation programme were not introduced at this time.  There are as number of points which need to be clarified. I will be posing a few questions as I proceed which the Minister can answer for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> However, first I should like to stress that the Irish Sugar Company and their related industries are extremely important to us.  Appoximatedly 3,000 persons are employed by the company.  In excess of 7,000 farmers are growing been and, in addition, several thousand persons are working in areas ancillary to the sugar, beet and vegetable industries, particularly in the area of fertilisers, haulage, and so on.  The importance of this industry to the nation could not be over-emphasised. It is important that £70 million is saved to the Exchequer by way of imports by the Irish Sugar Company. Indeed if you take into account byproducts, you are talking about £100 million as a saving in imports.  This highlights the importance of the company and the enormity of the situation should anything happen.</P>
    <P>I concur with the Minister in his concern about our not reaching the A quota figure of 182,000 tonnes.  This is extremely serious for Ireland because, in a relatively short time now, we will be renegotiating our quota and if we have not reached 182,000 tonnes that will put us in a position of great weakness, in any negotiations for holding to that figure, if not, indeed, increasing it.  I would urge all concerned with the industry at every level, at farming level, at processing level, and at marketing level, to combine together solidly to ensure that we reach the A quota of 182,000 tonnes.  It is extremely important and we must not lose sight of it.  I will be be coming back to it again.</P>
    <P>Acreage can be increased.  Evidence of this is shown very positively in the Tuam factory catchment area.  This year the acreage is 7,600, and that represents an increase of 25 per cent on last year's acreage.  Last year's acreage represented a 50 per cent increase on the year prior to that.  I believe, therefore, that the acreage can be increased.  When I am talking about Tuam, it might be appropriate to say that we on this side of the House are confident that the acreage required for the continuation of the Tuam factory will be arrived at.  That is a very important factor.  The figure is <Col N="1240" /> 10,000 acres and perhaps it will be an increasing figure as time progresses.</P>
    <P>What proportion of the proposed allocation of £30 million is earmarked for the Tuam factory?  There is no point in getting the acreage up to the level required if efficiency at factory level is not brought into line.  I have been disturbed by information which I consider to be reliable that not much of the £30 million we are talking about here today is earmarked for the Tuam development.  I am talking about the updating of the Tuam factory. I emphasise &ldquo;updating&rdquo; because over a long number of years the Tuam factory was allowed to be run down to a very serious level.  It is essential, therefore, that we should get the beet for the Tuam factory and that we should also update the factory and bring it into line with processing methods and efficiency levels of 1982 and the years ensuing.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as stated by the Minister, is designed to make certain that the company are capitalised.  At the moment we all accept that they are totally under-capitalised. People with a reasonable business-like approach must accept that they have to get capital.  I referred earlier to the A quota.  We have never reached that quota of 182,000 tonnes.  At the moment we have 88,000 acres of beet growing, and the optimum figure will be about 90,000 acres.  That would be a fluctuating figure, but we must get to that position pretty quickly.  There is a great deal more to this than is apparent at first examination.  We are faced with a very serious inflation situation, and a very serious interest rate situation, both of which are very much inter-related. Therefore, the margin to the grower of beet is not very attractive.  In fact, this is one of our problems.  Beet as a cash crop is very important to the Irish farmer.  For the past 50 years it has represented a very fundamental and integral part of the Irish farming scene.  For many years the Irish Sugar Company have acted as a lending institution for their customers.  Credit was made available on a seasonal basis to growers, and so on.  It must be acknowledged that the sugar company have been in a profit making situation for most of their existence, until the past few years <Col N="1241" /> when they ran into extremely serious difficulties. It is no harm to remark that in 1980 they had a loss making position of £11.2 million, in 1981 a loss making position of £12 million, followed in 1982 by an expected loss making position of about £12 million.  That is the kind of loss making situation which has been developing in the past number of years, from a position where the company were operating quite effectively and quite well.  I accept that there are underlying reasons for this. There are explanations.  The company borrowed and then got caught up in an inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>With regard to this allocation for 1982, £30 million is really the issue at stake because the other £35 million is a matter for the future.  It is an allocation for the years to come.  In 1982 it is proposed that £30 million should be allocated to the Irish Sugar Company.  I have already referred to the disturbing information which I received that Tuam was not earmarked for very much of this.  I hope the Minister will say this is not the case.  I will be very pleased if he does because, I feel very strongly that the Tuam factory has got to be updated in addition to getting those extra acres of beet which I am confident the Tuam factory area will provide.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that very positive conditions are attached to this allocation of £30 million in 1982.  It must be based on a very precise programme.  It is not clear to me yet, but I understand it is an anticipated programme rather than an actual programme.  It would have been far better if we were talking about an actual programme for the allocation of moneys rather than an anticipated programme. Since we are talking about an anticipated programme, I hope it will be totally and fully examined and ratified, and not accepted until all the important requirements are met.</P>
    <P>On this point it is no harm to mention that the recent allegations &mdash; indeed stronger than allegations &mdash; about the misappropriation of funds within the Irish Sugar Company have led to very disturbed feelings.  If we are investing this substantial amount of money, we want to make certain that what occurred <Col N="1242" /> recently, when some millions of pounds were done away with and disappeared, will not recur.  I would go further and say that, in semi-State bodies generally, extreme care must be taken to ensure that it never happens again.</P>
    <P>Apart from the amount of money involved &mdash; and the money was substantial &mdash; the fact that it could happen, and that some person or persons could pocket the money and get away with it and cause the sugar company to lose further vast amounts of money, is extremely important. I urge the Minister and the Government to assure us that there will never be a recurrence of that, and that every appropriate step will be taken in that regard.  It would be irresponsible not to state that the internal auditing management of the sugar company who allowed that to occur leave a great deal to be desired.</P>
    <P>In all businesses today we must aspire to the best business and management practices possible.  These are very much warranted in a highly competitive situation. Unfortunately we have no evidence of this as of now in the Irish Sugar Company. This needs to be corrected.  I do not want to labour that point but, at the same time, it is causing a disturbance in the minds of people, in the mind of the ordinary taxpayer, that such a development could occur and that it could have been going on over a long period of time, unknown to the management and board of the Irish Sugar Company.  What steps will be taken to avoid a recurrence of that situation in the Irish Sugar Company and in other semi-State bodies?</P>
    <P>I have already said that inflation will dictate whether farmers will continue to grow beet.  This is true whether it be in Carlow, Kilkenny, Wexford or the west.  This is a very important factor.  In this Bill we are talking about 88,000 acres, 90,000 acres used for tillage.  We are talking about farming right across the spectrum.  The whole farming problem and its present very serious situation is going to militate against our achieving the beet acreage we would all like to see. I fully support the Bill.  I would leave in <Col N="1243" /> those qualifications I mentioned and I expect the Minister to satisfy me on that.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to note that since 1976 to 1979 the company invested £40 million of non-Government money.  Apart from the number of persons who work directly in the company, the 3,000 and 7,000 growers, and the other people who work in ancillary industries, the Sugar Company have a very important business dimension in at least four towns &mdash; Tuam, Carlow, Thurles and Mallow.  I do not think it is easy to quantify the value a thriving prosperous sugar company is to our economy and to our life.</P>
    <P>There is one obvious and very great weakness in the company, and that is Erin Foods.  Unfortunately, Erin Foods, which I see as a innovation that brought a new technology into farming, have been seriously hit by inflation and high interest levels.  We import foodstuffs costing about £650 million and a substantial amount of that is in the area of vegetables. The products of Erin Foods are not holding their own in the Irish market, not to mention the difficulties they are having abroad because of inflation, interest rates and lack of competitiveness generally. The promotion of their products in Irish supermarkets leaves a lot to be desired. It is obvious that the Erin Foods product is not pushed to the fore as much as it ought to be.  If this situation is corrected it will help enormously, because the home market is most important for any product.  There is little point spending a lot of money in foreign promotions if we neglect our home market.  I submit that the home market for vegetables could be a great deal better.  Greater co-ordination of effort would ensure that vegetables could be grown here the whole year round especially if the market was made economically attractive and this would help to solve our financial problems.</P>
    <P>Beet is part of a very important rotation system in farming.  Beet, cereals, grass, potatoes, a whole range of crops fit into a network where there is an interdependence. When we talk about beet and vegetable growing, we are talking about a wider scenario &mdash; tillage and grassland.  There is no doubt that a cessation <Col N="1244" /> of the Sugar Company's activities, which would be on the cards without this injection of capital, could be very serious.</P>
    <P>I referred to our employment situation. Our import situation is very serious. The factories in various towns have social and business dimensions which cannot be easily quantified.  There are 300 full-time workers in the town of Tuam.  If you were to reckon that there are four or five persons per household, you are talking perhaps about 1,500 persons directly affected by that factory.  This shows the importance of making certain that the Tuam factory is kept in existence but it will not be kept in existence just by talking about growing more beet.  That is one very important dimension.  If we are totally committed to a promotions campaign, I am certain the acreage will be achieved.  We have many seasonal workers in Tuam, about 400 at present. This means there are about 700 persons working in the Tuam factory, either full-time or part-time, and this means there are thousands of people directly affected by the Tuam factory, not to mention all those engaged in ancillary businesses.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Tuam factory because it has been spoken about in recent times. I am concerned that the onus will be put on farmers to grow beet.  If they do not people may say they failed in their responsibilities and duties.  I say quite honestly that we must make certain that the factory receives a proportionate amount of that £30 million being considered for the Irish Sugar Company this year.  I want to emphasise very strongly that the Minister ought to inform this House how that £30 million is being allocated. I urge that it be allocated only under the strictest and severest supervision, and that it should be done on a proportionate basis.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how it is proposed to spend the extra £35 million.  I am satisfied that this money is necessary.  I fully support the Bill but I would like to know the breakdown of that money.  I would be satisfied if I was told a substantial amount of that money is earmarked for the Tuam factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit.  Ní fhaca mé sa Teach seo cheana é agus cuirim fíor chaoin fáilte roimhe agus guím rath Dé ar féin agus ar a chuid oibre.</P>
      <P>This Bill concerns one of our oldest and best loved companies &mdash; Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, a company with a chequered history of which we are all very proud.  It has been in existence for over 50 years.  God alone knows the amount of good that company have done for our people, not alone the farmers, the workers in the factories in the four towns already mentioned by Senator Hourigan, but those who helped to keep the system going&mdash;lorry drivers, helpers, petrol suppliers and so on.  It was a blessing when this company came into existence and those factories were established.  But they kept their heads above water until comparatively recently.  It is very sad to relate that in recent years something appears to have gone wrong.  What happened?  Was it the times?  For the last three or four years they have been running at losses of at least an average of £12 million a year. One is tempted to ask what are the causes of that unhappy position.</P>
      <P>The company have diversified their activities.  While some are holding their own or making a profit, if appears that the main industries &mdash; the sugar industry, the food processing industry and the engineering industry &mdash; have not been going well for some time.  It is all right to say management could be wrong or workers could be wrong, or maybe it is a combination of both.  I do not know.  Are the factories being kept up to date? How do they compare with similar factories on the continent?  These are points the Minister may be able to answer.  Management should take cognisance of this point and keep in touch with the most up-to-date factories on the continent. Since our entry into the EEC we are in competition with the most skilled operatives in the world.  Losses undoubtedly are due to a large extent to higher interest rates.  That affects all industries.  Higher labour costs, lower sales, possibly redundancies and early retirement payments and the inevitable industrial disputes could be factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> I am worried about the losses in the food processing industry.  We have the conditions necessary to produce the finest packaged food in the world.  We have a climate suitable for vegetables, fruit and potatoes.  Therefore why can we not grow this produce?</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan and the Minister referred to the lack of demand for these products on the home market.  If we do not sell our own manufactured goods here how can we expect to sell them abroad?  Somebody might say that is all very fine, but why are they not displayed prominently?  Why are they not promoted well enough?  Maybe the fault lies there, but this is something we will have to face up to.  Somebody told me recently that we spend £650 million a year on imported foodstuffs.  If so, it is a crying scandal.  It shows what could be done if we grew our own food and sold it on the home market.  It would turn the tables upside down as far as excess imports and our external debt are concerned.  One of the companies that could help considerably in this area is Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to support this Bill.  I welcome it.  The money is wanted and I hope it will be put to the best advantage. The Minister very wisely in his address said:</P>
    <P>The present Bill is designed for the most part to broaden the company's capital base and to allow it to increase its authorised share of capital from its present level of £10 million to a new level of £75 million.</P>
    <P>He observed that it may appear to be a dramatic increase, and it does and I have no doubt that it is absolutely necessary. I hope an effort will be made to bring about an improvement in the sales of sugar and food processed by Erin Foods. These are two key elements.  Unless we improve the position disaster will strike again.  I join with Senator Hourigan in expressing the hope that never again will such a scandal occur in the running of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  It is extraordinary that such a thing could happen. We are living in extraordinary times when people who have too much brains <Col N="1247" /> but badly use them, can do what was done.  I hope that such a thing never happens again and that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann will continue the work they have been doing since they were established some years ago.  I wish them every success in their efforts to keep employment at a very high level in the sugar beet industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill refers to a very long established and, until recently, a very efficient and profit making company. I accept the need for the increase in share capital from £10 million upwards, but the limit of £75 million leaves us to ask certain questions.  We are aware that £30 million of this capital is to be expended almost immediately to meet current losses.  As I have said on a number of occasions, State and semi-State bodies should be subject to the highest possible standards of accountancy and, at the same time, public accountability. Unlike the two previous speakers I feel there is now a very urgent need for a tightening of the financial management structures and this was alluded to by Senator Hourigan and Senator Cranitch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Members of this House would be very concerned if action was not taken by the Minister and by the board of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to ensure that there is not a repetition of the unfortunate scandal that arose some time ago in relation to that company.  It would appear to us that the financial and the sales branches of the firm were operating what appeared to be a brokerage both in the areas of selling and of finance.  It would have very serious consequences if we were to allow the opportunity to pass without severely censuring the company for allowing the operation of this type of scheme.  I insist that the Minister should impress upon the company the reservations raised in relation to that matter in this House.  He should extract from the company an undertaking that there will be no recurrence.  That is all I have to say in relation to that unfortunate scandal. We are dealing with public funds, taxpayers' money, and where such money is involved we must at all times ensure that <Col N="1248" /> we have the highest possible degree of accountability.</P>
    <P>The company should have been in a position to react somewhat quicker than they did to what was happening.  This seems to be a feature of company policy, or lack of policy, in the sense, as the Minister has also said, the increased share capital the firm are now seeking should have been sought some years ago. I wonder if requests were made for permission to increase share capital previously? If they were not, why?  If the company proposed to expand and to modernise their obsolete plant, then obviously they should have sought permission particularly in view of the fluctuations in the economy and in the money market generally.  I would have thought that the company would have sought permission much sooner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the company are embarking on modernisation of their plant.  Like Senator Hourigan, I strongly urge that modernisation of plant should take place also in the Tuam plant because that factory is an integral part of the sugar processing system in this country and it has been for quite a number of years.  It has provided both a social and an economic element in the past.  I see no reason why it cannot continue to do so in the future, provided supplies are made available from the grower and that when the supplies are available they will be processed as quickly as possible.  We should not allow a situation to recur as happened some years ago when, because of an industrial dispute at a crucial time in the harvesting cycle, supplies had to be left in the ground.  Certainly they were not processed with the greatest possible speed and the result to the grower was extremely unfortunate and financially damaging.  I did not blame the workers in that case but I would draw some attention to the fact that management should have recognised that there was a problem in existence and that it was likely to culminate in a serious problem when the harvesting of the crop took place.  That is what happened and the result at that time was disastrous.  That is one of the reasons for the decrease in beet growing in certain parts of the country.  Quite a number of <Col N="1249" /> irate growers still refer very heatedly to that to this day.</P>
    <P>The other area that needs to be looked at, and already it has been referred to on a number of occasions, is food processing. I welcome the fact that the Irish Sugar Company have sought over the years to diversify their enterprises.  They were singularly successful in doing so particularly in relation to machinery manufacture.  That sector of the company are to be congratulated for the successful fashion in which they undertook their enterprise and they have found worldwide recognition for it.  We hope that some of the money now being channelled into the company will be allocated towards research, the modernisation of those elements of the plant and also the expansion of those elements of the machinery manufacturing plant.  It is also essential that sufficient funds will be made available to ensure that the personnel who have the necessary qualifications are attracted into the firm and are given reasonable scope to produce the machines that are required today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the necessity to encourage diversification, with particular reference to the machinery manufacturing sector.  I have already dealt with that sufficiently and I wish to turn momentarily to the food processing sector.  It was, unfortunately, in this particular sector that the difficulties arose which have already been aired in this House this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> In relation to food processing, it is essential that the most modern packaging, presentation and sales techniques be employed.  The consumer has very quickly realised that the visual impact of a particular product has tremendous significance&mdash;perhaps unfortunately also &mdash; and as a result many of the items which are now displayed in our shops, stores and supermarkets, which are manufactured and processed outside the country, are far more eye-catching and far better presented than many of the products we process at home.  As the previous speakers mentioned, it is ridiculous to expect the people in the countries to which we export to support Irish produce if we have not the patriotism and the will to support our own industries.</P>
    <P>This is particularly relevant in the case of processed foods.  There are quite a number of foods being processed at present. We have many varieties of peas imported which have been very well marketed in this country, which were in competition with our own products and whose sales, I would contend, are gaining in momentum.  We have a number of firms processing potatoes.  Again, they were successful in cornering a substantial slice of the Irish market before we recognised that there was a possibility there for Irish processing to get in on the act, and to give employment at home, and, indeed, to produce a better product. It only remains, again, for the sales and the presentation techniques which are already in evidence in other countries to be adopted by Irish manufacturers in order to ensure the success of diversification in this area.</P>
    <P>The Tuam sugar factory has already been referred to.  I believe it has been a vibrant social and economic entity in the past and I see no reason why it cannot continue to be that in the future, provided that the raw materials are produced and made available to us.  At the same time I hope that the modernisation of the plant which is necessary will be undertaken to ensure that the company can continue to operate in Tuam on a viable basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> There has been some criticism of the Irish Sugar Company this evening, and it is justified, but I would not like it to go out from this House that we are here just to criticise.  The firm has given long and faithful service.  It has come upon rather hard times, in fact extremely hard times it would appear from the continued losses, but we should have sufficient confidence in Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to ensure that the funds are made available for it to continue in operation, to expand its operations and to diversify where possible. As long as supplies of sugar beet are available for any of its factories we should ensure that they are allowed to operate and, at the same time, we should make sure that the funds which we hope are incorporated in the present Bill are made available to the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it will enable the Irish Sugar Company to correct this situation of under-capitalisation which has been forced on it for a variety of reasons.  I feel that this Bill will give it a new lease of life.  Since 1976 the company has spent over £50 million in modernising its factories, reducing its oil dependence and increasing output.  Unfortunately, during the past years the company has been unable to meet the full quota of 182,000 tonnes allocated by the EEC and this is an area on which a lot of emphasis will have to be placed.  The farmers will have to meet the responsibilities in this direction. It is important that we meet our quotas, because when the Minister goes back to negotiate these quotas in the future if we have not met them it will make the task very difficult for him. There has been a very good response to <Col N="1253" /> this appeal in the Tuam area.  I am glad to say that more than 7,000 tonnes have been grown over the past year, an increase of 25 per cent and over two years an increase of 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>Since the company was founded 50 years ago it received £5.5 million from the State, a pittance when one considers the employment the company is giving in the area.  Three thousand people are directly employed in the factories.  Again, a very large number of people are involved in haulage, contracting, selling fertilisers, seeds and so on and 7,000 farmers are growing beet for the factories. So one could say that this £30 million is a very sound investment in our economy.</P>
      <P>The Sugar Company are indeed going through a rough patch at the moment. Even with the injection of this money, things will be tough for the years ahead. Basically their problem is inflation, which leaves them no longer as competitive as they should be.  The factories have been modernised, there has been replacement machinery and new silos have been acquired.  This now leaves the company ready to tackle the years ahead with confidence. Except for the last two years, the company has consistently shown a profit and I believe that with this sort of help they can do so in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>In the line of technology the Irish Sugar Company has developed in this country the only successful beet harvester perfected for Irish conditions and adaptable to small and large acreages.  It is sad to think that the people involved in this project are now working on the factory floor because of the shortage of funds.  I hope that this money will get to them immediately so that they can get on with the good work.</P>
      <P>As a housewife I urge the Minister to cut down on the importation of French sugar which we find in our supermarkets at the moment.  I feel that there is no need for this sugar to be coming into the country.  We are producing excellent sugar ourselves, and I certainly intend to buy Irish sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Erin Foods are making quality products and are giving employment to our people.  The price is very competitive <Col N="1254" /> and the products are certainly good and appetising.  I feel, however, that they are not getting the prominence in supermarkets that they deserve.  I would like to see some sort of promotion launched to increase the sales and give them a greater slice of the market.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill because I appreciate the difficult situation the company find themselves in.  Like everyone else, I am concerned that the Sugar Company can continue to carry on their activities in the interests of the workers and the farmers.  The importance of having a major sugar industry and an expanded food industry in the country cannot be over-emphasised.  I am delighted that this money is forthcoming and I am sure it will be put to very good use.  I welcome the Bill and sincerely hope it will be put into operation immediately.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a total £30 million has been allocated to semi-State bodies in 1982.  We are talking about an allocation of £30 million to the Irish Sugar Company.  I am aware that other semi-State bodies are looking for funds, so my question is where will this money be found or will the other semi-State bodies have to go without funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCowen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Cowen) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Cowen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express thanks to the Senators for their welcome of this Bill and to those who contributed to this debate.  I would also like to thank the Senators who welcomed me here for the first time as Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hourigan referred to the use of the £30 million.  I have said that the Sugar Company is to submit a plan to improve its efficiency and I will be looking closely at that plan to see that it is effective and workable.  Of course the company is already modernising its plants but it is having to do so on money borrowed from commercial lenders.  This Bill <Col N="1255" /> will remedy that situation.  It is up to the company to give me its plans for improved efficiency before I allocate the £30 million.  I have not earmarked any of the £30 million in advance.  In relation to Senator Hourigan's remarks on earmarking funds for particular factories, there is a misunderstanding here.  None of the capital to be advanced is earmarked. Thirty million pounds is not project expenditure or grant aid.  It is the price the State is paying for the assets that increased shareholding in the company constitutes.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan was also concerned about beet acreage and while urging all concerned to make every effort to reach our A quota of 182,000 tonnes, he mentioned that this has never been achieved. In fact, the A quota has been filled on two previous occasions, which goes to prove that it is an objective which can be realised and which has been realised in the past.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan also referred to the Erin Foods fraud.  I can tell him that the circumstances of the fraud have already been established by an independent firm of auditors specially engaged by the company for that purpose.  Their report, furnished to the board in June 1980, made recommendations on improved financial control, and these have been implemented by the company.  The firm of independent auditors who investigated the fraud were satisfied that no one in the company, other than the two persons charged, were involved and no suspicion should attach to anyone else.</P>
    <P>It is clear, as Senator Hourigan has said, that Erin Foods, which I regard as an integral part of the Sugar Company, is having difficulties in competition.  The Government believe that food processing has a future within the Sugar Company and that the measure now before the House will help to make it more competitive. To Senator Cranitch I would say that there is a need to improve productivity in our sugar factories and that is the aim of the company's ongoing modernisation programme.  It is one of the reasons why the present Bill is needed.  I, <Col N="1256" /> too, look to the company to reduce our dependence on food imports.</P>
    <P>I should like to take up a point made by Senator Durkan.  I mentioned earlier that the legislation imposes limits on the company's freedom of action.  I also mentioned that in an ordinary company financial restructuring would have begun to take place some time ago.  I then said that because of the State's known commitment this was not a problem for lenders. What has made the difference is the heavy losses of the past two or three years and the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies took account of this as soon as it became evident.  I think it is incorrect to impute lack of foresight to the management in this matter.  The facts do not bear out that imputation.</P>
    <P>Senator Hannon was concerned, naturally, with the points made by previous speakers as far as food processing is concerned. I would like to assure Senator Durkan that there is no problem about the availability of the £30 million.  It is there and it will be allocated provided the plan to be submitted by the company is satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The Government have a commitment to retain the Tuam factory. As I pointed out in my reply, none of this £30 million is earmarked for any particular industry within the functioning of the company itself.  Naturally, Tuam will <Col N="1257" /> get its fair share of this money on the basis that it will remain open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point that Tuam is a special circumstance in so far as it is a very run-down factory, and I think that would be accepted by all.  For that reason, its requirement and the urgency of its need for money would be far greater than in other cases.  Perhaps the Minister could throw some light on this because we are led to believe that money is being made available to Tuam. May I clarify our position on the Tuam factory situation?  It is that provided the acreage of beet is grown in the Tuam catchment area, the factory will and should be kept open.  Coupled with that, one must have efficient means to process the beet.  That is my question and the Minister might be able to enlighten me a little more fully on the matter.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald) Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Gene Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>My first duty is to thank very sincerely all the Senators who <Col N="1258" /> contributed to the Second Stage debate on the Bill establishing the National Heritage Council.  It is an indication of the interest in the measure when there were so many contributors.  I have no doubt that those who spoke expressed a keen and knowledgeable interest in the Bill itself, in the establishment of the council, what its functions should be and how best it could be used to preserve, promote and foster our heritage.</P>
      <P>In my introductory speech I invited Senators to make comments or suggestions for improvement.  I indicated at that time that my mind was by no means closed as to the content of the Bill, because I share the views expressed by many Senators that it is a type of Bill that can be improved by all the contributions made and by taking note and cognisance of many of the points made.  Therefore, I am grateful for the contributions, and the helpful and learned suggestions made are worthy of careful thought.  Some very detailed points about individual sections of the Bill were made and perhaps it might be more appropriate to consider them at Committee Stage when we will have an opportunity of discussing them in greater detail.  However, some more general points were made by all speakers and I will deal with them later.  Before doing so, I would like to clarify some general aspects of the proposed council.</P>
      <P>The concept of a National Heritage Council was not simply plucked out of the air, and I want to dispel any doubt in anybody's mind that that was the case. The Government arrived at the conclusion that this was the best means of preserving and protecting our heritage only after a long and careful examination and consideration of all the possible options. As I indicated already, this conclusion by the Government was not meant to imply that the job was not being well done up to this by the relevant parts of the civil service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opening speech I complimented the agencies, and I repeat those compliments. It can be taken as an indication of the Government's satisfaction with the work of the civil servants involved that in the main they will continue to carry out this work in the future under the aegis of <Col N="1259" /> the council that will be established by means of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The important new factor will, of course be the council.  It is extremely important in itself and it will consist of 15 expert and interested people selected by the Government.  These people will bring their expertise and their enthusiasm to bear on the important task to be assigned to them.  In order to enable them to do this with the utmost effectiveness, it was felt that it would be preferable to give the council the type of independent status associated with non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  I want to assure Members of the House that the calibre of people to be selected will be specifically related to the tasks the council will be expected to perform in an efficient and competent way.  I see the establishment of the council as being the beginning of a new era.</P>
    <P>Large administrative bodies generally have a multitude of objectives.  It is true of Government Departments as it is of other large organisations and functions that matters relating to our heritage tend to be dealt with on the periphery, being in the main marginal to a Department's principal objectives.  Here the council will have as its primary function the preservation, protection and promotion of our heritage.</P>
    <P>The Government's intention was to set up a body which would concentrate solely on heritage matters.  The council will bring together under one roof, as it were, a number of disparate elements of the Government's administrative machine which are concerned with like matters. This, of itself, should lead to greater effectiveness.  The bringing together of related heritage functions into one organisation should help to more clearly identify the national heritage in the public mind.  The task of protecting and preserving our heritage is not simply a matter for the Government alone but it is one that should involve all the people of this country.  The mere fact of having that council will bring more clearly to people's minds the necessity to preserve what is <Col N="1260" /> such an important element of our country's past.</P>
    <P>As is clear from the Bill, the proposed council will not be concerned with all aspects of our national heritage and culture. A number of very important aspects such as our language, literature and music are not mentioned in the Bill and it is not intended that they will be the concern of this council.  The Bill contains a basic framework which permits a council to be established and certain functions related to our physical heritage to be assigned to the council.  Further functions can be assigned later on by way of order.  This Bill does not, therefore, contain the last words of the Government on national heritage.  As I said earlier I believe that it represents the beginning of a new and a very significant era.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the Government's commitment to the archaeological and natural heritage in the Bill before the House should not be taken as any lessening of commitment to other equally important elements of our cultural heritage. We will continue to work strenuously for the preservation and development of our total cultural heritage.  By concentrating the charter the council now proposed on our physical heritage, it will be better able to establish clear objectives and avoid dissipation of its resources over a wide spread of activities.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with some of the points made by Members, and I again thank them for the interest they showed in the measure and for the study and time they obviously devoted to studying the Bill itself.  A number of Senators suggested that consideration should be given to including other aspects of our heritage with the terms of reference of the council. As I said, it was decided not to include every aspect within the scope of the National Heritage Council because it was felt that initially the council should deal only with the physical heritage.  I would like to stress that it is possible that other aspects of our heritage could be added later.  It must be remembered, however, that even as matters stand the council will not by any means be a small body.  From the start it will employ not far short of <Col N="1261" /> 1,000 people.  That in itself is significant in size.  If everything connected with all aspects of our heritage as, for example, the language, song, dance, art, literature, archives, folklore, etc. were to be included the council would be an unwieldy body.  As I said, further functions can be added and indeed the council itself, when it is established, I have no doubt, will have many suggestions for inclusion.  I was asked for an assurance that the list of functions was not exhausted.  I have no trouble in giving that assurance to the House and repeating that the list of functions is not exhausted.  The council will be empowered to take on additional functions and, as I have just said, the council itself will have a major say in what additional functions it should take on.  For my part I will not exercise a limiting or restricting role in considering such additions.</P>
    <P>I was asked by some Senators, I think Senator O'Connell especially, why the council should not report to the Department of the Taoiseach.  I should explain to the House that in putting forward arguments of that nature the Senator, I thought, gave the impression that the council will be part of the public service. The fact is that the council will be an autonomous body.  The Minister will only have limited powers over it.  It will have the same freedom &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; as have other non-commercial, State-sponsored bodies.  I might add that the Department of the Taoiseach is a central, policy-making Department and we do not feel that it would be structurally correct to include a huge executive area within that Department.  The council, as I said earlier will be a very big executive area even before it takes on any additional functions, as it may do under the Bill.  The council will be among the largest of our non-commercial, State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>The question of Wood Quay was raised by some Members.  The final position regarding Wood Quay is that everything of value that the site could yield was saved.  In addition, the corporation will provide an extensive museum on the site which will be under the control of the proposed National Heritage Council and <Col N="1262" /> will have an exhibition of all the artefacts found there together with reconstructions illustrating the pattern of life in Dublin during the Viking era.  The museum area will also house the old stone city wall.</P>
    <P>In view of the ever increasing rate of destruction of monuments and sites and to cope with the hazards of a developing society the Commissioners of Public Works have had in train for some time the updating and strengthening of the national monuments legislation.  This new legislation will not be introduced until the proposed National Heritage Council has had an opportunity of assessing the nature of the problem and the powers which they feel they will need to protect adequately this aspect of our heritage.  New legislation together with the results of a recently commissioned study on urban archaeology will enable the council to deal more effectively with the protection of monuments and sites.</P>
    <P>The case of the Derravaragh Canoe was raised by a number of Senators.  I should say here that canoe was seen in the lough when the level of the water dropped.  The exposed part of the canoe was beginning to split as it dried out.  The equipment required for the conservation of antique wooden objects is highly specialised and is not at present available to the National Museum.  Arrangements have been made, however, to supply this equipment.  In the meantime the only safe and practical course is to leave the canoe in its present habitat.  It would be incorrect to say that the canoe in any sense has been &ldquo;cast away&rdquo;.  I think that phrase was used by some Senator.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>The question of urban archaeology was raised, and I think I should mention here that my colleague, Deputy MacSharry, Minister for Finance, in his budget statement provided a sum of £25,000 for the commissioning of a study on the subject. Obviously this is an indication of the importance that we attach as a Government to urban archaeology.  A contract for the carrying out of the study has been entered into with the Department of Archaeology in University College Dublin.  I look forward to publication in <Col N="1263" /> due course of the findings of the study.  I expect the findings will set very significant guidelines for the future.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connell asked about the photographic facilities in the OPW.  He may like to hear that they are outstanding facilities and all connected with their operation deserve to be complimented. I am pleased to tell the Senators that these facilities will be transferred to the National Heritage Council.  Senator Mallon raised some very interesting points about the all-Ireland dimension of our heritage.  I want to thank him for his thought-provoking contribution.  I agree with him that our heritage is a common one; the heritage of this country is the heritage of the island of Ireland.  I want to assure him that when the council is being established it will be representative of all traditions of this whole island.  It is extremely important that the co-operation that exists at the moment between the staff and the Commissioners of Public Works and the National Museum and their counterparts in Northern Ireland should be further developed.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the suggestions made about the establishment of a centre somewhere, as he said, straddling that zigzag line that crosses our country where we could exhibit aspects of the heritage of the whole of this island.  It is something to which I will give consideration and I am sure the council constituted on the grounds that I envisage would also be interested in examining this idea.</P>
    <P>Last week I attended for the second time in three years the Irish Trade Union Conference in Belfast and I spoke at the conference dinner.  The previous occasion was in 1980.  As Senators well know quite a number of years had elapsed since it had last been held in Northern Ireland. I said I was pleased to be the Minister attending the conference then and to be repeating that experience only just two years later.  There you had a conference representing the traditions of workers in all parts of our country.  That was the position that existed there.  One must envisage the same being achieved when one talks about the heritage.  I might also <Col N="1264" /> say that I took an opportunity before leaving the next day to visit some monuments being preserved there by the National Trust and I was certainly impressed.  I support the sentiments expressed by the Senator and I am conscious, as we all should be, that in the heritage area, perhaps more so than in any other area, boundaries and borders are meaningless and non-existent.  The establishment of the council by my Government will certainly take that situation into account.</P>
    <P>Representation on the council was mentioned by quite a number of Senators. I accept entirely their concern and their reasons for the suggestions made.  I considered at length the possibility of the membership being the nominees of specific bodies but I had to come down in favour of the means being used in the Bill because of the large number of organisations seeking such membership and the controversy and disappointment that could follow the failure of some bodies to gain representation.  I felt that the best course in that representation on the council should be on the basis of individuals selected by the Government.  While I accept entirely what the Senators said, that it is essential that the major interest groups be represented, I would not favour a statutory provision guaranteeing such representation to any particular organisation, simply because it would be impossible.  It is to their credit that there is so much interest by so many organisations. In fact, the interest shown when the Bill was first circulated and published was very encouraging.  So many organisations made representations that I fear it would have led to the establishment of a very unwieldy body if all the interested organisations and groups had to be represented there.  I would ask the House to accept that position in good faith, and say to them that I would feel that the appointment of people and personnel on this council is a very important factor in the success of the council.  The calibre of the people is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Several Senators inquired about the new national monuments legislation and suggested that provisions about metal detectors, shipwrecks and treasure trove <Col N="1265" /> should be included in this Bill.  Work is well advanced on the preparation of new legislation, the new National Monuments Bill.  The stage has now been reached when I can say that the following provisions are likely to be included in the new Bill &mdash; I would hope to see the National Heritage Council examine and investigate the possibilities of any suggestions they may have regarding that particular measure:</P>
    <P>(1)  Provision for the protection of sites of ancient remains lying under water whether in fresh water or in the sea and especially of historic wrecks.</P>
    <P>(2)  Provision for the protection of &ldquo;archaelogical areas&rdquo;, both urban and rural, in order to ensure that sites of ancient settlements, villages and towns would not be subjected to development without provision being made for archaeological investigation and the preservation of important remains discovered.</P>
    <P>(3)  To make the use of metal detectors subject to certain restrictions that would help to safeguard sites of monuments and areas of archaeological significance from being interfered with.</P>
    <P>(4)  To allow greater scope for the provision of visitor facilities at national monuments and for the carrying out of restoration works where appropriate as against mere maintenance as provided for in the current legislation.</P>
    <P>(5)  To increase fines for offences under the National Monuments legislation.</P>
    <P>All these provisions are likely to be included in the new Bill, but they will not be introduced until the National Heritage Council have had an opportunity of considering them.</P>
    <P>I must confess I am surprised at the fact that Senators largely confined their comments to Ireland's archaeologicial heritage.  This heritage is one of which we should all be justly proud.  The pattern of human settlement and land use from about 6000 BC has left an indelible mark on the face of Ireland and is one of the major attractions for our European neighbours with whom we share the greater European cultural and historical <Col N="1266" /> heritage.  Urbanisation is increasing rapidly, and as a reaction to the noise, the smoke, the concrete, the congestion and the bustle of urban life people are looking to the natural environment more and more for refreshment of mind and spirit. But our natural environment is becoming increasingly vulnerable.  Industrial progress is good for our economic growth and for the future well being of our nation, but unless we are careful this progress will be paid for with a price.  That price will be the steady encroachment of modern building and technological developments into our natural scenery of great beauty and variety.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to designate four areas as national parks, that is areas where the national beauty will be preserved unspoiled, not just for the immediate future but for many decades to come.  The council will also take over responsibility for some other parks which are of great recreational or historical significance. In addition, the council will take control over the Shannon Navigation which in the past few decades has made such a significant contribution to the tourism industry.  It is the intention that the council will eventually take over responsibility for the Grand and Royal Canals.  It would be my earnest hope that the council, when it has been constituted, will give equal attention to archaeology and to our parks and waterways.  Both are equally in danger and both are equally deserving of being preserved unimpaired for the edification and enjoyment of future generations.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it was Senator Durkan &mdash; understandably, from his county &mdash; who referred with some disappointment to the fact that the canals are not being included.  I want to reassure him that my concern also is that they should at the earliest possible opportunity be taken over by the council.  As I said in my opening remarks, to do so at the moment, because of delays in clearing legislation, would have delayed the introduction of this Bill and I felt it more advisable to go ahead with what we could do but to make provision in the Bill whereby this function can be handed over as a responsibility to the new Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" /> Senator Murphy referred to the recent decision to put the treasures of Ireland on exhibition at five venues in mainland Europe.  I was glad he mentioned it, because it does give me an opportunity to assure the House that all necessary steps have been taken to protect these priceless objects from loss or damage. The conditions under which the objects will be exhibited abroad will be no less favourable to their safe keeping than the conditions under which they are exhibited at home.  We will have written agreement to that effect from the authorities of all five venues.  Furthermore, a representative of the National Museum and of the other participating institutions will be present at all times while the treasures are on exhibition.  They will have power to take any necessary action to deal with any contingency which may arise, to the extent of ordering the closure of the exhibition if that should be necessary. The only period during which the objects will be at more than average risk will be during transit.  In this connection we have been guaranteed the full co-operation of our national airline, and with the experience of the American tour behind us &mdash; I am sure Senator Murphy will agree &mdash; the risk factor involved is well within the acceptable limits.</P>
    <P>Reservations were expressed about the Bill mainly because it proposes to set up a State-sponsored body and remove the work from the civil service.  I was amazed at this because I have already dealt in some detail with the advantages of a State-sponsored body structure in this instance.  I do not think there is much point in going over that ground again. But there was an implication that the establishment of the council would result in the loss of the knowledge and expertise which the Office of Public Works had built up over the years.  I want to reassure the Members of the House on this point. This knowledge and expertise will not be lost.  In fact I hope it will be cultivated and developed.  I complimented the people concerned already for the wonderful contribution they have made in the past and for the great contribution I know they will make in the future.  In the main, <Col N="1268" /> the staff of the Office of Public Works engaged on parks and monuments will be transferred to the proposed council and the council will have the benefit of that undoubted knowledge and expertise. What I believe we are doing is drawing together into one body functions that were on the periphery of big Departments and at times suffering for being on that periphery.  We are drawing them into a body whose only function, I emphasise, will be the national heritage.  The advantages there tremendously outweigh the disadvantages.  The various Departments did a good job but I believe a better job can be done by bringing the functions together under a council with the interest, commitment and dedication needed.</P>
    <P>Pub interiors were referred to.  I want to apologise to the Chair and the House for my absence last night.  As the House is probably aware through the press I was engaged in other activities not as pleasant as dealing with matters of national heritage. I understand that the contribution on pub interiors was eloquent and that there was a plea for the preservation of such interiors, and anxiety expressed that the new council should do something in this area.  Pub interiors come under the heading of vernacular architecture or, as it is better described in Irish, perhaps, tithe na ndaoine, the houses of the people.  Other such items are thatched cottages.  People are aware of the necessity for preserving good examples of vernacular architecture.  Already some items have been preserved.  Recently, the Commissioners of Public Works bought an outstanding flax and corn mill near Letterkenny. I have no doubt that the National Heritage Council will also take an interest in suggestions like that and other items of interest in that area.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Senators for their interest.  I am pleased to have had the opportunity of introducing this Bill in the Seanad and more pleased, indeed, that such interest was shown for the most part in a positive way.  I believe that some of the points expressed can be used to improve the Bill.  We will have the opportunity to discuss some other points in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
