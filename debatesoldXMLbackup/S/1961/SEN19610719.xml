    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 44, between lines 12 and 13, but in Part V, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) A person who sounds a horn on a motor vehicle between the hours of 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. in built up areas, save in cases of grave necessity, shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was put down for Committee Stage and discussed on <Col N="1269" /> Committee Stage and the Minister then said he would take another look at it, but apparently he has decided that he is not able to do anything about it himself.  I do not want to go over the ground covered on Committee Stage, except to say that the Bill is framed on the basis that it states certain general principles, gives power to the Minister in Section 11 to make regulations&mdash; very wide and very varied powers&mdash;and goes on to prescribe certain matters as offences and to prescribe penalties.</P>
    <P>For example, Part IV is concerned with a speed limit and as well as prescribing a speed limit, the section gives power to the Minister, after experience, to vary the speed limit with regard to the number of miles per hour as well as to times and places where the speed limit will apply, that is to say, certain matters, such as the speed limit, have been considered of sufficient importance to be put into the Bill and I consider this question of blowing motor horns at night in built up areas, and indeed anywhere, of such importance that it would be better to have it in the Bill.  I would suggest, as I suggested before, that it would be possible to frame a section prescribing that the sounding of motor horns should be illegal during certain hours and at the same time, leave the Minister the same power as he has regarding the speed limit to vary matters if, on experience, it should seem right that a variation should be made.</P>
    <P>Everybody is concerned about these matters and I have been very interested to find letters coming from many places, not only from Dublin but from the country, adverting to this amendment about blowing motor horns and also to other noises made by motor cars at night which are considered unnecessary and which apparently are regarded by many people as a nuisance. A great deal of this noise is quite avoidable.  The use of the horn is in the very great majority of cases quite avoidable and it seems to me therefore that this provision should be put into the Bill.  It in no way takes from the Minister's power and it would help to bring to the public notice that this House, the Minister and the Oireachtas generally are alive to the gravity and the urgency of this <Col N="1270" /> problem.  If you were to put this provision in the Bill, I think it would naturally lead to the making of regulations for the abatement of noises such as the noise of motor cycles without silencers which is quite common in my area&mdash;many people, I think, at night take off the silencers probably in order to do certain speeds&mdash;and unnecessary noises generally.</P>
    <P>If the provision I asked for were put into the Bill, it would make for a great deal of comfort for a great many people, not only the invalid, the old and the very young, but for everybody, because quite a number of people on the main roads of the city, the suburbs and the country towns at night blow motor horns quite unnecessarily, when, as we all know as motorists, the use of lights would be quite adequate. It would mean more comfort for city dwellers and a great many rural dwellers, better driving and fewer casualties. It would be easier to enforce it if it were in general terms such as I have given.</P>
    <P>As has been stated by the Minister and agreed by most Senators, what we require are police patrols, not so much to enforce the law but to indicate to people how they are breaking it and what the courteous procedure is.  I realise that would be a very desirable thing, but I am afraid we will have to begin with police whose main duty is to tell people what is right but after a short period we will arrive at the situation when the police will be enforcing the law and bringing about the imposition of penalties.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that the Minister is not doing anything about this as it is a matter of such importance that it could very well be put in the Bill. There is nothing in the way the Bill was originally framed to make this kind of note discordant.  It could be put into the Bill quite easily with the resources open to the Minister and I regret very much that he did not see his way to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Senator Hayes.  I think the Minister should take this power.  It would be a very civilised thing to do.  There is no safety factor involved.  When car lights are used, the horn is completely unnecessary <Col N="1271" /> and I think you will put an end to what can be described only as suburban bedlam such as we have all experienced after the hours of darkness. Old people have come to me and grumbled about this.  They have also asked me, in the naive way of people who think that by being a member of Parliament, you can get anything done, to do something to stop the revving of cycle engines by young riders.  I do not think I can do anything about it but we can talk about it.  Young people express their youth by removing the silencers from their cycles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am curious about the phraseology.  It refers to &ldquo;...built-up areas save in cases of great necessity,&rdquo; I wonder what the interpretation of &ldquo;built up area&rdquo; would be and in what circumstances the sound of a horn would be considered a case of grave necessity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very briefly to support the amendment. There is no doubt that there is a great deal of unnecessary noise at night made by cars on main roads and side roads.  I understand that in Paris the blowing of horns is completely banned, day and night.  The result is not more accidents but greater care. People look where they are going instead of driving blindly around corners blaring the horn.  I think this <Col N="1272" /> is a most reasonable amendment and any effort to mitigate the noise on our roads now is desirable and very necessary.  I hope the Minister will accept this very modestly-phrased amendment, even at this late hour.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Ó Maoláin, I feel the words &ldquo;built-up areas&rdquo; require to be defined.  There is no definition of built-up areas in the interpretations.  There is a reference to built-up area speed limits which would not cover the amendment.  I also agree with Senator Ó Maoláin in regard to &ldquo;cases of grave necessity.&rdquo; What would be regarded as a case of grave necessity on the part of the driver might not be so regarded by a person who decided to prosecute and it would be difficult to get sufficient evidence to satisfy our courts that there was not a grave necessity.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;There shall be a speed limit of thirty miles per hour in respect of all public roads in built-up areas&rdquo;.  This is the expression you want defined.  If it should be defined in the amendment, it should be defined all the more here.  I do not mind admitting that it was instinct that led me to find this in the Bill or rather led me to get Senator Hayes to find it for me.  This business of speed limits and built-up areas is extremely well known.  What a built-up area is is also extremely well known.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I only asked for information.  What is a &ldquo;built-up area&rdquo; and what is &ldquo;a case of grave necessity&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am now going to look at the definition section which says &ldquo;&lsquo;built-up area speed limit&rsquo; has the meaning specified in subsection (4) of Section 45&rdquo;.  Subsection (4) of Section 45 says: &ldquo;In this Act &lsquo;uilt-up area speed limit&rsquo; means the speed limit under this section&rdquo;.  If the Department of Local Government and the draftsmen are going to get around some difficulty in local government law, or whatever it may be, in that way I see no point in Senator Ó Maoláin raising the matter in this way. This is a piece of legalistic cod.  What is a built up area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Senator talk about something about which he knows nothing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was able to get his nose on to this trail and catch out Senator Ó Maoláin also.  I do not believe there is any necessity&mdash;I can only express a layman's opinion &mdash;to define &ldquo;a built-up area&rdquo;.  This expression is well known.  It is quite common in Britain to see the words &ldquo;built-up area, speed limit 30 m.p.h.&rdquo;. I presume this is a &ldquo;cog&rdquo; from the British legislation and if you want a definition <i>á la</i> this system, built-up area is an area in which a speed limit operates, in which a built-up area operates.  Adopting this system, I am home and dried.  I have bridged the great gap, crossed the canyon, or anything you like.  There is no trouble at all, no difficulty.  I am home once more in my helicopter and just jumped into the built-up area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question is perhaps a more important one, &ldquo;save in cases of grave necessity&rdquo;.  There is no difficulty if a man makes a noise with his horn and a policeman asks him why he <Col N="1274" /> made such a racket and the person replies: &ldquo;This person who is slightly under the influence of drink came on to the road in front of me and I had to blow my horn and stop and you can see that he went back on to the footpath.&rdquo; The policeman will say: &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;  On the other hand, if a man drives through an area hooting his horn and he is held up and can give no reasonable explanation, he should be prosecuted under this amendment.</P>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy with this amendment because nobody ever comes back to the city of Dublin from the country without being aware of the continuous noise.  I think it should apply everywhere.  We all know that in summer time in the tourist areas in comparatively small towns when people come out from dances, there is a good deal of &ldquo;revving&rdquo; of engines and very often people drive off tooting their horns as a method of saying goodbye. We all know that is true.  We are really discussing the principle of this amendment. The Minister and his Department had an opportunity to consider it. They did not accept it but they could have accepted something like it and I think it would have been reasonable for them to have accepted something like it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very reasonable amendment.  We all know that when people in cities and towns in built-up areas go to bed, especially after 11 o'clock, they want to go to sleep and it is wrong that they should be awakened by the noise of motor car horns.  The same applies to hospitals. The majority of hospitals are in built-up areas.  The greatest culprits are the road hogs who drive at 40 or 50 miles an hour and who keep sounding their horns because they want everybody to get out of their way.  You also have people after dances trying to collect their friends.  I have seen it happening in Mullingar and other places, where they keep blowing their horns to attract their friends.  The Guards can do very little about it and they can be sounding their horns for as long as half an hour, wakening up half the locality.  The Minister may smile.  Other culprits are people outside public houses who also try to collect their friends by blowing their horns.  There is no necessity for <Col N="1275" /> that.  This is a reasonable amendment and I can see no reason why the Minister should not accept it.</P>

      <P>I was exercised by Senator Hayes's amendment.  I think I said to him previously that I should like to hear himself and the late Professor Joad in an argument about the relative merits of &ldquo;save in grave necessity.&rdquo; I was also exercised to know what would constitute &ldquo;grave necessity.&rdquo; There is no doubt it is an amendment which we would all like to see encouraged, that people would refrain from sounding the horns of cars near hospitals.  I do not know if the amendment could be put into legislative form and be enforced.  That is what is exercising my mind about the matter.  I think that a motorist could say: &ldquo;I sounded the horn in case of grave necessity.&rdquo;  Therefore, who is to be the judge, if I may so, of what would constitute &ldquo;grave necessity&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I find myself in a bit of a difficulty, like Senator Ó Maoláin.  When am I to advise myself, as the judge sometimes says, on &ldquo;grave necessity&rdquo;?  If I am to drive from Dublin to my home without <Col N="1276" /> sounding a horn unless I am satisfied there is grave necessity, then I must pass through Santry, Swords, Balbriggan, Drogheda, Castlebellingham, Dundalk, and so on, without sounding my horn.  If we do away with the word &ldquo;grave&rdquo; and make it &ldquo;necessity,&rdquo; so that no one may use a horn unless he considers it to be a necessity, it would be better.  I think the most objectionable noise one can possibly hear in the city today or anywhere for that matter is the screaming of the brakes of C.I.E. buses.  Would anybody contend for a moment that we should stop them from using their brakes in that way?  My information is that that is the most effective and proper way to use the brakes for safety purposes.</P>
      <P>Senator Carton, speaking last week, said that you could give warning of your approach to a crossroads by dipping and undipping your lights. Most of the corners or crossroads on my way home from here are lighted. Mention has been made of built-up areas and the imposition of a speed limit.  In places where a speed limit is imposed by the Garda, it should be easy enough to find out the position.  I would not back any legislation that would impose on me the necessity to refrain from blowing my horn or that would mean that I would be breaking the law if I used it in approaching all the different junctions I must pass through.  Are there not accident cases reported in the papers every week and the drivers of the vehicles are asked whether or not they sounded the horn?  If I am involved in an accident, I shall be asked if I sounded the horn when approaching the junction.  I shall have to produce very strong evidence to the court to show that I did or else I will find myself in trouble with that court.</P>

I promised at that stage to reconsider the matter and I have since done so.  Unfortunately, from Senator Hayes's point of view&mdash; how he read my mind I do not know&mdash;<Col N="1277" /> he is aware that on that reconsideration I do not feel there is reason to agree to this amendment.  The reason, as I pointed out earlier, is that there is no necessity whatever for this amendment, in the first instance.  Under Section 11, there is ample power, designedly, to cover not only the sounding of motor horns but the suppression or abatement of all other noises in any special circumstances in any particular places at any particular hours that we think would be in the interest of the general public.</P>
      <P>The purpose of that section and the power of that section, I think, are accepted by Senator Hayes.  That being so, one might ask: What is the purpose of the amendment?  If I am to read what he said properly, it would appear that by putting it into the Bill and spelling it out, as he proposes, in the section, added importance would appear to be given to the intention and that, as a result of that appearance of added importance, more cognisance would be taken of the law as so stated. If this were so and if we could follow that line right through, then there is nothing that it would not be worth our while to state in a measure such as this even though it would run into volumes of words, phraseology, subsections and sections.</P>
      <P>To get across this idea, to get it accepted by the public in a general way, the most effective way and the only way I think it will be got across is by propaganda in the sense of publicity of what we intend to do, of the end we wish to attain.  Over and above that, and in conjunction with it, there must be at the same time, a rigid enforcement by the Garda in the areas in question.  To state it here, to spell it out here, would not, in my estimation, add to the hoped-for success in the abatement of these noises in any way whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, the Senator has stated that we deal with other matters specifically, and asked why not this one, when we spell out certain things in other sections. In Part IV, the Senator pointed out we dealt with speed limits and actually made the speed limit and defined built-up areas to which he refers in his amendment.  It is true that we dealt with speed limits separately and <Col N="1278" /> outside of Section 11 but it is not done for the purpose of bringing out the importance of a speed limit.  It is done really because we are advised that this type of thing would be better not dealt with and should not be dealt with merely from a drafting point of view under Section 11.  Therefore, not being dealt with under Section 11, it would come to be dealt with elsewhere. As the Senator pointed out, it is dealt with elsewhere, spelled out.</P>
    <P>There is also a general observation I should like to make on this matter of spelling out the various details, that is, that where it is possible to spell out in an accurate, concise way any of these details, it is one thing but to deal with this matter as suggested in this amendment, or, indeed, in any other form of amendment hoping to achieve the same result, will not be so easy.  The stating of the hours is a matter upon which we might agree. If we did agree, we would find that the hours stated or any hours stated could not be the most suitable and might preclude us from taking action in other appropriate cases which did not fall within those hours.</P>
    <P>In regard to built-up areas, the amendment does not really cover the matter.  The fact that the same phrase is used in Section 45 does not add any weight to its interpretation under the amendment.  Used in Section 45, it relates to Section 45; in other words, it relates specifically to speed limits under that section.  If the same interpretation were to be used for this purpose in this amendment, then we would have to refer to the interpretation and the definition in Section 45 or in some other way repeat what is in Section 45 in order to give it any weight at law.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of &ldquo;grave necessity,&rdquo; I am not going to put forward the arguments for or against or the necessity for that phraseology.  It is my advice that the use of these words in this section or in any other section and the use of the words in this amendment would, in fact, give such a let-out that the section would be inoperative and could not attain its end at all, for the reason that if we put it on the books as we have it here now, we would find that <Col N="1279" /> the Garda would in the courts be under the obligation to show that the horn was blown or used in a case other than a case of grave necessity. If we were to deal with this matter in the regulations, we would be prohibiting, I think, totally the use of a horn or any other matter of noise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that the Minister has that intention&mdash;that he is considering such total prohibition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will appreciate that there are many matters we have to deal with in very great detail under these various regulations. If we are to deal with this matter, it will be in terms of total prohibition rather than stating it as an excuse in exceptional circumstances.  We will not use it in that way.  We are advised that the words as used in the amendment would be a let-out to such a degree that it would be as well not to have them at all.  When the Senator asks whether it would be a total prohibition, I would not go all the way with him.  It may be a total prohibition within specified times and areas.  It will have to be total in that restricted sense and it will be for the courts to determine whether or not exceptional circumstances arise.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with the various expressions of the people who supported the idea.  Nobody has spoken against the idea of trying to reduce noise, particularly at night time and in or adjacent to hospitals and nursing homes where people are sick and where noise would be quite annoying. All of us would go along with that idea and some more so than others. I am saying to the House that these matters were in my mind while we were drawing up these provisions.  In Section 11, I am quite satisfied we have all the power and authority required to deal with noise or nuisance noise.  It is my hope that it will be dealt with under the section.  I do not agree that we should accept the amendment for the reasons I have given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this <Col N="1280" /> amendment and the two discussions we had have done good.  I am satisfied enough with the results.  I should say, in the first instance, that I did not read the Minister's mind.  I merely concluded that because the Minister had not put down an amendment of his own, he was not going to yield to me. It is quite plain that, in the absence of something from the Minister, he was not going to agree with me.  It was also quite plain from the behaviour of the people who sit with the Minister that the Minister was not going to agree. While some thought I was right on the last occasion, on this occasion, they devoted themselves to splitting hairs about the meaning of particular words in the amendment, ignoring what I said about the framing of this amendment on the last occasion.</P>
      <P>As everybody knows, I am a modest and humble person.  I did not profess to frame this amendment so that it could go into a Bill and become law at once.  I stated that I put down the amendment so that it could be discussed. If the Minister agreed with it, he could get it drafted.  In spite of my humility, I have plenty of experience of Ministers.  I know that when they are putting something into a Bill, they want it, and quite rightly, in the words of the Parliamentary Draftsman who is the appropriate official for that.</P>
      <P>I put down the amendment to establish a principle and I can congratulate myself and be grateful to the Minister and the House because that principle was generally accepted.  While the Minister did not make any specific promise, he made it clear that he will do something about it.  There is nothing at all in the quibbles about what &ldquo;built-up areas&rdquo; mean and what &ldquo;grave necessity&rdquo; means.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister's point is correct, though the advice he got I heard before, when I come to think of it.  If you are going to do this, you do it by way of general prohibition and that would not preclude the courts from considering that a person could not avoid blowing the horn at a particular moment.  That is correct.  That means that the words &ldquo;in the case of grave necessity&rdquo; are not necessary.  All I was doing in framing the amendment was showing that I wanted a prohibition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> At the same time, I was aware that cases&mdash;they have occurred in my own experience; Senator Brennan gave an example&mdash;in which it might be necessary to use a horn do occur at times.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Minister will make regulations about this whole matter but he need not have gone to the trouble of arguing that if he put this in, he would have to make the Bill as big as a library.  He knows that is not so.  In any event, I am glad for what has been done and I hope that what is a very genuine evil in our community, that is, too much noise, as far as motor cars are concerned, will be obviated by regulations under the Bill.  I hope the Minister's optimism about enforcement will come to fruition.  I am grateful to the House for the manner in which it received the amendment and I withdraw it.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take the remaining Stage today.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add a very brief word to emphasise, if possible, what Senator Hayes said about the necessity for firm and strict enforcement of what is in this Bill.  Many of us are very pleased at the way in which the clear definitions and regulations in the Intoxicating Liquor Act are now being enforced.  The Minister will do a very fine service to the country if he sees that these regulations are enforced, too.</P>
      <P>I should like to add that, at the moment, there are the most flagrant breaches of the traffic laws, especially in regard to parking, all around Dublin. If the Minister had to drive in from Dalkey in the morning, afternoon or evening, he would see in many of the suburban centres the most flagrant breaches of the law.  I hope this Bill, when it becomes an Act, will strengthen the hand of the Civic Guards in seeing that they do not recur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout all the debates in this House and in the other House, the Minister has rejected the acceptability of tests for drunkenness.  He has had good reason to do so in many ways, but I would urge him to keep actively <Col N="1282" /> in mind the possibility of introducing such tests as soon as certainty, or near certainty, can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I should like to end by congratulating the Minister on the production of this comprehensive and effective Bill, and to urge him to see that every jot and tittle of law is enforced in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Dwyer Mr. O'Dwyer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dwyer</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the Bill which I think will prove to be a very good Act.  The Minister has very strong powers with regard to regulating speed and other matters.  I suggest he should use his powers with regard to regulation of speed very strictly.  I have no doubt that the majority of road accidents can be traced back to the high speed of motor cars.  That speed is increasing every day.  High speeds in built-up areas are very dangerous but they are even more dangerous on country roads.  Everyone is on the lookout in the cities so it is even more dangerous on the country roads.  I suggest to the Minister that the time will come, perhaps very soon, when it will be necessary to put a speed limit of perhaps 40 or 45 m.p.h. on all cars, in view of the increasing tendency towards speed in high-powered cars. Every day people are killed on the roads or have their limbs broken. Nothing which will stop those accidents would be too drastic.</P>
      <P>A great deal of accidents occur also by reason of the failure of motorists to dim their lights.  I have experience of that and I think regulations should be made which will compel motorists to dim their lights.  If there were such regulations, there would be fewer accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say one word on the question of enforcement which was raised by Senator Stanford.  The present law is not enforced. If you drive your car out of town any night, you will find that the absence of lights on bicycles is the rule and not the exception.  There is no doubt about that.  For example, in the city, you are supposed to drive on your parking lights, but you may hit a cyclist on the Rathgar Road because the cyclist has only a reflector on the back of his bicycle, and you cannot see it unless you have strong lights <Col N="1283" /> turned on.  So far as bicycles are concerned, lights are the exception and not the rule.</P>
      <P>Another thing which it is quite common to see, in Dublin, at any rate, is two people, very often two children, on the same bicycle.  That is a most dangerous practice but no one ever takes any notice of it apparently.  I agree with Senator Stanford who said there are flagrant breaches of the law. This morning I saw two breaches of the law in relation to traffic lights.  The traffic light laws are broken all the time.  When a Garda is present, everything is grand, but when a Garda is not present, the law is broken flagrantly. One of the most dangerous people in Dublin is the man who races for the lights to make sure he will get through before they change, or the man who goes around a corner even though the lights are against him.  That is a common thing.  To advert for a moment to the amendment before the House dealing with the use of horns at night, one of the most objectionable uses of horns is their use by people at traffic lights.  If there is a second's delay when the lights change to green, someone blows his horn because he is in a hurry.</P>
      <P>This may be a matter not for the Minister but for the local authority but there are several traffic lights in Dublin where the change is of too short a period to allow anyone to walk across. I heard from Senator Louis Walsh&mdash;he is absolutely right&mdash;that pedestrians have certain rights at the traffic lights. That may be so, but there are no motorists who would agree.  Practically no motorist would agree that pedestrians have any rights at traffic lights. A motorist who goes around to the right, as he is perfectly entitled to, brakes into the pedestrians.  I have seen them going very close without killing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator O'Dwyer that accidents occur because of speeding. They occur because of lack of courtesy and common consideration. A great many people, in this town, at any rate, drive their motor cars on the basis that it is a derogation of their sovereign status if they have to stop. They do not want to stop in any circumstances. <Col N="1284" /> They will blow their horns or do all kinds of things but they will not stop.  This is not a social matter.  I have pointed out over and over again that it is not the people with the big cars, it is not the young drivers and it is not the women who will not stop&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  Last Sunday afternoon on O'Connell Bridge, I gave way to a number of people who were waiting to cross and a man came up and went half way across right into the crowd.  He was an oldish man with five children in the car.  What was wrong with him, I do not know. I know the Minister talks in good faith about enforcement, but I think there will be great difficulties about enforcement when this Bill becomes an Act.  I think there will need to be a great many more motor cyclists in the Force.  It struck me&mdash;I do not know if it is a suitable idea&mdash;that the Ban Gardaí could be put in mufti at the traffic lights.</P>

      <P>They might be in danger there.  I often notice coming into town that if I follow a particular person, it is that same person who breaks the law at every set of traffic lights.  They are in the minority but they are dangerous.  When this Bill becomes an Act, if it is to be of any use, it must be rigorously enforced.  If it is not rigorously enforced, it will bring the law into contempt, and it will thwart the Minister's efforts and the efforts of everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I express my appreciation of the manner in which the members of this House have dealt with the Bill as a whole and the co-operative way they have gone about their business?  I would thank the House for the various expressions of approval that have issued.  I would say further that the members of this House and the Dáil and the people in public life who have the opportunity of making themselves heard can be of very great assistance if they will use themselves <Col N="1285" /> strenuously in relation to the wishes expressed here and the intentions enshrined in the Bill and on every occasion bring these matters to the minds of the public who have responsibility in the use of the roads of the country.</P>
      <P>Enforcement&mdash;yes; I quite agree.  If it were not enforced, we would be all worse off than if we had never started at all, because, now that the effort has been made, if it does not have the desired effect, the jungle that exists on our roads today will even more forcibly be part of our way of life in future.  Therefore, I would appeal very strongly to members of both Houses and others in public life who have access to the minds of the public through their position to impress on the public, whether they may be pedestrians, cyclists, motorists or drivers of horse-drawn vehicles, that all have responsibility.  No matter how laws are made, no matter how they are defined, no matter how regulations are made, or indeed no matter how they may be enforced, they will not really get to the root cause of our trouble unless we have acceptance by the public of their responsibilities so that they will have thought and consideration for others when they use our public roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that only ten per cent. or 20 per cent. of the accidents that take place are brought about wilfully by bad driving or misuse of the road. Eighty or 90 per cent. are the result of thoughtlessness and lack of consideration, people not thinking where they are going, what they are doing, who else is on the road and who else is entitled to be on the road.  That is the big problem.  The rigours of the law if fully applied and public opinion properly used by the better behaved members of the community can deal with that ten or 20 per cent., but the real big problem is the unwitting offender, the thoughtless offender, who offends by not having consideration for other road users and that is where I believe the members of both Houses and other public people can go a great distance in bringing about a reduction in the number of accidents and deaths on the road by using their influence on every possible public occasion to impress on the public the responsibility <Col N="1286" /> every member of the public has who uses the road, no matter in what capacity.</P>
    <P>I have been fully assured that there will be co-operation and ultimate enforcement by the Guards.  The laws as we pass them and the regulations we envisage as likely to be made under the measure will be enforced rigorously, when necessary.  I am accepting that assurance by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, on behalf of the Guards, and as a result of discussions with Garda authorities in my Department during the preparation of the Bill, I have no doubt that there is a fund of goodwill in the Garda force itself at high level to ensure that when we give them the means, they will use them to clear the roads of the dreadful toll of deaths every year.  They will take the steps necessary and proper to put the law into force so that they may save lives, perhaps even the lives of many of us sitting here.</P>
    <P>During the course of the discussion in this House and in the Dáil, it was said that I had rejected the idea of tests for drunkenness and Senator Stanford said he hoped that I would keep the matter in mind and when a conclusive method of testing for drunkenness had been arrived at, I would consider the matter again.  As I have said and reiterate now, we are in fact setting up a commission to deal with the whole problem of drunkenness, the degree of alcohol in the blood that may be regarded as bringing a person to the state of drunkenness or incapability so far as driving safely is concerned and all the various aspects of the matter.  All these will be in the terms of reference of the Commission which my Department is in course of getting together.</P>
    <P>If the commission reports at a not too distant date in the future that certain tests are reliable and make certain recommendations, then, as I said in the Dáil, the Minister for Local Government, whoever he may be at that time, will, I am sure, come back to both Houses with an amendment incorporating these recommendations.  The commission will present very useful information on the matter and will be of very great assistance in providing the Government with a proper assessment <Col N="1287" /> of all the facts regarding testing drunkenness.  Their recommendations will be given full weight, to the degree that I expect the Government and the Minister for Local Government of the day will come to the Houses of the Oireachtas to amend the law.</P>
    <P>I feel it is only right to express appreciation of the co-operation I have got in this House and in the Dáil and of the manner in which members, no matter on which side they were, dealt with the Bill.  I would thank them for the help they have given myself, the Department and the Government to bring along a Bill which I feel having been accepted whole-heartedly by both Houses with various amendments will also be accepted whole-heartedly and unanimously by the public when it is signed and becomes law.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, I was was not here when this motion was being debated before.  I did not know what stage it was at and I was waiting for a lead.  I should like to support the motion.  I have had considerable association with the schools, principally secondary schools, as a teacher, a governor and as a parent.  I have seen the operation of the various organisations for bringing teachers and parents into co-operation with the view to trying to improve the effectiveness of not only the whole system of transmitting knowledge to children and encouraging them to learn their lessons, as it were, but also of the higher and more important role of the school and the school teacher in the equal forms of education, building up children in the way we hope they will continue to go and giving them a proper appreciation of their outlook in life, their duty in life, and so on.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way from the initial days when laws were made to force parents to send their children to school.  I suppose there are still some parents who have to be forced to send their children to school, but I think they are in a small minority.  In those days, when those laws were necessary, that type of parent had little claim on the teacher, or his time, for the purpose of co-operation.  The parent sent his child to school under duress.  He would much rather have kept his child at home and much rather have employed the child at some useful manual work at home than send him to school and there was no point then in having parent-teacher organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is quite different now. Only a very small minority of parents are unaware of the advantages of education.  A very great majority send their children to school willingly and take a great deal of trouble choosing the schools to which the children go. I feel that such parents are being deprived of something they would value if they are not allowed to take the personal <Col N="1289" /> interest in this education, which they wish to take, by the forming of these associations.</P>
    <P>The teachers in this country, and in many countries, are very often obsessed with the idea that the student must get through the examinations and that a certain amount of knowledge has to be transmitted to the student by the teacher.  I feel that too often that is the primary, and very often the sole, concern of the school teacher. Too often it comes to be an end, something which the pupil regards as the only thing for which he goes to school. There are a number of other things but the most obvious one, apart from the acquisition of knowledge, is the means of acquiring knowledge, how should a pupil set about not only learning a certain series of facts but teaching himself how to acquire these and other facts so that the acquisition comes more easily and more naturally. He builds up an attitude of mind towards this whole business which will help him later on when these facts have been forgotten or when the examination has been passed or failed.</P>
    <P>It is in this business of learning how to learn that I think the parent can help the boy or girl and, incidentally, help the teacher by consultation with the teacher as to the methods to be adopted, first of all, by the teacher in the school.  That may be thought to be rather presumptuous but I still feel many parents are in a position to make suggestions about that and also the method to be adopted by a parent when the child finds himself in difficulties at home and is really seriously worried about what he should do about it. From the point of view of parents and teachers, these associations would be of the greatest possible value in getting the best out of our school system for our pupils and I should like to support the motion very warmly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to support this motion, because, as I understand the position, it is that the <Col N="1290" /> vast number of parents belong to some religious denomination or other and the machinery is that the local pastor, whether Roman Catholic or Church of Ireland, is the manager of the particular school.  The pastor being the manager of the school, the natural way to have discussions or to ameliorate any difficulties regarding schools is through the pastor of the particular religious denomination who is also the manager of the school.</P>
      <P>I feel that parent-teacher groups, which are all right in theory, bring forward to an extraordinary degree the crackpots amongst us.  This situation is one which we do not wish to encourage.  We all know of the &ldquo;Mama's darling&rdquo; or &ldquo;Daddy's pet&rdquo; who comes home and complains about something, whether it is lessons or discipline or something like that. There is a small minority always of the sort of parent who listens to that child and creates trouble.  That parent would have an opportunity to vent any spleen he or she might have or to create a discordant situation by being a member of a parent-teacher group in relation to the school.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible that in other countries parent-teacher groups are necessary, and not only necessary but excellent in their approach and excellent in their work.  But here in this country where we have such an overwhelming majority of people who are affiliated to the various churches and where we have in fact almost entirely denominational schools, I feel that the avenue through the teacher and the manager of the school is the avenue the parents should use&mdash;if not with the teacher, then with the manager&mdash;to discuss all the aspects of the attendance of their children in the school.</P>

      <P>I would not think it would take that trend.  My experience <Col N="1291" /> is not that of Senator Sheehy Skeffington or Senator Jessop as a protagonist of education in the higher sense.  Five of my children go to school.  The reason I support this motion is that in the past, over the years, I find that had I been associated with such a group as Senator Sheehy Skeffington envisages in this motion, I might have been closer to the education of my children.  In my case, it turned out all right, but I can readily see what is in the mind of Senator Sheehy Skeffington.</P>
      <P>There is nothing arrogant about the motion.  The motion says that Seanad Éireann would welcome fostering action on the part of the Minister. There is no great demand for it, but I am sure Senator Sheehy Skeffington, like Senator Jessop, intends to point out the advantages of this system.  We have not had it before and I think it would be advantageous.  I think in a school pretty close to where I live, not of my denomination, they actually have a parent-teacher group in operation, with or without the knowledge of the Minister.  I should still like to support Senator Sheehy Skeffington.</P>

      <P>My view is that if there is need for such association, it would be much better and much healthier that such association should grow without any fostering from anybody. Once you start fostering, you really propagate an idea that it should be done.  My view is that if such associations are to serve a really valuable purpose, they should be spontaneous and come naturally from the parents in co-operation with the teacher and the manager of the school. That is my firm view on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are practical difficulties I can see arising, should the Minister proceed to foster this idea at ministerial level. The practical difficulties, in my view, would defeat any good purpose that might be enshrined in the motion.  Let me examine this motion quite objectively and seriously and in so far as it would be applicable in rural areas. I am not conversant enough with the organisation and the pattern of life in, say, Dublin or Cork to be in a position to make a statement on whether <Col N="1292" /> it would be desirable to foster such an association there, but I suggest I am competent to form an opinion in regard to its operation in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do substantially agree with another speaker who said that we must face up to the facts.  The system of management in our primary schools, with all its faults and no matter what criticism may be made of the manager, be he the parish priest or the clergyman in a Protestant school, is that in the majority of cases, it has worked fairly well.  It is peculiar to this country and in the long run, the test of any machine is its working in practice.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact that we have this system of clerical management which, in my view, is good and should be preserved. It has guarded this country against the liberalistic attitudes that seem to have brought other countries into quite a lot of trouble.  Consider the system of education that developed in France over the past 100 years when liberalism was put on a very high pedestal indeed.</P>
    <P>I should not like to see any change in the method of the management of schools.  If there are abuses here and there, in my view, it is better to remedy the abuses.  In any human system, you are bound to have a certain amount of abuse.  You will have it in every Government Department and in all the affairs of men. You will not have everything perfect. It would not be a good thing that we should condemn a system because of isolated difficulties.  We must take the overall picture.  I again state that the system of management has served this country well.  If there is room for improvement, it is better to build up and to improve the existing system. I should be inclined to take the view that it is a very dangerous thing to advocate a change in the system of management, without being more than sure that any new system would be better than the existing system.</P>

It would appear that, by harping long enough on a system of management, the question as to its success or otherwise can be called into question.  I seldom get a chance of expressing my view.  I think this is the first time that I got this opportunity.  I feel bound to express the view that it is better to maintain the system and improve it and not to condemn it because of any isolated abuse.  If we could ensure that all our managers, no matter what their denomination, would use as far as possible the different means at their command to improve the existing system, I believe it would serve this country well in the future and would guard us against secularism in education. How is this to be regulated to the motion?</P>

      <P>Are these groups to be elected by popular vote or are they to be self-appointed?  Senator Sheehy Skeffington seems to think that I am cynical in this matter.  Honestly, I can assure him that I am not.  Here is what he would find happening in practice.  The working of a machine in practice is what really counts.  I could envisage this happening.  In rural Ireland, the manager of a school is either the parish priest or the rector. They are responsible for their flocks and are responsible for the management of the school among other things. That is the more direct responsibility. If the manager should develop, or foster even on his own account without any fostering from the Minister, a group of people, parents, and possibly people who are not parents in some cases, to aid him in the better running of the schools and to develop an atmosphere <Col N="1294" /> of co-operation, you might have jealousies.</P>
      <P>You have pride and prejudice in rural areas as to who is on this committee and who is on that committee. I know from experience that that can create a lot of jealousy.  Are we to have a hand-picked parish council? We have the idea of parish councils in existence already.  I readily admit that a lot of good can be achieved by such councils operating in rural areas. Perhaps the same applies to cities but I do not know.  Who is to appoint the parish committees?  It seems to be a rule of thumb that some people find themselves on parish councils, while other people do not agree they should be on parish councils.  You have not the harmony which the motion would seem to suggest.</P>

      <P>It would be as well to say that that would be the essence of democracy, but it would also be chaotic democracy, if you were to have all the people decide on the Road Traffic Act or decide this motion. I think it can be readily understood how ineffective that approach would be.  That is what would happen.  It would be as logical, in my view, to argue that all the parents should be asked to have a voice in the decision as to whether the substance of this motion is practical or not, but it would not be a practical way of deciding the motion, if all the parents were called together on the Hill of Tara to decide this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you are to have progress at all in a democracy, it is the representatives of the people who are to decide issues. That is the difference I always saw between republicanism and democracy. Speaking as a republican, it is the better system.  Because of that, I do not <Col N="1295" /> think that the substance of this motion is practical.  If there is anything in the idea, it is better for those organisations, where they are desirable, to spring up spontaneously without fostering action from a Minister.</P>

Would it provide a sounding board for crackpots or, indeed, are there any more sounding boards required in this country for crackpots?  Is it practical to do away with the system of corporal punishment? I am fond of children, but I think some corporal punishment is sometimes desirable.  I have come to the conclusion that I would approve of the establishment of a system for the protection of teachers from a certain type of children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this motion.  I think it is true to say that at the moment in very many schools, there is very little liaison between the teachers and the parents. One very often hears complaints by parents about the teachers and about what goes on in schools.  I think it is usually true to say that the more parents complain to one another and to other members of the public, the less they do about it.  They never go to the extent of complaining to the teachers and the managers.  That is sometimes due to the fact that they feel that if they complain to the teacher, their own children will suffer. Consequently, rather than bell the cat themselves, they decide to do nothing about it.  The unfortunate thing about it is that the problems which they have are often relatively small, problems which could be put right by merely stating the reasons for the complaints to the teachers.  But the parents do not do anything of a practical nature about it ; they merely complain to one another.  For that reason, a great deal of dissension and a great deal of hard feeling is built up quite unnecessarily between the parents and the school authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> This is not merely a one-way traffic.  There is often a great deal of ill-feeling on the part of teachers towards the parents also.  Again, the problems which teachers have are very seldom put across to the parents in a sufficiently clear way.  There are a great number of problems, none of them very big, but problems of some importance in their own way, which get worse and worse, due to lack of understanding and of communication between the parents and the school authorities.  These are problems which could very easily be smoothed out in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred.</P>
    <P>Nobody will say that every school in the country is running smoothly.  Nobody will say that education is a simple matter.  Education is a very difficult subject, and because it is difficult, every school has its own problems, some of them relatively big but most of them very small.  I do not know exactly what form the proposed parent-teacher groups would take or who would appoint them or anything else, but groups of the type which have been suggested could help to smooth out the kind of problems we have in schools throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There are a hundred and one things which they could do.  They could discuss such matters as hours.  As far as I know, the Department of Education lays down the number of hours which students must attend but there is no rigid rule as to when schools should begin or how long the lunch hour should be.  That is a matter which in many schools is a problem &mdash;whether or not there should be a long break in the middle of the day to allow the children to go home for lunch or a very short break to get the school day over as quickly as possible. It seems to me that these are the kind of problems which could very profitably be discussed between teachers and parents.</P>
    <P>The condition of the school buildings is something which gives a great deal of trouble, and very often small alterations costing very little could make a great deal of difference to the condition of the school.  If the parents were in a position to give their advice and make their suggestions, they would <Col N="1297" /> also go a little bit further, I believe, in putting these suggestions into operation. There are a number of other things, such as the amenities in the school, the question of punishment, activities for children outside school, about which a parent-group could be a very great assistance and could improve the education in the school and the relations between the teachers and the parents.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered, when we are discussing the question of education, that education is fundamentally the responsibility of the parent, and not of the school authorities.  Merely to send the children to school and delegate the authority for education is no reason why a parent should wash his hands in the question of education, and feel that he has no further responsibility for the child or the type of education he is getting, or whether he is getting a good education, or all the details of that education. If these groups would enable the parents to keep more closely in touch with what is going on, it would be a good thing.  By keeping in touch in that way, parents would be able to carry out their fundamental responsibility more effectively.</P>
    <P>Some of the speakers who spoke against this motion expressed the fear that the groups would dominate the school, would try to exercise their authority contrary to the teachers, that the teachers would live in fear of being dismissed by them, and so on.  I do not think that the proposer of the motion had such a group in mind.  I do not think he had in mind a group which would have any power of that kind, nor do I think it possible under the present system for a group formed by parents to have any authority of this kind.  If there were any suggestion that there should be this kind of power and authority, I certainly would be completely against such groups.</P>
    <P>I visualise these groups as being merely groups who would make suggestions, voice complaints, or give advice, but have no power after that to impose their wishes on the school authorities.  They would have no more power as a group than they have as <Col N="1298" /> individuals at the moment to make recommendations about the way their children should be educated.  If the intention is a group of this kind with no power but with plenty of opportunities to advise, to suggest, to smooth out the relationship between teachers and parents, then they certainly would serve a useful purpose.</P>

      <P>This motion has already been very fully debated, as it clearly deserves, and at this late stage of the debate, I do not propose to go into any details or to add any arguments, but I should like to say that I support it fully.  It is a democratic proposal in the fullest sense of the word&mdash; government of the people for the people by the people.  This is the kind of local government we should encourage as far as possible.  Perhaps the word &ldquo;government&rdquo; is a little strong. It will, of course, primarily be advisory, but advice is one of the adjuncts of government which we must foster and I think, in the fullest sense of the word, this is a democratic motion.  It is also reasonably phrased, even mildly phrased, and I should be surprised if the Minister, being a reasonable and mild man, cannot see his way to taking some fostering action in this matter as the motion suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had lost a bit of the thread of the debate due to the delay, but I did hear the earlier arguments on the merits of such groups as proposed in the motion and the arguments against the setting up of those groups.  I feel that it is not for me to add up the arguments here in the House but to state my position in relation to the motion.  I think I can accept that the mover of the motion does not want to replace the management of schools by this group, as was suggested by one member.  Providing the management of schools is a very big task and a very difficult undertaking, and from the point of view of administration.  I must have some one person responsible to me for the management of the schools.  The manager of each school is charged with the direct responsibility of the government of his school as at present.  It is, of course, open to him to set up or to recognise a spontaneously developed <Col N="1299" /> consultative committee, but the responsibility in dealing with the Department of Education rests squarely on the shoulders of the manager, as far as the school government is concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not think any other arrangement for management would be feasible, even though it were thought desirable.  Groups who take responsibility are inclined not to accept full responsibility and they are inclined to break into separate groups with different ideas.  I have had experience in relation to one school of three parent groups.  It was quite satisfactory until there were three different results.  The first group said theirs was satisfactory. The second group had negotiations and discussions with me.  They found that the negotiations with the first group were not satisfactory, and the day after the third group asked to see me, because they thought I had fooled the second group.</P>
      <P>I could not accept any motion that attempted to take responsibility and distribute it in a vague way over a large group of people.  I do not think that is the intention of the motion but I thought it better from my own point of view to say that first.  The proposer of the motion discussed all the merits of such groups in isolation from responsibility, and those against it spoke of all the bad things that could happen in such groups: cranks getting hold of them and reducing or diverting the responsibility of managers. It is a fundamental weakness to take it for granted that such a committee or such a parent-teacher group is good at all times, in all cases, in all circumstances and for all purposes.  I do not think it is.  I can see circumstances where it would be a good idea for a particular purpose and a particular occasion, and I should be very glad to see such a group on those occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the question of excessive corporal punishment in our schools, and indeed excessive mental punishment which is not objected to so strongly, but is equally objectionable to me.  Excessive punishment in schools is abhorrent to me, as I am sure it would be to any Minister for Education and to any normal person <Col N="1300" />&mdash;I suppose I should say to any other normal person.</P>
    <P>It is not always easy to bring proofs of the offence home, for a variety of reasons.  One of the main reasons, from my experience before I became Minister, is that parents are timid and inarticulate, and are not always prepared or able to make their complaints in the right place and in the right way.  A parent-teacher group could act as spokesman for the timid parents and act as mediator or interpreter between the teacher, the child, the parents and the manager.</P>
    <P>That type of mediation with a consequent resolving of a great number of complaints would be preferable to me and to the Department rather than having to take such action as the withdrawal of recognition from teachers, the withdrawal of recognition as principal or vice-principal, a reduction of salary, or the various penalties which we do impose but do not reveal publicly in the specific cases concerned.  I regret having to do those things but they must be done.  A parent-teacher group could in many cases avoid the necessity of my having to take action at all.</P>
    <P>Moreover, such a group might put an end to many unfounded charges against teachers, and unfounded charges are sometimes made.  I may be asked what harm is an unfounded charge because every charge that is made comes before the Minister and he examines it.  Teachers are human. They find themselves exposed to the glare of publicity and an image created of them which no one would desire. That in itself is a punishment before there is any proof that he is an offender.  Such committees would protect our teachers from the irresponsible and sometimes almost sadistic attacks made on them on the basis of charges which are not fully investigated, or by people who are not fully informed of all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>When introducing this motion, Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned other areas in which I agree they would be useful but he did not take the same line which I would take.  He thought we were preventing people from going into our schools and that <Col N="1301" /> we did not want these groups to go into our schools because they are in such a bad condition.  We welcome parents who come into our schools because they own them.  They may be able to see what could be done to stimulate the very rapid increase in school building which has gone on in recent years.  They may be able to see how a lot of good could be done locally because the school is not a State school.  It is locally owned by the people of the parish or by a religious group, whatever it happens to be.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned, as did Senator Ryan, the problems of the teachers.  One of the problems mentioned by Senator Sheehy Skeffington was the very large classes.  I should like to say that as well as being rapidly on the road to reducing those large classes, we are now beginning to get the extra teachers required to improve the ratio between teacher and pupils.  It is not possible to improve that ratio without an adequate supply of teachers.  The removal of the marriage ban, as well as the increased training college accommodation, is making that possible.  About four times in the past few years, we improved the ratio, and we expect to do much better in the years to come.  Again, perhaps a committee or a group would be useful in informing the parents of what is going on in the schools.</P>
    <P>The idea behind the manager being a pastor of the religion of the parents is that he is about the only one who could adequately represent all the parents.  It is sometimes forgotten that parents' rights extend only to his or her own children, and do not extend to the children of other people.  No body of persons, even if they are parents, are entitled to speak for the children of other parents.  Even a majority of parents would not have the right to take from a minority, or even a single parent, his natural rights which are inalienable.</P>
    <P>All in all, if parents' rights have to be centred in one person and if I depend on his responsibility in assuming the government of the school, it is probably best for every <Col N="1302" /> practical purpose that the representative of the parents should be a person nominated by the church to which they belong.</P>
    <P>To provide the management of schools is a great undertaking.  I should like to make it clear that I see no objection to a committee being formed. The manager has the right to form them himself or to recognise them as a consultative committee, but I am not prepared to be the person to decide that a committee should exist in a particular school in particular circumstances. I would welcome the spontaneous development of these parent-teacher groups for the reasons I have given and many other reasons, but I do not think that their development by direction of a Minister could be regarded as democratic, as Senator Stanford said.  It would be very desirable if parents spontaneously got together and formed these groups, but, on the other hand, if they are formed by direction or fostering action by the Minister, they may fall flat and not bring about all the good things we could see them do.</P>
    <P>As to fostering action, it is very difficult to take action which is not a direction.  A circular from me to the managers is as near as you could get to direction.  Somebody said we should circularise managers.  The nearest I could get to it is to say that I would welcome the spontaneous formation of such groups, that I can see many areas where they can do good, but everybody should be clear on the idea of limiting them to consultative groups who would consult with the managers and the manager would have the right to accept spontaneously developed consultative groups.</P>
    <P>As somebody pointed out, the whole group would have to be representative of all the parents and all the parents would have to have access to the group.  Whether they in turn in electing a representative committee would be taking away the rights of some parents I do not know, but that is as far as I can go: I would welcome the formation of spontaneous committees and see many circumstances in which they could do good.  I cannot say that they <Col N="1303" /> would be a good thing at all times, in all circumstances and in all places.</P>

      <P>I should like to start, speaking on the closure of this motion, by saying that I appreciate very much the spirit in which the Minister met it, the conciliatory tone, the tone which, in fact, I expected from him, and recognising the merits of such parent-teacher groups.</P>
      <P>Before I come to the particular points he made, I should like just to mention one or two points made by other speakers.  I appreciate very much the support given to the motion by Senator Cole in the first place, who made it quite clear&mdash;and I think he was right&mdash;that there is an increasing interest in this whole matter throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I think the point, too, was made with great authority by Senator Jessop that the school itself is helped by this meeting together of parents and teachers, without there being necessarily any specific object for the meeting.  It is not necessary even that they should be consultative.  They should just get together to meet in the friendly atmosphere thus engendered.</P>
      <P>Senators Carton, Ryan and Stanford all spoke showing the advantages that could accrue from such meetings. Senator Ryan made the point that a good deal of unnecessary ill-will can arise between parents and teachers.  I agree that one way of getting rid of that type of ill-will is simply to bring both together, again not necessarily to deal with a specific point, but the mere getting together would in itself be fruitful, as Senator Ryan suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were others who spoke against the idea.  Senator Donegan opposed it, as he felt it might be dangerous. Senator Barry said you might get crackpots&mdash;I think Senator Donegan used the word first&mdash;on those committees, and that would be a terrible thing.  I dealt with that in my first speech and suggested that the crackpot is easier to deal with before the bar of parental opinion in a parent-teacher group than in the private sanctum of the school manager.  He <Col N="1304" /> becomes considerably less of a nuisance if he makes a fool of himself before other parents, who can answer him more easily, and often much more strongly than the manager or teacher feels he can do.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are various definitions of a &ldquo;crackpot&rdquo;.  Sometimes the crackpot is merely a man who holds opinions that you do not share and puts them so clearly that it makes you mad.  If that is what you are afraid of, you will be very reluctant, of course, to provide him with a forum, but if he is a genuine crackpot, and will be seen to be so by parent-teacher opinion together, then the parent-teacher group is the best way to deal with him.</P>
    <P>I was a little disappointed when Senator Barry and others spoke on the assumption&mdash;the tacit assumption or perhaps the unconscious assumption&mdash; that there is always hostility between parents and teachers, and that if you bring them together there will be a row.  I do not believe that.  There may be, as Senator Ryan said, some unnecessary ill feeling, but I believe that nothing but good could come from their meeting together in this way, and I am a little surprised at the assumption that if you bring them together the main result will be a row.</P>
    <P>When I proposed the motion on April 19 after Senator Cole supported it Senators Ó Maoláin and Quinlan opposed.  Senator Ó Maoláin spoke with the voice of reaction, opposing the whole idea under the guise of a high Tory in a way I did not understand. It was probably something to do with the present negotiations on entry into the Common Market with Great Britain's Conservative Government, but I did not recognise Senator Ó Maoláin in the guise of high Tory.</P>

      <P>The speeches made by Senators Ó Maoláin and Quinlan seemed to me very silly speeches indeed, with the one difference, I may say, that I do not believe Senator Ó Maoláin is quite as silly as he would have us believe.  I am not <Col N="1305" /> quite so sure, I am afraid, about Senator Quinlan, because I am afraid Senator Quinlan probably genuinely believes some of the silliest things he says.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin said I had suggested that these parent-teacher groups would be expected to deal with &ldquo;grave problems,&rdquo; whereas of course I did not suggest anything of the kind.  He seemed to imply that parents are highly dangerous creatures, and he implied, as did others today, that he was afraid of giving Irish parents any say at all in the education of their children.  He even suggested that if you had parent-teacher groups they would be little Soviet committees in the villages.  Where do these Irish parents come from?  Where do Irish parents get their education?  The ordinary Irish parent who, I take it, would be gathered into the school where his or her child was being educated, has been educated probably in the very same school.  How do these people suddenly become Soviets when they leave school?  What is wrong with our education? Either it is good, in which case you do not get little Communists simply by bringing parents together, but if you do get Soviets by bringing them together, in that case our education is presumably bad, and they have not been taught the way in which free people can discuss things freely.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go in full detail into what Senator Ó Maoláin said.  He told us, however, that the managerial system is a native growth, whereas of course he knows as well as I do that it was brought in by a British Act of Parliament.  In any case, I was not attacking the managerial system.  I was suggesting, well within the system, a way in which greater comprehension and co-operation could exist between parents and teachers.  I do not believe that if you had greater comprehension and co-operation between the teachers and parents the managerial system would suffer.  On the contrary, I think it would benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carried away by emotion, Senator Ó Maoláin suggested such groups would be &ldquo;the thin end of the wedge which would open the floodgates and torpedo the whole system of education.&rdquo;<Col N="1306" /> Apart from the oddity of the floodgates torpedoing the system of education, that seems to be so exaggerated a statement about our unfortunate Irish parents that I cannot understand it.  The suggestion is that if you let the parents meet the teachers in the school, then the whole managerial system will collapse.  Why?  Is the system so weak, and is it likely to be subjected to such crushing criticism? I do not believe that is the case, but Senator Ó Maoláin does not think that the teachers, and I quote from column 98 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>could tolerate the intrusion into the school of a group of these self-appointed committee-men.</P>
    <P>They are emphatically not self-appointed committee-men.  My suggestion was that all parents, in particular sections of the school in turn, should be invited and encouraged to come into the school.  They are not self-appointed committee-men, and they are not seeking for power in the school.  The Senator made a variety of other points.  In one case he dealt with a quotation which I gave and I quote Senator Ó Maoláin at column 94:</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to these parent-teacher groups in the United States of America and gave a quotation which was interesting in itself, but I should like to insist that the system which we have evolved here of managerial control of the schools and the operation of managerial supervision is a unique system.  It is an Irish system....</P>
    <P>and so on.  I quoted from an article by Mr. Rafferty, who is the Secretary of the Department of Education, and who is not known to be wildly Communistic or wildly revolutionary, and the article in question was published in <i>Studies</i>, which is edited by Father Roland Burke-Savage who is not known to be over-rash in the kind of ideas he allows to be propagated. I quote again from that article what I quoted before.  It is at column 83 of the Official Report and Mr. Rafferty says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> Certainly the country is prolific</P>
    <P>&mdash;he is talking about the United States of America&mdash;</P>
    <P>in useful educational and cultural bodies.  Of these, the parent teacher associations ... are an outstanding example.</P>
    <P>I do not think that that can be lightly thrust aside in an irresponsible way by the words of Senator Ó Maoláin who winds up his speech by saying:</P>
    <P>Introduction of this parent committee business would lead to the other position which I pointed out at the start, not immediately, but eventually, and the present system of management of our schools would eventually be upset and we would have then in effect, what would be Soviet committees in every parish.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that that would be the result of the setting up of such parent-teacher groups.  I was surprised, and I am sorry he is not here, when Senator Quinlan first proceeded to support this view of Senator Ó Maoláin's and then went on to criticise the curriculum and the text books, and the lack of local autonomy in relation to the curriculum, and at column 101 he says:</P>
    <P>If I were to quarrel with the present system, I would quarrel with it on some of those grounds, that it is far too centralised in that respect, that there is too little local autonomy and too much time spent framing a uniform system for the young lad going out to earn his living on the farm ...</P>
    <P>and so on.</P>
    <P>Yet, he too seems to be terrified at the very notion of Irish parents, the product of the Irish educational system, coming together, because apparently they would smash the system that educated them.  Parents, in other words, are regarded at best as a confounded nuisance.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a number of points in which he made it clear that he saw value, I am glad to say, in the founding of such groups.  He struck one note of caution which I think was <Col N="1308" /> legitimate.  He said these parent-teacher groups could not take over the running of the schools, and in justice to me said that in fact I had not suggested that.  I might be permitted to quote what I did say last April at column 85 when I said:</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the function of such a parent-teacher group would not be in any sense managerial.  It would not be a case of setting up such a group as a committee to undertake the running of some part of the school.  It should not even be formally advisory or consultative. It would not be a parent-teacher group to which one would submit proposals.  It would consist simply of informal meetings and discussions between parents and teachers.  In a small school, all the parents would be invited to attend, say, twice a term in the school, and in a large school, you might divide the parents according to the ages of their children and their grades and invite two or three groups at different times.</P>
    <P>I think I made that quite clear and I think the Minister and I are at one on that.</P>
    <P>He made the point then that parents sometimes are &ldquo;timid and inarticulate&rdquo;, and might well be induced to express themselves in the presence of other parents and teachers in a valuable way.  He said he would welcome the setting up of such groups, if they came about spontaneously.  He also said that he would like to see the parents visiting the schools.  I should like to see them invited to the schools by the school manager.  I should like them to meet the teachers, not just one by one, but coming there regularly as an invited group.  He did say also that there were a number of other things which in his opinion would be invaluable about such groups, yet he was not prepared to &ldquo;direct&rdquo; that they would be formed.  He said that almost any circular from him would be taken as a &ldquo;direction&rdquo;.  I could quote two or three regulations in which it is clear that the Minister can issue, and has issued, circulars drawing the attention of school managers to &ldquo;the desirability&rdquo;<Col N="1309" /> of such and such an action; for instance, the inviting of lecturers to the school, and so on.  That would be the type of &ldquo;fostering action&rdquo; which I would hope the Minister would be prepared to consider in this case.</P>
    <P>When I think about Irish education, I think about Patrick Pearse, and I am afraid sometimes we are more terrified of free discussion still and of free meetings in our schools than would ever have occurred to Pearse as being possible in a free Ireland. In his essay entitled &ldquo;The Murder Machine&rdquo; on page four he says:</P>
    <P>To the children of the free were taught all noble and goodly things which would tend to make them strong and proud and valiant; from the children of the slaves all such dangerous knowledge was hidden. They were taught not to be strong and proud and valiant, but to be sleek, to be obsequious, to be dexterous: the object was not to make them good men, but to make them good slaves.  And so in Ireland.  The education system here was designed by our masters in order to make us willing or at least manageable slaves.</P>
    <P>On page 5 he says:</P>
    <P>Mr. John Dillon declared that one of the first of those tasks (those awaiting an Irish Parliament) was the recasting of the Irish education system, by which he meant the English education system in Ireland. The declaration alarmed the Bishop of Limerick, always suspicious of Mr. Dillon, and he told that statesman in effect that the Irish education system did not need recasting&mdash;that all was well there.</P>
    <P>We were told similarly to-day, by Senator O'Reilly among others, that all is well now, and that the system does not need recasting, nothing need be done and everything in the garden is rosy.  I suggest that there are many things, among them those that Pearse dreamt of in relation to Irish education, which still remain to be done, and which could be helped at least by a friendly bringing together of parents and teachers in our National schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> I notice with satisfaction that at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis last year Motion 55 read as follows:</P>
    <P>The Ard Fheis believes it is desirable and necessary to establish, for every national school, in the interest of the education, discipline and happy development of the children a consultative committee of parents, manager and teachers, and asks the Government to take the necessary steps towards this end.</P>
    <P>That Motion was proposed by the Padraig Pearse Cumann, Dublin North East.  The Motion was negatived, I am sorry to say, but I am glad to see that in the Government Party there are at least some parents who feel that this would be a valuable thing.</P>
    <P>I quote now from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 29th December, 1956, an article by Mr. Thomas O'Callaghan. The newspaper mentioned that the author had recently been appointed, with Professor Lyons of U.C.C., by the Minister for Agriculture to represent Muintir na Tíre on the Agricultural Production Council.  This is what he says:</P>
    <P>Even in the field of education we find an anomalous position.  Article 42 of the Constitution clearly defines that the State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
    <P>Although lip service is paid to this, what is the actual position?  Are the parents ever consulted about the type of education they wish their children to get.  Standards are set and exam papers laid out in an arbitrary manner by a few officials in the Department of Education who may (or who may not) be the most competent people to entirely judge the important issues at stake.  As far as rural children are concerned they are taught a system based entirely on urban conception.</P>
    <P>That is from the <i>Irish Independent.</i> I quote now, for the sake of balance, <Col N="1311" /> an item from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 23rd November, 1960.  It is entitled &ldquo;Novel Club&rdquo;.  It reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The good sisters in Saint Mary's College, Ballyroan, Rathfarnham, have come up with a novel, interesting idea which they call a Parent-Teacher Club.  The club is to meet a few times every term and listen to a lecture by somebody of importance. The lectures will be followed by a tea at which the parents will have a chance of meeting the teachers.  The meeting will conclude with a question time.</P>
    <P>Here are some of the subjects of the lectures planned: &ldquo;The Problems of Teenagers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Vocational Guidance&rdquo;, &ldquo;Musical Appreciation&rdquo; ... &ldquo;Film Appreciation&rdquo;, &ldquo;Good Reading&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to open the club on Sunday, December 11, with a lecture on musical appreciation by Fr. William Murphy, P.P., Bray.  And I hear that Rev. Dr. Feichin O'Doherty of U.C.D. is also on the panel of lecturers.</P>
    <P>So there is a parent-teacher club or group actually functioning, and apparently, as far as news items can be relied on, they have not yet turned into a local Soviet.  Of course, many secondary schools, I think of the High School, of Mountjoy School, of Sandford Park School, and many others, of Avoca School, Blackrock&mdash;one of the first to have parent-teacher groups in this country, I believe&mdash;already have such groups, secondary schools, like this school in Rathfarnham.  I have heard, indeed, that the Headmaster of Portora School in the North actually comes down a few times during the year to visit parents of Dublin boys at his school.</P>
    <P>Parent-teacher groups exist already, therefore, in secondary schools.  If they can exist in secondary schools, why not in primary schools?  There should be no class distinction in this.  If they can be carried out without danger to the whole educational system in secondary schools, why should they be withheld or sneered at in relation to primary schools?</P>
    <P>I should like now to quote from a speech reported in the <i>Irish <Col N="1312" /> Independent</i> of 7th December, 1959, which was made by the Very Reverend G. Perrott, S.J., Rector, Mungret College, Limerick.  He made the following comments at the Annual Dinner of the College Union in the Central Hotel, Dublin:</P>
    <P>There was, he continued, too much hesitation among parents in this matter of education.  They should remember the teachers were their servants.  They should give them praise and blame where they deserved it.  Parents were too slow to criticise either the school or the State.</P>
    <P>If Irish Catholic parents, he said, were not getting the education they wanted for their children they should be parading the streets with placards and slogans: &ldquo;Give us back our children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If they did, of course, they would be called crackpots straight away.</P>
    <P>I am trying to establish the fact that this is not merely a personal view of mine, but one which has widespread support in all kinds of circles.  I do not want to delay the House very much longer, but I do wish to quote from a series of articles which appeared in the <i>Irish Catholic</i> early last year signed by &ldquo;Gallowglass&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to the wishes of the Chair and to the wishes of the House I do not intend to quote at very great length.  I do want to establish the point, however, that a perfectly reputable Catholic paper sponsoring a Catholic journalist can put the point that parents can help by having parent-teacher groups.  In fact, there is a whole series of articles, about four in succession.  The first appeared on 4th February, 1960.  I shall just quote one passage from the article of 11th February, 1960.  This is what &ldquo;Gallowglass&rdquo; said:</P>
      <P>This country is supposed to be Christian.</P>
      <P>According to the Christian ethic the parents have prior rights in the matter of their children's upbringing.</P>
      <P>Theoretically in this country the parents are responsible for the type of education their children receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1313" /> But in practice, is this so?</P>
    <P>It certainly is not.</P>
    <P>According to the theory the parents help elect a government which, as their elected body, appoints a Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>This Minister decides with the permanent officials the education policy which will be followed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not the parents' choice, but the government's.  In practice parents have no say in the choice of the man who will be responsible for their children's education.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is at top level.</P>
    <P>But take the next level&mdash;the schools themselves.</P>
    <P>The parents have no say in setting up the curriculum.</P>
    <P>Their children will be attending either a national school, or a vocational school, or a convent or college.</P>
    <P>How many of these have any organisation or system which provides for teachers and parents meeting to discuss problems?</P>
    <P>There is a lot more on that line, which I could quote from this excellent series of articles, appearing in the <i>Irish Catholic</i> and written by a wholly responsible journalist, but I think I have said nearly enough to establish the fact that this is not just an isolated request on my part, but something that is seen to be valuable by a very wide number of people.</P>
    <P>I should now just like to deal with the fact that in some areas you find that groups of parents are getting together, or groups of teachers, &ldquo;specially convened&rdquo; for particular occasions, for a particular purpose. Now, I suggest that when parents come together it is always a good thing; but I submit that if they can meet in ordinary harmony with the teachers, without any specific and immediate object, it will be even better.</P>
    <P>I have seen it suggested that before a recent inquiry held by the Department of Education, a specially convened group of parents was addressed by a member of the I.N.T.O., and told that if a particular teacher was dismissed after this enquiry, the I.N.T.O. would boycott the school.  In other words, a meeting of parents was <Col N="1314" /> specially convened simply to listen to this speech, a speech which might be taken, I suggest, as being very close to intimidation before the Department of Education enquiry.  Now if meetings like that can be specially convened for particular purposes&mdash;other examples occur to one, but I will not mention them&mdash;then why not have them for the general good of the schools throughout the country?</P>
    <P>I may say that I thought my first speech, in introducing this motion on April 9th, was an eminently reasonable speech.  Perhaps, I do not always make reasonable speeches, but I thought I made an eminently reasonable speech then.  If anybody took the trouble to read it, he would know that I was not crying for the moon but that I was asking for something which would be quite easily granted. All I was asking for was a coming together, within the orbit of the educational system in our national schools, of groups of parents and teachers to help one another and to meet one another.  The social aspect is just as important in my opinion as the advisory and consultative aspect.  The mere meeting of the teachers with the parents prevents teachers from being ignorant about parents and prevents parents from being ignorant about teachers.  Joint discussions would let some light and air into the whole relationship between parents and teachers, which is not now always of the happiest in some of these schools.</P>
    <P>I should like to see such free discussions, free meetings and free co-operation encouraged.  I am afraid that the element of freedom has not yet, despite the aspirations of Patrick Pearse, been sufficiently brought into our schools.  I should like, with the permission of the Chair, to make just one last quotation from Patrick Pearse. This is what he says:</P>
    <P>The word freedom is no longer understood in Ireland.  We have no experience of the thing, and we have almost lost our conception of the idea.  So completely is this true that the very organisations which exist in Ireland to champion freedom show no disposition themselves to accord freedom: they challenge a great <Col N="1315" /> tyranny, but they erect their little tyrannies.  &ldquo;Thou shalt not&rdquo; is half the law of Ireland, and the other half is &ldquo;thou must.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now nowhere has the law of &ldquo;Thou shalt not&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thou must&rdquo; been so rigorous as in the schoolroom.  Surely the first essential of healthy life there was freedom. But there has been and there is no freedom in Irish education: no freedom for the child, no freedom for the teacher, no freedom for the school.</P>
    <P>I should like to hope consequently that in the spirit of that essay we might in the future relationships between parents and teachers in the national schools in Ireland set something of that spirit of freedom, so dear to Patrick Pearse, something of that spirit of give and take, and something of that spirit of comprehension and co-operation which I mentioned last time.</P>
    <P>My hope is, therefore, that the Minister will start very simply and foster the idea, and indicate now by circular what he has already, I am glad to say, indicated here today, and that he <Col N="1316" /> would recommend the setting up of such parent-teacher groups in national schools where it was feasible and where the management of the school considered that it could be carried out. My hope is that both sides would learn a little from this, both teachers and parents, for their mutual benefit, and for the benefit of the children in the schools.</P>
    <P>I can see nothing but good coming from such an encouragement and fostering of mutual understanding and respect in the face of the many problems of primary education which are the common concern of teachers, parents, managers, the Minister for Education and his Department.  I hope, therefore, that the Seanad will agree with me that Seanad Éireann would welcome fostering action on the part of the Minister for Education in order to encourage the managers of the national schools to establish parent-teacher groups in connection with the schools under their management, and I should like to ask the Seanad to vote for that motion.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an Alt seo.  Section <Col N="1317" /> 5, I understand, is the section under which a dependent child who would be entitled to an allowance of £120 under the income tax code is given that allowance on an income which used to be £60 and is made £80 by this section. I think that is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The British figure is £100, but apart from that, there is this difference also.  I understand that here if a child's income goes over £80, the whole of the allowance is lost.  I am thinking particularly of the case of a widow who has three or four children. She is allowed to count £120 for each child in making up her income tax form.  If the child has an income of £80, the widow still gets an allowance of £120, but, if the income, instead of being £80, is £82 or £84, then I am told the allowance of £120 disappears and the net loss, therefore, is something in the region of £40 because the income tax on the allowance of £120 is something less than one-third, or 6/4d. in the £.  That seems to be rather inequitable and it also, of course, creates considerable difficulties, particularly in the case of orphans whom someone wants to benefit.  The benefit must be made so that it will never exceed £80 or a certain loss will ensue.</P>
      <P>In Britain, I am told the position is that if the income of the child goes over £100, instead of the whole allowance being lost, only a proportion is lost.  I must confess that I am not an expert on income tax law, and I am not certain how it is done, but I am told the British position is much more favourable than ours.  I wonder would the Minister look into that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has stated the position correctly so far as the facts go.  I am not sure if there is a sliding scale in England in similar cases.  Anyway, the way this has always been looked at is: It stood at £40 for a long time and if you take income tax as being a third, 6/8d. in the £, then £40 was as good as £120.</P>

      <P>That is how strictly we should look at it, anyway.  Actually, if one widow is left with children with no money fixed on them and this particular widow is left with children with money fixed on them, that is a complete addition to her income.  It could be looked at as being worth three times the income tax for income tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister is an optimist if he thinks he will put that across me.  It is rather fallacious.  That £40 becomes £80&mdash;it becomes £100 in Britain&mdash;and surely the British do not look at it as the Minister does, that if the money were £100, they are giving her the equivalent of £300 in tax allowances.  Anyway, it is considered desirable where there are children they should be allowed to have an income up to £80.  I am not arguing now whether it should be £80 or £100&mdash;I think it should be £100 &mdash;but surely it should be fixed in such a way that the person who wanted to give them a benefit would have a free hand?  If he is to give them a benefit in such a way that it must never exceed a particular figure, he is very hampered. He could not buy equity shares, for example&mdash;at the moment, I understand they are going down but that is not the question.  If a dividend went up unexpectedly, the whole of the tax relief would be lost and that would not seem right.  If it is to be done at all, one would imagine that it should be done on the basis of allowing an income up to £80 while still getting tax allowance and if it is more than £80, there should be a scale by which £120 comes down in proportion as the income goes up.  It seems to me that that would be a reasonable way of doing it.</P>

      <P>That particular point which Senator Hayes has put about the sliding scale&mdash;I am not saying whether it should be £80 or £100&mdash;has never been put to me, I must say, and therefore I never gave it my consideration but I would believe that all these things should be roughly the same as they are in Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section which sets out new rates of death duties, I should like to put to the Minister that the whole income tax code recognises the existence of marriage and gives relief for a wife and for children, but death duties, estate duty in particular, do not take any account of that.  Under the ordinary income tax code, a married man gets a certain allowance for his wife and an allowance for one child, two children, up to any number of children.  That applies also recently to surtax.  The figure for surtax incidence has been raised and you can now add to that figure, can you not, an allowance for wife and children?  Is that not so?  With regard to death duties, that is not so at all.  For example, death duties begin at £5,000 and if they begin at all, if the estate amounts to £6,000 or £7,000, duty is paid from the first pound.  Five thousand pounds used to be a very substantial figure. If 40 or 50 years ago, my father had left me £5,000, it would have been a very considerable addition to me, but £5,000 now is a very small estate. So indeed is £10,000 if the people left after a deceased person are a widow and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> It seems to me when a deceased person leaves a widow and children that there should be an allowance for the widow and each of the children before the estate duties are levied because there is an immense difference between the case of a man of 60 or 70 who dies leaving an estate to be divided between adult children and the case of a young man of 30 or 40 who by his profession or any other way has something more than £5,000&mdash;it is not difficult to leave more if you have a house, an insurance policy and one or two other things&mdash;and who as well as leaving that money, leaves a wife and two, three, four or five young children. It does seem to be unfair that the same estate duty should be levied on them as would be levied on the adults who have made their way in the world and to whom the money would in the normal way be a windfall.</P>
    <P>It seems to me they are quite different cases and in that case it would be simple to amend the law so that a widow, before the estate duty began to fall on her, would get, say, £3,000 and each child £2,000 or, say, £2,000 and £1,000.  But there should be a difference in respect of the estate duty payable in the case of the widow and dependent children, and I use the word dependent in the legal sense, that is, where they are under 16 years of age and are pursuing a full-time course of education at school or in the university, and that payable in the other cases and the estate duty code should make allowances for that difference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable merit in the case put up by Senator Hayes but there is one point which he overlooks.  When the estate is under £15,000, there is no liability for legacy or residual duty in the case of a widow and a family so that the legacy duty in the case of a person of the first or second degree would be have per cent. and in the case of an outsider it is ten per cent.  So that, in actual fact, a considerable saving is effected when there is a widow with a family. The rate of estate duty begins at one per cent.  over £5,000 and goes up to two per cent., but then if the estate is over £5,000, there is this additional five per cent. in the case of a near <Col N="1321" /> relative and ten per cent. in the case of a person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, legacy duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, so the State does take account of the point made by Senator Hayes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The case I mentioned, the case I have in mind, is the common case.  There are no legacies. It is the case of the man who dies between the ages of 30 and 40, or 30 and 45 and leaves young children.  Presumably, he leaves whatever he has to his widow for the benefit of the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator does not seem to appreciate that, irrespective of whether or not there is a will, there is duty payable when the estate is over £5,000, so that this question of an actual legacy or residual duty still amounts to the five per cent.  and the ten per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to express an opinion on a point like this. One is certainly very sympathetic to the case raised by Senator Hayes in regard to these estate duties.  First of all, there is a levy on the total amount left, no matter to whom it is left, and then there is the difference in succession and estate and legacy duties, according to the relationship of the person to whom it is left.  Senator Walsh has pointed out that there is of course a good advantage to the widow on that side, if not on the other. Whether it is sufficient or not, I do not know.  It is very hard to defend a lot of these things but they are there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to look into that point.  As he says, it is a point with which anybody will sympathise.  Since I became interested in it I have looked at various cases.  I know of a case of two brothers and a sister sharing a business.  One brother is married with quite a number of children and the other brother is not married.  Assuming they have the same amount of money, surely the death of the married man with the children would leave his wife and children worse off?  The death would be much more <Col N="1322" /> grievous in his case than in the case of the single man.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look at that point because that type of thing could be dealt with very easily and would not cost very much.  It would cost very little and what it would cost the State would be very little as compared with the relief it would give to widows and orphans.  The existence of a wife and children is recognised all through the income tax code and should be recognised in this as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, as I pointed out, the position of a wife and children is provided for in the succession and legacy duties.  I should mention one other point.  As referred to elsewhere in the Bill, a person can leave £5,000 settled and £5,000 unsettled and they are treated as two separate cases for estate duties and therefore might be free.  There is a third possibility, that is, that a man may settle an insurance on his wife of £5,000 which would be free of estate duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will realise that the kind of people who know all about that are old people with plenty of money but very rarely does it happen that the youngish man in a profession or business, in the Civil Service or anywhere else, has got on to all these devices and stratagems whereby he can defeat the various kinds of duty.  That unfortunately is better known to the very rich or older people rather than to the young husband and father.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister to consider this matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point in connection with stamp duty, not the point which I raised on Second Reading.  In Section 13 of the Finance Act, No. 2 of 1947, an alteration was made in stamp duties imposed on conveyances and so on.  The stamp <Col N="1323" /> duty was increased to the sum of £25 per £100, except to three specific types of people.  The first was an Irish citizen; the second was a person who is ordinarily resident in the State and who had so been for three years prior to 15th October, 1947; and the third was a body incorporated in the State on or before 15th October, 1947.  A good many people, as is well known, took advantage of the third of these exceptions and acquired land in the country by means of what is called a holding company.  Many of them, or some of them at least, bought estates and houses which might have become derelict and fallen into ruin, unless rich people from outside this country took them over.  Some of those people, I think, have done our State a service by repairing those buildings, putting them in good condition and employing a great many people on the land around them.  Now a difficulty arises under this section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Supposing one of those people who came into Ireland and bought property by means of a holding company now wants to acquire some land, to get some fields which would improve the agricultural value of the land, to round off a corner; in other words, suppose he wants to improve his property, not necessarily to any great extent.  That person, who may be doing the State some service, finds that one most important provision is left out of this Bill, important from his point of view. In other words, there is no allowance under Section 33 for prior continuous residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1947, if a person had been living in the country for three years continuously before the operative date, he could buy the land.  But, in this section, there is, unless I am mistaken, no such provision.  Suppose a man came into this country 10 years ago. He has bought the land.  He has been living continuously in the country for 10 years.  To put it crudely, he gets no credit for that under the Bill.  If he wants to extend his land by a couple of acres, he will have to pay the 25 per cent. stamp duty.  Perhaps I am wrong about that and if so, the Minister ought to tell me so at once.  I do <Col N="1324" /> not think I am.  It does seem to me to be something of a hardship.  Why was that previous continuous residence clause left out here when it was written into the 1947 Act?  It may be said that the clause would give too much loophole to these people, that they would buy up vast tracts of land, and so on, at the lower rate. I do not think that is likely.  I do not think it is the intention.  I think that in some cases this imposes hardship.</P>
    <P>I should just like to refer once again to a matter I raised on Second Reading, that is, where somebody has entered into a contract to pay for land, perhaps a year ago, but has not been able to complete the contract and whether he could not be exempted from the very greatly increased stamp duty.  I argued that at some length on Second Stage.  I raise it again now frankly because none of us has received the printed report of the debate of last Wednesday and unfortunately I was not able to hear what the Minister said in reply to the debate last Wednesday.  I should be very grateful for his comments on both matters now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Senator correctly, he has in mind the case of, say, a person who was more than three years resident here before 1947, but at the same time an alien and who did get land under the 1947 Act and would now like to extend it.  I do not think it would be in keeping with the spirit of what we are doing here, if we allowed that because we do not know where that might stop.  That type of person, having got that leeway, as it were, might buy any amount of land all around.  He might become a very big land owner to the detriment of smallholders around who would need the land for their own living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few changes have been made in this.  There is one change made in this where the Land Commission notify the Minister for Finance that they see no objection to such and such a holding being bought by an alien.  In that event, the Minister for Finance may exempt him from the duty.  There would be no objection to the type of person whom the Senator has in mind <Col N="1325" /> applying to the Land Commission for that.  The Land Commission might perhaps come to the conclusion&mdash;as they could, I think, under this section &mdash;that here is a person who is doing his duty as far as the land is concerned and there are another 25 acres, let us say, going beside him which would make a great difference to him and help him in his agricultural pursuits and they might say: &ldquo;Yes, we will allow this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, though, that was not the reason we gave this power to the Land Commission.  We found it so hard to define the types of lands that should be exempted that we thought the best way was to say to the Land Commission: &ldquo;If you have no objection, we will allow this.&rdquo;  What we had in mind there was the big house with some poor land attached. The Land Commission might say: &ldquo;We think, on the whole, that might be allowed to go.  Here is a man prepared to spend money on this and certainly it is not a proposition for any Irish farmer to take on a house like this with poor land and therefore we would be prepared to say it can be done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The point raised by the Senator the last night, and to which he referred today again, was that a company might have been in the process of acquiring land before the Budget was introduced this year and that they might not have found it possible to complete the deal by some date in April.  That was argued out very acutely indeed in the Dáil on both Committee and Report Stages.  The reason I had to oppose it was that I could not find any safeguard that would give me an assurance that some fraudulent action could not be taken under any amendment of that kind that might be inserted.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, as the Senator pointed out here the last day, that it is entirely at the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners.  We could hardly plead that there would be fraud, but, then, it is hardly a fair burden, if you like, to put on the Revenue Commissioners.  They would have to have something to guide them as to the things they should allow and <Col N="1326" /> the things they should not allow.  I think it would be unfair to ask them to use discretion in such cases.  I do not think there can be many cases.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in the Dáil, in many Revenue proposals, the same thing happens.  Every time we put on a tariff, a person may have, as often happens, a cargo on its way or even at the docks.  However, it cannot be helped.  He must pay up.  Once the axe falls in the form of a revenue duty, he must then pay up.  I know that in the 1947 Act provision of some kind was made but, as I pointed out to the Dáil, it was an entirely new proposal in 1947.  Nobody expected anything of the kind to come along.  Some time was given to those who had commenced proceedings to complete them. I do not think anybody could claim that he was unfairly treated in this case.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of controversy going on before the Budget. There was a great deal of speculation even in the newspapers as to what measures would be taken in the Budget to stop this traffic, as referred to, of foreigners buying land here.  Anybody engaged in the purchase of land for a foreign buyer must have been well aware that some measures would be taken in the Budget.  It was certainly up to him to be careful about any steps he might take.  I do not think we could accept any amendment of the law of the kind suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for what he said.  With regard to the first question I raised, can I take it that the Land Commission have discretion to exempt a landowner from the increased stamp duty, if the Land Commission agree that the amount of land to be purchased is in the public interest, so to speak?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of that.  I think that is a very reasonable provision and I think the case I had in my mind will be met by it. I entirely agree with the Minister in believing that legislation should be very firm in opposing any tendency on the part of people from outside the country to buy up large tracts of land.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second question, there is just one thing I should like to say again.  I do know of one case in which a contract was entered into on 11th June, 1960, nearly a year ago.  It could not be completed for various legal reasons.  That person would not have heard any rumours about changes nine months away from the Budget.  As I said on Second Reading, I do not believe there is any injustice here, nor do I think that this is unfair.  The Minister made it quite clear that in matters of this kind, you have to bring the hatchet down short and quick, no matter what argosy of cargoes comes into the port of Dublin.  But here is a case where a man has to pay the best part of £2,000, owing to legal complications which it would be impossible for him to avoid.  Perhaps there are other cases of that kind in the country, too, but if the Minister is certain that no really legal safeguard would prevent a risk of evasion or something of that kind under any provision here, I am satisfied, but I should like him to think once again because this man could not have heard rumours about changes nine months away from the Budget. Certainly, we have here a clear case of hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.D. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the point of view of Senator Stanford in regard to this matter of the 25 per cent. on the purchase of land by foreigners.  I think that duty was a very wise one when it was imposed because it served as a restriction on foreigners buying up land in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one angle to which I thought Senator Stanford might have adverted, that is, in regard to holding companies being exempt from this 25 per cent. duty.  I think that is subject to abuse. I know cases where holding companies were bought up.  As a matter of fact, if you take up the <i>Irish Independent</i><Col N="1328" /> or the <i>Irish Times</i>, almost daily you will see an advertisement for a holding company with ability to acquire land.  After all, 25 per cent. on every £100 comes to a considerable sum.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Government are alert enough in watching out for the purchase of these holding companies? It is generally known&mdash;and the Minister possibly knows&mdash;that that has been done.  Some kind of regulation should be made to ensure that such a practice will be illegal so that any man purchasing a holding company for the purpose of defrauding the Government of their lawful revenue would be prosecuted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell Senator Sheridan something of which he may not be aware.  The holding company was exempt in the 1957 Act.  At that time, as Senator Stanford pointed out an Irish citizen could buy land in this country without paying the extra duty, or a person who was resident here for more than three years, an alien. Thirdly, an incorporated company could buy land.  That has gone now. We are striking that out and no longer exempting the incorporated company.  That has gone since 20th April.  They have no right to buy land, for this purpose, anyway.  They can buy land for other purposes.</P>
