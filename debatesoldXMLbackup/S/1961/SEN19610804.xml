      <P>I have been discussing that question.  I think it should be possible to finish the business by 5 o'clock, if it is not finished before that. Of course, in order to ensure that we can do that, I think there should be some agreement in the House that we finish all the business before 5 o'clock.</P>

      <P>We could not agree to finish all this business.  If any thought had been given to the position of the Seanad and these legal Bills had been submitted to a Joint Committee of both Houses, we would now be in the position where we would have members of this House on both sides who could give us information of the experience of the Joint Committee.  We could pass the Second Stages easily.  If the aim is to finish the Second Stages, that should be possible.</P>

      <P>It is the aim to finish the Second Stages so that we can take the Committee Stages next week. These legal Bills are more of a Committee nature.  There will be more discussion on the Committee Stages, I think, than there will be on the Second Reading Stages.  I think the Civil Liability Bill, 1960, is the most important one.  It is the biggest Bill and it has already been considered by a Special Committee.</P>

      <P>I cannot say that exactly because we are tied to the business we have here.  It depends on the members of the House as to what length of time it will take to discuss all these measures which we have before us.  We have a job of work to do which has been presented to us by Dáil Éireann and we have to do it.

We are expected to take the Committee Stage of that next Wednesday.  Today is Friday and we will not be finished until 5 o'clock. What opportunity will we have to put down amendments, considering that, according to Standing Orders, they must be in before 11 o'clock tomorrow morning, Monday being a bank holiday?

    <Title>Local Authorities (Education Scholarships) (Amendment) Bill, 1961&mdash; Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as showing that the Government are conscious of the problem involved in making educational facilities available to all our people, although, indeed, I can only regard this as being a first step on the road to tackling a very difficult problem.  We are lagging considerably behind other countries in our appreciation of education.  We are not lagging behind other countries in the amount of lip service we give to education but when it comes to providing funds for education, it is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in a jet age when we come <Col N="1718" /> to discuss transport and such problems, but when it comes to education, we are living in the horse and buggy stage. This Bill is to be welcomed as the first step on the road.  The Bill as it is will result, after four years, in making £550,000 available for scholarships both for post-primary and university education.  The university share has been set at one-third, or £180,000, that is, £180,000 between some eight full time students which amounts to not more than £22 per head.  If we add to this the very small outside funds that will be available for scholarships from the universities, through their own resources or through endowments, it brings the figure to not more than £27 per head.  That is our target after four years.</P>
    <P>When we look across the Border, we become envious of their position because we find that in Queen's University, Belfast, 64 per cent. of the students have scholarships, of one sort or another, which range up to a maximum of £350.  In Great Britain, we find that the situation is even more discouraging because almost 90 per cent. of the students in English universities are grant-aided and while to a certain extent the grants depend on means, for those who have no other means, there is full university support with grants ranging up to £350 per annum.  We may take from that the average per student in English universities is not less than £250 per student, which means that our target is to provide only ten per cent.  of that and it shows how far behind we are in this respect. Other countries who prize the scientific development of their people have long since taken forward steps in education and we compare most unfavourably with those countries.</P>
    <P>However, we must be thankful that a beginning has been made and if we recognise it as only a beginning, we may perhaps see much greater developments in the coming few years. I am not to be taken as advocating that because in this Bill we have got only ten per cent. of the support which is provided in England that the solution should be to increase our scholarships up to ten times the amount contemplated in this Bill.  That would involve <Col N="1719" /> £3,000,000 which perhaps would be unreasonable.  Seeing that University education&mdash;and I am dealing with that aspect specifically&mdash;is something which is to be prized, the students themselves should in many cases continue to make a heavy contribution to the cost of their education.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in seeking to extend this scheme and to bridge the gap between what we provide and what is available elsewhere, might consider meeting the problem to some extent by making interest-free loans available to students in the next grade below the scholarship grade.  The scholarship grade, as I read it at the moment, will probably cater for the top 20 per cent. of our students when it is fully implemented but we have the students below that who are very valuable citizens and who, when they have completed their education, may be more valuable than the top 20 per cent. For the next 40 per cent. at least, some system of interest-free loans might be made available by the Government.  That would at least establish the position that no student of more than average ability would be without a university education due to lack of means, even if he had to pay some of the money afterwards.</P>
    <P>Such a scheme is operated quite effectively in Sweden and also operates widely in the United States of America through various private agencies from which students borrow the necessary amount to go through the university, realising that by increasing their earning potential, they will be able to pay back the money over the first eight or ten years of their professional life.  That might be a method of doing something for those good students who will be untouched by this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the choice he had available.  I would prefer to regard the present scheme as just supplementing what is available rather than solving the problem as a whole. As a supplement to the existing scheme by which the county councils and corporations provide money it is a reasonable supplement.</P>
    <P>I think the county unit is somewhat small.  Our experience in the university has been that there is a considerable <Col N="1720" /> variability between scholarship candidates from different counties.  It means it is far easier, scholastically speaking, to get a scholarship in some counties rather than in others.</P>
    <P>The scheme will treble the amount of money made available for scholarships to the university but the present value of these is much too low.  They should range from £100 up to £200&mdash; probably at a mean of about £150.  It is acknowledged to-day that the minimum cost of university education is £300 per annum.  Fees and books alone will take £100.  Then there is the cost of studying in a university city.  Certainly, one will not get any accommodation under £3 3s. a week plus clothing plus other expenses.  It will be seen, therefore, that an estimate of £300 is a very modest one and so you cannot regard the present average level of scholarships at £150 to those who have no other means&mdash;whose parents are earning perhaps £600 or £700 a year and many even less&mdash;as putting university education within their reach.  There is still a gap of £150.</P>
    <P>The first essential is that the value of the scholarship should be stepped up considerably.  I would suggest that, as the first target, it should be stepped up at least 50 per cent., to bring it up to an average of £225 or even higher. That would still leave a gap that would have to be met otherwise by students. If that is the case, it means that treble the value of the amount of money available would only double the number of scholarships.  I think that that would be as much as could be administered effectively on a county basis. Otherwise, the disparities between candidates from different counties would be much too great.</P>
    <P>Several Senators have advocated a system of State scholarships.  I am not altogether enamoured of that idea. What is it seeking to reach?  There would be a great deal of duplication. I think it is fair that scholarships are based on the Leaving Certificate examination, as most county scholarships are at present.  On what, then, would a State scholarship be based over and above that?  I think it would be far better if the additional money <Col N="1721" /> were made available to the university colleges themselves, the university centres, to disburse to deserving students according to their standards.</P>
    <P>One of the main difficulties you are up against is that the Leaving Certificate examination is only a very rough means of making the decisions on which students are likely to profit from a university education.  We find that the first year at the university is very often a far better criterion.  In the first year at the university, you have a uniform standard of teaching for all the students and consequently the students very often change their positions considerably.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about basing everything on the Leaving Certificate examination is the difference between small schools and large schools which can specialise in scholarships.  When we are looking at the results of our scholarship examinations which we conduct every year in July, we see the marks.  The next question we ask ourselves in assessing the candidates afterwards to see how they are likely to develop is: what school are they from?  You will find invariably that the specialised teaching in some of our larger city schools, and so on, can add anything up to 20 or 30 per cent. to the marks of a student.</P>
    <P>Consider a student who comes from a small school&mdash;some secondary top school, perhaps, where the teacher has to cope with perhaps two classes and where certainly nothing of the nature of specialised training is possible.  We very often find that these students blossom out at the university. Likewise, students who have been crammed for scholarship examinations very often reach a peak and fall off in their university performance after that.</P>
    <P>The plea I am making here then is that what we really need is that greatly increased scholarship funds should be made available to the university for disbursement at the end of the first year examination so that we could see at the end of the first year that any student who had reached a certain standard and, at that stage, had given clear indications of his ability to profit <Col N="1722" /> from a university course would get the help necessary to carry him through.  At the moment, we do a little of that but our funds are so limited that it is almost negligible.  A student coming that way has to reach first class honours before we can give him any support.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider that aspect of the case in extending this and to correct any hardships that may be entailed in making these decisions at Leaving Certificate level. Above all, I appeal to him to correct the inequalities as between the highly specialised large school and the small school in the small town that is doing such a wonderful job for us at present but against such odds.</P>
    <P>I take it that this scholarship scheme is not meant to solve the problem of post-graduate scholarships.  I know that some counties out of their generosity have continued scholarships for an additional year to enable students to do some post-graduate work.  I take it the present funds should be devoted to the undergraduate grade.  The Minister should make adequate funds available to the universities to enable proper post-graduate scholarships to be awarded.  At present, in University College, Cork, we have less than 11 per cent.  of our students getting any form of support.  In fact, only 19 are getting post-graduate support.  To that, we might add probably an equal number who are employed in some minor capacity in the university and consequently are getting some support in that way.  But, all in all, it amounts to the fact that we have barely got the equivalent of £5,000 or £6,000 available for post-graduate scholarships in the university.  The other colleges, and Trinity College, are in no better position. I appeal to the Minister to look into that aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>To highlight the insignificance of the £5,000 or £6,000 which we have at the moment, I should say that six post-graduate scholarships valued at £1,000 each were awarded by the California Institute of Technology to electrical engineering and applied mathematics graduates of our university. That is the number one institute of science and technology in the United States.  That gives the Minister and the <Col N="1723" /> House some idea of the quality of the students in our universities.  The House can feel quite confident that our students can hold their own with students turned out from any university in the world.  Despite the fact that the number of staff members and the money available for laboratories and so on is inadequate, our end product is a credit to our universities.</P>
    <P>One item which disturbs me is the ratio between post-primary and university scholarships.  As set out in Section 4, the ratio is one to two.  Of course it is a question only of dividing the cherry, but considerably more latitude should have been allowed to the local authorities who, after all, are providing 50 per cent. of the money. The section states that there shall not be devoted to university scholarships more than one-third of the total.  I take it that they could devote considerably less than one-third and still comply with the Bill.</P>
    <P>There may be regions where, with a rate of a few pence in the £, the authority concerned would be justified in giving more than two-thirds to post-primary education.  There are also regions where the opposite holds. When they come to decide between the two, the obvious question is whether or not the university education or the post-primary education entails living away from home.  We can take it that in most counties the vast majority of post-primary students will be able to attend at day secondary schools.  Consequently, they will be living at home.  All down the years, it has been recognised that they required less support than those who had to go away to secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Conditions are relatively equal in university cities like Dublin, Cork and Galway.  In Dublin, the students can live at home and go to the secondary school or the university.  Therefore, the Minister's reason that the cost might be in the ratio of one to two seems to be quite reasonable.  Then, we must consider the other cities.  In Limerick, for example, the post-primary students could live at home and go to day secondary schools, but the university students would have to <Col N="1724" /> go away from that city.  Therefore, a rate that is fair for Dublin city or Cork city is manifestly not fair for Limerick city.  I take it that Limerick Corporation is a highly responsible body which weighs very carefully the amount of money it has and how it should be subdivided.</P>
    <P>There are other counties in which the students can live at home and go to a day secondary school, but must go away to get university education.  Consequently, the Minister should have allowed more latitude to the local authorities.  I think the section should read that they shall not grant more than half of the total to university scholarships and preferably one-third. He could have indicated his intention, but latitude should have been allowed. I hope on Committee Stage the Minister will see his way to liberalising the scheme to that extent.</P>
    <P>After all, there has been a continuing conflict between the central authority and the local authority.  The history of the past 30 years has been one of suppression of the local authorities and development and expansion of the central authority.  We can see at the moment that the authority of the county councils and the corporations is only a trifling fraction of what it was 20 years ago.  They are continually being told what they must do and, in fact, 75 per cent. of the rate is mandatory.  This is a matter which could be entrusted to the good sense of the local body.</P>
    <P>I am not for one moment pressing the claims of university students as against post-primary students, because they are all from the same class.  They are all from the class which needs State assistance to climb the educational ladder.  It would be a pity if a student had climbed the ladder so far as Leaving Certificate and it was then made much more difficult for him to climb the ladder from there on.  The question of the means test and the necessity for support is far more marked when the student passes the age of 17 or 18 years than it is in the 14 to 18 year old age group.</P>
    <P>Very few students have failed to get post-primary education due to family circumstances.  That applies, certainly, <Col N="1725" /> to families in the range of £400 to £800, who have all the time been making sacrifices to send their children to secondary schools.  The cost involved is about £120 per annum, including school fees, food, clothes, and so on.  The corresponding cost to a university student is about £300. Therefore, while a family might be able to make the sacrifice for children in the 14 to 18 year old group, that family could not afford the sacrifice involved in the case of the university student.  I would appeal to the Minister to give a little more discretion to the local authorities in this matter.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see that the Minister said yesterday that the number of children is taken into account in assessing the level of means for scholarships. I welcome that announcement. I did not know that provision was there.  I hope it is general in its application.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extension of the 25 per cent. that is to be available without means test.  That is only right and fair having regard to the fact that 50 or 60 per cent. of those who are paying the money in rates and so on would come into that bracket.  It is only reasonable that they should be putting up some funds for competition, as it were, between themselves. That is to be very much welcomed as a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The situation may arise, Great Britain being so keen on developing her scientific talent, and so on, that very many of our young boys may go to England and succeed in getting scholarships to British universities. I do not think that would be an altogether desirable development if we have facilities to train these students here.</P>
    <P>On the question of technical school <i>versus</i> the university, there is the difficulty of a line of demarcation between the two.  There is always the urge on the technical school to reach out and provide, as many are providing here now, courses to enable students to take extern degrees from London University.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is on scholarships, Sir.  I am suggesting that scholarships would very often meet the case that is advocated for those courses.  The necessity is always a financial one and the case is made that the students could not afford to do these courses on a day basis.  We should not allow such reasoning to hold in future because if students are qualified to go to a degree course, it is a far cheaper and far better investment to make sufficient scholarships or grants available to put them through the day courses, rather than pay the staff salaries and provide the extra equipment and all the rest to set up what at most can be only second-class degree courses for such students and probably something that may divert the institutions giving those courses from their fundamental task of catering for the post-primary technical school needs and the training of technicians, which are of such importance to the development of our economy.</P>
      <P>I go some distance with Senator O'Brien and Senator Stanford on the question of a broad education but by &ldquo;broad&rdquo;, I mean that in our technical or professional courses, there should be a certain amount of the humanities.  We are endeavouring to do that because this is a means of training students in giving value judgments as distinct from mathematical judgments.</P>

      <P>We find the Minister has considerable powers under the Bill to reject schemes when the conditions of award are not what are desired.  That is a useful provision and I hope it can be used effectively.  Before deciding on those conditions, I would appeal to the Minister to get some committee together to discuss with his Department and others what desirable conditions would be because one of the questions that arise is under what conditions can scholarships be continued.  Under our present system, it has been the practice to insist that students should follow an honours course and should get honours in an examination.  That, of course, is a standard much higher than is insisted on anywhere else.  In fact, we have had to depart from it by accepting students who had passed in what were regarded as the very difficult fields like medicine, engineering, and so on.  The university, being jealous of the title of &ldquo;scholar&rdquo;, always suggested to the authority concerned that the grants should be abated by some nominal amount and the title should be changed from &ldquo;scholarship&rdquo; to &ldquo;maintenance grant&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there were students who failed and the scholarship lapsed.  What should become of the money that is liberated in that way?  I would suggest to the Minister that such moneys might be made available for giving continuation scholarships to second year students from that county who had performed satisfactorily in their examination. In other words, where there are two students from a county, one of whom gets a scholarship and the other does not and at the end of the first year, the student with the scholarship fails and the other performs satisfactorily in the examination, the money liberated should be given to students who have performed satisfactorily in that year's examination, in order of merit, within the county.  I would not like to see the money lapse altogether. Of course, it would be better still if the county concerned would give that <Col N="1728" /> money to the university to be applied to second year scholarships at the discretion of the university&mdash;in other words, not specifically tied to the county where the money was got&mdash;but given to the most deserving students available at that time.  That, of course, would even itself out over a number of years because we do not like to think any county has a monopoly of either brains or failures.</P>
    <P>One other point occurs to me.  We have had a very productive development in the past few years in making it possible for certain civil servants to attend universities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is: if such men are awarded local authority scholarships and are entitled to go to university on the basis of such an award and, at the same time, if they are successful in being appointed as meteorological officers or junior executive officers, thereby being entitled to go to the university, being given a certain amount of salary, are they also entitled to hold local authority scholarships or will the Civil Service Commission deduct local authority scholarships from what they would give them otherwise?  My plea is that in such circumstances, where a student has the means of going to the university from other sources, like these specific schemes, these sources should then take priority, and consequently the contribution should not come from the local authority scholarship.  That should be made available for other students.  In short, local authority scholarships should be solely for students who go, without any strings, to the university without having <Col N="1729" /> entered into commitments with any other bodies, whether State or private, to serve a number of years in their employment in return for certain financial aid during the courses.  I think that is a highly relevant question in this Bill.</P>
      <P>Most of the other points I wish to raise can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  Again, I wish to congratulate the Minister on accepting this principle. I hope that he will move to make the principle fully effective, as I have suggested, by a system of loans, by increased scholarships to the universities and above all, by a great increase in post-graduate scholarships.</P>

    <P>I have listened to all the speeches from the opposite side of the House and I am very glad that all speakers welcomed and commended this measure because it is certainly an advance on the scheme that is working at present.  I heard Senator Hayes and some others expressing the opinion that it would be better to make it a State scheme; in other words, to have the whole thing done by the State and eliminate the local authorities altogether. I would not agree with that: I think it is better as it is, leaving it to the local authorities to administer the scheme, because I think they are in a better position to examine the circumstances of the people in question, the circumstances of the parents of the children competing for these scholarships. We have, of course, heard several times here and elsewhere that we should aim at decentralisation in many of our activities.  That concept would be an acceptable one to many of us.  But if we were to follow the advice given to us here by some speakers, we would be going along the road to more centralisation.  It would be better to leave the administration of this scheme to the local authorities, as at present, and to make available more financial assistance, so that more children of poor parents would be able to avail of these scholarships.</P>
    <P>While I would agree with certain things Senator Quinlan said, there are others with which I would not agree. He suggested that the emphasis should be on scholarships for people going from secondary schools to the university.</P>

      <P>In any event, the point of view was expressed here that there should be more emphasis on making scholarships available for students from secondary schools going <Col N="1731" /> to the university than for post-primary pupils.  I do not agree with that at all. At present, it is possible for the students leaving secondary schools to get positions such as those in the Civil Service and the banks, whereas if we were turning out too many university graduates it might not be too easy for them all to get jobs, especially in their own country.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Senator Hayes advocating that a certain number of scholarships should be awarded to Leaving Certificate students.  There is a point in that, although, of course, it would require further consideration. As against that, we have to consider that if we gave scholarships to people on the results of the Leaving Certificate, that would eliminate other people whose parents might not be in a position to bring them as far as the Leaving Certificate.  A good many students do not go beyond the Intermediate Certificate Examination.  Many of them succeed in getting jobs after they have done that examination.  We must also consider boys and girls who have got a primary education and who have no chance of getting a secondary education. The more of these scholarships are given to Leaving Certificate students, the less there are for the other people.  On the whole, I think this question of awarding scholarships should be left an open one and we should not specify to what group of students they should be given.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan mentioned that there should be some test after the first year at university and that there should be a disbursement by way of scholarship after the first year.  I do not know if that would work or if it would be an equitable scheme.  If there is to be any test at all, it should be when people are entering the university. It would be wrong to let people enter the university and then prevent them from going ahead after one year. That is what it amounts to.</P>

      <P>We must always take into account the difference between an honours student and a pass <Col N="1732" /> student.  There are always many more pass students than honours students. Sometimes it happens in after life, that the pass student might turn out to be just as effective in his or her position, and sometimes more effective than the honours student.  It would be wrong after one year or any length of time during the university career of a boy or girl that any distinction should operate to prevent them going ahead for their examinations and entering the various professions.</P>

      <P>We always like to see more money available for education, if it can be provided without pressing the taxpayer too much. We always have to have regard to the taxpayer.  There have been many references to the taxpayer within the past few days.  As far as I can see, this scheme will work out to be a fairly generous one.  It is only a beginning. As time passes, it can be improved on.  In any case, it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any more I can usefully say on this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on this new departure whereunder the State will now give £ for £ to the local authority towards the administration of this scheme.  It is only right to leave the administration of the scheme in the hands of the local authority.  The vocational education scheme is left in the hands of local authorities and it has worked very well.  I do not see any reason for the departure suggested <Col N="1733" /> in the course of this debate in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care for the line taken by Deputy Kissane towards the end of his speech.  The fact is that this Bill provides that in four years' time, when Fianna Fáil will be leaving the problem to their successors, even if they win the coming election, £300,000 will be provided at that stage.  It will take at least half a year to organise so the sum of £300,000 will not be reached until 1966-67.  Not so long ago, we voted £22,000,000 for electricity generation.  I tried to get that sum reduced to £10,000,000.  The very idea of rationing electricity seemed to horrify some people.  The same people have no inhibitions at all when it comes to rationing the most valuable commodity in the whole world, education. In no country, except the most reactionary and the most primitive, is education as severely rationed as it is in this country.  That is demonstrably capable of proof.</P>
      <P>Let us consider for a moment the position in the most extreme right-wing country, in the situation as we see it, the United States of America. There, they have had free liberal arts colleges as far back as one can go. There has been complaint sometimes that the standard is not very high but, on top of those, they have their graduate schools&mdash;the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the graduate school of Harvard, and Caltec in California.  They have been grafted on to the liberal arts colleges and, if a man has had a rather poor primary and secondary education, he can in those colleges develop his mind to the required standard and then go on to the higher institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan is, generally speaking, accurate.  When this scheme is fully implemented in 1966-67 we will have about 2,500, taking 200 as a reasonably average figure, students receiving awards.  That represents about 20 per cent.  I suspect it will be much less than 20 per cent.  It will be an improvement on the present position, but in University College, Dublin, the number of students assisted is at <Col N="1734" /> the moment well under 10 per cent.  I do not like to be too precise about it, but the authorities are co-operative if difficulty arises.  If a good honours student is in difficulties they will always abrogate his fees and give him free courses for a year.  The fees vary from £50 to £70, or £100, depending upon the Faculty.  Senator Quinlan gave the figure of 11 per cent. for Cork.</P>
    <P>Compare the position here with the position in Britain.  In Oxford University one finds the antithesis of the position here; 93 per cent. of the students at Oxford are in receipt of assistance of some sort.  The position in University College, Dublin, is that there is that top five per cent. who get reasonable awards.  One would be justified then in going to the next 40 per cent. that Senator Quinlan mentioned after the top 20 per cent., but I should not like to go quite as far as that.  If we could get the top 20 per cent. attended to, that would be a start.  It will be a long day, I am afraid, before that top 20 per cent. will be attended to.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to see the Minister&mdash; perhaps he was being pinpricked&mdash; descend to the piece of rubbish he did at column 1738 of the Official Report of the Dáil on 25th July last.  He said that in 1958 &ldquo;The problem was whether they would be able to pay the teachers.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>All right.  I withdraw the word &ldquo;lousy&rdquo;.  It is a perfectly modern word but if we, in the Seanad, are to keep up with the customs of the 18th century, then I withdraw the word &ldquo;lousy&rdquo; in deference to you.  It is a completely false and untrue statement and, no matter how much the Minister may have been pinpricked, he should not have made it.  He cannot wrap that cloak around him in July, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very serious matter. Senator Quinlan's contribution, though he may have spoken at some length, was certainly the best contribution to this discussion so far because he really got down to the mechanism of the problem, to the philosophic, mathematical physics of it, if I may so describe it.  It is a dynamic problem and the Senator applied his mind to it in the mental environment of his own professorship.  He asked why, if we cannot have a scheme of scholarships for a big number of our people, we could not have interest-free loans, a system that has been developed very satisfactorily and to a very large extent in Harvard University.  If the Government can throw millions around for other purposes in the legislation which has been streaming through this House during the past month, I see no reason why they cannot <Col N="1736" /> set up a fund of £1,000,000 which would go much further in regard to education than in creating electricity generating plant.</P>
    <P>There is the problem of good students getting into financial difficulties in their second, third or fourth year, through no fault of their own.  It may be that the father dies, and it is true the colleges do help such students, but their resources are limited.  During the discussion last year when I thanked the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education, who was not present, for the monies they have made available for higher education, it was suggested by Senator Carter that some people thought we had too much education and we were exporting too many educated people.  I do not suppose it is necessary to answer that.</P>
    <P>In order to bring home to the Seanad the seriousness of this problem, I want to ask a question.  We have four or five university colleges in this State. Is there a single son or daughter of an agricultural labourer receiving education in any one of those institutions? I can answer categorically that there is not a single son or daughter of an agricultural labourer receiving education in any one of those colleges.</P>

      <P>Five per cent. of the occupied people of this country are agricultural labourers.  The Lord distributes his mental gifts without regard to where people are born.  I do not know of a single instance of a son or daughter of an agricultural labourer attending any university college.  Moreover, 100,000 or 10 per cent. of our working population are transport workers. The son of a transport worker attending the university is a <i>rara avis</i>, a white blackbird.  You do meet them &mdash;they may be doing engineering or something like that &mdash; but they are rare although 10 per cent. of our working population are transport workers. There is in this country a huge number of under-privileged people, to use a word that has become current to describe them.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinlan that this is a most complicated problem. Long ago it used to be accepted that only those who came from a good mathematical school would do well in physics or mathematics.  I am told by professors in these subjects that a student of whom they are doubtful about letting on even at the first year often does better and better as the years go on.  That is a normal feature where that student has been to an inferior school.  To that extent the proposal the Minister has made here, that the matter should be left to the local areas, is a good one.  I should like to see these scholarships won on the Leaving Certificate examination.  It is dreadful to see young lads doing three or four examinations at the end of their school course.  They do their Leaving Certificate; they do a scholarship examination and, perhaps, the executive officers examination for entry to the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of that is that they are so completely burned out that they never do anything constructive for the rest of their lives.  It is like running a two-year-old horse in 40 races.  Therefore, I would like these scholarships to be won on the Leaving Certificate. However, that would give predominance to a limited number of schools who have a system of cramming and <Col N="1738" /> coaching to prepare students for the examinations.  That system would not produce the right people.  Provision for the system suggested by Senator Quinlan is needed.  That system is very much used at the best universities in England, of interveiwing candidates and deciding whether they have potentialities which are not apparent from the ordinary record.</P>
    <P>I was very much taken by the contribution of Senator Cole last night. I agree with him and was delighted to hear his comments.  He said in his experience there is no complaint in the local authorities about provision for education.  That is perfectly true. The local representatives are far ahead of the politicians, and public opinion has been far ahead of the political Parties in this matter.  It may be the influence of what is done in other countries.</P>
    <P>I should like for a moment to refer to a subject which has run through the debate, that is, whether the classics or mathematics and modern technological subjects are more suitable for the modern world.  I have quite a specific view about the classics.  The classics are really out of it; they are a luxury.  There was a most interesting confirmation of that last Sunday from Andrew Schonfield writing about the present position in Britain.  He said the men in the Treasury are not receptive of new ideas.  Of course, they are almost 100 per cent. recruited from the classical school at Oxford.  That kind of training makes people very accurate about facts.  They are extremely observant and as regards the written word, they will never make a slip or put a comma astray.  From my observation, I would say very often you do not get much constructive work from them.</P>

In the universities it is confined, on the whole, certainly in U.C.D., to clerical students.  Pure mathematics is a far more realistic subject for the <Col N="1739" /> modern world because it is basic to physics, chemistry, engineering and to a great extent to economics.</P>

I am glad to say that we find in University College, Dublin, in the large Faculty of Commerce big numbers of the sons and daughters of people in commerce and people in industry.  On the whole, I think that for people going into industry&mdash;modern life is so complicated&mdash;it is desirable that they should get that kind of abstract training in regard to the matters they will be engaged in for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>As between mathematics, the classics and law in relation to the modern world, up to recently the mathematical side of economics has been neglected in all our university colleges.  However, that is being attended to now.  I regret that we had two distinguished professors last night leaning heavily on the side of classical learning.</P>

      <P>It was developed at some length last night but I will leave it.  All the emphasis in our scholarships system up to the present has been on an élite group.  The modern world is the great age of the <Col N="1740" /> common man.  What I should like to see is a much bigger group of ordinary people.  What Senator Ó Ciosáin said is true, that you frequently find men &mdash;and women, too&mdash;who, whether they put such tremendous effort into it, seem to get a really outstanding degree at the university and never do anything in an original way afterwards. In that connection, I might tell a small story.  It will not take long.  An uncle of my own told me about Maynooth when he was there. He said that men who got honours never did well, whereas some very readable and likeable books were written subsequently by ordinary pass students.  One would expect honours men to write books.  That is the natural thing to expect from them. But very often you meet people who were pass students at university level who became excellent in after life, as Senator Ó Ciosáin said.</P>
      <P>It is only necessary to point to the fact that, in our State at any rate, the most successful of our semi-State bodies have been staffed by engineers and graduates of commerce.  Their training seems to be more suitable for the practical affairs of the world.  That does not quite answer it because medical people have to attend to their own business, such as those who come into administration or politics.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, of course.  There is no question about that.  I had intended all the time to say that I welcome the Bill unreservedly.  It is very often necessary to start off in a comparatively small way.  Mind you, we have had other parts of the system here.  You had the new Agricultural Institute working up to an annual expenditure of £750,000 a year in about two years.  There are various other examples of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It looks strange in that context that the Department of Education &mdash; I suppose the oldest Department in this country &mdash; is so conservative.  The Minister for Education here &mdash; I think this also applies to all Ministers for Education &mdash; has altogether too much respect for the Minister for Finance. I should like to see a more go-ahead approach, a broader approach to this subject.  If this framework is the correct <Col N="1741" /> framework &mdash; and I take it that the Department and the Minister have given great thought to it &mdash; I was trying to work out an amount of money by comparison with the £300,000 mentioned in this Bill, a much more suitable sum of money.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why people do not look ahead.  I take it that the campaign for the elimination of bovine tuberculosis will be over in a couple of years.  There is a net sum of £5 million a year going into it at the moment.  The Minister for Education will find many people in the semi-State bodies anxious to grab that money for super jet planes and various other forms of activity that should not take precedence over education.  He will find many people who already probably have their eyes fixed on it. Why does the Minister not put his eye on a great deal of that money?  It is not the only thing.  Rural electrification is drawing to a close after being long delayed.</P>

      <P>It was long delayed. I think one piece of backchat in one speech is enough.  The Minister deserves credit for bringing in this much, but he would have deserved more credit had he done it two years ago and not just before an election when it is felt that education would be a very serious subject, that is to say, education in this sense.  It is at that end you will have all the impact, as to what assistance is being given to students by comparison with other countries.  I suppose that, with the exception of the extremely reactionary countries and the primitive countries in Africa, we are the worst in the whole world.  We are certainly the worst in the whole western world and a great deal worse than Russia.  It applies in both spheres, the amount of assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come to the conclusion that education is like transport. Everybody is an expert at it. We heard a lot from the educators and the educated but the Minister will excuse me if I approach the problem rather from the point of view of that very large section of the community who have been unable to avail of the education which would be to their benefit.  I think we all agree on the importance of education.  I should hope we would all agree that the great progress we are making as a nation in regard to education is too slow.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that by way of criticism of the Minister.  I think successive Governments have done too little in regard to education.  Our progress as a nation, since we achieved our independence, has been remarkable in many fields but I do not think it is remarkable in regard to education.  I think that at this stage we should have reached the position where we would be providing free post-primary education for all the children.  We are not doing this.  What is provided in this Bill is puny in the context of what we should be providing and particularly so in the context of the situation we face in regard to entering the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>I have not much information about what is done in regard to education in the Western European countries but I have knowledge, through my trade union work, of what the position is in the United Kingdom.  I am of the firm conviction that we are not doing enough with regard to education here. Having agreed on the importance of education, I hope we can all agree that sufficient is not being done and that more will have to be done.  It may be said that we cannot afford free post-primary education for all the children of the nation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall leave that point.  We come to the question of scholarships, and from what I know of the problem, there are four difficulties. First, the scholarships are too few in number; secondly, they are too low in value; thirdly, they are unequal in their application between counties; and fourthly, they are unequal in their application between different groups of the community.  The Minister can say that this measure will somewhat lessen my complaint in regard to the first point, that there will be more scholarships than at present.  That is bound to be one of the results of this measure.  Secondly, I suppose their value can be increased somewhat. Because of that, I welcome the Bill, while saying that it is very puny and late in the field.  The other two points can be met by some assurance from the Minister.</P>
      <P>I remember some years ago the Irish Conference of Professional and Services Associations investigated the problem of scholarships throughout the country and how they affected children of members of affiliated organisations.  As far as I can remember, as well as criticising the fact that there were too few and that their value was too low, they made some other points.  The first was that scholarships were unevenly distributed throughout the country, that some counties provided a fair number of scholarships while neighbouring counties provided practically none.  I hope the Minister by providing the finances envisaged under this measure will even up that inequality and remove that complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other complaint was in regard to the application of scholarships within a county.  The examination disclosed that different measurements were applied in different counties.  You could have the situation that the son of a transport worker, as mentioned by Senator O'Donovan, might be unable to qualify for a scholarship in one county under its means test, while the son of a farmer, who would be regarded as a well-to-do farmer could qualify.  In the adjoining county, the position would be different.  There was <Col N="1744" /> no way of equalising the comparative means of a farmer and an industrial worker.</P>
    <P>It would seem that in many cases there was a tendency towards allowing the son of a well-to-do farmer to qualify, whereas the son of an industrial worker or of an office worker could not qualify, even though anybody familiar with the situation would see that the measurement was not fair to the industrial or clerical worker.  I hope the Minister, through the powers he is taking under this measure, will be able to deal with that inequality and see that there is a fair way of applying the means test for scholarships between the various groups within the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would probably be risky for a non-university professor to get involved in this argument about the two poles.  I would deplore the polarity and it has been deplored before in this House.  I think everybody will agree that the scientists have other attributes than what we usually consider to be attributes of scientists.  I always imagined a scientist as detached, searching for the truth, marshalling his facts and being very reasonable.  I think they are not always like that.  The humanists are often much nearer to that picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to get through this without raising any hares that I do not have to.  I should like to answer all the points as fully as possible.  As I said at the beginning, this is only a step, but the course which the debate has taken makes it necessary for me to put the step in the context of what has happened in other ways.  The £300,000 is to be provided in four years' time. The four years' delay, as Senators will appreciate, is not because we are postponing payment, but because when you develop a scholarship scheme, you have to allow for the fact that students will spend four years in the school or university.  The scholarships given this year will have to be paid again next year, and in the third year and in the fourth year.  New scholarships will be added on to this year's scholarships, and new scholarships in the third year will be added on to those for the first <Col N="1745" /> two years, and the same applies to the fourth year.  At the end of four years, students will be leaving, so that it is at the end of four years that you reach the maximum in a scholarship scheme. You must think in terms of the full scheme, fully developed, and with the full expenditure.  That accounts for the fact that it will not be reaching the full expenditure until four years after being put into effect.  It is not to delay the payment.</P>
    <P>The step is one of many.  It is a State commitment costing £300,000 which, on its own, would be very little. Senators will appreciate that in the past four years there have been other commitments in education.  University members will know that we have undertaken the transfer of one of the colleges at an expense of about £7,000,000.  We have doubled the school building programme; we have increased the number of teachers in the schools&mdash;their salaries have increased; we have a new technical college in Kevin Street at a cost of £1,000,000 to which we are committed; we have a college at Bolton Street at £500,000; and we have a new training college to which we are committed. All in all, apart from these large capital sums running into several millions, the actual expenditure of my Department on education has gone up by £4,000,000 since four years ago, so we are spending annually £4,000,000 more, apart from the other capital works.</P>
    <P>If Senators are worried about the efforts being made in education because of this £300,000 for scholarships, I would point out that it is part of a very much larger sum and fitting into the context of the expenditure of that very much larger sum and also into the context of my intention and hope that as money is available, we will spend very much more money on education in the future.  That perhaps answers the point made by the Senator who said that this £300,000 is an estimate of our interest in and concern for the education of youth.  Our concern can be estimated by the fact that we have raised the expenditure on education by £4,000,000 annually and also committed the State to several <Col N="1746" /> million pounds invested in education and intend to continue to do that as the money is available.</P>
    <P>When we compare the moneys we have available for scholarships with similar moneys in other very much richer countries than ours, I would remind Senators not with a view to giving them the impression I am satisfied but so that they will be less worried that we have a very heavily subsidised post-primary education in the country, even if it is not completely free.  The Department pay the most part of the salaries of teachers in secondary schools and they pay a capitation grant for each pupil, as well as the commitment of about a global two-thirds of the expenditure in vocational schools.  It is not a neglected facet.  If education is not completely free, we have a heavily subsidised system side by side with what will be made available completely free through these scholarship schemes.</P>
    <P>I want to give a picture of what this scheme will do.  Somebody asked me to give more statistics.  All round, it will give more money, depending on the local authorities making full use of the provisions of the Bill.  The overall annual amount for university scholarships can be increased from at present £60,000 to £180,000.  There will be three times the amount of money available for scholarships to universities and the overall annual amount for post-primary scholarships, if local authorities make use of the Bill, will increase from £90,000 to £360,000.  Therefore, there is a very big increase in the amount of money available for scholarships.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Senator who said I neglected to give the figures of how many would benefit must have had his tongue in his cheek.  It is obvious that the numbers will depend on the value of the scholarships.  If, for post-primary scholarships, we take a figure of £50 as being a scholarship to a secondary school, we can have 5,400 extra scholarships to post-primary schools, apart from university scholarships, that is, if you want to reduce it to figures like that.</P>

      <P>These will be additional to what is there already.  There was one county in which there was an imbalance between the amount for university and for post-primary scholarships.  It has been used right through as an argument or maybe it has given the impression that there will not be a benefit to the universities. There will be an all-round increase from £60,000 to £180,000.  If Senators are interested in the amount for each county, I can give some figures for university scholarships.  What would be possible under the Bill will be what I shall read out because it would depend on the local authority making use of the Bill.  Carlow County, at present £500, to increase to £2,067; Cavan, £1,800 to increase to £3,500; Clare, at present £600 to increase to £4,200; Cork County, at present £2,300 to increase to £14,200; Cork city, at present £1,200, to increase to £3,800.  Almost every county will show a big improvement.  If the Seanad desires it, I can have these figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The first power I took was to set a relation between the amount spent on post-primary and the amount spent on university education. If we had unlimited funds, that would not be necessary.  With a limited fund, we had to find out how many in a normal population, in Ireland, and in some other countries, go to secondary schools and to the university.  We found the proportion was about 8:1. So that, for every one university scholarship there should be eight post-primary scholarships.  Then, to reduce that to a cost, we discovered that here in Ireland the cost of a university education is about four times the cost of a post-primary education.  So, to give one for every eight it meant giving four to eight in the question of money because the one costs four times as much as the post-primary.  That gave a proportion of 2:1 in the distribution of the fund, one-third to the university, two-thirds to post-primary education. That was reached after a study of the normal proportion of people taking post-primary education to people taking university education in a free society and it was based on the cost of each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why I should like to state that is that to increase the amount of money going to the universities, you will have to do so at the expense of the fund for post-primary education.  If you do that, you will be giving university scholarships to people whose parents can afford post-primary education. You will be giving university scholarships to those people at the expense of the child who would otherwise have got post-primary education in this way. You will be taking the money from the post-primary poor student who would get post-primary education from a scholarship and making it available to a better-off child, who already could afford the post-primary, and giving him a chance of university education.  I do not think it would be fair.  If it could be done without taking the money from the post-primary <Col N="1749" /> education fund, I should very much like it.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes raised the point that a State scheme would have a better chance of getting the best brains in the country.  He felt that in one county a very clever lad might be in competition with other very clever boys while in another county a less clever boy would be a scholarship winner, although he might not be able to compete in the first county.  I am informed that with separate scholarships that unevenness has disappeared.  That argument may have been valid when Senator Hayes was at school 20 years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <P>Senator O'Brien mentioned the Commission on Higher Education. I would not hold up what I thought was a necessary progressive step because of the sitting of the Commission. Their terms of reference are wide enough to allow them to make any suggestions even along lines which I am covering.  We can also look forward to other bodies studying the needs of the scholarship scheme, the inadequacy of the amount of scholarships, the unevenness of the means tests and other anomalies.  It will be my aim to try to remove those anomalies. As someone wisely pointed out, I will have to coax rather than force the local authorities.  It may be a difficult task but I hope to be able to iron out many of those anomalies without seeming to interfere with the rights of the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the anomalies arise from the fact that we are dealing with a permissive Act.  The uneven distribution of scholarships between county and county will, I hope, disappear because of this provision of the £ for £ on a rate of 2d. and 30/- to the £ after that.  That is a built-in incentive to local authorities to make full use of the Bill.  It will depend on an informed public opinion and it will depend indeed on the co-operation of members of the House and of other public bodies interested in the development of <Col N="1750" /> education.  The fact that the Bill is introduced now, before an election, and not two years ago, may explain the changed atmosphere of the Seanad since the last time I was here.  I am grateful for the contributions made by Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. K. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Curragh of Kildare Act, 1868, divided the Curragh into three parts which were defined on the map deposited at the time with the Clerk of the Peace for County Kildare.  The three divisions were</P>
      <P>(1)  The Brown Lands&mdash;575 acres that is, the area on which a permanent military camp had been established in 1858 and over which rights of common grazing were suspended by the Act.  Such rights over the entire Curragh were appurtenant to grants by the British Crown of certain lands surrounding the Curragh, which had come into the hands of the Crown on the dissolution of the monastic institutions in Ireland.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Blue Lands or Rifle Ground &mdash; 463 acres: this area, though it remained subject to the rights of common grazing, could be used for musketry and rifle practice and other military exercises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The Green Lands, representing the balance, were to be used primarily for the common grazing of sheep but could also be used, in part, by the Irish Turf Club for horse racing and training and to a more limited extent than the Blue Lands for military purposes such as <Col N="1751" /> reviews, drills and, in cases of emergency, temporary encampment.</P>
    <P>The Act provided for the appointment of a Ranger and Deputy Ranger to administer the Curragh but placed the Camp area in the control of the British Secretary of State for War for as long as it might continue to be required for military purposes.  This area is administered by the Minister for Defence and was vested in him by deed of conveyance in 1957.  The Blue Lands and Green Lands are vested in the Minister for Finance and are administered on his behalf by the Commissioners of Public Works, two of whom fill the offices of &ldquo;Ranger&rdquo; and &ldquo;Deputy Ranger&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The areas of the three divisions for the purpose of this Bill are as follows:</P>
    <P>Brown Lands 771 acres&mdash;an increase of 196 acres.</P>
    <P>Blue Lands 815 acres&mdash;an increase of 352 acres.</P>
    <P>Green Lands 3,284 acres&mdash;a reduction of 548 acres.</P>
    <P>The addition of 196 acres to the Brown Lands at the expense of the Green Lands is comprised of&mdash;</P>
    <P>97 acres approximately, added under Section 11 of the 1868 Act which gave power to take in and add to the Brown Lands any portion of the Green Lands not exceeding in the whole 100 acres;</P>
    <P>60 acres which it became necessary to inclose for military purposes;</P>
    <P>39 acres approximately, which are now being added to the Brown Lands with a view to squaring-off the boundaries of the Camp area.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to the Military Lands Provisional Orders Confirmation Act 1898, right of firing over and right of user for rifle practice etc. of an area of 352 acres of the Green Lands were acquired.  This area, which, for all practical purposes, has been used as Blue Lands since 1898 is being so designated for the purpose of the new Act.</P>
    <P>The 1868 Act also provided for the constitution of three Commissioners to ascertain what rights of pasture, rights <Col N="1752" /> of way or other rights (except the rights of the Crown) existed in, over, or affecting the Curragh or any part thereof either by grant charter or prescription, to establish the ownership on those rights and the lands over which they were exercisable and what com pensation (if any) should be given to any party whose rights might be injuriously affected by the Act.</P>
    <P>The award of the Commissioners, which was made in 1869 was embodied in, and confirmed by, the 1870 Act. The award, among other things, listed the persons whose claims to rights of common of pasture were allowed and set out the number of sheep which each such person was entitled to graze. Many claims were disallowed or allowed only in part.</P>
    <P>The law officers have advised that, since 1922, the Curragh Acts have been largely obsolete and the present Bill is designed to remedy that position while at the same time preserving the various rights in respect of the Curragh which existed prior to 1922.</P>
    <P>One of the most important provisions in the Bill is that dealing with inclosure (Section 11).  In this connection the racing authorities have been concerned for a considerable time that the grazing of sheep has impaired the race tracks and gallops at the Curragh as a consequence of which owners and trainers have been reluctant to run valuable horses thereon.  Efforts to remedy the position by the application of fertilisers to improve the pasture merely resulted in a greater concentration of sheep on the areas involved and the racing authorities have urged that the only solution to the problem lies in the inclosure of the racecourse area. In order to enable such inclosure to be effected they have undertaken to secure the surrender of a number of sheep-grazing rights commensurate with the area to be inclosed (about 850 acres) on the basis of two such rights per acre.  They hope to have this done in time to prepare the race track for the 1962 Derby, which as Senators will be aware, is expected to be the best endowed horse-race in Europe.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is the usual &ldquo;definitions&rdquo; section.</P>
    <P>Section 2 vests in the Minister for <Col N="1753" /> Defence the parts of the Curragh not already so vested: following the proposed vesting the administration of the entire Curragh will be a function of the Minister for Defence.  The Minister's ownership will, however, be subject to existing leases, tenancies, etc., and the rights-of way, rights of common of pasture and other rights specified in the 1870 Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 7 and 8 are merely reenactments, in modern terms, and with appropriate adjustments to meet present-day requirements, of the corresponding Sections of the 1868 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 4 specifies, in modern terms, the uses which the Minister may make of the Blue Lands for military purposes. The powers of the Minister under Section 34 (1) of the Defence Act, 1954, are limited by this section inasmuch as the erection of permanent buildings on the Blue Lands is prohibited. This limitation derives from the fact that the right of common of pasture extends over the Blue Lands. Section 34 (1) of the Defence Act, 1954, provides that the Minister for Defence may use any land vested in or occupied by him for such purposes connected with his powers and duties under that Act and in such manner as he thinks proper.</P>
    <P>Section 5 prescribes the uses which the Minister may make from time to time of the Green Lands.  The Green Lands are the main sheep grazing area and while the 1868 Act gave the British Secretary of State for War some rights over these lands, his powers in regard to them were much more limited than in the case of either the Camp or the Blue Lands.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the lodging of copies of the new &ldquo;deposited map&rdquo; in the Central Office of the High Court and in the local circuit court office.  It also deals with the purchase of copies of the map.</P>
    <P>Section 9 exempts the county roads on the Curragh from the operation of this Bill save in the matter of vesting (Section 2), the power to close the county road through the Camp in an emergency (Section 3) and the power to lay sewers, cables, pipes, etc. (Section 7).</P>
    <P>Section 10 acknowledges and preserves <Col N="1754" /> the rights of sheep grazing over the Blue Lands and Green Lands making it clear that those rights do not extend to the Camp or to other parts of the Curragh leased or let for special purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 11 which, as I have said, is one of the most important sections of the Bill enables a part or parts of the Curragh to be inclosed and fenced to the exclusion of sheep but the exercise of this power is made contingent on the prior voluntary surrender and extinguishment of grazing rights commensurate with the area proposed to be inclosed.  At present the number of sheep (7,957) is somewhat less than twice the number of acres available for sheep grazing.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with the publication of notice in the press of intention to inclose.</P>
    <P>Section 13 enables the Minister to exclude or authorise the exclusion temporarily, of sheep from parts of the Curragh while race-meetings, carnivals, exhibitions, competitions or other such functions are being held.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 and 15 provide for the preservation of existing contracts, agreements, leases, tenancies, etc. and for the continuation of legal proceedings which may be pending.</P>
    <P>Section 16 enables the Minister to make bye-laws in relation to the Curragh and provides for penalties in respect of breaches.</P>
    <P>Section 17 repeals the 1868 Act completely and Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the 1870 Act.  The other sections of the 1870 Act are retained in order to keep in force the award scheduled to that Act, which constitutes a statutory record of the grazing rights.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is the usual expenses section and Section 19 is the short title.</P>
    <P>I hope that these points of explanation will help Senators to understand any matters of difficulty and I will be glad, when concluding, to deal with any other questions which may arise on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill and are in favour of its early implementation. The Bill is designed, first, to achieve the purpose of having <Col N="1755" /> unified control exercised by the Minister and his Department in contrast to the dual control operating at present between the Department of Finance and the Department of Defence.  Both have had responsibility for certain aspects of the administration of the Curragh since 1922.  I am in favour of unified control.  The second object is to preserve the existing rights particularly the right of common pasturage, in respect of the Curragh, while at the same time giving power to the Minister to issue a licence to the racing authorities to inclose, if necessary, a larger portion of the Curragh for racing.  When it is thus inclosed, it can be properly treated by the Turf Club to make it fit for racing, particularly during dry weather.</P>
      <P>It is agreed by everybody that the Curragh is the cradle and home of Irish racing.  It is a most important property in the economic life not only of County Kildare but of the whole country.  It is in the unique position that it contains our principal military establishment, is the headquarters of the racing industry, and at least 80 per cent. of the trainers reside and train their horses on the Curragh.  It would be no exaggeration to say that at least 90 per cent. of the horses trained in Ireland are galloped on the Curragh.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Curragh has been subject to the rights of common pasturage and, as the Minister told us, something over 7,000 sheep are grazed there annually.  We all agree that many interests have to be protected. It would be very hard to please everybody in this Bill, but the Minister is going a long way to try to meet the wishes of all.  We all understand the importance of the racing industry to our economy, the vital place it holds in our exports and the amount of employment it gives, more especially in the Curragh but also throughout the country.  Irish horses and Irish horsemen have brought honour and renown to our country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>And Irish horsewomen, too.  Anything that can be <Col N="1756" /> done to comply with the wishes of the Turf Club in connection with next year's big race meeting, should be done.  I am sure that is one of the reasons the Minister has introduced this Bill.  Next year's Irish Sweepstakes Derby will be one of the most valuable, if not the most valuable, to be run in Europe.  That is something to be proud of.  It is expected horses will come from England, Germany, France and America.  Who knows but perhaps even Mr. Khrushchev might be in racing mood by then and send over a &ldquo;flyer&rdquo; or a &ldquo;sputnik&rdquo; to compete. In order to maintain the very high reputation of Irish bloodstock, it is necessary to ensure that the premier flat racecourse will measure up to the very high standard that will be demanded.</P>
      <P>In the past, the Turf Club have had the right to fence off only a small area of the course, while the remainder has been wide open.  It was a commonage, sheep could be grazed in it and caravans and travellers with horses could be on it.  In other words, the Turf Club had no control over the major part of the racecourse.  As the Minister quite correctly told us, when they put extra fertiliser on the course, it only meant more sheep grazed on it and that it was trampled even more. The purpose of the Bill is to give the racing authorities control over the entire racecourse so they may ensure that, no matter what the conditions are, horses can race without any fear of harm.</P>
      <P>That is very important.  As one who has an odd flutter on a racecourse, I know that in certain dry periods of the year the fields at the Curragh have been very small.  The Turf Club could not be blamed because they had not control over the entire course.  If they have complete control over the entire course and can fence it in, sufficient grass covering can be provided in dry weather to enable horses to race in proper conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Curragh enjoys a very high reputation.  The Irish horse enjoys an even higher one.  Next year, we will have one of the richest races in Europe at the Curragh, thanks to the generosity of the Hospitals Trust.  For <Col N="1757" /> that reason, this Bill should have a speedy passage so that the racing authorities can take full advantage of the short time between now and next June to put the racecourse into the state in which we should all like to see it.</P>
    <P>The present condition of the Curragh is a disgrace.  There is scutch grass, gorse and furze growing all over it.  Governments are always appealing to the farmers to improve their lands.  It is often said that the Irish farmer is a conservative man, slow to adopt new methods and make improvements.  The best method of teaching is by example and there is room for an excellent example to be given now in relation to the Curragh. Perhaps the Minister would consider giving control of this area to the Agricultural Institute.  Certainly the furze and gorse should be removed forthwith and the fertility of the soil improved. If that is done, the farmers who have rights there will gain.  It is said that the Curragh grazes only two sheep to the acre.  Reasonably good land should carry four sheep.</P>
    <P>We are in favour of the Bill and we will do everything we can to ensure its speedy implementation.  All of us would like to see the Curragh as an area which will give edification to those who pass through it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. Ted O'Sullivan Mr. Ted O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was a small boy, I heard about the Curragh in both song and story.  Over 40 years ago, when I first saw it, I was very disappointed.  To a man coming from a mountainy area, it represented a huge plain, but unfortunately a wasted plain.  I have become better acquainted with it in the years that have gone and I have never been able to understand why it was permitted to remain in the condition in which it was.  I made enquiries about it and I discovered that it appeared to be nobody's business. War broke out in 1939 and we compelled the people to till a certain percentage of their holdings.  The Curragh was left untouched.  Some people told me the land was no good; it would not grow anything.  I drove <Col N="1758" /> round it several times and I noticed adjoining land producing excellent crops.  I found it hard to understand why the Government did not take some steps to take control of the entire Curragh.</P>
      <P>We have this Bill now and I presume this Bill will give that control to the Government.  I understand certain rights are preserved in the Bill and that may cause some confusion. The Minister put it on record that the Curragh grazes less than two sheep to the acre.  I hope it will not go forth that the largest plain in Ireland grazes less than two sheep to the acre.  I wonder is the Minister taking enough control in this Bill?  Possibly this is merely a beginning.  I should like to see some of the existing rights extinguished. It should not cost much to buy out rights on land that can graze only a sheep and a bit to the acre.  This is the most famous plain we have.  I am in complete agreement with every word uttered by Senator L'Estrange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. Ted O'Sullivan Mr. Ted O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surprised? That shows how often the Senator is wrong.  We are proud of our racing industry; I hope we shall be even more proud of it in the future.  Anything we can do to improve the position will, I hope, be done.  We are grateful to the Turf Club and the Hospitals Trust and the other interests concerned for what they are doing in relation to the Curragh.  I pass through this area twice in the week and it always pains me to see the furze and the gorse growing all over it.  It is inexcusable. Something should have been done in the past 20 years to improve the condition there.  Perhaps the Minister will now make a move in that direction.  Whatever Government Department moves in, the sheep grazers will not object anyhow.  A good move was made four or five years ago by the Department of Defence on the land at Kilworth.  The gorse that covered that land was removed but nothing has been done since.  They did not even sow grass seeds and that is an eyesore on the main road.  The good work that was started should be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> The inferior pasture at the Curragh can be improved.  It is a scandal to see the quality of the grass on Government property.  If this Bill does not give the Government sufficient power to make the Curragh what it should be, a national showpiece for the people coming from all over the world next year for this famous race, something should be done to ensure that it will not be an eyesore and that people will leave with a better opinion of the Irish people than they would have if they spent a couple of days at the Curragh in its present condition.  If sufficient power is not provided in this Bill, I trust the Government will look for the authority later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been interested in some of the suggestions made in this debate in regard to removing eyesores from the Curragh.  Some 20 years ago, an attempt was made to have these eyesores removed but at that time the military opposed the suggestion put forward.  I was in charge of the Board of Works at the time and I had to pull in my horns.  It would not be permitted but I hope the Minister who is now in charge of the military end of it will be able to carry out the necessary work to make the Curragh more pleasant to look upon than it is in its present state of neglect, neglect in the sense in which any ordinary farmer passing the Curragh must regard it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the carrying capacity of that land in Kildare should be limited to one or two ewes or one or two sheep.  Without great expense to the State, that land could be made to carry at least treble that number.  It could have been done at the time the Racing Board, or whoever it was, had the novel idea of fertilising the racing strips.  They left the rest of the Curragh without one ounce of fertiliser.  The sheep had more intelligence because when the fertiliser was put down, they grazed barer than ever the spots that were fertilised.  The whole thousand acres of the Curragh could be fertilised without any loss to the State with the extra grazing that could be provided <Col N="1760" /> and the extra sheep that could be carried on the land.  Some small rent could be charged for it and the State recouped for the expense involved in spreading the fertiliser.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any bad land in the Curragh.  There is neglected land, land that could be brought back to fertility at a very little cost.  I do hope it will be found possible to have the furze bulldozed and the land made suitable for grazing. It may be the military have a valid reason for their objections.  I did not question their authority at that time.  I merely bowed to the powers that be.  They had all the power and I had none.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word on behalf of the people who have grazing rights there.  I never met one of them in my life but I know they are industrious people, mostly Wicklow men, who at certain seasons of the year remove their sheep down to the Curragh.  I hope these men's rights will be safeguarded.  Furthermore, I hope when these powers are conferred on the Minister, the necessary steps will be taken to bring the Curragh into line with the onward march of the nation, endeavouring to get the farmers to improve their land.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject, may I say that public bodies are notorious for neglecting land?  If the ordinary person does not destroy the noxious weeds on his land, he is prosecuted and probably fined.  I should like to have a test case brought against Dublin Corporation, the biggest authority in the country, for their criminal neglect of some of the best land in Ireland which I pass every time I come here.  I refer to the land at Finglas just beside the E.S.B. station where some of the finest land in this country is to be found.  You would imagine at a distance it was covered with furze but it is a weed known in Irish as <i>buachallán</i>.  It is deadly poison if eaten by cattle or sheep.  Yet the civic fathers in Dublin are looking at that.  When the seeds ripen, they are blown all over the countryside poisoning people's land.  It is not fair to those people and it is not fair to ratepayers <Col N="1761" /> living in that vicinity, some of whom have complained to me on the subject.  I do hope there will be a noble example set in the Curragh and that we shall see fertility on all sides instead of ragwort and other noxious weeds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  It does appear that the amount of land being inclosed, around 1,000 acres, is rather small for the headquarters of racing here.  I believe that, with the increased facilities in regard to the transport of horses, this country could expand considerably its bloodstock industry.  Not only could it sell the yearlings, the raw material, as it were, but there would actually appear to be a market in America for trained horses.  I have seen the large tracks there and, like Senator L'Estrange, I spent a few months on them.  It seems that with the prices being paid for horses in America, the scarcity there and the high cost of training, we could have a considerable expansion here.</P>
      <P>Before the Minister takes any further steps in regard to the Curragh, I should like to feel that the possibilities for a great expansion in our bloodstock industry have been gone into. I have a feeling that, perhaps, the ploughing and so forth of parts of the plains might render them less suitable for bloodstock training in the future. It might be necessary, in place of the 1,000 acres, to have 2,000 acres or more.</P>
      <P>I agree that it should not be left in the semi-derelict condition in which it is at present.  A forward-looking plan for our bloodstock industry should be quickly drawn-up&mdash;a plan which would quickly bring all that can be made available of the Curragh plains into full production.  In that regard, the Agricultural Institute could well be brought in to make that portion of the Curragh a showpiece.</P>

      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of disturbing the harmony.  I should like to ask the Minister a few questions in regard to the present position of the Curragh.  Reference was made to green, brown and blue areas. I should like to know the extent of the portion of the Curragh which is being allocated to the Racing Board. There are runs besides the racecourse proper.  That is really the best portion of the land.</P>
      <P>Let me emphasise what the other speakers said in reference to the fact that when going through the Curragh, you feel you are travelling through a derelict place.  The whole appearance of the Curragh area is derelict, both to the right and left of the main road as you proceed towards Kildare.  There are portions of the Curragh which appear worse still.  I refer to those portions on the back road by the military camp.  It is a pity that the whole area of the Curragh should have been left in this condition for so long.</P>
      <P>In future, under whose control will the Curragh be?  Will it be entirely under the control of the Minister, the personnel of his Department and the Army or will it be partly under the control of the Board of Works, as we heard it was when Senator O'Grady was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance?  This dual control was a bogey then and it may continue.</P>
      <P>I assume that the fencing of the Racing Board section will be such that sheep can be grazed inside the Racing Board section of the Curragh.  I do not know of anything that would add more to the texture of the sward than to have sheep grazing on it.  Facilities could be afforded for the removal of those animals when tests for racing took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1763" /> Why did they leave the furze there at all?  The sheep lie down in the shelter of those furze bushes in winter time and when the snow comes.  The furze was of some use but it could not be anything like the service which would be rendered by thorn bushes, ornamental trees or even poplars which could be grown along the Curragh.  They would be far better than the furze.  The furze can convey no other impression but an impression of complete dereliction.</P>
    <P>The main road could be made spectacular. At the same time provision could be made to have shelter for animals other than the shelter, which is probably usefully provided sometimes, for the sheep grazing there at present.  Everybody will agree that two sheep per acre is a colossal waste of land.  If they had it in Connemara or West Cork, look what they could do with it.  It has been said already that what is everybody's business is apparently nobody's business.  Let us hope, now that the matter is being taken in hands by the Minister, that by this time 12 months, the improvement in this area will be evident.</P>

      <P>Will I be allowed to finish what I am saying? You would not allow the same facilities to pass from the O'Grady to the Ó Donnabháin.  My principal question relates to the extent of the Curragh which is being allocated to the Racing Board and the facilities which we hope will be provided for the Derby next year.  As Senator O'Grady said, the sheep showed better sense when the place was fertilised.  I hope that the grazing facilities provided at the Curragh will be sufficient to ensure that there will not be two sheep to the acre.</P>
      <P>I should also like to know how is the grazing on the Curragh set.  Is there a perpetual right of some sheepowners to graze their animals or is it set annually? I believe it is not set annually, but I am comparing it with the Phoenix Park which is in charge of the Board of Works and the grazing is set annually for cattle.  As far as I can judge, the Curragh is set under a different system and there are owners with permanent rights of grazing.  The point I am coming to is that if the Department of Defence improves the conditions of the Curragh for the maintenance and sustenance of sheep it should be fully utilised.  They should have a park ranger, perhaps a retired member of the Defence Forces, to supervise the whole question of the utility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a Bill on which I can adopt an attitude of complete neutrality.  Unlike Senator L'Estrange, the Minister and Senator Quinlan, who seem to have a particular interest in horse racing, I have not, but I am interested in the Bill and I can view it dispassionately.  The Bill has nothing new in it, except Section 11.  It would have been far better if the Minister had introduced the section which authorises him to take over certain parts of the land not already vested in the Minister for Defence, with Section 11.  Then the picture would be a great deal clearer.  This Bill relates to the Curragh of Kildare Act, 1868, and part of the 1870 Act which has to be continued as it confirms the findings of the Commission set up to find out who had rights of common and the extent of these rights.  The Schedule to the 1870 Act is a very lengthy Schedule and contains a great number of names and addresses.  You find that some people have the right of common of pasture for as few as one sheep.</P>
      <P>I should be glad if the Minister would tell us how the figure of 7,000 compares with the allowable number of sheep which may be grazed on the basis of the findings of the Commission in 1869.  That would give us some idea of the use to which the Curragh is now being put compared with the use to which it was put in 1869 when the Commission sat.  The Bill does nothing which will enable the Minister or any other State body to improve one blade of grass in regard to the present condition of the Curragh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing which the Bill permits is that under Section 11 the Minister is authorised to inclose certain parts of the Curragh, if the persons who have grazing rights consent, but if there is one man, with even one sheep, who says he will not agree then, like the old Diet of Worms, he can say no and that is the end of <Col N="1766" /> the project because there is no compulsion in the Bill in this regard or power of compulsion or any compensation provisions.  Therefore, if the racing authorities to which the Minister refers are unable to persuade one recalcitrant person with the right to graze one sheep, they can whistle.  The Minister seems to shake his head.</P>

      <P>I do not know about that because the right of common of pasture extends over a great area.  My recollection is that people have rights over particular strips of lands which may include several acres. However, the Bill, apart from that, does not give the Minister or any other State authority any right to do anything substantial in the way of changing soil fertility of the Curragh.  It seems to be a remarkable position that for 90 years, if my understanding is correct, no part of the Curragh lands has been ploughed.  I am not an agricultural expert but I think it is accepted that land which has been grazed for such a long period, and which has been left untilled, is ripe for acquisition by the Land Commission on the grounds that the land is not being properly worked.  No farmer who had his land in that condition for so long could resist an order by the Land Commission to acquire it compulsorily for the purpose of distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be appreciated that when the British Parliament, which would have had no great concern for the Irish farmer or Irish land, was enacting the 1868 Act, they did not have the same knowledge regarding the necessity for tillage in order to keep land in good heart.  Since that kind of knowledge came to our shores, some steps should have been taken, if necessary, by the compulsory buying out of the grazing rights, to make this land available for tillage.  These 300 acres should not have been allowed to lie fallow for such a long time.  There is nothing in the Bill which will enable the Minister for Defence to do anything in that regard.  While in the ordinary course of events, I have <Col N="1767" /> every concern for the small man, even the man with one sheep, I think there are circumstances which warrant the Government paying proper compensation.</P>

      <P>It is to be observed that a committee was established some time pre-1957 to investigate what could be done about these lands and how they could be fertilised.  The Minister for Defence in the Dáil said that that committee has not reported yet. <Col N="1768" /> That is a great piece of nonsense. One would imagine from that kind of statement that, since 1957 or an earlier date, the committee had, day and night, been worrying their brains, inspecting this, examining reports, devising new plans, amending them, and so on, and all the time working on the matter.  How many times and for how many hours has that committee met and can the Minister put some &ldquo;jiz&rdquo; into it to make it report soon so that the position of the state of the common which everybody condemns will be rectified at an earlier date?</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill that was not contained in the operative provisions of the 1868 and the 1870 Acts, but there is one thing that perhaps the Minister will be able to say something about at this stage.  There is a reference in Section 4 to the effect that the Minister for Defence shall not erect, or authorise or procure the erection of, permanent buildings on the Blue Lands.  Then in Section 7 the Minister for Defence is permitted to do a whole lot of works.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to consider whether it is necessary to define &ldquo;permanent buildings&rdquo;.  It seems to me that in some of the statues which one comes across from time to time a thing such as a manhole which the Minister is authorised to lay or to build could be regarded as a permanent building. There are also such things as electrical transformers which are erected from time to time and which could also be interpreted as being included in the phrase &ldquo;permanent buildings&rdquo;.  I think perhaps it might be desirable to clarify what is intended by &ldquo;permanent buildings&rdquo;, so that the authorities having charge of these lands in future will not feel inhibited in the kinds of necessary structures they have to erect on the Curragh lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might deal with Section 13.  The rights to common of pasture are being retained under this Bill but the Minister for Defence may apparently from time to time exclude sheep from particular portions by the erection of temporary fences.  Is it intended that the temporary fences shall be for prolonged periods?  Will <Col N="1769" /> they have any effect on the rights to common of pasture of persons entitled to them at the Curragh or will it be a matter of only a few days?  If it is only a matter of days, it does not arise.  In relation to State matters, things that are said to be temporary, like temporary appointments, can last for 10, 15, 20 or 30 years.  Temporary fences erected by the Minister could well last for that period, if the material could stand up to the weather.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to Senators for the manner in which they have dealt with this Bill.  I think it has met with general agreement.  That is understandable, in view of the main purpose of the Bill which is to facilitate the Racing Board in their efforts to ensure that the Curragh racecourse will be of a standard appropriate to the best-endowed flat race in Europe which will be held in the Curragh next year. I welcome the tributes which were paid to the generous contribution of the Hospitals Trust in so endowing that race and to the efforts of the Racing Board to ensure its success.</P>
      <P>The main point that was raised during the discussion was the state of fertility of the land at the Curragh. As has been mentioned during the debate, an inter-Departmental committee was set up in 1957 to investigate the problem of improving the fertility of the Curragh land.  It is not such an easy problem as some people appear to think.  Undoubtedly, the land could be fertilised and could be made more productive but the terms of reference given to the committee were that this should be done at no ultimate cost to the State.  The people with grazing rights there would, I am sure, be very happy to have that land improved so as to improve its carrying capacity but the question of who would reap the benefit of the improved fertility would be another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the committee have their report ready and that it is merely being withheld as some minor changes will be required in it due to the passing of this Bill.  I do not know that it is a fact that the Curragh can graze only two sheep to the acre. There is some reason to believe that there have been a greater number of <Col N="1770" /> sheep at times on the Curragh than there were rights existing for them. The 1870 Act which allocated these rights did so on the basis of the area of land in the vicinity of the Curragh that was owned by the different people who had rights, rather than by any advertence to the actual carrying capacity of the Curragh.  This system of grazing in common is mediaeval.  While the rights are held in that way, it is not a simple thing to improve the fertility and to see that the land is productively used.  However, the committee's report will soon be available and the question of improving the fertility of the land will then be gone into.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Grady said that the military opposed the removal of the furze at one stage when it was proposed to do something about it.  It is a fact that the Minister for Defence has certain rights over the whole Curragh area. The plains of the Curragh are used and can be used for the exercising of military troops, the carrying out of tactical exercises and other such exercises. If we have an Army, we must have somewhere to exercise them.  The only suitable place for carrying out certain large scale exercises is the Curragh and, in the carrying out of such exercises, the cover provided by furze, and so on, is of great advantage. I can see that there would possibly be some military objection at least to the complete eradication of the furze.</P>
    <P>Senators may take it that I fully agree that everything possible should be done to raise the general fertility of the Curragh lands, and to ensure that they make a better contribution to the economy of the country than they do at the moment.  It is a rather complex problem and, as Senator O'Quigley has said, this Bill does nothing in that respect.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to say exactly how near to the main roadway the portion to be inclosed will be.  I understand what is intended is that the present racecourse area will be inclosed. That, I think, would bring the fences fairly close to the road.  Senator Ó Donnabháin hoped that the type of fencing would permit grazing of this inclosed area, but the whole purpose <Col N="1771" /> of the fences is to exclude sheep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if this Bill will have any effect on that. The number of grazing rights at the moment is the same as it was in 1870, that is, 7,957.  Senator O'Quigley raised the point that if one man disagreed to a voluntary surrender of his rights, the whole of Section 11 would be ineffective.  That is not so because we have to get only a certain number of rights.  So long as we get sufficient rights to cover the 850 acres it is intended to inclose, that acreage can in fact be inclosed.  Even the man who has the right to graze only one sheep on the Curragh has that right extended over the Curragh as a whole, and not in connection with any one single strip. The right is to graze the Curragh in common, that is, the total area of Green and Blue land.  On the basis of two sheep to the acre, 850 acres would require the extinguishing of 1,700 grazing rights.  If they could get only 1,699 rights, they could inclose only 849½ acres.  That would be the only effect of failure to get the surrender of the full number of rights.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, nothing in this Bill to permit the compulsory buying out of the rights of grazing.  It is possible that that may be the only solution to the problem of improving the fertility of the Curragh.  Something like that may have to be done, but it is not proposed to be done in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see the conflict between Section 4 and Section 7.  Section 7 authorises the Minister to lay sewers, <Col N="1772" /> drains, water pipes, electric, telegraphic, telephone and other cables and pipes under, on or over the ground.  It is straining it beyond reason to suggest that because Section 4 prohibits the erection of permanent buildings, it may, in fact, prohibit the provision of such things as manholes in the construction of sewers.</P>
    <P>The provision in Section 13 with regard to temporary exclusion would be a matter of one or two days.  There is no intention, at any rate, of exclusion under that section for any lengthy period.  It would be used only in connection with such things as road races which occasionally take place.  Senator Ó Donnabháin raised another point about how the grazing is set.  The grazing is not set.  The 1870 Act confirmed certain rights which people had for a long time to graze sheep there, and those rights are tied to the lands they owned.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other point was raised that I should deal with and I ask the Seanad to agree to the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am still not satisfied that the Minister has dealt satisfactorily with the position in regard to permanent buildings.  What is the Minister's conception of &ldquo;permanent buildings&rdquo;?  If he wants to put up some kind of movable structure attached temporarily to the land, does <Col N="1773" /> he feel he is authorised to exercise power for that purpose under Section 34 of the Defence Act?  I am not trying to limit the Minister's powers.  On the contrary, I think the Minister in the exercise of his powers under the Defence Act should not feel limited in any way.  He should know quite clearly what he is entitled to do.  One view that might be taken of a structure or a hut would be that it was temporarily fixed to the ground, and on the other hand his Departmental advisers might say it a later stage to the Army authorities that it was a permanent building.  There might be a conflict between what the Army authorities feel they require and what the administration of the Department feel could be done by the Minister.  I wonder if the position is clear?</P>

The Minister for Defence has certain rights over those lands but the graziers, the people who have the right to graze their sheep on the Curragh, also have the right to graze over those Blue Lands.  Therefore, the Minister for Defence has not got the right to erect a structure there permanently but, if during range practices that might last for a week or so, it was considered necessary to erect a temporary structure to provide shelter for troops, or something like that, that would be permitted but the structure would have to be removed when the range practices would be over so as to restore the free grazing for the sheep over the Blue Lands.</P>

      <P>I cannot refer back to the Act of 1870 in connection with the right of grazing on the Curragh but when we are dealing with the present situation there, I fancy the Act must be out of date, that the right is hereditary coming down from 1870 to the present day.  I do not know <Col N="1774" /> whether it is the owners of the land in proximity to the Curragh or their successors to whom the allocation for grazing is given or is it in virtue of the land being there?  I do not know whether anything can be done under this Bill about this question of setting land in perpetuity, more or less, or about this perpetual right to grazing. Do these people pay for the grazing? I am thinking of the Phoenix Park for the purpose of comparison.</P>

      <P>They are not necessarily Wicklow men.  It is a hereditary right, if you like, attaching to the lands of those people who in 1868 owned certain lands in the vicinity of the Curragh.  These rights have existed since the disestablishment of the monastic institutions in Ireland and the 1868 Act authorised the setting up of commissioners to investigate the various claims that existed.  They allowed some of the claims and disallowed others.  The final award was that there were 7,957 sheep entitled to be grazed in different numbers by different people.  They were allowed on the basis of the area of land in the vicinity of the Curragh owned by these people, on the basis of one sheep per Irish acre of land in the possession of the particular person.  That appears to me to have been the basis.  These are rights that the people claimed to have existed almost from time immemorial and if it is people from Wicklow who are actually putting the sheep there at the moment they must be doing it by arrangement with the people who own the land in the vicinity of the Curragh and, therefore, own so many rights for the grazing of sheep on the Curragh plains.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is correct in what he said about the nature of these rights.  There is the right of common of pasture, what is known to lawyers as <i>profit à prendre</i> appurtenant to certain holdings of land. The manner in which these rights were determined in 1868 was on the basis of long user by the persons who claimed to have sheep there for upwards of 30 years.  I do not agree with the Minister that if a man had a right which was on the basis of one sheep per Irish acre that at the present time you can simply take in one acre for every two sheep that a man has a right to graze because the right to graze is a right which extends over the whole of the Curragh.</P>

      <P>That is what the Minister has said, that it extends over the whole of the Curragh, and if it extends over the whole of the Curragh every one of the persons who have the 7,957 sheep are entitled to say in regard to any part of the Curragh being taken over, &ldquo;I do not agree to extinguishing my right to have my sheep grazed on that particular part. <Col N="1776" /> That is the most luscious part and my sheep always grazed there and throve very well on it.&rdquo;  That, I believe is the true position but, of course, it is quite clear that the fellow with one sheep and even the fellow with 57 sheep is not going to be able to argue that point in any Court because pitting his rights and his money against the Racing Board or against the Minister for Defence would be a rather profitless pastime for him.</P>
      <P>We are doing less than justice in Section 10 and Section 11.  It would be far better to make a clean sweep and to say to all the people there that if they agree to extinguish their rights they will be paid so much for them. It would be far better to deal with the position in this way and, if necessary, to enact that the findings of the Commission which were confirmed by the 1870 Act would be modified to that extent, that persons could be compulsorily bought out if they objected. That would be a far better way.  I can see quite an amount of difficulty arising for the Minister and for the Racing Board under Section 10 and Section 11, if passed.  But if the Minister is happy in that situation, I do not see why I should disturb his contentment.</P>

      <P>I should make it clear that nobody will suffer by this. This clearly provides that there will be sufficient land still left for the number of grazing rights remaining.  It is quite clear that the basic owner of the common may inclose portion of it, so long as, beyond all doubt, he leaves sufficient pasture uninclosed for the remaining owners of rights.  I am quite satisfied that is the position and, as I say, nobody will have any lesser amount of grazing left to him than he has at the moment.</P>

      <P>At first reading of Section 3 (b), it seemed to me, as it must have seemed to many Senators, that the amount in question was the total fund.  I learned in conversation with the Minister that is not so, that this subdivision applies only to the new amount coming in, that the old commitments for continuing scholarship-holders are not affected by this Bill.  That is a point worth emphasising. Subsection (c) (1) says: &ldquo;an income of an amount exceeding such amount.&rdquo;  I wonder whether that wording is elastic enough to permit reductions for the number of children in assessing the income?</P>

      <P>I think both would be considered as income, in much the <Col N="1778" /> same way as property would be taxed in the case of a person with property and who was also an income-earner. In paragraph (1), &ldquo;income&rdquo; could cover income in salary as well as income from property, whereas in paragraph (2) which relates to a person with property but no fixed income, the &ldquo;income&rdquo; in that case would be related to the property.  I think in the case of a person having both, all the income will be fixed by the local authority as the income derived from the property and added to the actual income of the person so that a notional total income will be fixed.</P>

I read that paragraph &ldquo;property of a value exceeding such value&rdquo; as relating to rateable valuation of property.  Now, I gather that is not so.  The Minister says it is the income derived from the ownership of the property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Senator thought that in the case of a person with a combined income of a known sum and ownership of property of a certain valuation, where both figures, if separated&mdash;one under income and one under valaution&mdash;would be less than the figure fixed by the means test such person would escape even though his combined income from the property with his known income would be greater than the income of a person <Col N="1779" /> excluded?

      <P>That would perhaps be clearer as a description, but in fact I am advised it is covered in the way it is put in the Bill.  The case taken is that of a man with a money income below the level of the means test figure.  He owns property which gives him an additional income to his money income which, when the two are combined, would exclude him.  I understand that in estimating the value of income from a valued property £1 valuation is taken to equal £16 income and that the person assessing such a combined income can do so fairly accurately.  A combined income would come under heading (1) even though the income comes from property and from a fixed money income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to say how glad I am that this Bill is now about to pass and that I regret I had not an opportunity of saying so at an earlier stage.  I hope when the Minister comes to allocate the funds he will make it possible for these scholarships to be at as generous a level as possible, particularly in the universities.  I know that because the <Col N="1781" /> universities in Great Britain have got very much greater support from the Government than we can hope to have, because of their greater resources, their fees are correspondingly lower than ours in many cases.  This is a great burden on our people and rather an anomaly.  If we can ease that by giving generous scholarships, it would be in the long run very considerably to the benefit of the country.</P>
      <P>I hope when the local authorities are administering these grants they will make it possible for the scholars who are allocated to these scholarships, subject to their satisfactory performance in the universities, if necessary to prolong their stay there.  I am thinking particularly of professional students.  The professional courses in medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry and engineering are all now so crowded with detail&mdash;so many special little bits to be gone into here and there&mdash;that a student cannot give much consideration to the scientific aspect of these subjects.</P>
      <P>It has become usual in Great Britain for such students, usually the better portion of the class, to take some time off, about a year, to devote specially to the scientific aspects of the subject during the course of their professional training.  That prolongs their stay in the university and, therefore, is an extra burden on them which, if they cannot provide it out of funds like this, they will be unwilling and perhaps unable to undertake.  These are extremely important people from the country's point of view.  It is these people usually who are qualified to do research work in their professional subjects and to take up such aspects for public advancement at a later stage.  We have been very definitely contributing less than our share of people with this special training in our Irish universities in the past for that reason&mdash;that the burden of the long professional course is so great they are not given time off to do the scientific work at higher level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other thing I should like to add, and that is largely to support what my colleague, Senator Stanford, said about the allocation of <Col N="1782" /> these scholarships.  I am glad to hear from him the Minister is well disposed towards some review of the anomalies that have obtained in the past.  I feel in allocating these scholarships only two things should be taken into consideration: the ability and merit of the candidate and the wishes of the parents of the candidate as to the university he should go to under the scholarship scheme.  I believe they should be allowed to go to any university where the standard is sufficiently high.</P>
    <P>Speaking for the university I have the honour to represent, I think a consideration of the list of our teachers is sufficient to guarantee the adequacy of the training of any student who comes to us.  We take our teachers from all levels of universities in various countries.  We have a large number of teachers who are graduates and former members of the staff of the National University of Ireland.  We are very proud to have this wide selection of distinguished teachers and, on that basis, we can undertake that anybody who wishes to come to us under the scheme will be assured of an adequate training.  This university has a long tradition of participation in higher education and we are only too ready and too willing to play our part and do anything we can in furthering the interests of the country.  We regard this as a very proper opportunity from that point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has three principal objects.  First of all, it proposes to provide for the survival of causes of action on death. Secondly, it proposes to deal comprehensively with the law as to concurrent fault.  Finally, it proposes certain miscellaneous and important reforms in the law of tort.  As the Bill is accompanied by a full and detailed Explanatory Memorandum, I assume that Senators would wish me to confine myself to the principles involved in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill is concerned with the survival of causes of action on death.  It is proposed to amend the law to ensure that all actions except certain excepted actions listed in Section 6 will survive the death of either party.  At the present day, the application of the maxim <i>actio personalis moritur cum persona</i> is confined to the law of tort and the effect of Part II will be that all tort actions, other than excepted causes of action, such as breach of promise and defamation, will survive death. Damages for pain or suffering or personal injury or for loss or diminution of expectation of life or happiness are being excluded in Section 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of what I may call happiness damages has given rise to considerable difficulty in England particularly in view of the fact that the test to be applied is an objective one. Moreover, it has been said that the maximum amount that can be awarded is £500; and in assessing damages under the Fatal Accidents Acts in England account must be taken of any damages payable under the survival statute of 1934.  On a full consideration of this problem it seemed to me that what should be done was to give more damages to the dependants of a person who lost his life due to the wrongful act of another.  The dependants and not the estate are the real sufferers, and this all the more so where the estate <Col N="1784" /> goes to a stranger under the will of the deceased.  Accordingly, Section 49 of the Bill provides for an additional head of damages in a fatal case in order to compensate the dependants for mental distress resulting to them from the death.</P>
    <P>The total of the amounts awarded in any one case will not exceed £1,000. The amount for each dependant will be assessed by the judge and indicated separately in the award.  The idea of providing compensation for mental distress will be completely new to the common law and the relevant provisions in Section 49 will apply for a trial period of three years.  Before the end of that period the law will be reexamined having regard to the actual cases where damages for mental distress have been awarded.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to keep records of each case decided in the courts.  I suggest that the figure of £1,000 is a generous one, which compares more than favourably with £750 which is, I understand, the top amount awarded for what in Scots law is known as <i>solatium</i> or <i>solatium doloris</i>.  The principle of awarding compensation for moral damage is an attractive one and it has operated successfully in Scotland and in France.  We shall see how it will work in this country.  The present system of confining damages in fatal cases to purely actuarial or financial loss means that a husband can recover nothing for the loss of his wife, unless he can prove economic dependency, which very often he is unable to do.  Before I leave this subject, I may mention that mental distress under the new proposal will, of course, have to be proved.</P>
    <P>Concurrent fault is dealt with in Part III of the Bill.  The liability of concurrent wrongdoers, contribution between concurrent wrongdoers, and contributory negligence are covered exhaustively.  Wrongdoers will include persons who commit an ordinary civil wrong, technically called a tort, persons who are in breach of trust, and persons guilty of a breach of contract.</P>
    <P>The Tortfeasors Act, 1951, which has <Col N="1785" /> been found in practice to be unsatisfactory, is being repealed.  Apart from the fact that it leaves a number of problems unsolved, the Supreme Court have held that the Act does not allow for third-party procedure to settle matters of contribution in the injured person's action, where the injured person has not sued all the tortfeasors. The proposals in the Bill are specifically designed to avoid as far as possible a number of actions in respect of the same accident or occurrence.  Except in exceptional cases, all issues, whether of liability, damages or contribution, will be settled in the one action.</P>
    <P>Section 34 of the Bill will get completely away from the existing law in negligence cases.  Where a person suffers damage as a result of the negligence of another, the law is that he recovers all or nothing depending on contributory negligence on his part. Subsection (1) of Section 34 proposes that instead of this &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; rule, damages will be apportioned according to the degree of fault of each party.  Thus a person, who suffers damage in an accident to the extent of £600, for which he is found one-third to blame, will recover £400.  This is a fair and equitable system which has met with approval in every legal jurisdiction in which it has been introduced.</P>
    <P>Parts IV and VI of the Bill propose to re-enact and bring into line the existing statutory provisions as to both ordinary fatal accidents and fatal air accidents.  The law as to the heads of damages to be awarded is, as I have already indicated, being amended so as to allow compensation for mental distress, Part V of the Bill makes certain purely consequential changes in the Workmen's Compensation Act. These changes are necessary because of the amendment in the law of contributory negligence.</P>
    <P>Part VII of the Bill contains certain miscellaneous provisions dealing with the law of tort.  The main changes in the law will be found in Sections 58, 60, 61 and 62 and I shall deal with these sections separately.</P>
    <P>Section 58 will enact that the law relating to wrongdoing will apply to <Col N="1786" /> an unborn child for his protection, as if he were born, provided he is subsequently born alive.  The Section is drafted as declaring the law.  This is to avoid any implication that the case against the former Great Northern Railway Company, decided by an Irish Court of Appeal in 1890, is in fact the present law, which, indeed, it may very well not be.</P>
    <P>Section 60 will abolish the defence of nonfeasance by a road authority. As the law has stood since the famous case of <i>Russell v. The Men of Devon,</i> decided as long ago as 1788, a road authority are not liable for damage resulting from mere nonfeasance, that is to say, from mere neglect to perform their statutory duty to repair the road. But a road authority are liable for negligence in the execution of their duty. In other words, they <i>are</i> liable for misfeasance.  Section 60 will provide certain statutory defences for a road authority; and the factors to which regard must be had in determining whether a road is adequately maintained are set out.  The new section will come into operation on a day not earlier than the 1st April, 1967.</P>
    <P>A new liability is being imposed on road authorities and it is only reasonable that they should be given sufficient time to take necessary action in regard to public roads, and bridges, pavements, etc., forming part of such roads.  It must be realised that the liability is really a liability being imposed on the local ratepayer whose interests must be taken into account. The section strikes a fair balance between those using the roads and those whose financial responsibility it is to maintain the roads.  The law has, as I have pointed out, been there since 1788; and, in justice to those who have to pay the bill, it cannot be lightly changed over-night.</P>
    <P>Section 61 proposes to allow proof in bankruptcy of claims for unliquidated damages.  On examination of the law of bankruptcy as it impinged on the proposals in the Bill, it appeared to me that there was no valid reason why claims for unliquidated damages <Col N="1787" /> arising out of a breach of contract, for instance, negligence in the case of a paying passenger, should be provable while claims for unliquidated damages arising out of an ordinary tort should not.  Section 61 will allow claims for damages or contribution in respect of any wrong to be provable in bankruptcy where the wrong was committed before the bankruptcy.  Where the damages or contribution have not been liquidated, the court may make an order for the assessment of the amount. This accords with the provisions of Section 46 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1872 in regard to unliquidated damages in the case of a contract or promise.</P>
    <P>Section 61 will not, of course, operate in a case coming within Section 62. The latter section proposes that moneys payable under an insurance policy in respect of liability for a wrong will go directly to the injured person instead of into the wrongdoer's estate.  What is involved is the extension to all liability policies of the provisions in regard to an approved policy contained in Section 76 (4) of the recently enacted Road Traffic Act.</P>
    <P>Part II of this Bill is on the lines of proposals made by Dr. Glanville Williams of the University of Cambridge in his book, <i>Joint Torts and Contributory Negligence</i>.  These proposals were based on a study of the law in Britain, Canada and this country and also on the pioneer work of the United States authority, Professor Charles Gregory.  I should like to express my appreciation for the help that Dr. Williams gave us and for the unstinting way in which he was always ready to let us have his views on various aspects of the law with which this Bill deals.  I should also like to express my thanks to the Bar Council and the Council of the Incorporated Law Society for their valuable and constructive observations.  Lastly, I should like to thank the members of the Special Committee of Dáil Éireann for the work they did in the detailed examination of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I should mention that we are now, and for the first time in any common law jurisdiction, attempting codification <Col N="1788" /> in a branch of the law of tort.  We have tried to avoid as far as possible the use of technical phrases with restricted meanings.  The Bill has naturally to be examined against the background of the common law. However, I suggest it should be examined on the basis of the legal principles it establishes and the obscurities in the law that it purports to resolve.  As the Bill ranges over a wide territory, I considered that it would be desirable to accompany it with a detailed Explanatory Memorandum. Since the Bill was first introduced in Dáil Éireann, it has been substantially amended in some respects. I have had the Memorandum re-written and expanded and I trust it will be of assistance to Senators in studying the Bill.</P>
    <P>The law of wrongs is of importance to lawyer and layman alike.  Indeed, over half the actions that are heard in our courts are personal injuries actions.  A prime purpose of this Bill has been to facilitate and encourage settlements out of court and to avoid where possible multiplicity of actions as respects the same set of facts.  The advantage of having whole branches of the law dealt with comprehensively in one statute is obvious.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House. I trust that it will achieve what, at the outset, it was intended and designed to achieve.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to refute any suggestion that this Bill has been rushed or that it has not been given the most careful consideration. In the first instance, it was circulated in draft form to all Government Departments where it has been carefully scrutinised as all such legislation is.  Then I sent the Bill to the Bar Council and to the Incorporated Law Society.  They examined it in detail and let me have the benefit of their views.  I sent it also to the Law Schools of the Universities here and to the Law School of the Queen's University of Belfast.</P>
    <P>In preparing the Bill and amending <Col N="1789" /> it, we have carried out a comprehensive comparative examination of the systems of law here, in Britain, in the United States of America and in Canada.  The latest piece of legislation on this subject in a British Commonwealth country was passed in South Africa, the South African Apportionment of Damages Act, 1956.  We examined what was done in that Act very carefully and have taken it into account in the wording of our Bill. As I have indicated, we were in close contact with Dr. Glanville Williams of Cambridge University who has given our Bill detailed and careful examination and has been unstinting in his co-operation.</P>
    <P>It will be readily agreed, I think, that before we went into the Dáil at all this Bill was very carefully considered. Then when we went to the Dáil that House facilitated me in having a Special Committee set up to deal with the Bill.  In that Committee we had four senior counsels, prominent practitioners all of them, and two solicitors. They and the rest of us on that Committee, these experts and the nontechnical people, scrutinised the Bill very carefully and thoroughly and we amended it in several important respects.  As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, I have been able to have the Explanatory Memorandum rewritten completely for the benefit of this House so that Senators would have an Explanatory Memorandum which would be exactly related to the Bill as it was coming into the Seanad.  I know that is no more than they are entitled to but nevertheless it is an earnest of our good faith that we did provide Senators with such an Explanatory Memorandum and at short notice. Therefore, I would suggest to the House it would be wrong to get the idea that this very important piece of legislation has been rushed in any way or that it has not been very carefully considered.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt this is a good Bill and I have no doubt of the good faith of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Neither have I any doubt nor any lack of appreciation of the work that has been done by the Parliamentary Secretary himself and by the <Col N="1790" /> Department in the preparation of the Bill.  I never said, and I did not hear anybody else saying here, that this Bill has been rushed.  The difficulty about the Bill is that we got it very late, not because it has been rushed, but because, perhaps, it has been started too late.  It is a very indigestible morsel to receive at this particular moment.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me there are only two ways of dealing with this Bill.  One is to be an expert, say you understand it and proceed to talk about it; the other is to say you do not know anything at all about it.  I am in a position rather between these two, but verging more to the person who does not know anything about it. I know, of course, that it is of interest not only to lawyers but to ordinary laymen particularly because on account of the growth of actions in court dealing with torts, owing to modern transport and for many other reasons.  I recognise the diligence which the Parliamentary Secretary displayed in connection with the Bill.  I recognise all that he has done in that direction but the Bill would get a better reception here if either of two things had been done.</P>
      <P>The complaint here is not that the Bill is being rushed; the complaint is not that we are being kept here to deal with the Bill at a particular time of the year.  The complaint really is that we were idle for a period when we might very well have been discussing the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary might have introduced the Bill in the Seanad.  I agree that if he did not want to do that, we have no way of requiring him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another course open which would have simplified the work we have to do this week and next week.  If, having got the Second Stage in the Dáil, he had referred the Bill to a Joint Committee, we would have had the advantage now of members of this House&mdash;no doubt there are a couple opposite; I see one behind me&mdash;who would have been on the Joint Committee.  They could have assured us that they had taken part as members of this House in the examination of the Bill and that they <Col N="1791" /> were satisfied that the Bill had been amended and was now suitable for passing.  If that procedure had been adopted, the Parliamentary Secretary's work with the Bill would have been very much facilitated.  The Bill would have had not only a swift but also a very informative passage through this House.</P>
    <P>The position is quite different now. I recognise the Parliamentary Secretary's solicitude for us when he made out this memorandum.  It is a memorandum of 28 pages.  The Bill is a Bill of 31 pages and is extremely technical.  It is not so very long since we got a copy of the Bill as amended in the Dáil.  It was considered in great detail in the Dáil and amended.  I did not read the proceedings of the Special Committee, but I looked through them and in several volumes of the Committee proceedings the name &ldquo;Haughey&rdquo; occurs five or six times on each page.  He was moving amendments which were, in the main, agreed amendments.  Although the Parliamentary Secretary took considerable pains with the Bill, he was able to accept an enormous number of amendments.</P>
    <P>The Bill we have now is a Bill which was amended very considerably in the Dáil.  All I regret is that this House did not get an opportunity of participating in this on Committee when we would now have the Bill on Report and members from both sides of the House would be able to assure us that they had received consideration from the Parliamentary Secretary for their point of view and co-operation with regard to the amendments.  If that were the situation, the Bill would have a swift passage.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that that course was not adopted.  This Bill is not a political Bill; it is not a Bill that anybody wants to oppose for any Party reason.  It is not right, whoever is in office, that at this stage of the proceedings of the Seanad, we should get not only this Bill but a great many others.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he would have no difficulty at all if this thing had been gone <Col N="1792" /> about in a different manner.  I suggested on more than one occasion that for this kind of Departmental Bill, where no political issues arise at all and where nothing arises really except the common good, this House should be used more to introduce these Bills or that there should be a Joint Committee procedure.  It would make for the smoother passage of the Bill and, eventually, make for better legislation.</P>
    <P>I regret the Bill was not introduced earlier or sent to a Joint Committee from the Dáil.  There is no charge that the Bill is being rushed.  The Bill got a very lengthy passage in the Dáil and that is a reason why this House should get a chance of considering it at leisure.  It is not reasonable that we should be asked to consider it at the end of a session and not only in the twilight but in the gloom and darkness of a dying Oireachtas.  That is what is wrong.  In the meantime, I am in favour of giving the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was very nice and sweet until he came to the end of his speech.  Then he seemed to launch an attack against people who he imagines made certain charges against him. Nobody said this Bill was rushed. What we do complain about is that this House of the Oireachtas has not been and is not being given a proper opportunity to study the Bill as it comes from Dáil Éireann so that it can make any constructive speech upon it on Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary refers to the lengthy examination which it got in the Special Committee.  It is to the Parliamentary Secretary's credit that in the Committee he was in a position to move and have accepted 98 amendments&mdash;a substantial number of amendments to a Bill of this kind. It shows the number of technical difficulties in a measure that had been through all the rounds of Government Departments and over and back to Sir Glanville Williams, the Law Societies, the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society.  Notwithstanding the 98 amendments made in the Select Committee, there were 58 <Col N="1793" /> amendments made on the Report Stage in the Dáil.  That is a total of 156 amendments made to this Bill to which we were asked only yesterday to give a Second Reading without having had it in our hands even for 24 hours.</P>
    <P>It is a moderate complaint to say that we have not been given an adequate opportunity to study the provisions of this Bill and the Parliamentary Secretary ought not to be heard in this House to say that we are unjust in our complaints.  Senator Ó Ciosáin, the Acting Leader of the House, said this Bill was in hands for some months, but, of course, the amendments on the Report Stage were not made until 1st July.  As there were 58, it would be rather difficult for us to relate these to the Bill until they were made.  That is all that has to be said about the delay.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself, if one had a copy of Professor Glanville Williams' book &mdash;I do not know whether there is a copy in the Library&mdash;might be easier to understand.  It is sufficient to say that the reforms advocated by Professor Glanville Williams are incorporated in Part III of this Bill.  The major portion of the Bill contains matters which legal practitioners have been advocating for a number of years. I am happy to think that the Bill has been the subject of detailed consideration by the Select Committee and the Dáil.  It is interesting to note that what the Parliamentary Secretary so nicely turns in his favour is just what he sometimes uses against other people, the fact that present on that Committee were four lawyers, senior counsel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am speaking of Senior Counsel.  On other occasions I thought it would be four senior counsels and two solicitors and the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is a happy thought that it has got such intensive study from such a distinguished body of people <Col N="1794" /> and it is interesting to see that the Parliamentary Secretary can find some use, even in this House, for learned senior counsel who are members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>One of the things I am very glad to see dealt with in this Bill is the way in which the law relating to contributory negligence will operate in future.  It has always been monstrous to think that because a jury or judge in certain cases could say that a plaintiff was guilty of the slightest negligence, the person could be maimed for life and get no damages whatever.</P>
      <P>The major defect in this Bill is something which will perhaps form the subject of a separate Bill.  This evening we heard Senator Ó Donnabháin talking about common of pasture being a medieval institute.  Of course sheep grazing and sheep farming are as old as the hills upon which the sheep are now grazing but there is a very medieval doctrine which still prevails in this country, that is, that the king can do no wrong.  That doctrine still applies as far as I can see, notwithstanding the introduction of this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>I am very glad that that is so.  It seems monstrous that if the Electricity Supply Board is guilty of negligence in relation to leaving a live wire across a roadway and if a motor cyclist is killed as a result, the Board will be liable, but if the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is similarly negligent through his employees, he will not be liable in tort law.  In each case, the dependants of the deceased motor cyclist will have lost their sole means of support.  There is on record such a case where the Department of Finance, out of its munificence, offered to pay the funeral expenses of a man who, through the negligence of the Minister for Posts <Col N="1795" /> and Telegraphs, had been beheaded by a wire.  It is a pity that that anachronism in our system of law should have to await the early announcement by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that this doctrine of non-feasance is being abolished and that the defence will not apply after some date five or six years hence.  When the Bill came out originally, I felt it was a pity that that was not contained in it and I must say I am very pleased that that amendment of the law has been made.  It is no harm at all, because it will make our county surveyors and their staffs that little bit more careful in future.  It is no harm in this day and age, when so much money is spent on road construction and so many facilities available for proper road maintenance, that local authorities should be made to do their duty through the threat of possible legal action against them for negligence in respect of their duty as highway authorities.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding my apparent carping criticism of the Parliamentary Secretary, I must express my appreciation, and, indeed, congratulate him, on the fact that he is incorporating this amendment and, indeed, all the other amendments of the law relating to tort. The one relating to non-feasance is a rather courageous amendment by the Parliamentary Secretary, because it does impose a greater liability to take care on the part of local authorities and is one which might in certain circumstances give rise to a fairly substantial volume of complaint from local authorities.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary has postponed that evil day for a few years.  In the meantime, local authorities will have to address themselves to the necessity of maintaining highways and footways in a proper condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law relating to liability for damages to an unborn child has been quite unsatisfactory up to the present. Since our criminal law in a variety of respects safeguards the life of an unborn child, it is only right that the law as well should go the full distance <Col N="1796" /> and provide that where an unborn child is injured, through the negligence of another person, that person should be liable for damages for the injuries caused.  I hope medical science has advanced to the stage where this provision will inure to the benefit of children injured through the negligence of other parties.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the survival of causes of action on death seems to be a very substantial change in the present law but I must confess I do not fully appreciate what the effect of the change is.  Listening to the Parliamentary Secretary, I rather gathered that it does open up the way to causes of action which hitherto could not be taken.  In so far as it does that, and gets rid of an anomalous position, it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Apart from these rather scattered observations on this very intricate Bill I have nothing further to say.  It appears to me, however, that even after the most detailed scrutiny of this Bill, and notwithstanding the most detailed scrutiny it has received from the Select Committee, and afterwards from the Minister and his advisers and the amendments to it, there will be defects and deficiencies in the Bill.  For that reason, I am rather disposed to say that the Parliamentary Secretary might have all Stages of this Bill in the not-too-distant future, because I rather gathered from him that certain aspects of this Bill will be subject to examination to see how they work out, and certain figures will be watched and certain statistics compiled with a view to ascertaining the effectiveness of the provisions.  I rather gather that if it should be necessary to amend this Bill, that amendment will be readily forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I have expressed the view before, for what it is worth, that in ventures of this kind, in making changes of any kind which do not work out, there should be no hesitation about amending the law.  I think that whatever difficulties this Bill may have, and I anticipate they will be very few, it is right and proper that we should here and now exculpate in advance the Parliamentary Secretary and his <Col N="1797" /> advisers from any blame for defects that may be in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like some opportunity, as a member of this House, of examining the details so far as I can apply my mind to all sections of this Bill. I hope that, when the Committee Stage comes up for consideration, notwithstanding the mutual recriminations of a mild character we have had to date, the Parliamentary Secretary will extend a little latitude to us in our desire to give this Bill the best reading we can with a view to ensuring, as far as this House is concerned, that it will be as good as possible when it comes to be signed by the President.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very comprehensive and important measure dealing with a major branch of the law of torts.  I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department on the introduction of this very important measure so for as lawyer and layman alike are concerned. It is the culminating measure of a lot of important law reform work which has gone through the Houses of the Oireachtas in the past two years &mdash;the Rent Restrictions Act, the Charities Measure, the abolition of archaic matters like the defence of common employment.  These archaic and outmoded defences and outmoded aspects of our jurisprudence are gradually, in the course of the past few years, being removed.  We now have this very important measure which codifies this very important field of civil liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present measure incorporates and amends the Tortfeasors Act, 1951, and the Fatal Injuries Act, 1956, both of which are incorporated and amended in the present measure.  I particularly welcome Section 49 which provides for damages not to exceed £1,000 in the case of mental disturbance caused by a fatal accident.  It has been an anomalous situation that fatal cases gave rise to comparatively low damages as against where a person might be injured in some way.  To layman and lawyer alike, it was an anomaly that an injured person had far greater value in the assessment of damages than, to put it bluntly, a dead <Col N="1798" /> person.  The situation now is that that has been remedied to a certain extent by the provision of compensation up to £1,000 in the case of mental distress which afterwards occurred following a fatality.  It is a welcome innovation.</P>
    <P>The other matters that have been written into the Bill are the old legal doctrines of <i>actio personalis moritur cum persona</i> that a legal action dies with the death of a person.  That has been modified by successive legislative enactments over the years.  Now, that maxim no longer applies except in certain really personal actions involving breach of promise, seduction, criminal conversation and so on, where the actual presence of the person is necessary to the legal action.  The other legal axiom, <i>volenti non fit injuria,</i> is in Section 34.  It provides that where there is an expressed or implied agreement liability exists.</P>
    <P>Section 34 is the most radical innovation in this measure.  It is the key section in the whole measure. That, linked with Section 56, means that we now have the abolition of the famous last opportunity three question rule which has bedevilled the law courts over a long number of years. Lawyers know and laymen found it incomprehensible to understand the rarefied sort of reasoning that went into elucidating whether two or three questions were appropriate in particular negligence cases.  The matter got into very rarefied abstract unreal argument in many cases.  That now goes and we have an easily understood and perfectly simple way of assessing liability, the apportioning of damages according to blame.  It is easily understood by a layman and a lawyer. Anything that simplifies the law and makes it understood in a simple way by lay people is good.</P>
    <P>It is often very difficult for lawyers to explain to a plaintiff why, if a defendant was clearly negligent in a case, the plaintiff happened to lose. That situation is now resolved.  The plaintiff's damages will be reduced to the extent that he, the plaintiff, contributed to the accident but reduced only.  He will, unless grossly negligent, <Col N="1799" /> succeed in obtaining some amount of money.  That is a very practical and key improvement in this.  It will lead also, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, to more settlements out of court, to more expeditious trials and more expeditious hearings.  The situation will be one in which I imagine we shall have far more of what we call assessments in court where liability will no longer be an issue.  With the lodging of money by the defence in court the question of assessment of the appropriate amount will be a very expeditious matter.</P>
    <P>The other matters in the Bill have been referred to by Senator O'Quigley. The abolition of nonfeasance as a defence available to local authorities is very welcome.  There should be no difference at all between the negligence of omission and the negligence of commission.  For years, local authorities have been enabled to use this defence of nonfeasance when they were negligent in acts of omission.  It is good that that is put on a rational basis now and that local authorities may no longer be able to raise that defence from 1967 onwards.</P>
    <P>There are other matters in the Bill and, by and large, it is really a Committee Stage Bill.  Senator O'Quigley mentioned one matter on which I thoroughly agree.  It is the anomalous business of the famous defence available in the old days that the King can do no wrong and which is still there, with certain legislative exceptions like the Road Traffic Act where the Minister for Finance is liable.  However, it is still there in the case, for instance, where the Post Office can be negligent in laying a wire and they have this defence that the King can do no wrong. It has been abolished in the Crown Proceedings Act in England in 1947.  I am glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say a similar measure will be introduced here.  When that is done I feel we shall have very few archaic or medieval regulations and entanglements left in our system of jurisprudence.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a very noble attempt on the part of the Department <Col N="1800" /> at codification.  I do not think it will succeed entirely.  The lawyers and the judges will always find loopholes and there may be court cases on top of this measure.  It will not be a final codification, I am sure, but it is a noble attempt at achieving this difficult objective.  I do not think it will succeed completely, but it is a great step in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  That is a statement which is often made in this House with, possibly, varying degrees of enthusiasm, but I should like to stress in this case that I make it with the maximum enthusiasm.  Although this is a very technical Bill, it will have, I believe, very practical results.  Certainly so far <Col N="1801" /> as anyone in the legal world is concerned, it will have what might almost be described as revolutionary results.</P>
      <P>I should like principally to welcome Chapter III of Part III of the Bill.  I believe it is most important, and it is certainly the part of the Bill which introduces the greatest innovation.  Previously, when a claim was made by an injured party, the courts had to decide whether the injury was the fault of the defendant, or whether the plaintiff himself was in any way negligent.  The courts had to give full damages to the plaintiff if there was no negligence on his part, or no damages if there was any negligence on his part.  That certainly led to grave injustice on many occasions, because, I think, experience will show that in certainly four out of five accidents there was some degree of negligence on the part of both parties involved.</P>
      <P>The simplest example is the person who walks across the road and is knocked down by a car.  That is a very common type of accident, and I think experience will show that in nearly all cases of that kind, there was a degree of negligence on the part of the person who left the footpath without taking adequate precautions, and a degree of negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle which knocked him down.  Up to now the courts had to find all one way or the other.  Under this Bill the courts will be able to say that the accident was, say, one-third the pedestrian's fault and two-thirds the defendant's fault and apportion damages accordingly.  That is a very important innovation and a principle which should have been introduced here some considerable time ago.  It has been in operation in Great Britain since 1945, and has worked very well there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effectiveness of Section 34, curiously enough, is likely to be of benefit to almost all those likely to be concerned by it in the future.  In other words, people who might never have received damages without this section, will now receive some damages, but limited damages.  On the other hand, those who might have had to pay very much damages will now <Col N="1802" /> only have to pay limited damages. The only type of person likely to suffer is the person who, in the past, got excessive damages.  In future he will get merely reasonable and adequate damages.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome also the many other valuable sections of the Bill.  Some are new and some are merely clarification and re-enactment of existing law.  There are a number&mdash; and several have already been referred to&mdash;which will play an important part and be of great practical benefit in the future in the courts.  One aspect of the Bill which I welcome in particular is the fact that so much of the law on civil liability will now be gathered into one Bill.  That is very useful and it is being effected by this Bill.  It is something which the practitioners will welcome.  Up to now, we had to go to so many different Acts, reports, books, and so on, to get the law on the various aspects of civil liability.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for his industry in preparing this Bill, and on the way in which he met most of the objections or suggestions made in relation to the original draft.  In particular I should like to congratulate him on the very useful memorandum, now revised, which he has produced to enable people to understand and work the Bill, when it becomes an Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want first to express my appreciation to the House for the manner in which they received the Bill and the commendatory things Senators have said about it.  I hope it will live up to our expectations, and I am sure it will.  We have all made an honest effort to give the people and the Courts the practitioners and the litigants who have recourse to the Courts, a useful and valuable piece of legislation.  We have done all we could and we can only hope for the best after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not really want to attack anyone when I was refuting the suggestion about this legislation being rushed.  I was merely concerned to point out that it was not in fact rushed.  I fully appreciate that this House is not getting the time they would like to <Col N="1803" /> consider this Bill and, indeed, the time I would like this House to have to consider it, if circumstances had been different.  I certainly would prefer if this Bill had come to the House in a more leisurely fashion and spent a longer time here.  I have not the slightest doubt it would have been possible to improve it somewhat by that process.</P>
    <P>I do not want to convey any wrong impression about the maxim: &ldquo;The King can do no wrong&rdquo;.  I want it clearly understood that I merely said we might have news about that.  I must sound a note of warning and point out that the British, when they eventually decided to do away with that maxim&mdash;and after all they invented it&mdash;excluded the Post Office and the Defence Services.  I shall not say any more.  I merely wish to make it clear that I have given no undertaking of any nature today.</P>
    <P>In connection with the question of non-feasance in local authorities, I should say that there is provision whereby they may insure against any claims that may arise.  The proposed change in the law need not necessarily be very expensive on them.  It is only right and proper that we should give them plenty of time to put their house in order.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with Senator O'Quigley who said this Bill is not the last that can be said on this subject, and with Senator Lenihan also in what he had to say.  It is quite true that an examination of the operation of the Bill will be undertaken and when the time comes the experience that has been gathered will be brought to bear in considering whether or not any amendments or changes should be made.</P>
    <P>I would not like to be as pessimistic as one distinguished Senator who privately informed me that he wanted to make a point because, as he said: &ldquo;When you have to amend it in six months' time, I want to be in a position to be able to say: &lsquo;I told you so!&rsquo;&rdquo; I hope that situation will not arise but it is true to say that the Bill is, if you like, experimental. It is new; it is a large measure.  There is a great amount of innovation in the <Col N="1804" /> Bill, and we will certainly have to keep a careful eye on the manner in which it operates and be prepared, if necessary, to have further changes made in the law.</P>
    <P>I want again, a Chathaoirligh, to express my thanks for the very reasonable way in which the House has received the Bill.  I do appreciate fully that I have come here and asked a lot of the House in asking Senators to deal with the Bill in the very limited time at their disposal.  Indeed, I would have expected more criticism on that aspect.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of that.  I should like to mention at this stage to the House that I am very anxious to get my other three Bills, that is, the two Courts Bills and the Defamation Bill.  I understand the House will be meeting next week. Would it be possible to get agreement from the House that we would get all Stages of these Bills next week?</P>

      <P>Standing Orders provide for amendments to be put in within a certain time.  As next Monday is a bank holiday, it would be 11 o'clock tomorrow.  I take it that 11 o'clock on Tuesday would be a reasonable time, if these arrive.</P>
