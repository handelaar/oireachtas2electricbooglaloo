      <P>Senator O'Donovan, in opening the debate, talked of expenditure over the past ten years.  I still find it hard to reconcile a figure he gave of £70 million.  However, when I go over it, maybe the Senator will be able to let me know later where I am wrong. Expenditure was £90.4 million in 1951/52 and £131.7 million in 1961/62. That is not more than £40 million over the whole ten years.  I do not know, therefore, where the figure of £70 million could come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past four years, from the time this Government came into office, the increase has been £25 million.  With that, I find that capital items in the Supply Services account for £10 million.  Therefore, current expenditure would be up by about £15 million over these four years.  Senator O'Donovan made the point that we should add to <Col N="1434" /> that the fact that we saved £9 million on food subsidies.  Against that, there was a compensatory expenditure of £2 million under social welfare heads.</P>
    <P>Another point made by Senator O'Donovan was that we had the advantage of falling import prices.  I do not think that is right.  Taking the index as 100 in 1953, I find that the import price index in 1956 was 106.1 and for 1960 it was 106.6, so that actually there was no saving, as far as either national or Exchequer finances are concerned.  There is, however, an advantage to this country on the export side.  Taking again the exports of 1953 as 100, the figure, in 1956, was 95.9 and in 1960, 102.2.  These were just a few figures to which I wanted to draw Senator O'Donovan's attention. I am sure he will point out if I have misquoted him.</P>

      <P>Coming to the Common Market, which I find took about three-quarters of the time on this debate, I have not very much to say, but I should like Senators to realise that the Ministers of the Government were cognisant of the implications of the Treaty of Rome before the decision was taken.  We were interested both personally and as a Government and were aware that the country also was interested in the unity of Europe which is the political implication of the Treaty of Rome.  Indeed, had we felt otherwise, we would not have considered the economic aspect of the Treaty.  I know that in public speeches and pronouncements and in this debate, more stress was laid on the economic side than on the political side, but that was because the political side was taken for granted and the economic side was of more controversial interest, let us say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We naturally had to assess the interests of this country before coming to this decision that we would in certain <Col N="1435" /> circumstances apply for membership, not only on the political side but on the economic and social sides, because all these aspects have to be taken into account before we seek membership of the Common Market.  The only decision we announced was that if Great Britain should apply for membership&mdash;because that appeared at that time to be imminent&mdash;we also would apply.  We felt it necessary to make the preparations for application in case Britain should apply so that our application would be considered by the six countries involved when the application of members of EFTA was considered. That may be a wise decision, to have it considered at the same time, or it may not, but on the whole we thought it better to have our application in time.</P>
    <P>The position, of course, is that most of our trade is with Great Britain but if we take groups of countries after that, our trade with the European Economic Community, the six countries, comes next.  We have much more with them than with the EFTA group and therefore it would look, from the economic point of view anyway, that the sensible thing to do would be to go in with the Community, if they are all in together.  Therefore, there was no great difficulty in making up our minds on that particular contingency but Senator Quinlan was wrong in assuming that we had decided that if Britain decides not to go in, there will be a new position to be considered.  If Great Britain does not go in and the EFTA countries go ahead with their programme, it would look as though over the next ten years tariffs would be gradually lowered within these groups but raised against us and that at the end of ten years, we would be more or less isolated.  We would have to consider our position very carefully, therefore, if Great Britain decided not to join the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>I made a few notes as a result of recent debates as well as this one and I would like to give some figures on the economic position of the <Col N="1436" /> country now compared with four years ago, as it may be the Senator's last opportunity of making some comparison between now and then.  It was mentioned in the debate that the number of people in work had gone down very considerably over those four years.  First of all, let us take the figure published from time to time.  This, however, is a net figure and I am not making any comparison except to say it is the highest so far.  The number of males in insurable employment in January, 1961, was 437,673 and the number of females in July was 215,993.  That is a total of more than 653,000, which as far as I can ascertain is the highest figure we ever reached in insurable employment.</P>
    <P>Take for a comparison the number in employment given in the statistics produced each year at Budget time. The number in employment under the heading of agriculture, fisheries and forestry was, in April, 1954, when the previous Government came into office, 460,000.  In April, 1957, when they left office, it was 433,000, a reduction of 27,000.  When the present Government came into office, the number was 433,000 and in April, 1960, the latest figure available, it was 413,000.  It went down by 20,000, therefore, in agriculture, fisheries and forestry, the reduction in their three years being 27,000 and in the four years of the present Government, 20,000.  On the non-agricultural side, all other things such as services and industries, the figure went down, between 1954 and 1957, by 22,000 and, between 1957 and 1960, by 4,000, a very big improvement indeed.  Actually, during the three years of Coalition Government, 49,000 people lost employment and during the four years of the present Government, 24,000 went out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator cannot listen to the facts.  He had better study the facts when I have finished.  In the last year for which we have figures, that is, from April 1959, to April 1960, the reduction on the agricultural side was 7,000 and the improvement on the <Col N="1437" /> industrial side was 7,000, so that we actually maintained employment over that year.  That was the only year since the war&mdash;during the war, I think employment was maintained&mdash;that we have this record except for 1954, which, as I pointed out here before, was the achievement of the Government of that time, after three years when the position had been cleaned up by the Budget that was brought in in 1952.  It required a drastic Budget of that kind to clean up the position, but we got what we wanted and in 1954 we actually increased employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>We got a change of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking facts and the Senator had better try to interpret them as best he can.  On the manufacturing side, we have somewhat later figures, because these figures produced at Budget time are produced from the previous April or June.  From March, 1959, to March, 1961, on the manufacturing side, we had again improved employment by 5,000 people and if we take all industries, including the manufacturing side, it is 6,000, so that the good trend is going on at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need hardly draw attention to the unemployment side because the figures are published from week to week. However, it is no harm to put on record that in the three months, January to March, 1957, that is, before this Government took over, compared with the three months of 1961, the average improvement in the unemployment figure is 31,000.  In other words, it was cut by one-third during that period and it now stands at the lowest figure it ever stood at.  I mentioned this question of unemployment only last week and somebody said it was easy to cut unemployment when emigration went up.  I went to some trouble to go back over these figures on emigration because I was fairly satisfied that they were not unfavourable, as far as we were concerned.  It would be as well for Senators to know the facts about these emigration figures because if we know the facts, we may be able to do something about emigration. We are not going to do something <Col N="1438" /> about emigration by putting our heads in the sand and by thinking that there was no emigration under Fine Gael and that there was under Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the figures of the inward and outward movements of sea and air traffic, which are the figures taken between each census.  The Statistics Office often tell us that they cannot give reliable figures except at census time.  These figures are quoted against Fianna Fáil and I want to give the figures from 1st April, 1954, to 31st March, 1957.  According to these figures, 150,214 people left this country in that period.  That is the net outward movement by sea and air&mdash;an average of 50,051 per year.  That is the Coalition's record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting exact figures.  Senator L'Estrange is getting very uneasy.  He will be able to go out before I quote the really good ones. For the four-year period from 1st April, 1957&mdash;we came in in the last week of March&mdash;it was 156,000.  That is in four years compared with 150,000 for three years under the Coalition, so that our yearly average was 39,029. That is an average of 11,000 per year better than the Coalition were able to give us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that our figures are satisfactory, by any means, but we are making every endeavour to bring that figure down and down.  As I say, we should study the facts, see what they are, see what the trend is, and then if the Opposition would help <Col N="1439" /> us in this matter, we might be able to do even better than at the moment. They are not helping us by saying that the emigration figures were higher during the past three or four years than during the Coalition period.  If we leave out 1957, which I think is reasonable, because we could not be expected to stop the momentum of emigration that was there&mdash;it had gone from 50,000 to 60,000 and it was 60,000 when we came in&mdash;our yearly average would be 32,000 as against 50,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the three years 1958, 1959, 1960.  1961 will be much better, as I shall show.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>1961 so far is much better, not the future at all.  The future certainly will be better because the trend is there.  It is the six monthly figure which has been taken, from November to April.  The reason it is taken up to April is that Easter is sometimes in March and sometimes in April, and people come in at Easter and go out again.  We must take up to the end of April to give a true figure of one year compared with another.</P>
      <P>Starting with that six monthly figure in 1954/55, the outward figure for the Coalition was 12,885.  It then improved somewhat, but it was bad in 1959/60, but not as bad as under the Coalition. In 1960/61, that is, for last winter, we actually had a plus figure for the first time ever and instead of people going out, 3,000 came in during that period. I am not talking about the future; I am talking about the past, and the figures are showing a trend.  It is quite evident that during the next five years, when I have no doubt this Government will be carrying on, we will be reaching a figure that will be less than the natural increase in population and we will then begin for the first time since the Famine to build up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Fianna Fáil, the figure was 32,000.  Even though I quote the true figures, I am quite certain that Senator L'Estrange will go down to the chapel gates and say that 200,000 went out in the past three years.  I have heard Fine Gael Deputies and Senators say that they were very conscious of their duty as a Government to keep down the cost of living and that they made a great attempt to do it.  The cost of living figure in February, 1954 was 124; in February, 1957, it was 135, up 11 points; in 1961, it was 149.  In other words, it went up 14 points in four years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not mind what we said.  Although it is not exactly just like the emigration figures, it is better than the Coalition effort, because if we had gone at the Coalition rate, we would have gone up 15 points.  The cost of living went up by 14 points during those four years but we have in every way possible compensated all the classes by increased benefits or increased wages.  The social welfare old age pension has gone up by 25 per cent. as against an increase in the cost of living of 14 per cent. <Col N="1441" /> Industrial wages have gone up by 26 per cent. against an increase in the cost of living of 14 per cent.  The agricultural wage increase varies from 1.4 to 3.2 per cent. above the cost of living increase.  With regard to the agricultural price index, Fine Gael propaganda is never based on fact but on talk as to what happened under Fine Gael and what happened under Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving statistics now.  Let me repeat that if the Fine Gael Party are anxious to improve matters in this country, the way they can do that is to base their estimates on facts but they do not like facts. Let us take the agricultural price index of 1953 equal to the base 100. That year is the year which is referred to in the country as the &ldquo;black year of 1956&rdquo;.  The figure then was 91.8. In 1960, it was 101.6.  It is 10 per cent. better than it was in 1956.  The latest month quoted is April, 1961, when it was 104.8.</P>
      <P>Prices are one thing and output is another.  The net output in 1956 was £143.5 million.  In 1960, it was £156 million, so if you take either the price index or output, you will see that agriculture is considerably better off than it was in 1956.  The volume of output would give much the same result, though not as good, for the prices are better now than they were then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst prices have been improving and output going up, the numbers of livestock in this country have been improving also.  If we compare January, 1957, which was two months before this Government took over office, with January, 1961 we find that cattle have increased from 4,022,000 to 4,241,000; sheep from 2,560,000 to 3,106,000; and pigs from 741,000 to 944,000.  I made an observation before which was not accepted by the Opposition that, if you looked at the <Col N="1442" /> graph for the number of pigs in this country, you could always know when the Coalition Government were in office because the number of pigs always appeared at the lower end of the graph.</P>
    <P>Farmers, if they are to farm well, must use feeding stuff, fertilisers and seeds.  Taking the year 1953 as equal to the base 100, we find that, in 1956, the figure for feeding stuffs is 102.7. In 1959, it was 120.1.  For seeds it was 102.8 in 1956 and, in 1959, 120.5 The figure for fertilisers was 115.6 in 1956 and 178 in 1959.</P>
    <P>It is quite evident from these figures that the farmers have confidence in their own industry and that they are putting more and more into the purchase of feeding stuffs as a long term programme and a great deal more into fertilisers.  We can expect to get a bigger output from the farmers in the future years than they gave in the past.</P>
    <P>Let us take production in industry. Again taking the year 1953 as equal to the base 100, we find that, in 1956, it was 103.6 and in 1960, it was 120. That again shows a very big increase, indeed, in production on the industrial side.  All these figures show that we may expect a very much bigger volume of production, both in agriculture and industry, in future years than we got in the past.  It should make it easier for any Government to carry on.</P>
    <P>With regard to the balance of payments, we went down £55.4 million for the years 1954, 1955 and 1956.  Since then, we went down £1.3 million.  As regards Budgets, when we assumed office early in 1957, the Estimates for the various Departments were prepared by the outgoing Government.  In fact, the book was printed at that time, and it was handed over to us to deal with. The next thing I, as Minister of Finance, had to do was to get an estimate from the Revenue Commissioners of what the income was likely to be on the level of taxation at that time.  When I compared those two figures, I found I had to cover a deficit of £11 million.  I do not know how the Coalition Government, if they had come back, would have faced that figure.</P>
    <P>It was a desperate figure to face.  The <Col N="1443" /> only way it could be faced was to remove the food subsidies, which gave us in that year a saving of £6 million. We had to impose extra taxation of £3 million and to put over £2 million down as estimated saving for the year. In fact, we did not go half far enough because we found ourselves with a deficit of £5.8 million so that if we had foreseen what the true estimate was going to be of both spending and saving, we should have calculated the deficit on the bill as handed over to us by the previous Government as £17 million, because that is actually what it amounted to.  The country had been going badly, because the year before that there was a Budget deficit of £5.9 million.  We took it over, as I say, and had a deficit of £5.8 million, but every year since then, we have been balancing the Budget and there is no further difficulty as far as that is concerned.</P>

      <P>Yes, indeed; we removed the food subsidies, which went one-third of the way to meeting the deficit at that time.  I could not put on more than £3 million extra taxation because, as I explained already, if you put a penny on the pint, it produces so much but the next penny will bring in only half of that and you cannot go very far in the way of extra taxation because it is a declining figure all the time. I thought that we would make savings and so on, but we still had a deficit of £5.8 million, which showed that there was no buoyancy in the revenue at that time because the country was more or less in despair and we could not get revenue out of the people.</P>

      <P>We did it, first of all, by giving the people a bit of confidence that it could be done, and the people did put their confidence in this Government because they knew that they were going to put things right, and they had none in the Coalition, and rightly so.  During that year, we climbed up the ladder amongst the European countries and actually did better than some of our very wealthy neighbours like Belgium and Great Britain, and Switzerland, which is not our neighbour so closely.  The 1960 figure over 1959 was five per cent. but I have no comparison for any other countries as yet, because as far as I know the OEEC report for 1960 is not written yet.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the total tax receipts, Senator O'Donovan painted a picture amounting to extravagance and high taxation, but actually as far as tax receipts are concerned, if you take 1955-56, the tax receipts were 18.3 per cent. of the gross national product; in 1956-57 they were 18.9 per cent; and last year 18.5 per cent., so there we are doing a bit better.</P>

We have not very many figures for this year so far, but as far as revenue is concerned, we have figures to 22nd July, and revenue received by the Exchequer was £40 million, within a thousand pounds, for those 16 weeks, that is £2½ million better than last year, which is very good indeed for less than one-third of the year.  As I said before, you do not get revenue unless people are fairly well off.  You do not get income tax unless people are earning, beer and spirits tax unless people can afford to buy beer and spirits, and tobacco tax unless people can afford to smoke.  The fact that we got more from tobacco, beer, spirits and income tax means that people are better off than they were.</P>

So far, I am right in that forecast.

      <P>Could the Minister answer one question: I understand that when I asked yesterday the question if Britain did not join the European Economic Community, why should the Government rule out Ireland joining, the answer the Minister gave was that that has not been ruled out.  Yet in column 205 of the Dáil Debates of Wednesday, 5th July, 1961, the Taoiseach was very explicit in ruling it out when he said:</P>
      <P>For these reasons, the question of our establishing a link with the Common Market while Britain should remain outside is not a practical one.</P>
      <P>The White Paper states the same thing even more emphatically.  If the question is not a practical one, that means that there will be no earthly meaning to even applying for a link with the Common Market.  Consequently, the Taoiseach's statement is doubly at variance with the statement by the Minister yesterday in correcting the statement I had made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be appropriate on this section to deal with a point made with the Minister with some gusto at the beginning of his speech.  I have before me the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>, 1960, page 317. It shows that in January, 1957, the import price index was 113, to base 1953, 100.  In February, it was 117.2. In March, it was 116.4.  Then the inter-Party <Col N="1448" /> Government went out of office and, by some magic wand, the Fianna Fáil Party changed all that.  In April, it was 114.6; in May, it was 112.9; in June, it was 112.5; and so on, this happy tale went.</P>
      <P>The average for the whole year was 112; the average for 1958 was 107; the average for 1959 was 104.7.  In certain matters, we have heard recently from the Minister and, indeed, from other Ministers, particularly the Minister for Transport and Power, that it took them three years to clear up the mess.  It only took a shake of a magic wand to clear up this matter, because it happened immediately they came into office.</P>
      <P>By an extraordinary coincidence, the export price index did the very same thing.  The average of the export price index for 1956, under very bad Government, was 95.9.  Then, in January, 1957, it was 96.7; in February, it was 98.2; in March, it was 99.3.  Then the Government changed and it became 100.5 in April and 101.1 in May, and for the year as a whole it was 97.6.  The following year, 1958, it was 100.1 In 1959, it was 104.  In other words, it was <i>pari passu</i> in 1959 with the import price index.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested I had falsified my figures when I said that at the fag-end of 1956, at the turn of the year 1956, it was 114.  Actually, it went a shade higher.  I take it the former Government were very unwise to have the general election in March, 1957. Perhaps the present Government will be very unwise to delay the election this year too long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fair reply to the Minister's speech.  It is quite clear that I did not falsify any figures.  The fact is that the annual figure the Minister gave for 1956 did not show a true picture at all.  The figure was continuously rising as regards import prices.  It was continually declining as regards export prices during the whole of that year.  The Minister, by taking <Col N="1449" /> this global figure for the year, did not convey a true picture of the situation in any sense whatever.</P>
      <P>Perhaps a more important point on this Bill, and directly on the section, is the question of the truth of my figures as regards the history of domestic Government expenditure in this country over the past decade.  I said, and I repeat, that the gross amount of the expenditure in the year 1950/51, the last year of the first inter-Party Government, was £75 million.  I said that when Deputy MacEntee left office, in his last complete year of office, although he had taken £10 million on food subsidies out of the expenditure&mdash;a direct in and out transaction&mdash;the expenditure was about £105 million.  So, he increased, by £40 million, the ordinary expenditure of the Government.  The Minister agreed this with me a couple of years ago.  It is only now, when the election is looming up, that he chooses to make a rumpus about it.  However, that is £40 million and the Minister accepted it from me a couple of years ago.</P>
      <P>The other figure is this, and the Minister did not really make any point about it.  I said that the expenditure for 1956/57, the last year of the second inter-Party Government, was about £109 million and that you could knock that by £9 million approximately for food subsidies, £7 million on bread and £2 million on butter approximately, making a round figure of £100 million, and that, for the coming year, the Minister has an estimated expenditure for Supply Services of £132 million on the face of the Estimates Volume.  That is an increase again, allowing for the food subsidies, of about £30 million.  I gave the Minister a present of a couple of million pounds in it.  There you have, for the decade, an increase of £75 million in Government expenditure.  I admit the £ is not the same today as it was in 1951, but, of that £75 million increase in Government expenditure, the inter-Party Government or the Coalition Government&mdash;call them what you like&mdash;were responsible for £5 million; the Fianna Fáil Party were responsible for £70 million.  There is no getting away from that.  These are facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> The Minister was talking, in relation to emigration, about reliable figures. I shall not pursue the matter with him.  He first said he would give the facts and reliable figures.  These are facts, subject to the elasticity of the £&mdash;and it has had very much the same degree of elasticity during the decade.  The Minister was correct when he said that the inter-Party Government who were in office from 1954 to 1957 paid great attention to the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Could I point out that though the cost of living went up, the import price index went up by 14 points between the time they came into office and the time they left office? They kept the cost of living down as low as they could.  It went up 14 points all right, but the import price index has gone down systematically until recently. Since the Government came into office, owing to their particular approach to finance, the cost of living has gone up systematically, despite an important decline in prices of imports which account for roughly half our gross national expenditure. The Government have wasted their opportunity, just as they wasted a bigger opportunity still after the Korean War.</P>
    <P>I can see, a Chathaoirligh, that you are getting restless but I have finished what I have to say on the section and I think that the latter part of what I have said was very much on the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The import price in 1956 and in 1960 was exactly the same or almost the same: 106.1 and 106.6, so there was no great difference over the period.  As a matter of fact, it was lower in 1959, higher in 1958 and higher still in 1957.  Certainly it was not as low over our four years as it was in 1956.  I cannot get that £75 million in 1951.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been called to the Dáil for one of his Bills so I have been asked to take the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to amend the Insurance Act, 1953.  That Act authorises the Minister for Industry and Commerce, for the purpose of encouraging exports, to make arrangements, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, for giving guarantees in connection with the export of goods or the rendering of services.  Under the existing legislation the aggregate amount of the liability of the Minister for principal moneys may not exceed £2 million.  The purpose of this Amending Bill is to raise the statutory limit of £2 million provided for in the 1953 Act to £5 million in order to provide for the growing demand for political risks insurance cover under the Act as a result of the increase in the volume of exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aggregate potential liability of the Minister under political risks insurance <Col N="1452" /> policies in force at 31st March, 1961, was over £1½ million.  With the increasing demand for insurance cover under the Act, it is probable that the limit of £2 million will be reached in the near future and it is necessary to raise this limit.  I think £5 million is a suitable figure.  The aggregate potential liability would, of course, become an actual liability only if all the risks covered by the insurance policies materialised.  As Senators will, no doubt, appreciate this in an entirely remote contingency.</P>
    <P>The present Bill will make possible the continuance on an increasing scale of insurance cover against certain risks which are inseparable from the export trade and which are of a type that cannot normally be covered by insurance or otherwise guarded against by commercial means.  The Bill is, therefore, designed to facilitate a continued expansion of our exports.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ministers for Health have from time to time arranged for the establishment of limited liability companies under the Companies Acts to provide health services which, because of their nature, the territory over which they were operated or some similar cause, could not be provided conveniently and economically by a local health authority as at present constituted.  The <Col N="1453" /> practice has been for the Minister to invite a number of individuals to form themselves into a company to perform functions specified in a general way by the Minister.  After incorporation, the company would provide the required service in accordance with its memorandum and articles of association as agreed with him.</P>
      <P>Usually, the members of these companies and their boards of directors were all nominated by the Minister who invariably appointed the chairman. The bodies established under this procedure are the Medical Research Council of Ireland, the National Blood Transfusion Association, the National Mass Radiography Association, the National Organisation for Rehabilitation, the Dublin Rheumatism Clinic and St. Luke's Hospital, all of which are now operating.  To a varying extent, depending on the method of financing the particular company concerned and the sources of its funds, the Minister, through their several memoranda and articles of association, exercises a degree of control over the financial and other operations of all these bodies I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>All these bodies have contributed, and continue to make a considerable contribution, to the development of the health services.  I must emphasise, therefore, that the introduction of this Bill is not to be taken as reflecting on them or their work.  Nevertheless, it cannot be gainsaid that the use of the Companies Acts for the purpose which I have described was not contemplated by those who framed the Companies Acts.  Company law is designed to facilitate individual persons who, for industrial or commercial purposes, may wish to form themselves into a corporate entity with limited liability. The Companies Acts were not drawn with a view to the use to which they have been put in the fields which I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acceptance of that opinion makes it necessary to provide a more appropriate statutory basis for the provision and administration of that type of health service which cannot be readily placed within the framework of our existing scheme of local government.  The Bill now before the House is designed to provide this more <Col N="1454" /> rational, and, I may say, more consistently constitutional, procedure for setting up corporate bodies to administer health services.  Under Section 3, the Minister for Health will have power to make an order setting up an organisation to provide a special type of health service.  A body so set up will be a corporate entity with all the usual powers of a corporation to enter into contracts, employ officers and servants and so on.  The entire procedure will be simpler, speedier and less expensive than the current practice of using the Companies Acts, which, as I have said, were not designed for this purpose.  There will be an additional advantage which I shall mention in connection with Section 10.</P>
    <P>Section 4 relates to the membership and staff of a corporate body established under the Bill.  Special provision has been made under which the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission may be used in the making of appointments to offices under the body.  It is proposed also that the code of superannuation applicable to local officers may be applied, with such modifications as may be necessary, to such a section. Furthermore, under the section, if an officer of a corporate body transfers or is transferred to the service of a local authority, service reckonable for superannuation purposes under the corporate body may be allowed in calculating superannuation benefit under the local authority in due course.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 contain detailed provisions in relation to the functions of a corporate body and its administration. Section 7 is included to meet circumstances under which a body established under the Bill may no longer be needed, so that its dissolution becomes desirable.  The dissolution of a body might be occasioned by the fact that the service to provide which it had been set up was no longer required, or by the fact that the service had expanded to the extent that it had become practicable to require that each health authority should provide and administer its own such service. With these possibilities in mind, the section provides that, where a corporate body is dissolved, its assets, <Col N="1455" /> liabilities, officers and equipment may be transferred to other corporate bodies or to local authorities, as the Minister might consider appropriate.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a certain amount of misconception about Section 8. Consequently I would like to emphasise that it is not intended that any of the existing companies which I enumerated earlier will automatically become a corporate body under this Bill.  All Section 8 does is to provide a means by which a company can become a corporate body, without having to go through the complicated formalities of the Companies Acts.  This, however, can only happen where the Company passes the necessary formal resolution prescribed by subsection (2) of the section.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for meeting the expenses of the Minister in administering the Act.  These expenses should be nominal as they will cover only the administrative costs involved in the making of establishment orders. Section 10, in addition to providing for the laying of Orders under the Act before the Houses of the Oireachtas, requires that a copy of each Order will be sent to each member immediately after it is made.  There is also provision for annulment, within seven sitting days after presentation. In other legislation this period is 21 days but Senators will readily appreciate that if a corporate body established for a particular purpose is to get on with its job, it cannot do so if the threat of dissolution by reason of annulment of the relevant establishment order is hanging over its head for the long period which might be represented by 21 sitting days.  Under the new procedure the making of the Order will have been brought immediately to the notice of every Deputy and Senator and the period of seven sitting days is not an unreasonable time in which to enable a Senator or a Deputy to make up his mind to move to secure annulment if he wishes to do so.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier, in relation to Section 4, that there was a merit in the proposed procedure for establishing these special bodies other than convenience, speed and lower cost. <Col N="1456" /> It is that under the existing dispensation a Minister for Health can set up any company he thinks fit for the performance of any health function and it is only fortuitously that the fact would come to the notice of members of the Oireachtas.  Under the proposed procedure, he must not alone make the Dáil and Seanad, as entities, aware of what he is doing by tabling the relevant Orders but he must put each Deputy and Senator personally on notice.  I recommend the Bill to the House for Second Reading.</P>

I am inclined to agree with the Minister in regard to Section 10 where not only is the order laid before both Houses, where it will be available, and which really means in the Library, but he intends sending copies to each member of the two Houses.  The seven sitting days, which cover a period of more than a fortnight, is a reasonable period instead of the 21 sitting days, where no copy is sent.  I think the Bill is quite desirable.</P>

We are setting a very bad headline for the country as a whole in regard to the hours of our working.

      <P>Might I be permitted to ask the Minister a question about this?  We have an excellent branch of the national blood transfusion service in Cork.  They are certainly working very well on a voluntary basis with a paid officer in charge.  I should like to ask the Minister, without any of the protestations of my friend from Cork that anything is being taken away from anybody, whether the character of the blood transfusion organisation in Cork, which I consider to be an extremely well-run one, is being changed by this Bill and, if so, is there any need for such change?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Seán Ó Donnabháin Seán Ó Donnabháin">
      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Mrs. Dowdall is one of the points in connection with this Bill to which I wish to refer.  I have other questions which I should like the Minister to clarify also.  In connection with the blood transfusion service, I should like to avail of this opportunity to compliment the organisation, both in Dublin and Cork.  I have experience of the Dublin organisation.  In passing, I might say that it is from the country people that we get the best service in Dublin and I presume the same applies to the Cork organisation I should also like to pay tribute to the <Col N="1459" /> staffs of the factories in Dublin who have contributed to such an enormous extent towards the provision of blood for transfusion purposes.</P>
      <P>As far as I know, there are only the two services&mdash;the Cork service which covers the southern area and the Dublin service.  I am just wondering whether there is any other organisation providing a system of blood transfusion. Does this legislation indicate now that we will have one national blood transfusion service?  Will Cork amalgamate with Dublin or vice versa?  I feel that the one organisation might possibly be the better.</P>
      <P>I read the Bill and were it not for the explanatory memorandum, I would not really know what the purpose of the Bill was.  In the explanatory memorandum, two services are indicated&mdash;the blood transfusion service and the mass radiography service.  I am wondering whether it is intended that in the future there will be no local authority radiography service.  At present, we have in Dublin the headquarters of the mass radiography service but we have also the service which was instituted by the Dublin Corporation before we had the mass radiography service.  It is still functioning. I presume that the two are co-operating in their activities in the Dublin service.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned several other services and organisations, such as the Medical Research Council, which is a very important body.  Then there is the rehabilitation service which covers both the rehabilitation of extuberculosis patients as well as patients who have recovered from other disease.  My interpretation of the rehabilitation service is that it deals with the rehabilitation of extuberculosis patients.  The rheumatism clinic is a service I can also pay tribute to because I have had personal experience and they are doing very satisfactory work there.  St. Luke's, I think, is a special hospital like any other public hospital but it is information to me to find that it will be taken over.</P>

      <P>Very good.  I would ask if there is any idea of amalgamating the two blood transfusion services and even mass radiography.</P>
      <P>My final query is in connection with the other hospitals and services for the public which apparently do not derive any benefit from the Hospitals' Trust&mdash; the orthopaedic services and the poliomyelitis services to which we are asked so often to contribute.  I wonder could these also be brought into a national scheme by which they could be provided with funds from the Hospitals' Trust?  Perhaps they are. I do not know, and that is why I asked the Minister could these services be classified as hospital public services and get funds from authorities, outside the collections and bazaars and functions they organise for their support.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Baldoyle orthopaedic service is classified as a hospital, and if it were incorporated to some extent like the blood transfusion organisations, could it serve a greater section of the country than possibly it does at present?  I know that many citizens help considerably towards the transport of patients for the cerebral clinics and poliomyelitis clinics.  I may be asking the Minister a question which is outside the scope of this Bill, and he will enlighten my ignorance, because I should like to get clarification of the position in which these other services stand, apart from the several mentioned by the Minister and the two mentioned in the explanatory memorandum.</P>

      <P>I believe in starting with first things first.  I want to refer to the Health Authority as it is established and as it was mentioned by Senator Ó Donnabháin.  What I want to impress on the Minister just in a few words is this: There are 27 members on the Dublin Health Authority and they have no authority.  I think it is most unfair to elect representatives of the people who have to face the electorate, and to see the blame for the failure of the Dublin Health Authority put on those elected representatives. As one point to illustrate that the Dublin Health Authority has no power, I will just mention that at their very first meeting, they recommended to the manager that the nursing staff, both men and women, employed by the Authority should be given a substantial increase and a betterment in hours and conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me, first of all, point out that this Bill is designed to deal with functions which ordinarily the health authorities are not in a position to deal with.  The Bill relates to bodies which are set up outside the general system of health organisation and administration in this country. They are specialised bodies.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Cork Blood Transfusion Service, to which Senator Dowdall referred, I want to say that this Bill does not affect its position in any iota.  It will remain as it is at present, an independent locally-based organisation, and we cannot interfere with it or with any other private special health service that exists at the moment.  Therefore, what Senator Ó Donnabháin fears in respect to either the National Blood Transfusion Association, St. Luke's Hospital, or any other of the existing companies established for the provision and operation and administration of health services does not arise.  The Senator can put it out of his head immediately that there is anything in the Bill which would give the Minister power to compel an existing limited company to become an established body under the order.  It is not necessary for me, therefore, to go in detail into the points raised.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at Senator Quinlan's remark about this as slot machine legislation.  It is true that it is coming before the Seanad perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what leg the Senator wishes to stand on&mdash; whether he wishes the Minister for <Col N="1463" /> Health to preserve his powers which at the moment he enjoys.  I do not think he ought to, because I have some regard to the Constitution of our country and to the responsibility which Ministers bear to the Oireachtas.  But as things stand at present the Minister for Health has powers to establish bodies to discharge subsidiary functions which are limited only by the financial resources the Minister has at his disposal, and these, as the Senator may know, amount to something like £6,000,000.</P>
      <P>I recognise that when the Department of Health was established, it was decided that the local authorities should become health authorities for the purpose of administering the Health Act.  It became apparent that provision ought to be made, <i>ad hoc</i> provision, if you like, for special services which had never before been provided by health authorities.  It then became necessary to make this <i>ad hoc</i> provision.  This was an empirical solution and outside the broad framework of local government.  The only way in which the Minister of the day could deal with that problem was by availing of the powers which existed under the Companies Acts to establish a corporate entity the liability of whose members would be limited only by guarantee to provide and operate these services.</P>
      <P>My predecessors availed of the facilities that were provided to do this. I think, in the circumstances of the day, they were quite justified in doing so.  It has now become apparent that the need to establish these special services, if I may put it that way, will grow.  I think the time has come when the Oireachtas should be made aware of what is being done by a Minister for Health in relation to services of the type to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make it quite certain that, whenever a Minister finds it desirable or essential to establish a special type of health service, all the members of the Oireachtas will be made aware of what he proposes to do.  I put it even to Senator Quinlan that this is not to give the Minister any further power.  In fact, it is imposing shackles upon the Minister <Col N="1464" /> and making him responsible to the Oireachtas for what he does.  That is the sole purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Every one of the bodies to which I have referred, which I enumerated earlier, has been established under the Companies Acts.  Some of them, at their inception, received very substantial grants out of moneys at the personal disposal, almost, of the Minister for Health.  At the present moment, some of them continue, even today, to be financed in their operations by the Minister for Health, again out of funds at his disposal.</P>
    <P>My personal opinion is that that is not a desirable situation.  Therefore, I have been responsible for initiating this Bill which will inform the Oireachtas of what the Minister is doing and make it possible for any member of the Oireachtas, if he so wishes, to put down a resolution questioning the manner in which these bodies are conducting their affairs and which can bring the Minister responsible for them into the Dáil&mdash;because the Minister is responsible only to the Dáil&mdash;to answer for their conduct.  That is what this Bill proposes to do.  I think the Senator has misinformed himself about the purpose of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Research Council itself was set up as a company limited by a guarantee.  Provision was made, it is quite true, in one of the Acts amending the original Public Hospitals Act of 1933, to make it possible to provide funds.  The Act was passed only when it became apparent that the Act as originally drafted could not cover the Medical Research Council.  So, as I have said, it was set up and established without the formal and official cognisances of the Oireachtas.  The Minister who set it up found he could not finance it and therefore he had to get special powers to deal with it.  All the other bodies which I enumerated, some of which have received grants of almost £400,000, have also been set up under the Companies Acts procedure.  I do not think that is proper.

      <P>We have now got an admission that a body of the importance and scope of the Medical Research Council could be set up under the section without any debate here.  I am shocked by what the Minister has revealed of past legislation and the powers under the Health Authorities Act.  The Bill is an improvement and this section is an improvement on the past but that is not good enough.  Take the example of the recent Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  According to the Minister, a body of comparable scope could be set up under the section and the best we could do is to drag the order made through the House for approval.  That is a very cumbersome and ineffective way of doing this.  If this had applied to the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards, we would not have the five valuable amendments which we got through.</P>
      <P>There is too much power in the section. It should be limited considerably either in the scope of finance or by some other means which I cannot think of right now.  We have got to be careful of such sections.  There is far too much centralisation, too much government by order, in this country and too little work or sense of duty by us here in the Seanad when we see the most important Bill of the year, the Appropriation Bill, going through without a single contribution from the Government benches and a motion on the E.E.C. and the Common Market going through without a single idea, good, bad or indifferent, from the Government side.</P>

      <P>I want to make it quite clear that nothing I have said could possibly suggest that it would be the intention to establish a body of the importance and character of the Medical Research Council by order.  In fact, my mind has been running the other way.  I would like to give that body a definite statutory basis and impose on the Government of the day a definite obligation to finance it.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan should not let his imagination run away with him.  He is afflicted with one or two phobias, one of which is this cant about government by order.  This country could not be run if the responsible Ministers had not power to make orders to deal with situations with which it would not be practicable to deal by legislation.  Every country has got an administrative system. Every country does by order things which experience has taught them would involve terrific waste of public time, energy and money, if they were done by legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to get into an argument about that but nothing&mdash;again, I repeat nothing&mdash;which I have said could possibly suggest that I intended &mdash;I cannot speak for my successors but I am perfectly certain that they would be of the same mind as I&mdash;that a body of the importance and character of the Medical Research Council should be established in this way.  But should it ever happen that the exigencies of the time demanded that such a body should be established by order, it would <Col N="1469" /> be possible for a Minister to make an establishment order and bring the body into being.  He must, however, come to the Oireachtas to defend that establishment order.</P>
    <P>The Senator need not shake his head.  He is a neophyte in these matters and he should learn from those who are experienced as to how a legislature has to work.  A Minister must defend that order in exactly the same way as he would defend proposals on the Second Reading of a Bill.  I think that perhaps there would also be this: people would feel freer on both sides of the House, on the Government as well as on the Opposition side, to express their views regarding the order the Minister had made.</P>

      <P>On the question of Government by order, the Minister does not prove his case by a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, by suggesting that I am advocating that Ministers should have no power to make orders.  What I am advocating is a very different thing. What I am saying is that the modern tendency to make orders upon orders is a substitute for efficient legislation. We might all take as our motto and the Minister might take as his motto: &ldquo;All power corrupts but absolute power corrupts absolutely.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned his good intentions.  Again that is not legislation. I am not such a neophyte in this business that I do not know what is good legislation.  I perhaps have read as much about it as any of the members or as most of the members of this House.  I do know that the essence of good legislation is that it could not depend on the good intentions of the Minister or a Department.  We are legislating not for today or tomorrow but for as long as the statute remains on the book.  Consequently, though the Minister denies that he would set up a body of the importance of the Medical Research Council, at the same time, he is putting through a Bill that gives him power to do it.  If that is not an <Col N="1470" /> example of bad legislation, I do not know what bad legislation means.</P>
    <P>He mentioned the substitute of the Minister having to come and defend his order in the House.  I want to know whether that means that the House could change details of those orders. Even if it does, it is a poor substitute for the full play of debate.</P>

    <Title>Medical Practitioners Bill, 1961&mdash; Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>By this short Bill, it is proposed to make a minor change, which has been recommended to me by the Medical Registration Council, in the law on medical registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> The Medical Practitioners Act of 1951 provides that a medical practitioner is not entitled in this country to full registration until, after obtaining his qualifying diploma, he had a year's practical experience in an approved hospital.  The purpose of the &ldquo;intern year&rdquo;, as this period of experience is commonly called, is to ensure that each medical practitioner will, in addition to his academic knowledge, have practical experience under supervision before he enters fully on the practice of his profession.</P>
    <P>The obligation to do the intern year presents no problem in the case of a medical practitioner qualifying for the first time in this country.  If a medical practitioner, qualified in Britain, comes to live in Ireland and wishes to transfer from the British to the Irish Register, there is likewise no difficulty as the obligation to do an intern year applies in Britain also.  Similarly, if a medical practitioner wishes to be registered here on the basis of a qualifying diploma obtained in one of the territories with which we have reciprocal arrangements for medical registration, our present law exempts him from the obligation to do an intern year here if he can satisfy the Medical Registration Council that, after qualifying abroad, he has gained experience equivalent to that which he would get if he did his intern year in this country.</P>
    <P>A small number of medical practitioners, however, come here from countries with which we have no reciprocal arrangements for medical registration.  Some of these practitioners may have high qualifications, and they may have had very considerable professional experience; but before one of them can become registered here he must, after obtaining an Irish qualifying diploma, then undergo the intern year as if he were a newly-qualified Irish medical graduate with no experience whatever.  This is obviously not a practical necessity where the medical practitioner has been, for many years perhaps, in practice in his native land and it is a defect in our present legislation that the Medical Registration Council cannot <Col N="1472" /> exempt such a man or woman from this requirement, if it wishes to do so.</P>
    <P>It is to correct this defect that I have introduced the present Bill.  It will enable the Medical Registration Council to waive the requirement to do an intern year for any foreign medical practitioner applying for inclusion in the Irish Register who, having taken an Irish qualifying diploma, satisfies the Council that his original qualification was sufficient for the efficient practice of medicine and that he has had experience equivalent to that of the &ldquo;intern year&rdquo; in his own or another country.  While such a practitioner will still need to get the Irish qualifying diploma, I understand that concessions in relation to the period of study required before sitting for the examination for such a diploma are given in such cases by some of the medical schools.  The Bill will make a desirable improvement in the law relating to Medical Registration and I recommend it accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this Bill.  There is at the moment considerable difficulty in regard to these practitioners to whom the Minister has referred.  Some of them come from countries which have not got reciprocal arrangements with us.  It is not really a question of their practising here; it is a question of their obtaining provisional registration here in order that they may study for a higher diploma.  This cannot be done under the present arrangement.  One difficulty is that we have not got reciprocal arrangements with all the countries with which the General Medical Council of the United Kingdom has arrangements.  Through this reciprocal arrangement with the United Kingdom, our practitioners can go on the General Medical Register of the United Kingdom and, through that, can go to any country that is reciprocally recognised by the General Medical Council, but some of these countries are not recognised by us and their practitioners cannot come here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This anomaly has given rise to some uneasiness in these countries and to their representatives in Britain and it has caused uneasiness in the General <Col N="1473" /> Medical Council.  This Bill will go a long way towards remedying that state of affairs.  The simplest thing, of course, would be to grant recognition to every country recognised by the General Medical Council, but it was thought that there would be some difficulties about that.  After all, we produce many more doctors than can find jobs here. A large percentage of our graduates go abroad and therefore the Irish Medical Registration Council is, very rightly, rather cautious about the terms under which people from other countries practise here.</P>
    <P>This is a very good compromise and it enables a man who wants to come here for a higher diploma, or to practise here, to put his case before the Irish Medical Registration Council and receive recognition, which he could not have received before.  In that way, it makes things easier, without opening any wide gate, or any back door, to practise in this country for those from other countries with which we have not got this reciprocal arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to draw the attention of the Seanad briefly to the fact that while we appear to have more medical graduates than we require, and large numbers are going abroad, during the present flight from the country, in a few years, I feel we are going to run into a serious shortage of junior and higher medical staff, unless we make provision to ensure that conditions here are as good as the conditions available abroad.  I am referring in particular to the large number of students going for postgraduate work, internships and so on, to the United States.  Very few of these students will return to the conditions here in view of the conditions available to them abroad.  In short, the medical profession must be treated as befits that noble body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objects of the Bill are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  To increase the authorised share capital of Aer Rianta Teoranta from £10 million to £13 million; and</P>
      <P>(ii)  To provide for the issue by the Minister for Finance of repayable advances to the Company of such sums (not exceeding in the aggregate one million pounds) as the Company may from time to time request.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta's present authorised share capital is £10 million, of which £9,975,541 has been issued.  Aer Lingus and Aerlínte are subsidiaries of Aer Rianta, the capital of which is used mainly for investment in the subsidiaries. The existing capital has been used by Aer Rianta as to £2,977,974 in Aer Lingus and £6,921,477 in Aerlínte, the balance being retained by the Company for its own capital purposes.</P>
      <P>In the Bill, provision is made for an increase in the authorised capital to £13 million.  Provision has been made in the Capital Budget for 1961/62 for the investment of £1,200,000 in the air companies and provisional estimates of capital requirements in the years 1962/63 and 1963/64 show that an additional investment of up to £1 million will be required, making a total investment of about £12,200,000. It is not possible to forecast for how long the increase now proposed will meet requirements.  Because of the spectacular expansion in our air business&mdash;to which I will refer later&mdash;and the possibility that the increasing traffic may necessitate additions to the companies' fleets and equipment, precise forecasts of capital requirements are extremely difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of £1,200,000 in the Capital Budget for this year includes £150,000 in respect of Aer Rianta's investment in a hotel project.  I shall deal with this project in more detail later.  The Capital Budget also provides £850,000 which will enable Aer <Col N="1475" /> Lingus to liquidate a bank loan on which it has been operating for the past few years.  The actual capital expenditure of Aer Lingus for this year is estimated at £450,000 but this will be met by the company from its own resources.  Capital expenditure by Aerlínte in the current year is estimated at £600,000 of which £400,000 will be met from its own resources.  The balance of £200,000 will be provided by the Exchequer.  When these amounts have been issued, the capital of Aer Lingus will consist of £3,820,000 subscribed by the Exchequer and £1 million long-term loan from a commercial source, as compared with £2,970,000 Exchequer participation and £1,500,000 loan capital on 31st March, 1961.  The capital subscribed to Aerlínte will be £7,120,000 as compared with £6,920,000 on 31st March, 1961. There will be an increase of £150,000 in the amount retained by Aer Rianta for its own capital requirements.</P>
    <P>A sum of £250,000 will be required by Aer Rianta in the years 1961/62 and 1962/63 to cover its investment in Irish and Inter-Continental Hotels Limited, a company formed to undertake the construction, furnishing and equipping of three hotels to be erected in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  The total cost of the project is about £2,750,000 and the balance of the capital required is being provided by means of a guaranteed loan under the Tourist Traffic Acts and by a number of banking, commercial and private interests. I think I should explain that Aer Rianta will not enter the field of hotel operation as such.  The hotels will be operated by the Inter-Continental Hotels Corporation, a subsidiary of Pan-American Airways.</P>
    <P>The Corporation has very considerable experience of hotel management and has adapted American hotel management methods to international standards of service so as to provide flexible operation in accordance with local customs, style and habits in each country which it serves.  The arrangement which is being made provides the maximum selling coverage on a world-wide basis and should be particularly valuable in developing airline <Col N="1476" /> traffic and tourism for Ireland in North America against the heavy competition of the more highly developed tourist countries of Europe and the near East.</P>
    <P>Very considerable State funds have been invested in jet aircraft and in the development of a transatlantic service and it is considered that the full benefits of that investment cannot be reaped unless it is backed by further investment in the provision of suitable hotel accommodation.  There is a serious imbalance between the greatly increased passenger capacity being provided by the air carriers in particular and suitable first-class hotel accommodation in which no worthwhile increase has been made in recent years. Private enterprise in Ireland is rather reluctant to go into this essential development but I am happy to say that one of our leading hotels will be a substantial shareholder in the project now under discussion.  This is a happy instance of a union of public and private interests.</P>
    <P>Participation by air companies in the hotel business is quite a feature of the international airline business because they appreciate that the provision of first-class hotel accommodation is a very necessary adjunct to the development of air passenger traffic.  I am satisfied that Aer Rianta's investment which, in fact, represents only about 10 per cent. of the total cost of the project, is a very necessary one and that it will yield quite substantial benefits for Irish aviation business generally.  I have dealt at some length with the hotels project so that Senators will be in a position to appreciate the significance and value of the Aer Rianta investment in the project.</P>
    <P>The amount of capital allocated to Aer Lingus for 1961/62 covers the liquidation of the bank loan already referred to and the purchase of such items as fleet and ground equipment. The main ground for repaying the bank loan is the undesirability of the company having a large proportion of its capital in the form of loan capital.  The capital required by Aerlínte in 1961/62 is for modifications in aircraft fleet, spares and equipment, ground equipment, premises and office furniture and repayment of working capital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> The provision for the issue of repayable advances from the Exchequer to Aer Rianta is a new feature, and will enable Aer Rianta to obtain capital for items which would normally be financed by means of bank overdraft. It is considered desirable that certain short term capital requirements should be met in some other way than by the issue of share capital. The provision in the Bill follows the lines of similar provisions in the Electricity (Supply) Acts and the Turf Development Acts.</P>
    <P>Senators will, no doubt, be interested in a brief résumé of the results, financial and otherwise, achieved by the Irish air companies during the past two years.  In the financial year ended 31st March, 1960, Aer Lingus had an operating surplus of about £170,000. The final accounts of the company for the year ended 31st March, 1961, will be published this week after the companies' annual general meeting, and I am glad to say that Aer Lingus will have an operating surplus considerably in excess of that achieved in 1959/60.  Aerlínte which operates transatlantic services will have an operating deficit of £93,621 in the year ended 31st March, 1961.</P>
    <P>There have been very significant and heartening increases in the numbers of passengers carried by the companies in 1960/61 and, also, quite a considerable increase in freight carried.  The number of passengers carried by Aer Lingus in 1960/61 was 713,000, an increase of 25 per cent. on the 1959/60 figure.  The total amount of cargo carried&mdash;12,000 tons&mdash;showed an increase of almost 40 per cent. on the 1959/60 figure.  In the year ended 31st March, 1961 Aerlínte carried 35,176 passengers, an increase of about 50 per cent. on the 1959/60 figure, and the total amount of cargo carried at 244 tons was two and a half times more than the amount carried in 1959/60.  In regard to the operating deficit of Aerlínte in the financial year 1960/61 it is well to point out that this compares with an operating loss of about £589,000 for the twelve months ended 31st March, 1960 and an operating loss of about £790,000 for the eleven months ended 31st March, 1959.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> The traffic carried by both Aer Lingus and Aerlínte continues to expand in the first quarter of the current financial year, April to June inclusive, as compared with the corresponding period last year.  Passengers carried by Aer Lingus increased by 16 per cent. as compared with last year and freight by 31 per cent. Passenger traffic on the transatlantic service increased by 57 per cent.  I am happy to say that the trend is reflected in forward bookings.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>We should all welcome the latter part of the statement of the Minister in relation to the successful operations of both our air lines and the great improvement in Aerlínte. We are all very proud of and pleased with the work of Aer Lingus and its quite dramatic expansion and, above all, its wonderful record of safety. Those of us who use air lines quite a lot cannot fail to notice in other countries that there has been a marked deterioration in efficiency, in cleanliness, in service and even in courtesy on some air lines as a result of increased traffic. I am glad to say that in the case of Aer Lingus, nothing like that is apparent, and we all hope that even if the business grows bigger, efficiency and all those other things that go with it will not deteriorate in any way.  In fact, in many ways there have been great improvements in Aer Lingus, particularly on the catering side of their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also will agree with the proposition of providing hotels in connection with flying.  Because of the vagaries of the weather, one often finds oneself at an airport having to lie down for the night on a couch and the provision of hotels is absolutely essential.  The Minister has said that provision is being made for the erection of first-class hotels.  I am very glad that he did not use that awful word &ldquo;luxury.&rdquo;  This is a word that is put on everything nowadays in the public press&mdash;it must be a luxury ship, a luxury hotel, or whatever it is.  Really what we want in the modern world are first-class second-class hotels, not first-class luxury hotels. By first class, I mean where everything is well done at all levels and where no <Col N="1479" /> false frills are introduced to cover up other deficiencies.  For that reason, I welcome the Minister calling them &ldquo;first-class hotels,&rdquo; and I hope that when we operate them, they will be first class in every way and will give a good, decent, straightforward service at every point in their operation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide the increased capital necessary to do all the things envisaged.  We all know that an undertaking such as an air line is very expensive and requires very large capital, and, above all, we should willingly vote this capital in this case because this is not a case where capital is required to bolster up something.  It is really a sign of success. The extra capital is absolutely necessary because of the extraordinary expansion that has been going on in our two air lines.  It is, therefore, no surprise to me to see that we are presented with this Bill for the provision of increased capital, because once we have committed ourselves to this operation we must follow our investment and keep ahead of other people, if we wish to keep up the success that we all desire to see attending this enterprise.</P>
    <P>Many people were, perhaps, a little bit apprehensive about the feasibility of operating a transatlantic air line.  I myself believe that with the record of Ireland in air lines and, first of all, in Aer Lingus, we are capable of competing with other and bigger countries provided there is a reasonable degree of co-operation on fares and costs, that we are not being under-cut by wealthy countries merely to get business by running on uneconomic lines.  If there is always to be fair competition, we in the new Ireland will always be able to take our place in competition with anybody.</P>
    <P>As we are all talking of Common Markets at the moment, I hope that, generally speaking, in our economy the same lines will be followed&mdash;that we will have the most efficient machinery possible and that it will be operated by the best and the best paid personnel at all times, because it is only with good machinery and good personnel and a good spirit that one can compete internationally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> It is encouraging to see that at all levels there have been increases&mdash;increases in passengers and that the financial situation is improving in both the air lines concerned.  We also agree with the Minister that it is very difficult in an expanding industry like this to give precise forecasts of the capital requirements. I should not be surprised and, in fact, I should be rather glad to see the Minister coming again, perhaps in a comparatively short time, for more money to put into these companies.  I also welcome the fact that there is being imposed on these companies the obligation to repay the capital invested in them.  One of the faults of nationalised companies in some countries is that they are continually run at a loss and the capital originally invested in them by the State and the taxpayer is, in fact, never recovered.  I hope that, on that aspect, too, we shall see that these companies are not only successful but so successful that they will be able to repay the capital advanced to them and any loans made to them.  It is to be hoped that the provision whereby interest becomes due, where payments are overdue, will not have to operate. We support this Bill.  We think it is a sign of success.  We wish it every success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this measure.  Particularly, I should like to pay tribute to the very efficient manner in which our air services have been carried on, right from their introduction.  Every Irishman and woman must feel proud of the magnificent record of these services. So long as the same meticulous care and attention as are given to every detail of the working of this grand organisation continues we have nothing to fear from competition, even from the wealthiest countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Irish airmen have proved that they are second to none.  They are amongst the world's best.  That has been proved apart from the magnificent progress shown by our pilots in Aer Lingus and Aerlínte.  So long as we have the same efficiency in these operations, the same meticulous care to every detail and the extraordinary success of our pilots, we can <Col N="1481" /> look forward to a great expansion of our air services.  Therefore, I wish to congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I should like to pay a tribute to the gentleman, his predecessor, who had the foresight and courage to embark on this vast undertaking when perhaps very few people in this country would agree with the steps he took, steps which have been justified by the experience of the past number of years.  I have seen a magnificent airport develop in my native county on a spot that was once a marsh.  It is now a show place and one of the finest airports, I understand, in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JaneDowdall" hpid="Mrs. Dowdall Mrs. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, like previous speakers should like to congratulate the Minister on his coming here with this Bill.  Usually we do not welcome Ministers coming to look for more money but in this case we do.  It is needed because of the success of the project.  I am sure the Seanad will agree, as the Dáil has, to allow this capital to go to Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>I, with the other speakers, should like to congratulate the whole organisation of Aer Lingus and Irish International Airlines on which I had the honour and privilege to travel last year.  As Senator McGuire has said, often by success and repetition people get careless in their attitude, in their behaviour and in their service but that cannot be said about our Irish airlines. In behaviour, manner, conduct, dress and in every possible way, I think the staffs of our Irish airlines are quite exemplary.  They are accepted all over the world.  The pilots, the navigation officers, and so on, are second to none and our record is due to their efficiency and their great care.  I would say the philosophy that life is very precious and nothing that would cause injury or in any way endanger life must ever be allowed to creep in has permeated to the board and direct to its personnel and that that is responsible for the very fine record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The imagination and courage of our Government in instituting this fine service are bearing fruit.  Even at this stage, I should like to say congratulations <Col N="1482" /> to them and may they continue to have imagination and courage in the future.  I hope that when Cork's airport is open&mdash;with the added success of that to the country and to us in Cork in particular&mdash;the Minister will be back next year looking for more money and that we shall support him again.  I congratulate him on the need for looking for this money and hope that we shall give it willingly and with grace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to join in a tribute to the work of Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta and Aerlínte, to the very efficient standard of service and also to the very distinctive friendliness they bring to their operations.  We can all be proud of their work and certainly wish them every success in the future. I am glad to see that the hotel project, in conjuction with Pan-American Airways, is about to come to fruition. In Cork at the moment, practically all during the summer season and well into the autumn, hotel accommodation is very difficult to get.  I think it is probably the same all round.  Therefore, we should welcome this development and add our voices to the appeals that it be kept at a reasonable level and that it will not earn the title of a luxury hotel.</P>
      <P>The Minister used the significant words &ldquo;operating profits" and "operating loss&rdquo;.  I wonder if that includes provision for depreciation and replacement of the fleet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The amounts for depreciation and replacement of the fleet have been deducted before that surplus is announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, the results are far more satisfactory than they appear at first reading.  The provision set aside last year for depreciation of the Aerlínte fleet was some £400,000.  That seems a very low figure to depreciate a fleet worth £10 million that is supposed to be replaced within ten years.  Ten years is the accepted life of such transatlantic planes at the moment.  The figure of £400,000 multiplied by ten gives £4 million.  I wonder whether that is the full amount of depreciation.  Perhaps it is accounted for by the fact that we <Col N="1483" /> did not have all the planes in our possession during that financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the year ended 31st March, 1960, there was no depreciation because there was no fleet.  The first Boeing plane came into operation on 14th December, 1960.  The depreciation in the accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1961, simply reflects the depreciation on that part of the fleet which was in operation at that time. It is indeed very small for that reason, something in the order of £50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must face up then to considerably higher depreciation in the coming year.  I recently had the pleasure of travelling by Aerlínte and seeing their service in New York and elsewhere.  It was brought home very forcibly to me in that experience that a single small company cannot hope to survive in a modern competitive world.  With the advent of the European Economic Community and the resulting competition and elimination of special privileges and advantages, I cannot see how Aerlínte can survive, unless it is successful in conducting mergers&mdash;I hope it will&mdash;with other similarly circumstanced airlines. Aerlínte at the moment has offices in many cities of the United States.  It seems very border-line economics, to say the least of it, if you have not a flight to, say, Los Angeles, to bear the cost of maintaining an office there. Aerlínte suffers from the same deficiency as every other activity in the community, the fact that we are such a small community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our intention to play whatever part we can in the European Economic Community and one of the first services that will have to be strengthened through suitable mergers is the transatlantic airlines. Also in the years ahead, according to my reading of the Rome Treaty, we can no longer retain the very special advantage Aerlínte enjoys in having among transatlantic flights the unique right of entry into Dublin.  That cannot <Col N="1484" /> be preserved indefinitely.  While we share the enthusiasm created by these figures.  I think it well to be cautious and see the difficulties that lie ahead.  I hope that the forward-looking policy of the Minister will lead to successful mergers in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank members of the Seanad for their very friendly welcome to this Bill.  I am sure that the directors and management of the air companies will be glad to hear their commendations regarding the service, which I also experienced myself.</P>
      <P>There are just one or two points I should like to make in connection with the observations here today.  The capital of Aer Rianta, as it will be after this Bill is passed, consists of shares taken by the Minister for Finance and there is not any arrangement at the moment for the repayment of capital. It is in the nature of shares invested in the company.  I hope that in the course of time it will be possible for the air companies to commence remunerating their capital.</P>
      <P>With regard to repayable advances, none has yet been issued.  When they are, in accordance with the terms of the Bill, arrangements will be made for repayment of interest on outstanding amounts at regular intervals and for the repayment of the capital itself.  We intend such issue of repayable shares for certain types of equipment whose effect on the economy of the company should be fairly quick, such as the establishment of a gigantic computer in connection with the booking of seats and other similar equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan spoke of the future of Aerlínte finances.  In fact, the deficit is going down very quickly.  The predictions made in 1957 when the whole question of transatlantic travel was considered by a number of experts proved to be a little optimistic but not excessively optimistic.  The prediction was made that we would actually break even in the year ending 31st March, 1961.  In fact, there has <Col N="1485" /> been a deficit, but the traffic is growing very rapidly and I am glad to tell the House that the percentage of seats occupied, of seats sold, on Aerlínte planes is at present higher than in any other major transatlantic air company. I also think the House would like to know that four years ago the prediction was made by people expert in market research that it should be possible for Aerlínte to carry 40 per cent. of the transatlantic traffic embarking and disembarking at Shannon.  At present the figure is 45 per cent. Allowing for the novelty of an Irish transatlantic service and all the difficulties to be overcome there, including the difficulty to be overcome in America where a great many people up to now thought we were not the sort of nation that could run a first-class air service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The House might also take note of the fact that the terms of the Rome Treaty include nothing about aviation at all.  There is no provision regarding aviation, no obligations or agreements relating to air companies among members of the Community so air companies are not at present affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are absolutely no obligations whatever either in respect of the type of provision which airlines might make or the type of provision already in operation as far as aviation is concerned.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan also spoke about pooling.  There is no need to discuss that today at all.  The Irish air companies operate on their own very successfully.  The surplus in the case of Aer Lingus more than makes up for the deficit on Aerlínte.  It is quite evident that as the world grows smaller, as the world shrinks, we will see various types of co-operation between countries in and outside the E.E.C.  There is co-operation at present.  Air companies in Europe, for example, share maintenance facilities, share each others planes for relief purposes.  The air companies will consider these problems from time to time.</P>
      <P>I think I have said everything that needs to be said, except that I should like to remark on the fact that the Seanad seems to be wholly united with regard to Aer Lingus and Aerlínte and I find it refreshing to notice this spirit of unity pervading the Seanad.  I go occasionally to remote rural parts and hear people comparing the capital issue for the Boeing services which will last for many years with the amount for old age pensions in the current year, as part of the current Supply Services, and that kind of dreary nonsense.  I am glad there has been no word of that here today.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee; reported without amendment; received for final consideration and passed.</P>
