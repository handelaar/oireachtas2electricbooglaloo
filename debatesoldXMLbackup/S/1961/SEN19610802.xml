      <P>Might I inquire whether it is intended to look for all stages of the Civil Liability Bill during this month?  The Bill is particularly complex and complicated.  It was dealt with on Committee Stage by a special select committee of the Dáil. It does not seem to me to afford much opportunity to the Seanad to study the Bill if we are to be asked to give all Stages during the coming month.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main object of the Bill is to increase the funds available to An Foras Tionscal from which grants may be made up to 31st December, 1963, for the promotion of industries both in the undeveloped areas and in the rest of the country. The Bill also provides for the increasing of the number of members of the Board of An Foras Tionscal from 3 to 5.  Its remaining provisions effect comparatively minor changes in the Undeveloped Areas Acts 1952 and 1957 and in the Industrial Grants Act, 1959, arising out of the experience of An Foras Tionscal in the operation of these Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aggregate amount of the grants which may be made by An Foras Tionscal is being increased from £10 million to £15 million.  This increase is necessitated by the fact that the provision of £10 million is likely to be exhausted sooner than was anticipated: as at 31st March, 1961, commitments of the order of £8 million had been entered into against the &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo; of £10 million.  On the basis of these commitments and taking into account projects at present under <Col N="1489" /> examination but which have not yet reached the approval stage it is expected that the limit of £10 million may be reached before the end of the present year.  Projects for which grants had been approved by An Foras Tionscal as at 31st March, 1961, involve an estimated total capital investment of over £26 million and are expected to give employment to close on 15,000 workers.  For details of particular grant payments by An Foras Tionscal, I would refer Senators to the report and accounts of that body for the year ended 31st March, 1961, which were recently presented to the House.</P>
    <P>The present legislation relating to industrial grants is due for renewal on 31st December, 1963.  I believe that the time has now come to undertake a comprehensive review of the present scheme, designed to assess the extent to which it has been successful and to see whether any modifications of the system are desirable.  Among the matters which will have to be brought under review are the question of whether the present concept of the undeveloped areas has outlived its usefulness and whether the time has come to adopt some alternative such as &ldquo;development areas&rdquo; to replace the existing &ldquo;undeveloped areas&rdquo; with the object of enabling other parts of the country to qualify for the more favourable grants at present applicable to projects sited in the undeveloped areas.  The reaching of decisions on these matters must await the outcome of the review to which I have referred. As a preliminary to the undertaking of the review, An Foras Tionscal has in hands a detailed study of grant aided projects, designed to assess the measure of success achieved by the existing grants scheme.  Pending the outcome of the review and the enactment of any consequential amending legislation I intend to continue to implement the policy laid down when the Undeveloped Areas Act 1952 was before the House of confining the scheduling of areas outside the undeveloped areas proper to &ldquo;fringe areas&rdquo; which are contiguous to the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Industrial Grants Act 1959 specified that <Col N="1490" /> the maximum grant which may be given by An Foras Tionscal in respect of an industrial project proposed for establishment outside the undeveloped areas may not exceed £250,000 unless the Government, having regard to the amount of employment likely to be afforded by an undertaking, approve of the making of a grant in excess of that figure.  When the Industrial Grants Act 1959 was in course of enactment, it was stated that the Government would not be disposed to avail of this special provision unless in the case of a project offering prospects for the employment of 2,000 workers or more.  I intend that this requirement should stand pending the outcome of the review to which I have referred and the implementation of any ensuing amending legislation. Nevertheless, I foresee that an exceptional case might arise which would warrant An Foras Tionscal in recommending to the Government the making of a grant in excess of £250,000 for a project which might not have a minimum employment content of 2,000 workers.  The type of project which I have in mind as possibly warranting such an exceptional recommendation by An Foras Tionscal would be one of major importance to the general wellbeing and economy of the State and involving an exceptionally large capital investment.  A possible example of such a project might be a timber pulp mill or a chemical industry.</P>
    <P>The reason for augmenting the board of An Foras Tionscal is that since the passing of the Undeveloped Areas Act 1952 which limited the Board to 3 members, the responsibilities of the Board have been very considerably widened due to the extension of their activities to the whole of the country instead of to the undeveloped areas, as previously and due to the very substantial increase in the number and size of projects which has come forward as a result of the programme undertaken by the Industrial Development Authority for the attraction of external investment.</P>
    <P>The object in providing that An Foras Tionscal may make grants towards the provision of plant (e.g. items such as cranes, roof tanks, electric transformers for general use as distinct from one for use in a particular process) is <Col N="1491" /> that legal advice recently received by An Foras Tionscal raised doubt as to whether they were entitled to make grants for plant, as distinct from machinery and equipment, as they had been doing.</P>
    <P>The provision relating to restrictions on the sale of assets or shares in a grant-aided concern does not introduce any new concept: it is intended to remove any doubts which may exist as to the legality of the present practice of An Foras Tionscal of writing into the agreements entered into with the promoters, a clause that they will not sell the assets or their shares in the concern, without the previous consent of An Foras Tionscal, for a stipulated period.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to avail of the opportunity of again stating categorically that the facilities under the industrial grants scheme are available to Irish promoters on exactly the same basis as to foreigners.</P>
    <P>I confidently recommend this Bill to the House and I should be glad if it could be given an early passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very interesting Bill, which involves quite a large sum of money, as well as a very important aspect of our national life, namely, industrial expansion.  Up to now, the consideration in this legislation was to put industries into undeveloped areas and I think it is true to say that in going into undeveloped areas, there was, first of all, a social rather than an industrial ideal.  First of all, the aim was more to employ people than to create industrial expansion.  I suppose the two went together but primarily the aim was to bring employment to the undeveloped areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the thinking behind this legislation will have to be changed.  It is in fact being changed in one way but for a different reason from that which I have in mind.  The reason I have in mind is the advent of the Common Market.  Our Taoiseach told us yesterday that we were about to seek admission, when certain conditions are fulfilled.  It would seem, therefore, that in future any industries that will be set up, whether in the <Col N="1492" /> undeveloped areas or in the new areas envisaged under this Bill to which the grants may be extended, will have to be approached from this point of view.  There is, first, the matter of placing isolated industries in out of the way places.  That should not be done unless the industries have some special local value where price content and the price of the articles produced are not a major factor.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the grants to areas outside the undeveloped areas.  It has often been said that the whole of our country is undeveloped or underdeveloped&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;including Dublin itself.  Although there is here the biggest concentration of industry, it is by no means overdeveloped. That being so, I feel that in future the important thing to ensure is that if industries are to be established in underdeveloped areas, the idea of putting in single industries should be got away from and a concentrated effort should be made to put groups of industries in pockets in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>That is important for two reasons. It is important from an economic point of view because a labour market can be created.  Instead of having isolated individuals coming to work in one factory or industry, a pool of workers can be created in the area.  Secondly, the workers will be inclined to stay in the places in which they are working, where they can have a social life built round a reasonable number of industries.  At present one of the difficulties is that very often when an industry is started and when the promoters have spent a lot of time and money on giving people technical training, they lost the workers.  The workers went to England or Dublin. Having gained the skills, they were able to sell their skill at a high price in an area where they had a social life. These considerations should be taken into account in the new set-up of our having to establish industries which will have to compete in the open market and with industries in other countries.</P>
    <P>I was rather interested when the Minister told us that Foras Tionscal were at present engaged in a review of <Col N="1493" /> the present scheme.  That would be in accord with what I have been saying. I see that the Minister was asked in the Dáil what effect the funds already advanced had had in the underdeveloped areas.  I was very surprised and pleased to hear the Minister say that there were only two failures out of 61 now in production.  That is very good.  When they are carrying out the review of the present scheme, I am sure Foras Tionscal will also inquire into how many of those 61 now in production will exist in the new arrangement towards which we are moving.  Will these industries be able to survive without protection?  How long will it be necessary to protect them in order to enable them to survive? Can they be brought into such a state of efficiency as to enable them to compete in the new situation? Generally speaking, the Bill is to be welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister expressed the wish that this Bill would be given a quick passage.  Certainly, I would not wish to delay it.  This Bill, however, was initiated prior to the decision in regard to the E.E.C. and largely provides for commitments entered into before that decision was taken at all.  In that situation, it is somewhat unreal to be considering the question of developed areas and undeveloped areas because we must face up to the situation that it is not simply a part of the country but the whole country which must be regarded as undeveloped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has given some indication that this question is to be reconsidered but before that reconsideration is entered into, I think we should look carefully at what we are doing at the present time.  In other words, I do not think it is very wise, in view of the decision to apply for membership of the European Economic Community, to go ahead with the setting up of industries without attempting to assess whether or not they will have a future.  If we become a member of the E.E.C., it does not make sense to set up industries and a year afterwards face the possible dismemberment of them.  That <Col N="1494" /> is no solution to our economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>I referred to developed and undeveloped areas.  I should like the Minister to consider his and my native city.  I suppose it is regarded as a developed area.  It is certainly not in the undeveloped areas but in the context of E.E.C., I wonder what the situation of industry will be there? What, for example, will happen Fords?  Does it make sense that Fords could possibly continue to manufacture cars for this small market in the context of the European Community when they could do it at bigger centres nearer the markets and nearer the raw materials?  The same situation exists in regard to the neighbouring firm of Dunlops.  It is ridiculous to regard such a place as a developed area that would not need special assistance in the development of industry and in the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>I grant that this Bill was initiated prior to the decision being taken and I grant that it largely provides for commitments entered into before the decision was taken.  Before we go any further, I think the Minister and the authority concerned should take a careful look and see if we could not use our resources better in the situation we are facing and whether we would not be doing a better job for our citizens if we concentrated on the larger units, on industries that would have some possibility of a future in the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not regard what I have said as a criticism of the measure or of what has been done.  We should now move away from the idea of developing industry locally so as to provide employment in the undeveloped areas.  In the new context, this whole country is undeveloped, not one part developed and another part undeveloped.</P>

      <P>No; it is not even that. If it were, it would have something <Col N="1495" /> specific.  It would be more positive.  If Fianna Fáil adopted that attitude in 1932, we would not be in a position now to promote industry.  That is my answer to Senator Murphy; that is the answer to Senator Murphy's defeatist speech.  The point Senator Murphy was trying to make, that merely because the Common Market is a topical subject&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is nothing new under the sun.  For the Senator's information&mdash;I do not want to be dragged off the point I am trying to make&mdash;the Common Market is not new.  If the Senator will study his history, he will see that there is nothing new in the Common Market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>What?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be news to Senator L'Estrange.  I am quite prepared to accept that that intelligence is quite new to the Senator.  I am trying to make the point that the fact that there may be a grouping of countries in Europe does not warrant our ceasing our industrial activity.  Far from it.  We are now only at the commencement of it.  Regardless of what advantages other countries may have, I think we have as good an advantage in the European market as any of them.  This Bill has no relation whatsoever to the Common Market but, as the Senator sought to make the point, I should like to say that that is not our attitude.</P>
      <P>Senator McGuire made a good point, and it was made before, when he suggested that promotional activities should tend to group industrial efforts.  I dare say there is something to be said for that.  This Bill deals merely with the financial angle&mdash;the Industrial Grants Act.  I might say a word about Foras Tionscal: it is more or less responsible, together with the Industrial Credit Company and the Industrial Development Authority.  Most reasonable people will agree that Foras Tionscal have done a good job of work in this regard.  So have the Industrial Development Authority and the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> I was looking through the last report. One might offer some little criticism on the grounds that the report is scanty in information and a bit late in issuing.  But, apart from that, the activities of Foras Tionscal since the Industrial Grants Act&mdash;from the period 1956-1959 onwards&mdash;are a fairly creditable performance.  We are glad, I think, that the Minister has accepted the principle of including marginal areas as ranking for grants under the Act.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Murphy that this whole country is an undeveloped country.  The Senator has a bad dose of an inferiority complex when he says that.  On the contrary, this is a well-developed country.  There is nothing undeveloped about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make a serious point.  The Senator will have his soapbox in Mullingar very soon and he can get away with that on the market square when there will be nobody to take him up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is when the mess has been cleared up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume all Parties subscribed to the industrial effort.  I said I was glad the Minister had included marginal areas and that he is prepared to sanction comparable grants for areas near the undeveloped areas. We all know that our efforts in this regard will be governed by the size of our purse and the amount of money which can be devoted to promoting industrial activity of this description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think most people&mdash;chambers of commerce and those interested in promoting industry&mdash;can obtain all the information they require from the various bodies set up to deal with this matter.  Speaking on my own behalf, I found the Industrial Development Authority, the Industrial Credit Company and Foras Tionscal which, incidentally, is not a State body, very helpful any time I sought information regarding the location of an industry, <Col N="1497" /> the financing of an industry or any smaller details regarding preliminaries.</P>
    <P>There is nothing good but can be better.  While I do not agree with lengthy reports, it might be useful if it were possible to have this report with a little more padding and to have it issued a little earlier.  One notes from the report that, of the 100 or so manufacturing projects proposed over the past five years, roughly one-third have British interests involved.  It is understandable enough that this type of industrial activity should appeal to the British businessman for reasons which are obvious and into which I need not go now.</P>
    <P>There are also some Continental firms interested here and many firms have made contacts with this country over the past few years.  I think many of them are anxious&mdash;and perhaps in the light of recent events will be more anxious to set up industries here.  The reasons are obvious enough&mdash;low rates, low taxes, political stability, a good supply of labour and a good potential for industrial technicians.  We have upwards of 255 technical schools in this country quite capable of turning out smart young students who are anxious to become, later on, willing workers.</P>
    <P>There are many other facilities available to outside industrialists in this legislation.  Income tax and corporation profits tax, over a period of ten to 15 years, will be remitted.  Any industrialist will realise that this will enable a company to build up a reserve and further to expand from there.</P>
    <P>One point I should like to mention is in regard to the wording of the Act where it says that 100 per cent. of the cost of the building and 50 per cent. of the cost of the plant respectively can be paid.  I think the wording could be a little more specific.  Continental promoters when they see that wording are inclined to look for the full 100 per cent. and 50 per cent., as the case may be.  I am quite sure there is available to them sufficient information to let them know that they may not get a grant of that description. I assume that when it comes to legislating on this point, it is hard to be <Col N="1498" /> positive.  Since the <i>Programme for Industrial Expansion</i> was formulated, there has been more or less steady progress.  If we continue that into the next five or ten year period, I am quite sure we shall be in a stronger position than ever to group our industries, if necessary, and to make an assault on whatever market may be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to say a few words on the Minister's brief but the debate has been widened very considerably.  I believe in reasonable planning arrangements.  Certainly in recent weeks in this House we have had some examples&mdash;and we have two more today&mdash;of very inadequate planning arrangements, if we are to take the Bills at their face value.  Of course we could take the Bills as just pieces of election literature.  I am going to develop that point about this Bill.</P>

      <P>Let the cap fit. Two years ago, we had a Bill in this House to provide for grants under these pieces of legislation with a limit of £10 million.  Two years later, it has <Col N="1499" /> to be increased by another £5 million. Does that suggest reasonable planning? We had the same thing last week when we had the Air Navigation and Transport Bill.  The amount in relation to that legislation was increased from £8 million to £10 million two years ago and now it is being made £13 million.</P>

      <P>It does not suggest that people can see very far ahead. My main point is that there is no necessity whatever for this piece of legislation at this time.

      <P>This is like the Fianna Fáil Deputies in the Dublin Corporation who would not make any grants until the money was in the till; the game worked by two Fianna Fáil Deputies on the Housing Committee. This is the obverse of the coin. It takes years sometimes for commitments to go through a system and I am not talking about the word &ldquo;debts&rdquo; which became &ldquo;commitments&rdquo; in certain political events in the past.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter in the Minister's brief.  He states that a possible example of a large project is a timber pulp mill.  Am I to take it from this statement that the Government have decided to develop the timber products industry through private industry?  If they have, it is a very serious decision to announce in this way.</P>

      <P>I shall accept the Minister's word on that score.  I shall not develop the point.  Either the chemical industry or the pulp industry would be a big thing.  They are <Col N="1500" /> not really relevant to this Bill, I take it.</P>
      <P>The third point I should like to make about this Bill is that apparently over the next couple of years we shall be paying seven per cent. for money. I remember when the Bills dealing with international financial associations, to which we were subscribing, were going through this House, on all sides of the House, we said that it was very unlikely that we would ever want to borrow money from them because they were charging seven per cent.  I can see we might easily be going for money to these international bodies for these purposes because apparently we would get it cheaper there than in the particular climate that is building up here at the moment.</P>
      <P>In regard to the last few paragraphs of the Minister's brief, it may be again that the same approach of mind applies to this as the Minister pleaded a moment ago.  He says that he wishes to avail of the opportunity to state categorically that the facillities under the industrial grant scheme are available to Irish promoters on exactly the same basis as to foreign promoters. This is a remarkable piece of literature. I take it that it was written in the Minister's Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I want to come to a matter that was introduced in a major way in the discussion, that is, that we find a climate growing up here in relation to the Common Market, that the idea of our joining it has been sold in this country over the past two years by people who have little connection with industry and by a few people who have some connection with agriculture, with the result that the policy of Fianna Fail in relation to industry, which the Fine Gael Party sometimes felt was pressed too hard, but which has on the whole proved successful in relation to the main articles needed by our people&mdash;clothing and shelter and many small articles&mdash;is to be reversed. Take electric light bulbs.  When they were first made in this country, they were terrible.  They were not even straight.  But now I believe that, in general, we have as good electric bulbs as anywhere in the world.  Are we to jettison all these and, at the same time, as Senator Murphy suggested, give away our political freedom as a side wind on it?  I am not interested in the <Col N="1502" /> people who put their money into those factories, because they have already made at least as much out of them as they put into them, but I am interested in the ordinary people who accepted bad boots and poor quality clothing and badly made delph for many years.</P>

I am glad to say again that I have on occasions held rather strong views but I find them stated in public by few people. They may state them behind their hands in private all right.  On this question of our joining the Common Market in a particular way, I am not alone in my view that we are jettisoning at one stroke of the pen a policy into which so much effort has been put.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement on this Bill.  The most significant figure he gave was that £26 million is the capital investment in industries providing employment for about 15,000 workers.  That is a very comforting fact because it means capital investment of about £2,000 per worker, and as long as we can keep our average capital investment anywhere in that region, we should have no real difficulties with capital supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are looking at that, it would be well if the Minister and the Government used these same figures to evaluate what the present flight from the land is costing us.  There are 7,000 or 8,000 people leaving the land each year.  Capital to absorb these into industry would run from £13 million to £15 million a year.  I make this suggestion to the Minister in <Col N="1504" /> passing from this point, that it would be well to consider that perhaps £13 million or £15 million, if properly invested in the land, might achieve that same objective; in other words, it might accomplish the turning of the tide and keep those 7,000 or 8,000 people on the land.  If they are held there, you will have a much sturdier and healthier national community than one where you have this flight from the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of theory in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has promised a review, and it is quite timely.  We all look forward to its findings, especially in the complex situation we find ourselves in at present, as stressed so much by Senator Murphy, that is, the impact of this unknown development on our industries. The next two or three years will be critical and I hope that we shall have full scale and independent reviews of many of our activities, especially a review of what we have achieved up to date in our liberal scheme of grants for industrial development and how these might be regulated to give maximum effect in future.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that Foras Tionscal have in hands a detailed study of grant-aided projects, designed to assess the measure of success achieved by the existing grants scheme.  That, to my mind, seems to encompass the whole field of the promised review of the present scheme.  I must pay the highest possible tribute to Foras Tionscal and their fine staff for what they have done.  In this instance, I regard them as the body who have put the policy into operation.  They made many of the decisions, and they had a hand in shaping and orientating that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is wise that the same body should undertake the major share of the review.  A commission or a committee should be set up on which Foras Tionscal would have some representatives, but on which there would also be outside representation.  In that way only can we look forward to an impartial and scientific examination <Col N="1505" /> of our progress.  It is only on such a sound basis that we can chart our course for the future.</P>
    <P>The second point which emerged clearly in this debate, and in the Dáil, is the question of the undeveloped areas.  The coming of the European Common Market has been seized on by many to belabour the help that has been given to undeveloped areas.  That help was of vital importance to the development of the country, and to the creation of small industries in our towns and villages.  That, to my mind, was far more important than the creation of the same amount of total employment in Cork or Dublin.  It is through the country and its small towns that a nation breathes, and lives, and has its being.</P>
    <P>That will be of even greater importance in the future if we join the Common Market, because we will be exposed to all the ramifications of the Treaty of Rome, and we will find that if we are to preserve our nationality, it will be preserved only in so far as we are successful in building up and strengthening our towns, villages and farms.  That nationality will not be preserved by having mammoth factories in Cork, Dublin or Galway.  I appeal to the Minister, as one who has come from an undeveloped part of the country himself, knows the conditions there, and knows what industries mean to towns and villages, not to fall for the line of reasoning that the workings of the Common Market would aggravate further the flight from the towns and villages in rural Ireland into the cities.  I hope that will be resisted by every possible means.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the country as a whole is undeveloped.  Of course, that is just one of those extravagant statements.  Undeveloped compared with what?  Undeveloped compared with London, yes.  Undeveloped compared with England, yes.  But we have to count our blessings here, and realise that our stage of development is on a par with the stage of development of 20 per cent. of the population of the world, at least.  We have nothing to be ashamed of in the use we have made of the few years we have had to develop. I feel confident that if we play <Col N="1506" /> our part in the European Economic Community in the spirit of that Community, and if we see, above all, that everything we prize in our national heritage is preserved and strengthened, we can look forward to the coming decades with confidence.  Far too much has been made of the effect of joint industries on our industries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a passing reference to the points raised by Senator Murphy and Senator O'Donovan on that question.  I have no intention of developing it at length, but so far as it impacts on the grants for which we are voting money, I want to raise these few caveats.  I want to caution people against the idea that it is only the chain store or the enormous industrial unit that can survive, and that, by inference, our small industries should be got rid of as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Such a policy of monopoly is in many ways totally foreign to the spirit that motivates the Common Market. That spirit is shown in the insistence on family farms, and on their part in developing the morale and nationality of the people concerned.  Is not the small industry in a town or village the counterpart of a small family farm?  When ranches and 1,000 acre units are taboo on the agricultural side, I do not see why we should not be able to resist strongly a great flight to mammoth industries.  I have every confidence that our small industries will go from strength to strength, and will play their part in the future, just as they did in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of this £26 million which the Minister mentioned has been contributed by way of capital, we as a nation have contributed £8 million by way of grant. That is a substantial contribution by <Col N="1507" /> the taxpayers, but the contribution I am looking for and cannot find is a contribution by the workers themselves, that is, a contribution by way of worker participation and worker share capital.  The savings of the workers, even though small individually, globally can be quite large and play quite a large part in the contribution to the financing of our industries. I wonder whether in designing the grant scheme, Foras Tionscal have made any effort to encourage that type of capitalisation on a par with the more orthodox type of share capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is concerned with the making of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  Surely in making grants, and in making an additional £5 million available, we are at liberty to express views as to how those grants may be used for the best fulfilment of our industrial development. That is all I am endeavouring to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stressed the fact that the terms and inducements are as readily available to Irish promoters as to foreign promoters.  I think he was quite right to stress that very strongly. We have heard it stated in the country that if you speak with a German accent, you get far more than a mere ordinary Irishman.  I am glad that has been contradicted by the Minister. I feel that if these Irish promoters included worker participation and the local savings of the credit unions, it would be much more securely tied in to the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in giving grants to small units, the idea is held that when the small units begin to enlarge, you may have to go to the expense of putting up dwellings, and so on, for the workers involved, as in the case of the Shannon Industrial Estate which we have been discussing.  I hold in this context that there is no need whatever for that. We are getting too soft in our thinking. In large industrial countries, like England or America, what is half an hour's travel to or from work?  Anyone in the city of New York who has only half an hour or an hour's travel considers he is living on the doorstep of <Col N="1508" /> the job.  Certainly if any worker or any community of workers is within 12 or 15 miles of the plant in an adjacent town or village, there is no reason why our industrial development should have to face the burden of rehousing them within half a mile of the plant.</P>
    <P>With regard to the survival of units in our undeveloped areas, if those areas are classed as undeveloped, I do not see why there cannot be a wage differential between them and large cities.  This would be just a realistic appraisal of facts, of what it means to be able to live convenient to work and, at the same time, have all the facilities of the Irish countryside.  That is worth a considerable amount.  I note that the rate paid in Italy to labour is 2/5d. per hour, while here I think it is 4/2d.  There will be inequalities in pay between units in the Common Market and I do not see any reason why such inequalities should not prevail in a free market if it is the only means of ensuring that our small industries will remain in our towns and villages.</P>
    <P>I look forward to this review to be carried out by the Minister and appeal to him to ensure that it will be conducted neither by his Department nor by Foras Tionscal but will be as independent as any review can be made as it is the most important undertaking at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy should be congratulated on the statement he has made today.  He asked us to face realities, not to bury our heads in the sand.  I think he is quite correct in the facts he stated and I do not agree at all with Senator Carter who regarded Senator Murphy's speech as defeatist.  That is all wrong.  It would be better if more politicians in the Government and outside told the people the truth.  We are concerned here with £8,000,000 of the taxpayers' money and even if we are on the eve of a general election we should be very careful about the spending of that money.  The Minister in this Bill is getting permission to increase expenditure from £10 to £15 millions.  Seven million pounds roughly have already <Col N="1509" /> been spent so we are dealing with expenditure of roughly £8 millions of the taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>Listening to Senator Carter and some Fianna Fáil Senators one would think that talk about increased production was in some way a substitute for a policy of increased production.  I should like to tell them that all the exhortations in the world will not prevent production from declining or even factories from closing with an inefficient administration and a wrongly conceived policy.  That is the danger facing us today.  That is all Senator Murphy has pointed out to the Minister. He asked the Minister to face realities because the situation today is definitely changing and has changed from what it was a year or two ago. Many Continental firms have come here in the last few years and used Ireland as a back door to the British market.  If Ireland joins the Common Market along with Britain&mdash;and we have stated we will&mdash;a danger faces us that those German or French factories with subsidiary factories here can as easily export to the British market from their own countries as from Ireland and may close their factories here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to agree with Senator Murphy that we must be very particular about the taxpayers' <Col N="1510" /> hard-earned money and make sure that those industries will be able to stand on their own feet, export when the tariffs are taken down in a few years as they very well may be and face the difficulties that will undoubtedly confront them from abroad. The circumstances will be very different in the future from what they were in the past 15, 20 or 30 years. These industries may not even have their own home market.</P>
      <P>It is, I think, an awful pity that the Government when appeals were made to them four years ago did not set up a committee to go into the pros and cons of the Common Market and how it would affect our industries.  If the Government had done that in 1958 and 1959&mdash;instead of trying to abolish proportional representation&mdash;instead of a fortnight or three weeks ago, they would have the information now and be in a better position to allocate this money having the full facts before them.  We all admit that certain Irish industries can compete, are competing and will in the future compete, with industries from abroad.  Others who have got the taxpayers' money and protection for long years have made no effort, good, bad or indifferent, to put themselves in a position to compete, if and when we enter the Common Market.</P>

      <P>I am telling the truth; I am saying what is known by all industrialists in the country.  We all like to believe in our heart and soul that every industry set up in Ireland during the past 30 years could weather the storm but we know that many cannot. The Government have stated they will give compensation and that workers will have to be compensated or other employment found for them. There must have been some necessity for stating that.  In spending this £8 million, the Government should be very careful.  They should see to it that none of these factories will close down within the next two, three, four or five years when we enter the Common Market.  It is admitted that this Bill is a continuation of the Industrial Grants Act introduced by Deputy Sweetman in 1956, an Act which was much condemned at the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the turn some of this debate has taken. It appears that on the Government benches any criticism is considered to be sabotage of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That type of exclusive arrogance has been adopted by that political Party for too long.  Personally, I am not going to allow anyone to get away with it here.  It is obvious to anyone reading history that the development in industry which took place here in the 1930s was largely a matter of pure expedience rendered necessary by the destruction of the agricultural industry&mdash;the industry which has not yet recovered from the ravages of that period.  The figures produced in the Budget show that that reduction is still taking place to the continuing disadvantage of the economy.</P>
      <P>We will never build up a sound industry of any sort in this country until agriculture is first put on a proper basis and until industry becomes something that will consider agriculture in its proper context.  To my mind, the criteria by which industry can best be judged in this country are: Is it an export success?  Do the products it produces give good value for money and has it a good employment content?</P>
      <P>Many of the reasons why those criteria cannot be applied to many industries here is the siting of industries in disadvantageous positions.  Great Britain is a very successful country industrially but there are not many industries sited in the Highlands of Scotland.  They would not long survive there.  If heavy and suitable industry is to be sited in Ireland when the Common Market comes in and when we will be forced to be competitive, they will probably have to be sited in the portal areas&mdash;in places like Waterford, Cork, and possibly Limerick.  I doubt if western Donegal, Sligo or such areas will be nearly as suitable.  The freight and other charges would be far too great a burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" /> Undoubtedly, there will be great opportunities for this country, if only we use them to the best advantage. One thing I have noticed very much in recent years in the enormous development of the economies of northwestern Europe, particularly Britain, northern France, the Low Countries and Western Germany, is the difficulty of finding portal facilities.  The portal facilities and the large water areas available in Waterford and Cork are capable of enormous development and expansion.  The large ships that trade in the Seven Seas will find it convenient to break down the cargoes and, perhaps, manufacture the raw materials which they will bring in at these portal areas where they can be cleared quickly rather than having to wait days and perhaps weeks, as they do outside Rotterdam, Liverpool and such ports which are fog-bound and bar-bound and so are unsuitable places. These are the sorts of things that ought to be exploited rather than have items manufactured here that have no change of an export potential and that will never give self-sustaining or increasing employment in this little country.</P>
    <P>We have too many disadvantages here to think we shall have the money or the wealth to bolster up industries which cannot have a chance of standing on their own two feet.  If we do, what happens in the final analysis is that we shall make our agricultural industry uneconomic by the fact that the costs will rise too high on that industry.</P>
    <P>I am surprised these points are not borne in mind when the Government are framing their policy.  Many of the industries which have been sited in the west could, with advantage to themselves, be sited elsewhere.  With a prospective competitive advantage from entering the Common Market, which most people foresaw, they would have been better sited in the south and the south-east than in the west, where they are less likely to be a success because they will carry the increased costs of freight inwards and outwards.</P>
    <P>I do not cavil at the Government for making this extra money available for these purposes.  It shows that they are interested in promoting this aspect of <Col N="1515" /> our economy.  We shall not have enough money in this country to promote anything unless we do so in the best and most efficient way.  We shall not be allowed to trade in the Common Market because there are shamrocks on our goods but because the goods that bear the shamrock are the best and most competitive goods entering that Market.</P>

      <P>Like other Senators, I wish to support this Bill.  I do not intend to say a great deal about it because the necessity for having a sufficient sum available for grants for the establishment of industry is clear to all of us.  The point raised by Senator Murphy as to whether at this stage we ought to hand out grants lavishly in view of impending developments is well worthy of consideration.  It surprises me that a point of that kind, made in a thoughtful and constructive way, should have engendered such heat on the part of Senator Carter and indeed on the part of the Minister himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There was provision in the 1952 Act for extending the areas of operation of Foras Tionscal by Ministerial Order.  At the time the 1956 Act was introduced, the Taoiseach, then Deputy Lemass, opened the debate for the Opposition.  He is reported as follows at column 1944 of Volume 160 of the Official Debates:</P>
      <P>The first question that arises on this Bill is why it is considered necessary at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> Then, at column 1946, he is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>Why is it considered necessary at this stage that State aid to new industries should be given in the form of free grants.  One would have thought that the Minister himself would have felt obliged to give some explanation of his own change of attitude in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in 1956, had no great regard for the Bill which was being introduced and of which this Bill is an amendment.  He had no great regard for the policy of providing free grants for the establishment of industry outside the undeveloped areas.  That is the only point I wish to make&mdash;that this Act helped to lay the foundations for the successful industrial development that we have witnessed over the past few years.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that industries are not like mushrooms.  They do not grow up overnight.  One does not get in the short space of one or two years an increase in industrial output simply because there happens to be a change of Government.  The increase in industrial output and export stems from the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, and an Act passed towards the end of that year, the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which provided for tax concessions on all profits on goods exported from the country.</P>
    <P>These are points which, unfortunately are not sufficiently well known to the public for one reason&mdash;that the Opposition Parties lack an <i>Irish Press,</i> an <i>Evening Press</i> and a <i>Sunday Press.</i></P>

The conclusion which anybody <Col N="1518" /> with a detached mind would reach is that Senators on the opposite side are hostile to the objects this Bill is designed to promote.

      <P>You cannot have it both ways.  The objects of this Bill are twofold.  It is a Bill to extend the Undeveloped Areas Acts and to extend the Industrial Grants Act.  One would imagine from the speeches we have heard from those on the opposite benches that the enactment of the original Undeveloped Areas Act was due to the Coalition Government.  It was, of course, the Fianna Fáil Government which enacted the Undeveloped Areas Act in 1952.  There is no doubt about that and, if I remember rightly, there was no opposition to it in this House at the time, but it appears there is opposition now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Those who talk about the flight from the land and who say we are not investing money in the land are not stating facts because there is more money being invested in the land <Col N="1520" /> today than there has been invested for a number of years.</P>

      <P>I do not like to chase all of the hares started during this debate but unfortunately there are some I cannot ignore.  However, I shall come first to the more constructive contributions that were made. First of all, I can take Senator McGuire's suggestion that we might begin to contemplate grouping industries in different parts of the country. It would be a good idea but we must realise that the siting of an industry must be, and always will be, a matter for those investing in it, for those carrying the equity.  I have always maintained that neither Foras Tionscal nor I should influence any industrialist to site his undertaking in any part of the country.  This is something that must remain peculiarly a matter for the industrialist himself.  There are many technicalities that operate in relation to the siting of an industry and these must be left to the promoter himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>You said, Sir, that the Bill was not necessary and was only a piece of election propaganda. We have in the Industrial Development Authority and in Foras Tionscal two bodies which carry the confidence of the community and certainly carry the confidence of members of both Houses of the Oireachtas who have had any contact with them.  Many months ago, they represented to me that the moneys available for grants were being committed and that they foresaw, before the end of this year, the possibility that all the money they were authorised by the Oireachtas to commit would have been committed. Therefore they asked me if I would introduce an amending Bill to ensure that no project presented to them would be refused grant assistance, or held up in any way for want of money.</P>
      <P>It was on the basis of that request, and having examined the situation as I saw it, that I decided to introduce this Bill.  I do not know whether the chairmen or members of these bodies have any interest in the election propaganda of Fianna Fáil.  I doubt if they have, but I can assure the House that it is only on the basis of what was suggested to me that this Bill appears before the Seanad and not as a piece of Fianna Fáil propaganda.  In any event, the performance of the Government over the past four and a half years has been such as to make it unnecessary to rush in pieces of election propaganda at this stage.  There is no Bill before the House that is not essential.</P>

      <P>Senator Murphy did pose the question, whether in the event <Col N="1522" /> of our being admitted a member of the European Economic Community, we should not think twice about this policy of giving grants to industry.  I do not want to accuse him of defeatism but perhaps I misunderstood the Senator.  He is shaking his head.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The implication was clearly that industries are now being set up with the aid of grants given by Foras Tionscal without studying the effect which European Economic Community conditions will have on them. I take it that that is what he meant. Again, I should like to assure the Senator that every industry to which a grant commitment is made is examined very closely by the Industrial Development Authority, in the first place, and, secondly, by Foras Tionscal, and unless it is seen to be a viable industry and unless it is established to Foras Tionscal that it has a reasonable prospect of surviving, a grant will not be given.</P>
      <P>I should like to add that in most cases the bulk of the output of these new industries is designed for export, and already many of them are engaged in successful exporting operations in many parts of the world, which indicates that, even as of now, they are prepared to withstand world competition. I am not going to suggest that that is applicable to all cases, but by and large, I do not think the Senator need have any fears about a very careful appraisal being made of the soundness of an industry before any grant is given to it.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was made that the Bill was introduced before our decision to make application to become a member of E.E.C. and that therefore we might have second thoughts even about going ahead with the Bill.  I can only repeat that our possible accession to E.E.C. was envisaged many months ago and certainly before this Bill was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan made the point that while £26 million represented the total capital investment in these industries, £8 million was a quite substantial <Col N="1523" /> amount to be paid by way of grants by the Exchequer.  That is true.  He also suggested that the workers in those factories might be induced by Foras Tionscal to make contributions to the capital of those industries.  As the Senator knows, moneys provided for grants are taken out of the capital account, and that account includes such savings by the ordinary workers as the Post Office Savings Bank, small contributions to national loans, and the like, so that in that fashion the workers who are being given good employment are enabled to contribute to our savings and in that fashion, indirectly though it might be, to contribute to the capital structure of our industrial undertakings.</P>
    <P>Senator Carter made some mild complaint about the delay in the printing of the report of Foras Tionscal. I think the House ought to be aware that that report was in the hands of the members in June, that is, the report for the year ended 31st March, 1961, and I think it could almost be fairly claimed that it was probably the first report of a State-sponsored body that was in the hands of members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>He also complained that the wording of the Act or of the literature of Foras Tionscal might be vague enough to be considered by foreigners as indicating that full 100 per cent. grants would be given for factory buildings and 50 per cent. grants for machinery in the undeveloped areas.  I have here a copy of the &ldquo;handout&rdquo; of Foras Tionscal in this connection.  It clearly says &ldquo;grants not exceeding the full cost of factory and grants not exceeding half the cost of machinery and equipment.&rdquo;  It may be that the Act might not be as specific as that, but as far as foreigners coming into this country are concerned, they will be told at a very early stage that the grants of 100 per cent. for factory and 50 per cent. for machinery are maximum grants and are not available in all cases&mdash;in fact, are available only in very few, because it is only reasonable to assume that Foras Tionscal will look to the promoter of the industry for his <Col N="1524" /> own contribution to show his confidence in his undertaking.</P>
    <P>As Senator Quinlan pointed out, £26 million total investment against £8 million grants committed, is a fair indication that quite a substantial contribution is required from these promoters before a grant of the taxpayers' money is forthcoming.  I think that, too, will answer the suggestion of Senator L'Estrange that as soon as Common Market conditions come into operation for us, these people are going to abandon their factories.  They are hardly likely to abandon contributions of that order of the balance of £26 million when £8 million grant money is taken from it.  Of course, these people are interested in their investment and in the return this investment will give to them.  They come here, not, as Senator L'Estrange suggested, to get a back door entrance into the British market.  In that respect, I stand over my interjection that statements like that are nothing but sabotage.  They come here because in these places they have an intelligent and adaptable labour force, a labour force capable of producing goods of a quality equal, if not superior, to the quality of goods produced in any other countries.</P>
    <P>As far as the suggestion is concerned that some of them are using locations in Ireland to enable goods to get into the British market by the back door, I should like to remind the House that the conditions under which Irish goods are given preferential treatment on the British market come under the trade agreements made between this country and Great Britain, and the relationships between the two countries in this respect to ensure that the terms of these agreements are properly carried out and adhered to are very close and cordial.  On any occasion when there is the slightest doubt&mdash;I do not think there has been any suggestion that these trade agreements are being availed of in that way &mdash;there is the closest degree of cooperation possible between the authorities on both sides to ensure that there is no such evasion.  That is why I suggest that to make wild, unsustainable and unsustained charges in this <Col N="1525" /> House that foreign industrialists have come here and have done so to defeat the terms of these agreements is sabotage. These charges should not be made unless they can be supported.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley suggested, and supported Senator L'Estrange in this respect, that this is only an extension of the 1956 Industrial Grants Act.  He is right, but only very partially right. To ignore the 1952 Act is completely wrong.  The Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, was passed for the purpose of inducing the establishment of industries in the undeveloped areas which corresponded mainly with what were known as the congested districts.  The phrase congested districts was a handy statutory definition imported into the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952. Under that Act power was vested in the Minister of Industry and Commerce to schedule contiguous areas and say that grants should be given to industries located in those contiguous areas. In 1956, the Coalition Government brought in a Bill bringing the grants available to new industrial undertakings outside the undeveloped areas up to a maximum of £50 million.</P>
    <P>In 1959, the Undeveloped Areas Act, and the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, were taken together for amendment purposes primarily for the purpose of the increasing of the ceiling of grants applicable to both areas.  In the 1956 Act, the ceiling was brought to £10 million.  Therefore, this Bill is not only an extension of the 1956 Act but also of the 1952 Act and the 1959 Act.  Its primary purpose, as I have said, is to raise the ceiling from the £10 million fixed in 1959, to £15 million.  That appears to be necessary even at present, or will be necessary in the course of some months.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the Senator that grants are not handed out lavishly.  The closest possible examination is made of each and every proposition.  Grants are not given out willy-nilly, but are given as the undertaking develops, as the factory is built and the machinery installed.  The closest possible scrutiny is made of the expenditure of the grants.  Not only that, but there is in the agreement the <Col N="1526" /> condition that the promoters are not entitled to part with the factory premises, or their shares, unless within a specified time.  That has always been part of the agreements made between Foras Tionscal and the people who sought and got grants.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, we are removing a doubt which arose that those conditions were enforceable and we are including a provision to make them statutorily enforceable.  There can be no suggestion whatever that grants are given lavishly without any regard for their effect or without any regard for the taxpayer who is providing the moneys.</P>
    <P>Those, I think, are some of the main points which were raised.  I want to say that while negotiations will soon be in hand for our accession to the Common Market, we must, in no circumstances, in the meantime sit down to see what is going to happen. Unless we have confidence in ourselves and in the future, we will get nowhere.</P>

      <P>We will have to proceed on the basis that we have a viable economy and that our people are able and prepared to work as hard and as efficiently as people in other parts of Europe.  I am not suggesting that we will not have our difficulties. We certainly will, but so far as the Government are concerned, they have taken full account of those difficulties.</P>
      <P>The suggestion was made during the course of the debate that we are ill-prepared for our advent into the Common Market.  It is well known that all of our industries have been alerted and that the Committee of Industrial Organisation has been set up to examine closely&mdash;with the help of economists and with technical help &mdash;what the effects of our accession to the Common Market are likely to be. Therefore, when the time comes, we shall be properly prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be no illusions about our accession to the Common Market from the point of view of time.  In the case of Britain, it will take several months and possibly years before she ultimately becomes a member.  It is <Col N="1527" /> inevitable, in any event, that there will be long and protracted negotiations in the case of each country's application for admission.  We propose to use those months to ensure that industry will be prepared to the fullest possible extent for any changes that will be brought about by our accession to the Common Market.  We shall be well able, in most cases, to face up to the obligations of the Rome Treaty in so far as industry is concerned.</P>

      <P>I want to make a few observations on this, the most important section of the Bill.  The Minister has taken us through the various developments of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, and the amending Acts of 1956 and 1959.  The Minister did not say anything with which I would substantially disagree. In fact, I do not think he said anything that was not in accord with what I stated myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> I want to make the point that the 1956 Act was responsible for the extension of the free grants for industry to areas outside the undeveloped areas. When the 1956 Act was introduced it was the expressed view of the Taoiseach that that should have been done by way of order rather than by way of special enactment.  This section very properly provides an increase of £5 million in the amount which may be paid by way of grants.  That is something which in 1956 was completely anathema to the Taoiseach.  He is on record as saying he did not agree with free loans at all.  That is a remarkable thing to hear from the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I will quote it <i>in extenso</i>.  Then there can be no two ways about it and no doubt that this was the attitude of Deputy Lemass in 1956.  At column 1947, Volume 160 of the Dáil Debates, he said:</P>
      <P>I have urged already here that, in present circumstances, having regard to the policy being pursued by the commercial banks, the general tightness of money now existing, it is desirable that the resources and, perhaps, the powers of the Industrial Credit Company should be extended, that that undertaking should be enabled to provide money for industrial expansion through investment in the shares of private undertakings, shares which it might not be desirable to market at the present time, or to deal with smaller concerns by way of repayable loans or the purchase of debentures.</P>
      <P>It is harmless so far.  He went on:</P>
      <P>I think that is necessary but I think that is all that is necessary and, indeed, I am quite certain that, if that were done, it could be said that no industrial concern with any prospect of development, any prospect of making a profit, would not be able to proceed because of shortage of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> That is the background.  Of course I cannot speak with the same conviction while reading, as did the Taoiseach when making that statement.  He went on:</P>
    <P>What is the danger we are facing because of this proposal?  The Minister is taking power for the Industrial Development Authority to give grants to any new industrial enterprise anywhere.  The danger is that no industrial enterprise will ever start again without getting this free grant from public funds.</P>

      <P>We have a provision in this Bill which obliges the Industrial Development Authority to take certain things into account and a section which also gives them power to impose conditions. These are provisions which I think are likely to be far more effective&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe that over the main part of the industrial field private enterprise is the best force on which to rely.</P>
      <P>In another paragraph, he deals with private enterprise and I want to come to that, but afterwards he says:</P>
      <P>If it could be shown that any single industrial proposition that would not otherwise proceed was likely to go ahead quickly because of the provisions of this Bill I would say that is an argument in its favour. We have not been told that.  Indeed no reason has been advanced for the Bill at all.  There is an implied assumption that industrial development has been held up by the absence of free grants.  That is not true.  Industrial development has been held up to some extent by inability to get capital.</P>

You do not have to meet it by going into the pockets of the taxpayer to hand out grants of this kind when by doing so you are creating a situation in which concerns that might otherwise develop will not develop unless that grant is given to them and where the policy of western development is negative at the same time.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Quigley missed the point of my review of the Undeveloped Areas Act and the Industrial Grants Act and their integration for certain purposes.  I wanted to make the point during my reply on the Second Reading that the increasing of the ceiling from £10 million to £15 million for the purpose of covering grants was applicable both to the Undeveloped Areas Act, as it originally was, and to the Industrial Development Act and this integration, this Bill, is consequent more on the 1952 Act then on the 1956 Act.</P>

      <P>I listened to that speech by the Taoiseach.  I know its import and it is this: capital was then the biggest difficulty in the establishment of industries in this country and he advocated at that time that if <Col N="1532" /> instead of giving grants limited to £50,000 under the Industrial Grants Act of 1956, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, could contrive some system of making capital more freely available, it would serve more the industrialisation of the country than that Act with its limited provisions.  Limited provisions they were because grants were not given&mdash; still are not given&mdash;outside the undeveloped areas, if it can be shown that the industries could be established within the undeveloped areas.  The thinking behind that speech was quite clear: that the starting of an industry should not fail for want of capital, whether that capital was a grant or ordinary investment carrying interest rates for the lenders or investors, as the case may be.</P>

The Deputy, of course, was well aware of the financial position of the country then.  He knew that unless it was possible to provide capital, the provisions of the then Bill would be meaningless.  We know very well that capital was not available because the only way to get capital is through national loans.  An attempt was made to get capital in that way and we know it was not a great success.  We could leave it at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to have been reading the Industrial Grants Acts.  If you turn to the enactments repealed at the end of the Industrial Grants Act, 1959, you find that they include the Industrial Grants Act, 1956.  If you look at the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, you find it is a facsimile of the Industrial Grants Act, 1959, except that, in 1959, the Fianna Fáil Government were expanding the scope and increasing the amount of money.  There is no doubt that this policy is the policy of the previous Government&mdash;the policy of Deputy Sweetman.  People may say that politicians spend hours arguing about this.  What are they sent here for but to decide policy, but when one policy is adopted by one group, having been initiated by another, why should this group suddenly decide that they were the people who first did this?  They were not.  Their particular line of industry was one which to a certain measure succeeded.  It was Sinn Féin industrial policy.</P>

      <P>I am not referring to the Sinn Féin political idea.  What I mean is the idea of going at it ourselves alone&mdash;behind tariff walls, we will produce the goods for our people here and the enticement to do so will be tariff walls.  Two things were clearly expounded by Deputy Sweetman at the time.  One was the granting of relief from income on new exports and the other, industrial grants, whereby grants would be made available for the propagation of industry. These two things are absolutely clear and it is quite stupid politically for anybody to say that we spend three hours discussing what happened in 1956.  It is absolutely important as to which side everybody is on.  If one political group is converted to the other, that is very important as far as policy is concerned.  It is the sort of thing that will decide who will be the next Government.  The idea is clear to anybody who sat in the Dáil at that time.  It was the previous Government who initiated these things which have been expanded by the present Government. They were voted against by them at that time.</P>

      <P>It is only right to offer proof to the House, as I think it has been offered by Senator O'Quigley, when he quoted the extracts from the speech by Deputy Lemass, as he then was, in 1956.

      <P>You do not have to meet it by going into the pockets of the taxpayers to hand out grants of this kind...</P>

      <P>I must confess that I have a very considerable dislike of most of these proposals for money for nothing...</P>
      <P>If I said that, it would be national sabotage but it is all right for Deputy Lemass to say that.</P>
      <P>He further stated:</P>
      <P>The implication is that this Finance Bill gives some enormous financial aid to industry.  I have calculated that the maximum amount of money that it could possibly cost the Government, even if we assume that we will get a 10 per cent. increase in industrial exports and a 10 per cent. increase in coal production, is less than £10,000.</P>
      <P>He was very far out in his estimate at that time.  We are all delighted that he was so far out in his estimate and that he was so wrong.  He also stated:</P>
      <P>These are provisions which I think are likely to be far more effective in retarding industrial development than in helping it.</P>
      <P>If I said that today, it would be regarded as national sabotage.  I would be told that I was trying to sabotage industry in the country but it is all right for Deputy Lemass to say it.  It is only right that we should let the people know where Deputy Lemass stood and where Fianna Fáil stood as regards industrial grants in 1956.</P>
      <P>Then he continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>I believe that over the main part of the industrial field private enterprise is the best course on which to rely.</P>
      <P>He wanted private enterprise then; he did not want any grants, good, bad or indifferent.</P>

I think that is what he meant.  The review will have to be done in a very close way&mdash;to the point, perhaps, that the details of some firms will have to be examined. It would be impossible to expect individual firms to disclose details of their business to outsiders in any way. <Col N="1540" /> Foras Tionscal are intimate, in so far as they can be, with the details of some industries.  I want to assure the Senator that this will be an objective review.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do feel, however, that the time has come to undertake a comprehensive review of the present scheme. The objects of such review would be to assess the extent to which the existing system has been successful and to see whether any modifications of the system are desirable.  In particular, I feel we will have to give <Col N="1541" /> careful consideration to the question of whether the present concept of the undeveloped areas has outlived its usefulness.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give all non-agricultural workers a statutory right to a minimum of two weeks holidays each year, with pay, plus the public holidays, or compensatory leave or pay for employees who may have to work on a Public Holiday.  This represents an increase of one week in the present minimum provided for in the Holidays (Employees Act), 1939.  The 1939 Act did not apply to workers whose remuneration exceeded £350 a year.  There is <Col N="1542" /> no wages ceiling in the new Bill.  The figure of £350 specified in the 1939 Act bears little relationship, of course, to present day money values.  I had considered the desirability of an appropriate increase in this figure but I have now decided that it is not really necessary to prescribe any upper wage limit in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in the Bill is, therefore, a wide one but it is necessary to take power to make special provision for certain classes of workers, for instance, insurance agents paid on commission.  The position is being met by a provision which will enable the Minister to make regulations bringing classes of persons within the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Since 1939, a considerable number of workers have, through collective bargaining between trade unions and employers or otherwise, secured an additional week's annual leave.  Many workers have a statutory right to this extra leave by virtue of Orders of the Labour Court, made in accordance with proposals of Joint Labour Committees, or by virtue of Agreements registered under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  The Government would have preferred if all workers had been able to secure these additional holidays by collective bargaining.  However, it is clear that many workers are not in a position to do so.  It is mainly to bring the holiday allowance of these workers up to the present accepted standard that the Bill is being introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a consolidating and amending measure.  It will cover all classes of workers, irrespective of salary or type of employment.  It proposes to abolish the distinction in existing legislation between workers who have a separate entitlement to public holidays and workers who have no such entitlement but get additional annual leave.  If this distinction were retained, certain employers, for instance those in Sunday trading shops and refreshment houses, would be obliged to give their workers three consecutive weeks' annual leave in the year without any option to give days off, or compensatory pay, in lieu of public holidays. <Col N="1543" /> I am satisfied that a greater flexibility than this would be beneficial to both workers and employers.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Bill provides that workers should get six public holidays in the year with pay.  In general, under the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, the carrying on of industrial work on public holidays is prohibited.  There are, however, a number of exceptions to this, for example, some types of shift work and work covered by special exclusions. In non-industrial employments many workers would, in the normal course of their employment, be required to work on all or most of the public holidays.  Even where public holiday work was not a normal feature of his job, a worker might, in exceptional circumstances, have to work on an odd public holiday.  It is, therefore, necessary and desirable to retain the various alternatives which existing legislation provides to cover such cases.</P>
    <P>A worker who is required to work on a public holiday will, therefore, be entitled to one or other of the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) a day off, with pay, within a month; or</P>
    <P>(b) an additional day, with pay, added to his annual leave; or</P>
    <P>(c) extra payment for the public holiday.</P>
    <P>The 1939 Act provided for payment of a worker who worked on a public holiday and who was not given a compensatory holiday, at a minimum rate of time and a quarter.  The Bill proposes that this rate be increased to double time.  The qualifying period in the five weeks preceding a public holiday which a worker must work before becoming entitled to the Public Holiday with pay is being reduced from 150 to 135 hours.  This takes account of reduction in working hours in recent years and allows a reasonable margin to cover short-time working, sickness or other casual absences. Other new provisions in relation to public holidays are that days of annual leave and hours lost through wet-time will count as hours worked in the qualifying period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> The qualifying period of work for adult workers for the purpose of qualifying for annual holidays is also being reduced from 1,800 to 1,600 hours in the year.  Here again, wet-time up to a maximum of 250 hours will count as time worked.  It is the practice in some employments that workers get, at present, in addition to one week's annual leave and public holidays, other days off with pay.  These days may be Church holidays or other holidays customary in particular parts of the country.  I think that many of these workers and their employers would wish to continue such arrangements. Accordingly, the Bill contains a new provision that such extra holidays may be counted as annual leave up to a maximum of seven days in any year.</P>
    <P>The Bill re-enacts provisions in existing legislation about the payment to workers, who leave employment before they receive annual leave, of an appropriate proportion of holiday pay.  This payment is known as &ldquo;cesser&rdquo; pay under the 1939 Act. With the increased annual leave, the amount of cesser pay to which any worker will be entitled in respect of a particular period will, of course, be proportionately higher under the new Bill.  Furthermore, the monthly qualifying hours for entitlement to cesser pay are being reduced from 150 to 135, in line with the reduction in the qualifying hours for annual leave entitlement.</P>
    <P>A number of provisions in existing legislation are being retained either unchanged or with minor amendments. For instance, the Bill continues the provision that an employer who dismisses a worker immediately before a public holiday must, if the worker has worked for the qualifying period, pay him a day's pay in respect of the holiday.  Workers will continue to be entitled to get annual leave within their employment year, that is a year counting from the date or anniversary of the date, of entry into employment. A worker whose remuneration includes board and lodgings must be given a specified daily allowance in lieu while on holidays but the rate of allowance prescribed in the 1939 Act is <Col N="1545" /> being appropriately increased.  The Bill in its present form is, in many respects an agreed measure, and it is the Government's hope that it will be brought into force without delay so that workers may get early benefit from its provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an acceptable measure.  As the Minister said in conclusion, it represents agreement, that is to say, it has been in operation to a great degree for some time past, owing to collective bargaining between employers and workers.  It also reflects a degree of flexibility which is very desirable.  It is an example of legislation which carries out the principle that the State should not initiate this kind of legislation but when sufficient advances have been made owing to agreement, or what one might call enlightened thinking, then the law should step in to see that everyone gets the benefit of the collective bargaining and nobody is allowed to escape because of certain circumstances or perhaps the weakness of certain classes of employees.</P>
      <P>A good deal of it has been in operation for some time.  I am not an employer but over a long period, when one could have domestic service, one gave a fortnight's holidays, which is now put into the law.  It is very desirable when agreements have been made, that they should get the force of law, as in this Bill.  I suppose from the point of view of employers, it could be said&mdash;and I am not able to speak for them&mdash;that conditions should not be made which would be too onerous for small people or those not already well established in industry.  It would appear from general practice that there is nothing in this Bill in that regard. The Bill is acceptable and I think it should get its Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, even though I regret it has been so long coming to us.  The trade unions have for years past been pressing for a measure such as this, and it is quite true, as the Minister said, that it is largely an agreed measure.  It is coming to us in the Seanad in the first week in August, right on the eve of the general holiday period, and I could <Col N="1546" /> be justly critical of the fact that it is coming to us at this time, when it should have come to us long ago.  The Bill did not see the light of day until the Labour Deputies in the Dáil introduced a measure themselves&mdash;I am speaking from memory on this&mdash;and then the Minister brought forward his Bill.</P>
      <P>We are in the situation here that we are cluttered up with Bills right before the holidays.  This has been said before and it is appropriate to say it again now: surely if the Dáil was over-burdened with work, this Bill and indeed others could have been introduced in the Seanad and then found their way down to the Dáil?  I know that important amendments were proposed in the Dáil on Committee Stage by the Labour Deputies on behalf of the trade union movement and we have not got the verbatim report of the Dáil Debates.  I do not know from reading the papers what happened in regard to those amendments. We have not had an opportunity of studying what was said in favour of and against the amendments and to judge the weight of the arguments.  It is all right to say that we can wait and see the reports when they become available, but we are on the eve of the holiday and the Minister has said that he is anxious that the Bill should be enacted as soon as possible so that the workers should have the benefit of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that it shall have effect on the date appointed by the Minister.  I hope that in his reply the Minister will tell us what his intentions are in that respect.  I am a little puzzled as to how that will affect the situation at the present time, because it appears to me that on the date appointed, the workers will be entitled to count the employment year current at that time for the purpose of getting any benefit they might be entitled to under this measure, so it seems that the earlier the date appointed by the Minister, the more benefit it will be to the workers affected.  For that reason, I am sure the Minister will appreciate my difficulties in speaking on behalf of the trade unions.  I do not want in any way to hold up the passage of <Col N="1547" /> the Bill, but on the eve of the holidays, I have not got a copy of the Dáil Debates on Committee Stage and I am not able to look again at the trade union amendments, and at the arguments put up by the Minister in opposition to some further amendments proposed by the Labour Party Deputies on behalf of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>However, having said that, as I have already indicated, this measure is largely an agreed one and I should say on behalf of the trade union movement that we welcome the Bill.  We are glad that at last it has seen the light of day and at last is likely to become the law of the land.  I think it would be wrong if we exaggerated the position, because, as Senator Hayes has pointed out, what we are doing here is largely writing into law what has generally been secured by the trade unions in respect of organised workers. It is quite some time now since the fortnight's holiday became the general practice by reason of trade union definition. I speak from memory again on this, but I think the fortnight's holiday has been general for organised workers since away back in 1948 or the early 1950's.  It is right that the law should come in and say that this is now the general practice and in so far as it is not applied to unorganised workers protected by trade unions, it should be made obligatory that they get the advantages regarding holidays and other improvements provided in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill has dropped the question of an income limit.  The old Bill had an income limit of £350.  That is largely inappropriate in the present circumstances, and because of that income limit and the change in money values meantime, the law as it stands at present is applicable to only a very small handful of workers, particularly women workers in receipt of £350 or less per annum.  I am, therefore, glad that the income limit has been removed and I think that the Minister was wise in not putting in any limit at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my disappointment that provision has not been made for providing that Good <Col N="1548" /> Friday will be regarded as a public holiday.  I know from my old days in the Cork Workers' Council that it has been the view of the trade union movement for decades that Good Friday should be a public holiday and that those people who are required to work on Good Friday should get compensation by way of an extra day or a day in lieu.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make in concluding&mdash;and I hope that I am not opening up a general discussion on this matter&mdash;is to ask the Minister how the minimum provision embodied in this legislation compares with similar provision in other countries in the European Economic Community.  The tendency must be to even up or even off the conditions generally, and I think it could be said that the fortnight's holiday provided in this Bill is below the average provided for in the other Western European countries. I do not want to open a wide debate on this, but to ask the Minister if he has any information; if what I suppose is true, that the fortnight is well below the average, it could not be thought that this Bill would be regarded as onerous to employers.  Most of the employers already provide for a fortnight or more holidays, and it is right that the Legislature should come in now and say for the minority remaining that they also should have at least these minimum conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill require all employers to give what is at present being given, and for many years has been given, by all except a very few.  The Minister showed a sense of realism, particularly in a country like this, which deals with so many perishable foods, when he allowed national holidays to be substituted for by another day's holiday if the employer so opts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy pressed the point with regard to Good Friday and said that organised labour has for a long time been seeking to have Good Friday made a national holiday.  I think such an arrangement would cause great difficulty for industries which deal in <Col N="1549" /> perishable goods.  If Good Friday were made a holiday, Easter Saturday would be a half day; Easter Sunday would be a full day; and Easter Monday another holiday.  It would be impossible to handle perishable goods of any sort, if we had all those holidays together.</P>
    <P>Further, there is a very high seasonal demand for all perishable products. Icecream, meat, foods of all descriptions, bread, confectionery and everything else, reach peak demand, probably, over the Easter week-end.  If a national holiday were made obligatory on Good Friday, it might cause dislocation in trade, and it would possibly cause complete dislocation in the shipping of these products, many of which must be shipped, because they would otherwise be lost.  I believe the Minister was right and prudent in the course he has taken in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is one subsection upon which I should like the Minister to comment, as it may be going a little too far.  He proposes to require employers to give holidays if they employ domestic servants for two weeks or longer.  I think that is going further than one should in this type of legislation. The employee covered by this is conceivably working for four or five different employers in the one day or may be working for one person.  This may cause a great deal more hardship and inconvenience if it is one person, particularly if it is an old person who relies on the domestic help to come in in the morning, get breakfast and arrange things for the day.  Two weeks would mean a great deal of hardship for an old lady depending on that type of assistance.</P>
    <P>Have the provisions of this Bill been compared with similar legislation in Western Europe?  Some time ago, I saw a schedule taken from the <i>Financial Times</i>.  I am sorry I have not got it with me, but so far as I can remember, working hours in this country are lower than in any other Western European country, except France or Britain.  Our average working week is lower than the working week in the Scandinavian countries, the Low Countries&mdash;Holland and Belgium&mdash; Switzerland, Italy and Western Germany. <Col N="1550" /> It is necessary that we should not make legislation that might put us at a disadvantage in relation to people with whom we must compete in Common Market.  Even if there were not a Common Market, if we wished to progress industrially, we would still have to compete and would be at a further disadvantage if we tried to give conditions here which our competitors do not allow their workers to enjoy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a great deal to be said on this Bill, it being, as the Minister said, a consolidation, with amendments, of existing legislation. Everybody agrees with the principle of affording minimum holidays to all classes of workers.  It is not clear, however, when the Bill is to come into operation and I should be glad if the Minister would indicate that.  Most of us are anxious that no worker in the current holiday season will be deprived of the benefits of the Bill and, therefore, we are anxious to let the Minister have all Stages, subject to amendments which can be taken this evening or tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I do, however, in that context emphasise, without repeating what Senator Murphy has said, the unsatisfactory manner Bills come to us at this late hour of the day.  It gives no chance to anybody to make the detailed study of the Bill that ordinarily would be made.  I am aware that there were certain amendments in the Dáil and their fate I do not know.  I think I heard the division bell ringing during the last few days when the Bill was debated in the Dáil but I do not know if any amendments were accepted.  Apparently they were not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing that strikes me about legislation of this kind which is intended to benefit all classes of workers except agricultural workers&mdash; we shall deal with them later.  To ensure that the people the Bill intends to benefit do, in fact, benefit, it is not enough to enact a piece of legislation, declare it law, fix penalties, provide means whereby persons can be prosecuted for failure to observe it.  We should go further.  I would ask the Minister if he has any machinery in mind or whether it will be possible for him within the limitations of the Bill <Col N="1551" /> to ensure that it will be effective as far as all classes of workers and employers are concerned.  In some of the legislation under the Factory Acts, it is stipulated that certain notices shall be printed and put up in factories setting out minimum standards of safety.  The question of posting up such notices in relation to this Bill does not arise.</P>
    <P>I should like to see it being obligatory on employers who employ anybody other than casually to make available to the workers a summary of the principal provisions of this Bill in relation to their entitlement to public holidays and to the substituted benefits which people are entitled to if they do not get certain kinds of holidays to which they are entitled. That is the only way in which you will ensure that the person employed in isolated employment, working, perhaps, in a small office in a small town and who has no connection with other employees, will become aware of his entitlement to annual and other leave under a Bill of this kind.  Very often the people who are most neglected are the people living in isolated areas, people who are employed in small concerns, mostly offices, and places of that kind.  These are the people who stand in the greatest need of protection from the Legislature and who do not have the valuable protection which trade unions can afford to them.  I should like the Minister to indicate whether any such thing as that is contemplated.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister can point to the provisions of the Bill whereby the inspector appointed by him can require employers and employees to give certain information which will enable the inspector to ascertain whether the provisions of the Act are being complied with in respect of particular persons.  I should prefer people to be in possession of the knowledge of what is contained in this Bill and what they are entitled to rather than to have inspectors going round and finding it out for themselves.</P>
    <P>I think the abolition of the income limit of £350 is much overdue and, consequently, much to be welcomed. <Col N="1552" /> In relation to subsection (3), there is not any clear indication in the White Paper as to why certain persons are being excluded from this Bill.  In particular, I refer to the persons in category (h), persons employed by the State.  The State, as I pointed out on another Bill recently, is quite a different entity from the Government. I am wondering whether the Minister might be able to indicate now or on Committee Stage what is meant by the term &ldquo;the State&rdquo; in paragraph (h) of Section 3.  Apart from that, I welcome the Bill as an improvement on the existing position.  Before concluding, let me express the hope that this kind of legislation will not be taken as the maximum by employers but that it is intended to be a minimum.  I should hope that with the passage of time it will be regarded as a minimum and not a maximum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Bill has received general approval from the House and that any comments on it have been of a minor nature.  I am surprised that Senator Murphy raised a question as to why this Bill was not introduced sooner.  In fact, when I saw the number of Labour amendments in the Dáil, it occurred to me to inquire why it was not introduced far sooner, some years sooner, especially when one remembers that the Conditions of Employment Act which first provided for paid holidays for workers was passed in 1936.  The next Act was passed in 1938 and another one was passed in 1939.  We find that a period of 21 years elapsed.  Labour Ministers had opportunities in between and Senator Murphy may well ask why this Bill was not introduced sooner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only saying that because Senator Murphy claims it was a Labour motion in the Dáil that prompted the introduction of this Bill.  I was in a position to answer, when discussing that Labour motion, that the Government had decided to introduce a Bill embodying these provisions.  I do not want to score minor points off the Senator but I think I can be forgiven if I do not resist this one.  I have been in office for just two years and there <Col N="1553" /> were six years of Labour ministries. The Leader of the Labour Party was Minister for Industry and Commerce for three years and we did not see this Bill appearing any sooner than in the summer of 1961.  The years I have given&mdash;1936, 1938, and 1939&mdash;are significant.  They were years when Fianna Fáil were in office.  There was no improvement on the provisions of these Bills until now, when Fianna Fáil are back again in office.  I hope the Senator will forgive me for making these points.  I could not resist doing so.</P>

      <P>As far as the suggestion that Good Friday ought to be included as a public holiday for the purposes of this Bill is concerned, that was one of the amendments put down by the Labour Party in the Dáil.  I pointed out to them that the public holidays as declared are the usual ones &mdash;Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day, St. Patrick's Day and the bank holidays; that the declaration of a public holiday is a matter for the Government under the Public Holidays Act, 1924 and that, until such time as it is declared a public holiday, it is not the intention to include Good Friday for the purposes of this Bill.  There is provision in the Bill whereby the Minister can by regulation declare a new public holiday so declared and so enacted by the Oireachtas to be a public holiday for the purpose of this Bill.  The Labour Deputies accepted the situation and withdrew the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Senator also asked me how our legislation compared with similar legislation in the European Economic Community countries.  In the first place, I should like to point out that this country has a very good record as far as the implementation of International Labour Office conventions are concerned. When one compares this legislation with the legislation in these Common Market countries, one will agree that we in this country have a good record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In France, there is a minimum vacation period in a year of 18 days as <Col N="1554" /> against our 12 days.  They have five legal holidays which, I take it, correspond to our public holidays, making a total of 23&mdash;somewhat in advance of us.  In Belgium, they have six days as minimum vacation, but 10 days which are legal holidays.  Therefore, in that respect, we are in advance of Belgium.  In Italy, they have ten days, somewhat less than our minimum vacation period, but they have 16 public holidays.  I do not know how they work out 16&mdash;it seems a very high number&mdash;but, taking the two together, they are somewhat in advance of us. Western Germany has 12 days minimum vacation period, which is the same as we have now, but they have ten to 13 legal holidays, I take it, public holidays.  Perhaps the variation applies to different parts of the country.  In the Netherlands, they have 12 days minimum vacation period and a variation of six to ten public holidays. Luxembourg has eight days minimum vacation period and ten public holidays.  Generally speaking, we compare very favourably with the other Common Market countries.</P>
    <P>What Senator Burke has said about the net hours of work in the year in relation to these countries is quite true also.  We are somewhat lagging behind most of them.  We are in advance of France: I do not think I need give the figures.  I shall give our figures&mdash;2,184 net hours of work per annum.  We are in advance of France in that respect and much the same as Britain, because they vary.  Their lower limit is lower and their higher limit is higher.  We are lower than Belgium, lower than Italy, higher than the minimum in Western Germany, but much lower than the maximum.  We are much lower than the Netherlands and much lower than Luxembourg.</P>

      <P>Certainly; it will not take very long to give the figures if the House will bear with me.  The heading is: &ldquo;Net Hours of Work Per Annum&rdquo; and the figures are&mdash;France, 1,920; <Col N="1555" /> United Kingdom, 2,192-2,152; Ireland, 2,184; Belgium, 2,212; Italy, 2,288; Western Germany, 2,296-2,140; the Netherlands, 2,352-2,320; Luxembourg, 2,352.  I do not think I need comment further on that.  As I was asked the question by the Senator, I thought it only fair to give the figures.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley shares Senator Murphy's criticism that the Bill has come so soon to the Seanad.  Unfortunately, I, too, would have liked to give the Seanad the opportunity of reading the Dáil debates and seeing exactly what happened.  Senator O'Quigley says he heard the division bell ring, but did not know what happened.  I do not blame him for that, either, because his colleagues in the Dáil cleared out of the House when the division bell rang and did not vote. Therefore, they probably did not know what happened, either.</P>
      <P>The division bell rang for the one amendment on which the Labour Party divided the House.  That was the proposition that, instead of giving two days' pay to a person who worked on the holiday, he should be given three days' pay.  I submit to the House that the two days' pay, which is in this Bill, is a considerable advance on the <i>status quo</i> which provided one and a quarter days' pay.  I thought that a reasonable minimum compensation for the person who had to work on a public holiday.  Of course, he had the option of getting another day off in lieu within a month if he had to work on a holiday, plus his extra day's pay or a day added to the end of his holidays.  I thought it would be pretty difficult for some employers to be obliged to pay three days' pay or to give a day off plus two days' pay in lieu of a public holiday.  The Labour Party divided the House on that and got no support other than that of the few members of the Labour Party who were present in the House.</P>

      <P>That, and other amendments submitted by the Labour Party, were in fact propositions that <Col N="1556" /> were put to me before the Second Reading by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They put other propositions &mdash;for instance, a proposition to reduce the minimum number of hours worked which would qualify a person for annual leave and a proposition in relation to the minimum number of hours worked which would qualify a person for entitlement to holiday pay, that is, public holiday pay.  I met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions not fully, but I do not think they expected I would.  I reduced the number of hours in each respect from what appeared originally in the Bill to some half way between what the Congress proposed and what was in the Bill.  The Labour members, nevertheless, put down their amendments.  They said they did not know, apart from an undertaking given on my behalf by the Minister for Transport and Power, who handled the Bill in the Dáil, what my intentions were.</P>
      <P>The undertaking was to the effect that I proposed to meet as far as I could the point of view of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Nevertheless, not having fully indicated how far I would go, the Labour Party felt constrained to put down amendments in conformity with the actual wishes of the Congress.  Having heard my argument in each case, except in relation to the three days' pay for holiday work, they withdrew the amendments. I think that puts the House fully into the picture as far as the amendments are concerned and will also justify to a degree my suggestion in my opening statement that it was largely an agreed measure.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke mentioned the hard case of the poor old woman who employs domestic help for two hours a day.  Hard cases make bad law.</P>

      <P>It is impossible in a measure like this to legislate for every contingency.  Nevertheless domestic workers are entitled to the minimum statutory entitlements.  The fact that a minimum of two hours per day is required of a domestic worker to qualify for annual holidays relates roughly to <Col N="1557" /> the level of wages received.  If a person who works for two hours a day is entitled to holidays, that same person can forgo the holidays but can get compensation.  The compensation will be related in proportion to the pay of the person for two hours' work per day, which will be low, in any event.</P>
      <P>By and large, I do not think the measure will impose an undue hardship on a person who can afford to employ domestic help.  I can appreciate that there are poor old people who get domestic help and who can ill afford to pay for it.  Perhaps voluntary organisations can give some measure of help in this respect.  It would be wrong to deprive domestic workers generally of their statutory minimum entitlements under this Bill.  I think the Seanad will agree it would be impossible to legislate for this very select class.</P>
      <P>These were the only points raised in the Bill.  I am glad the Bill has received the acceptance it has received in this House.</P>

      <P>We have had some outstanding examples of bad draftsmanship in a number of Bills that <Col N="1559" /> have come before the House recently. The most outstanding and disgraceful example was the Courts of Justice and the Court Officers Superannuation Bill of 1961.  That is a piece of legal gibberish which has no parallel in the statute laws of this country and perhaps has no parallel in the statute laws of any other English-speaking country.  It is pity to see Bills of this kind going through in such haste.</P>
      <P>Section 3 is something which strikes me as being incorrect.  It is a typical piece of slipshod draftsmanship that should not appear.  We find in Section 3 that &lsquo;&ldquo;worker&rdquo; means any person of the age of 14 years or upwards who is employed, other than a person who is&mdash;&rsquo; and it goes on to give the details. Paragraph (d) says &ldquo;a lighthouse or lightship employee&rdquo;; paragraph (e) says &ldquo;a clergyman in Holy Orders&rdquo; and then we have this kind of stuttering in regard to paragraph (h): &ldquo;a person who is a person who is employed&rdquo;. The &ldquo;a person who is&rdquo; in paragraph (h) should not appear.  The House should delete that and not have this kind of slipshod draftsmanship. Frankly, I feel ashamed when my colleagues ask me: &ldquo;What do you mean by this?&rdquo;  Perhaps the Minister will deal with this and I will deal with a different matter later.</P>

I agree he has a good point, but, on the other hand, it does not affect the validity of the Bill.

      <P>I see the Minister's position.  The plain fact is that we are enacting legislation which is not what it should be and it does not do any credit to the Legislature and its knowledge of English, or those who are employed as draftsmen.  Having said that, we will leave it, because it is not my intention to deprive any workers of the benefits this Bill may give them in respect of the coming bank holiday. It does underline the desirability of regarding Seanad Éireann as a House of the Oireachtas which has the function of revising Bills that come from the Dáil.  We should not be put in the position that if we do not pass a Bill quickly, some people will be deprived of the benefits which the Bill is intended to confer on them.</P>

      <P>There was the case of the Malicious Damage to Property Acts of 1861 when the court said that there was something in an amendment that did not make sense and they had to make sense out of it. People talk about the costs of litigation and of lawyers, but the Legislature ought to do its job and it is manifest, particularly in this kind of case, that the Legislature is not doing its job properly.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister in relation to paragraph (h) which refers to &ldquo;a person who is employed by or under the State not being a person so employed in an unestablished position&rdquo; and so on, would he indicate what category of people these are, because I cannot quite understand what is meant by &ldquo;employed by or under the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister might appreciate my point when I say that the State in my conception, is one entity and somebody employed in the Department of Industry and Commerce is another entity. The State embraces the Government but the Government does not extend as far as the State.  They are separate entities, and I wonder, when it comes to enforcing this section, what the Minister has in mind.  Does &ldquo;State&rdquo; mean persons merely employed in the Civil Service, or persons employed anywhere who are paid out of public funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition, I am told, is one supplied by the Department of Finance and accepted by the Department of Industry and Commerce as meaning people employed in unestablished positions under the State as opposed to established civil servants. The Senator knows what an established civil servant means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is quite so, because as far as the Department of Finance is concerned, it was badly caught out in its definition of what constituted employees of the Government and so on, as was exemplified in the case of the Social Welfare Act, and the Civil Service Regulation <Col N="1562" /> Act of 1956 and the Civil Service Commission Act 1956 both took care of that.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Department will be well aware of the decision in Fawcitt and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, which was related to compensation to be paid to the plaintiff in that action for the taking over by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of phosphate lands in Clare during the war years.  The question arose whether or not the Land Acquisition (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919, applied in that case.  It then transpired that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was a different entity from the State.</P>
      <P>I wish that people in drafting Bills would have some regard to the meaning of these words as interpreted by the Supreme Court when it is laid down that the Government is one entity and the State is a different entity.  If people would have regard to the initial provisions of the Constitution of Ireland, they would realise that there are three organs of State &mdash;judiciary, legislature and executive. These three are separate and distinct, and there are other organs of the State such as the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Attorney General.  If we are putting into legislation a word such as &ldquo;State,&rdquo; we ought to define what we mean by it or at least be able to say whether it means a Government in control of the Civil Service or merely those who are not employed by the Government&mdash; such as people employed in the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the courts, in the office of the Attorney General and such other people.  It is a bit unfair to ask the Minister to give an authoritative view of what is meant by this word in this context.  I do not think it has any real meaning.  I suppose that in the helpless, hopeless condition we are in at the beginning of August, 1961, there is nothing we can do about it but let it pass.</P>

Perhaps they do not go as far as that.  I would like to raise a point on paragraph (g), which refers to a person other than a person who is wife, husband, etc., but does not refer to an adopted or an illegitimate child. I raise this because I see that under the Civil Liability Bill there are definitely included in subsection (2) of Section 47 persons adopted under the Adoption Act, who shall be considered legitimate offspring.  It might be very important.  Sometimes illegitimate children live in the house, too, and they would be workers as the son of the house would be.

      <P>I should like to raise a somewhat similar point.  Naturally, this will apply to the head of the house, who will be the person responsible for seeing about the people who are employed.  It often happens that an orphaned nephew of the wife is living in the House.  I should like the Minister to examine every possibility because we do not want to have friction among families, by giving people legal rights this Bill never envisaged.  Legal action might be instituted at a later stage in which there might be no equity, but the law would give the people right and powers which they should not enjoy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cole knows that I do not want anyone to be imposed on.  It is quite common in most countries for a relative of the wife or husband to live in the house. If it is a relative of the husband, it is all right, but if it is a nephew or a niece of the wife who is the orphan, there is no blood relationship to the husband.  The Minister might consider that when making the regulations.</P>

      <P>There is probably a good deal in the question raised by Senator Burke.  There is an attitude growing up nowadays and people who 10, 15 or 20 years ago might not have been remunerated for giving gratuitous services to relations are now succeeding in establishing in court that they are entitled to some payment and can regard themselves as employed. I think the case cited by Senator Burke is worthy of consideration because an orphaned nephew of 14, 15 or 16 years of age might not be regarded as being entitled to remuneration or holiday privileges.  He may be regarded as a member of the family but perhaps some dispute might arise and he might try to apply the law with all its rigour at every point.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in considering the case of the adopted child and the illegitimate child, should also consider applying this regulation to the person to whom the employer stands <i>in loco parentis</i>.  In the Fatal Injuries Act, that peculiar relationship applies and it applies in some other statute which I cannot bring to mind at the moment.  It deals with the case Senator Burke has in mind and would probably in all circumstances be fair as between the person seeking the benefit of a Bill of this kind, and the person responsible for much kindness in the upbringing of the person who found himself an orphan and had to be sheltered and supported.  I am merely putting for the Minister's consideration that the person who stands <i>in loco parentis</i> should be covered.</P>

So did the organised employers, but only in regard to one matter on which I also met them.  They made no other point in connection with any other part of the Bill.  I should say that somebody&mdash;I think it was the F.U.E.&mdash;made a point about the entitlement to double pay for work on Christmas Day.  That double pay was intended in the original Bill to take St. Stephen's Day into account.  They asked for clarification and as a result of their representations, the Bill now specifically states that that payment is in respect of Christmas Day and St. Stephen's Day, in order to avoid any misunderstanding, that there should be double payment for Christmas Day plus St. Stephen's Day.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to make is that if the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, or any other trade union for that matter, make suggestions to the Government which are, in fact, embodied in Bills, I think it is only fair and right that the organised employers should be informed of the proposals of the trade unions, considering that there is the original agreement from which everything has emanated. The trade unions might easily propose some changes not in fact operated by the employers under the collective agreement, and it seems to me that it is very important that in future if the trade unions make proposals, in fairness, the employers should be given a chance to see them <Col N="1567" /> before they are embodied in a Bill.  As a matter of fact, I do not see anything in this Bill to which I would take objection.  It is quite fair.  As I have said, these conditions are already being operated.  I just wanted to make the point clear for future reference.</P>

One of the points on which the Congress sought consultation was the reduction of the hours for entitlement to a public holiday and annual holidays, and the F.U.E. were consulted on that point.</P>

      <P>This is only a small point, but I should like to ask the Minister for how many years back can an employee recover money payable to him.  I know it says in paragraph (b) that it may be recovered as a simple contract debt.  That should suggest a period of six years.  At the same time, however, that is probably only the procedure by which it might be recovered. Does it mean that a debt due under statute can be recovered up to 12 years?  It is a matter on which I should like the Minister to express a view.</P>

I take it that this will be headed &ldquo;The Minister for Industry and Commerce against John Murphy&rdquo; and an inspector will be present to give the necessary evidence proving the case.

      <P>This is a section which enables the Minister to appoint inspectors to ask questions and to see that the Bill's provisions are observed. We all resent having inspectors, but there is no doubt they are necessary, if legislation of this kind is to be implemented. One thing is the approach of the inspector.  The inspector is bound, if so required, to produce his certificate of appointment, but it would be a much better approach if the inspector came to the occupier of the premises or the employer and said: &ldquo;I am an inspector inquiring into the observance of the Holidays Act, 1961, in this premises and, therefore, I am going to make certain inquiries&rdquo;.  That is better than having someone ask: &ldquo;what business is this of yours?&rdquo; and so create a certain atmosphere.  It would be far better if a person with a warrant of appointment from the Minister came to the person he was entitled to question and said: &ldquo;I am an inspector appointed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make inquiries&rdquo; and produced his certificate.  I would hope the Minister will issue a directive to all inspectors on all occasions to produce the certificate first and to question and talk afterwards.  That is likely to promote better feelings between the prying inspector and the person who may be possibly guilty of some breach of the law.</P>

I find great difficulty in complying with certain regulations sought by inspectors because people who should give me the certificates I require cannot be got to give them. Where is it to stop with all the inspection? It was not Senator McGuire but Senator Hayes who, when the Minister had finished his introductory speech, said that what is being done here has been done by practically all good employers in the country.  Sometimes I think we might want to turn back the clock and let them do their own job. The trade unions are nearly powerful enough to see that the employers will do the right thing.

      <P>I think it desirable that social advances in the State should come more from enlightened thinking and demand by the citizens than that they should be initiated by the State. I am glad that in relation to this Bill the impetus has come from collective bargaining between the trade unions and employers.  I think that is the basis of this Bill.  The State is doing a good job of work by embodying in legislation agreements that have been arrived at in this way.  We all know that there are people who are not either organised employers or workers who may have to work under totally different conditions which, if implemented, would not be fair either to the workers concerned or to the employers and would cause higher costs of operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" /> I agree that this Bill has come in the right form, that is to say, the conditions in the Bill have really arisen out of collective bargaining and are not being imposed by the State.  There is nothing that I can see in this Bill to which objection can be taken as being either unfair or too onerous on any employer, organised or unorganised.  The Bill contains a reasonable range of holiday conditions and should find general approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal purpose of this Bill is to enable increased funds to be made available to Bord Failte Éireann for the development of the tourist traffic industry.</P>
      <P>Since 1952, the amount of Bord Fáilte's annual grant has been limited to £500,000 from which the Board have to meet the cost of overseas publicity and advertising, as well as other activities such as the financing of hotel staff training schemes, the carrying out of improvement works at holiday resorts, road signposting, the development of the native souvenir industry and the payment of grants to meet interest charges on loans for hotel and resort development.  The Board have represented that valuable results would be likely to accrue if the rate of expenditure were to be accelerated for a limited period of time.  The Bill provides, therefore, that, instead of the present maximum annual grant of £500,000, the Board may receive grants not exceeding in the aggregate £5 million.  In my view, this global sum should meet the Board's requirements for a minimum period of seven years commencing with the present financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International travel has been increasing since the Second World War and is continuing to expand.  Intra-European traffic is increasing at the rate of about 10 per cent. per annum, and American traffic to Europe is <Col N="1573" /> expanding at very nearly the same rate.  It is estimated that last year more than 800,000 American visitors came to Europe and that by next year the figure will have reached one million.  The growing tendency towards longer paid holidays for workers, the increase in individual incomes and the favourable economic conditions which exist in many countries provide grounds for the expectation that the tourist traffic industry will continue to expand for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Last year visitors to Ireland spent £42.4 million, almost 50 per cent. more than in 1953 and 30 per cent. more than in 1957.  While this income makes a very valuable contribution to our balance of payments, there is no doubt that it is capable of being substantially increased.  Our share of the American traffic to Europe has increased from 6 per cent. to 10 per cent. within the past 10 or 12 years, but I am satisfied that the proportion could be increased to 20 per cent. Our proximity to Britain and the freedom of travel between the two countries places us in a very favourable position to attract more tourists from that source. However, the increased competition between countries for tourist traffic and the rising costs of advertising indicate the need to spend more money on promotion, both in the British and the United States market.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte hope to open new tourist offices in those countries and to engage in more effective promotional activity. Good results have already been achieved by the Board as a result of promotional efforts undertaken in certain limited fields such as coach tours and angling holidays, and the Board believe that an increase in general tourist promotion and publicity abroad would bring significant results.</P>
    <P>It is essential that our efforts to attract increased tourist traffic should be accompanied by commensurate efforts to improve the standard of amenities for the reception of visitors. As Senators are aware, generous grants are already being provided towards the cost of the extension and improvement of hotel accommodation and the development of major tourist resorts. There are, however, many other <Col N="1574" /> development activities, the tempo of which must be increased.  Because of insufficiency of funds the present rate of progress is unsatisfactory.  The new arrangements which will be possible under this Bill for the financing of the Board's activities will, however, enable faster results to be secured.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains, in addition, a number of provisions dealing with the guaranteeing of loans for the expansion and improvement of holiday accommodation and the development of tourist resorts.  The power to give guarantees in respect of loans was originally limited by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, to a period of five years, but this was extended to ten years by the Act of 1957.  The ten year period will expire in July, 1962, and, as the scheme is operating satisfactorily and constitutes a valuable incentive to private enterprise to undertake hotel and resort development, I am proposing that the power to give guarantees should be extended for a further 5 years, that is, until July, 1967.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1952 imposed a limit of £3 million on the aggregate amount of loans which may be guaranteed.  The total amount so far guaranteed, or recommended to me by Bord Fáilte for guarantee, is approximately £2½ million, and as there is a definite possibility that the limit of £3 million may be reached within the next year or two, I am proposing a new limit of £5 million.</P>
    <P>Grants are payable by Bord Fáilte to meet interest charges on guaranteed loans arising during the first five years of the repayment period.  Interest grants are also payable in respect of loans raised otherwise than under Ministerial guarantee for the construction and improvement of holiday accommodation.  There is at present a statutory limit of £75,000 on the aggregate amount of such grants which may be paid by Bord Fáilte in any financial year.  As a result of the various incentive schemes which have been introduced for hotels in recent years, many new development projects have been put in hands which may involve the Board in interest grant commitments in excess of the statutory limit.  I am, <Col N="1575" /> accordingly, proposing that the limit be removed.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that I am envisaging that the increased expenditure on tourism which is provided for in this Bill will be confined to a limited period of time.  The view of Bord Fáilte is that an accelerated rate of promotional and development activity during the next number of years will be likely to result in a substantial expansion of the tourist traffic industry, and the proposals contained in the Bill have been prepared on that basis. I hope that the Bill will make an important contribution to the development of the tourist industry over the next few years, and I recommend it for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>We have such a heavy Order Paper before us at present that it would be futile and tiresome to follow up all the lines one could follow in relation to this Bill about tourism. I suppose everybody in the country has faults to find with our tourist industry and suggestions to make as to how it can be developed.  I think we should regard the question that arises on this Bill, tourist traffic, as above politics. I feel that, generally speaking, agriculture, industrial development and tourism are three industries that should be approached in as business-like a way as possible.  I know it is impossible to keep politics out of Bills, Acts, laws, and so on, but, as far as possible, the approach to these matters should be the business approach.</P>
      <P>I think Bord Fáilte is recognised by all Parties as an excellent organisation without which our tourist industry could not operate or expand.  I agree with the suggestion that they should be given more funds to improve amenities. The three main things needed for the development of the tourist industry are good hotels, good roads and something for the tourist to do and to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are doing a good job in encouraging people to build hotels and to improve our existing hotels.  We are still a fair way behind in providing proper amenities for guests and in providing the number of beds needed to put up the number who at present come to this country, not to talk of the <Col N="1576" /> number of people we wish to see coming here and whom we shall see in the future.  Our roads are second to none in the world.  We have nothing to worry about in that regard, except to keep them good and to keep on improving them.</P>
    <P>People are always saying too much is being spent on the roads.  I do not think so.  It is one of our greatest investments and one which will produce the best results in the immediate future.  Tourism is something in which we have hopes of really great expansion. With the growing standard of living in every country, the number of tourists is growing all the time.  Ireland is coming more and more into the picture and into the programme for tourists of all qualities, from the ordinary man in the street up to the wealthy tourist.</P>
    <P>I should like to make just one point here.  Instead of making a sort of general survey, which anybody could make, I should like to draw attention to one little pet idea of my own, but one which, I think, is very important, so important that I and some others have on the Order Paper for some months past a motion suggesting the restoration of our abbeys, churches and castles.  One of the reasons why this should be done, I suggest, apart from cultural and educational purposes, is to have them as tourist attractions.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say we have beautiful scenery in Ireland&mdash;and indeed we have.  If you are on a holiday or if you go touring, it is not enough to drive along the countryside and to look at scenery.  Every drive through scenery should have an objective.  There must be something to see.  We have a wonderful heritage of castles and abbeys from the Middle Ages onwards and we have our houses of the eighteenth century, some of which are in bad repair, and so on.</P>
    <P>I know that the Tourist Board have taken an interest in the necessity to give tourists some objective when they are touring.  We all know what has been done with Bunratty Castle.  They carried out a very fine restoration of that castle.  I understand that in three months something like 30,000 people <Col N="1577" /> visited it.  That is quite an extraordinary result.  It is not a bit surprising to me that the restoration of that castle should have made such an impact and should have attracted so many tourists coming from Shannon and all around that area and, indeed, from all over the country and from many countries.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a man the other day who comes from a very old Irish family.  Their family home around Sligo or Mayo was burned down.  It is now lying a ruin by the side of a lake.  I gather they are pestered by people coming to see this ruin.  The boatman who plies for hire on the lake brings the tourists to see the ruin, because it is some objective for the trip.  Otherwise, he would just have to row them around the lake and they would have nothing to look at but the water and the view from the boat.  Very few people want to go on a lake and to row there for a few hours and to look at nothing.  The ruin is an objective. There is nothing to see, except the ruin itself and weeds.  He tells them about the old house and he makes up a story.</P>
    <P>That is an illustration of the extreme necessity for some focal point in trips for tourists.  I know that Bord Fáilte are interested in pointing out interesting places for tourists to go, apart altogether from driving around looking at the scenery.  I do not propose to go deeper into this proposal for the Tourist Board except to say that from my experience I think any money given to Bord Fáilte will be well and profitably used in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The promoters of tourist traffic in this country certainly deserve congratulation.  It is quite clear to all of us that hotels have greatly improved, that entertainments for tourists have greatly improved, and that transport and tours have greatly improved.  As Senator McGuire has just said, the local authorities have played a good part in this.  Our roads are excellent.  It is a very great charm to a visitor from England or from abroad to be able to drive on first-rate roads with hardly <Col N="1578" /> another car in sight for miles.  This, I know, is bringing many people from England into the country.  The local authorities are also providing better camping sites and better parking places.  All this is helping the effort, and it all adds up.  Credit is also due to shopkeepers and private citizens who are making an effort to brighten the look of our streets and roads.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, the tourist market in Europe is highly competitive. It happened, within the past few months, that I travelled through some 12 European countries on two cruises &mdash;as a lecturer on an American cruise and a British cruise.  It gave me an opportunity of studying tourist conditions abroad.  So with a view to this kind of Bill in the House, I made some notes.  I should like to emphasise that many of these countries are small countries like our own.  I do not think there is much use in comparing ourselves, in terms of tourist traffic, with France, Germany, Russia, and such like.  We simply have not the resources. I was lucky enough to see places like the Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Greece and the youngest of our European Republics, Cyprus.  They afford a pretty fair criterion for judging the possibilities in Ireland and our standards here at present.</P>
      <P>One contrast, of course, strikes you immediately.  We have the grave handicap of our climate, or perhaps I should say our summer climate.  It is worth emphasising this qualification, for in fact I seriously believe that the Tourist Board might make something of our winter climate, because our rainfall in November, December and January is no worse than that of Athens, and the temperature in the same months is very much higher than Paris or Madrid.  It might be worthwhile for Bord Fáilte to bring out a slogan &ldquo;Come to Ireland in the Winter, too.&rdquo; In fact we can promise better climatic conditions in November, December and January than most countries in Europe, some of the best in the whole northern hemisphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unhappily, as we know from recent experience, July appears to be one of our wettest and cloudiest months.  We <Col N="1579" /> have to face that.  And Bord Fáilte will have to face it one way or another, for I see advertisements in the foreign papers of glorious sunny beaches in the summer in Ireland.  People come, and generally they do not get that weather in July.  There should be some realism in facing up to our climatic conditions and to the fact that our climate is our worst disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Let me now consider briefly our three main advantages and what we can make of them.  The first is our scenery.  I have seen a good many countries in Europe now, and I am convinced that Irish scenery is unsurpassed for colour and outline in any country in Europe, in its own particular idiom and its own particular way. We can be quite certain that here we have a tremendous asset.  The second advantage is one about which tourists have again and again spoken to me, the temperament of our people.  We are naturally friendly to strangers.  Sometimes it is said that we are friendlier to strangers than to ourselves, but that is an exaggeration.  We naturally respond to strangers.  That makes a great impression on people.  You will not get that in Britain or, on the whole, in the North of Ireland, or in France, or Northern Germany.  You meet it in Southern Germany.  It is something that immediately strikes the stranger and the tourist.  With it there is the relaxed tempo of the country, although I am reluctant to emphasise this before the Minister for Industry and Commerce. This easy-going temperament, taking things easy, probably hits against our industry and our production. But it has a very definite compensation. Only last week, I was talking to two very intelligent tourists from America, the kind of people who would send others here.  What they liked most of all is our easy way, the lack of strain or rush.  If sometimes the Minister for Industry and Commerce is sad about our production figures, he can remember that something is coming into the country and will come in more and more if we can only preserve that relaxed temperament, together with hard work.</P>
    <P>Our third advantage is what I want <Col N="1580" /> to stress most of all.  Senator McGuire has very rightly said something about it already.  In this country, as in countries like Israel, Lebanon, Syria, and Greece, we have immense historical and intellectual treasures.  Those are what we should develop now, because, as I see it, there is a change in fashion in what tourists want to find in the countries they visit.  It used be the custom just to rhapsodise about the mountains and the sea, and to buy some souvenirs.  But there is a higher standard of education in America and throughout Europe now, and people want something more than just scenery and souvenirs and good food.  As Senator McGuire put it so clearly, the boatman wants something towards which to row, something about which he can tell a story when he takes you across the lake.</P>
    <P>I feel that in this country we could do a good deal more in developing interest in the historical side.  We have every period of history represented. We have a herioc age with Cuchulain and Finn, and a Patrician age with its early Christianity.  We have the age of the Norsemen which I think would be a very considerable attraction to Scandinavians through a publicity campaign on the lines &ldquo;Come and see your old capital city, Dublin,&rdquo; or in similar terms.  Such names as MacOstrich, the son of Osric, and MacAuliffe, the son of Olaf, show our association with the Norsemen. Scandinavians would find many such things of great historical interest to them.  The French might be interested in coming to see what the Normans did in this country.  In other words, I suggest that the time has come when Bord Fáilte should gradually move towards a more intellectual and a more historical approach in their publicity. That is what tourists are going to want more and more in the future.</P>
    <P>If we want to develop that kind of historical tourism, what can we best do?  Briefly, I think it depends on two things, on places and people.  We have already developed a few of our historical places.  We have sites like New Grange and Glendalough, and there are many more throughout the country.</P>
    <P>What I want to emphasise now is <Col N="1581" /> that we need to spread our tourists, not have them coming just to Cork or Dublin for a day's visit.  I should like to mention some of the other places that could be developed.  There is Cuchulain's grave near Dundalk.  It is a remarkable rath and it may be authentic.  It has all the atmosphere. Not far away is Finn's lake on Slieve Gullion.  If you could get good lecturers or guides to tell the story about these places, it would have a tremendous effect on tourists.  Another most remarkable place which I have never heard mentioned is a fine castle near Dundalk.  Its name, I think, is Roche's Castle, or the Castle of the Roches.  It dominates the whole hillside and plain and has a magnificent Norman keep, in all about an acre in extent.  It compares with some of the great Crusader castles which I have seen in the Lebanon and Syria.  It is a place that could be developed considerably, within a convenient run from Dublin or Dundalk.  There is another site, Charle's Fort near Kinsale&mdash;I wonder does anyone in the House know it? It has Stuart fortification and dominates the harbour in a magnificent way.  Its splendid walls are in a very good state of preservation.  Altogether it is a magnificent sight.</P>
    <P>There are many more assets which could be developed.  Senator McGuire mentioned the Georgian houses.  We have had tourists coming over purely to see the Georgian houses and the gardens of Ireland.  I hope we will do all we can, if I may say so in parenthesis, to preserve their amenities. There is at the moment a threat to Westport House, one of the great houses in the west.  It is being threatened with having a factory being built close to its walls.  Credit is due to the people who have built up that mansion as a tourist centre.  It is a pity if they have to accept a factory taking away from its beauty.  I want to emphasise again that we need to spread out our tourist centres.  We have far too many of the kind of tourists who dash around Dublin for a couple of days and then leave.</P>
    <P>We need to decentralise and spread out our tourist attractions, first, by developing widespread historic sites, <Col N="1582" /> as I have suggested, and secondly&mdash; and this would be fairly easy&mdash;by decentralising the museums.  Send some of our best art treasures to Galway, Cork, Limerick or Waterford. Preferably send those that have some regional connection with those areas. If you go to Greece, you must visit at least five different museums, skillfully distributed right through Greece. Athens is not enough.  You must go on to Delphi in the west, to Olympia in the southwest 150 miles away, to Delos, one of the islands, and to Rhodes in the southeast.  Unfortunately, that is not so in Ireland. You can see almost all our art treasures in or near Dublin.  Strategically, this is bad policy, and I hope that the Minister will consider decentralising our art treasures.</P>
    <P>A word of praise is due to some of the voluntary organisations throughout the country which have been doing a great deal for the tourist trade.  One in particular I should like to mention is the Maritime Institute in Dún Laoghaire.  There, by voluntary effort of some local citizens, you have a fine little collection of objects of seafaring history, giving the history of Irish boats, and of Irish seamen and other things of that kind.  A month or so ago, the Minister for Justice honoured the Institute by a visit.  But it deserves more than that.  If Bord Fáilte&mdash;or the Minister&mdash;would help it financially, it would be thoroughly deserved.  This is the only institute of the kind in our island, and it has done a good deal for naval history in one way or another.  In Yugoslavia as I saw about four months ago, you go to a small little town called Kotor on the magnificent Gulf of Kotor, a little town of perhaps 4,000 or 5,000 inhabitants.  There you find a splendid maritime institute with a remarkable collection of objects worthy of preservation of historic interest in connection with the sea.  Again in the nearby town of Dubrovnik, another good maritime institute is found.  These institutes serve two purposes.  They interest tourists, and they promote young boy's interest in the sea.  In time our own navy, our Maritime Inscription and our mercantile <Col N="1583" /> marine could benefit.  I recommend to the Minister that he should think kindly of that Maritime Institute in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>So far, I have been talking about places.  I would like to mention one other strong point.  In Ireland, we have great historic personages in the literary world, in the political world and in the world of philosophy.  We have not done very much to develop them as tourist attractions.  There is a Yeats summer school in Sligo, which is slowly building up a good connection. But there is not much else as far as I know.  Bord Fáilte might do very well if they organised tours based on Oliver Goldsmith or Patrick Sarsfield or Jonathan Swift or the O'Neill leaders or something of that kind, and placed their advertisements in the right kind of journals.  It might prove an attraction to the kind of tourists who do not just land off a ship and leave that evening, but who want to stay for a week or ten days.</P>
    <P>What about organising clan tourism? The O'Mahonys, I understand, already meet in County Cork, and the O'Malleys meet in Galway, in a private way.  Bord Fáilte might enlist the O'Neills of the United States and other clansmen to come in <i>en masse</i> in tours to this country.  That might be a little horrifying perhaps to the more serious historians amongst us, but we are here to bring tourists to the country and, properly done, it would do good.</P>
    <P>Here I want to say something which I think matters a good deal.  Much depends on the quality of the guides in this kind of tourism.  I hope that Bord Fáilte is watching this.  There are two kinds of bad guides.  One is the ignorant kind, and tourists very quickly find out if they are ignorant. The other is the biased kind, giving you some slanted history one way or another.  That is regrettable, and I know that it causes distaste among tourists eventually, even if the history is slanted in the way they like it.  I suggest that Bord Fáilte might consider enlisting rather better equipped guides&mdash;university undergraduates or graduates.  Only today I saw that there is a private organisation offering to <Col N="1584" /> provide guides to historic sites in Dublin.  I do not know who they are or whether they are of the right kind. They may or may not be, but this is the kind of thing that Bord Fáilte ought to be very much interested in.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I should mention.  These tourists must be entertained in the evening, when the day's journeying is over.  Nothing is sadder than to see them in the city of Dublin between 8 and 9 o'clock straggling around Grafton Street or O'Connell Street&mdash;it was specially noticeable during the cinema strike&mdash; wondering what they could do.  Bord Fáilte must try more and more to help every organisation that is providing good entertainment for tourists.  In connection with this, I would like to mention one specific matter.  Dublin needs a concert hall.  It is a scandalous thing that in our capital city there is not a single suitable concert hall which is available during the whole week. The suitable buildings are obtainable only on Saturdays or Sundays.</P>
    <P>As the Minister perhaps knows, there is a very attractive proposition before the citizens of Dublin at the moment.  The Royal Dublin Society, I understand, have made an offer to provide a concert hall on their own grounds, if they get financial help. They will not do it out of their own money, but if they get financial help from the citizens of Dublin or from the Government, they will have the concert hall built on their own grounds, and, what is more, they will maintain it.  There will be no charge, no cost, to the citizens of Dublin or to the State, once this hall is built.  This, I think, deserves careful consideration by the Minister and Bord Fáilte and all others interested in the tourist trade.  The Royal Dublin Society are prepared to build a hall holding up to 1,800 people which would be suitable not merely for concerts but for international conferences and meetings of that kind. The Government should, if they possibly can, seize this opportunity.  It is 50 years now since Dublin has wanted a concert hall, and now here is our chance.  I should like to repeat that there is this very attractive point: once the hall is built, the Royal Dublin Society will look after it.  We who are <Col N="1585" /> meeting in a house which for 100 years was owned by the Royal Dublin Society, are well aware that we can trust the Royal Dublin Society to do well for the citizens of Dublin, if they get encouragement.  I emphasise this project as one of the things that we might perhaps immediately do.  It would provide entertainment for tourists as well as bringing up the standard of music and art in our country.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to mention is this: for a hundred years, we have been consistently neglecting a most inexpensive and effective way of publicising Ireland as a tourist centre.  It costs the State almost nothing.  Indeed, if properly handled, it would cost the State nothing at all, but would bring in revenue.  I refer to what my late colleague, Senator Fearon, used often to mention in this House&mdash;our postage stamps.  There is a great opportunity for postage stamps showing historical personages or scenic views.  If properly designed and properly distributed, they would greatly increase tourist interest in our country.  So far as I know, every nation in the world, except our neighbour across the water, Great Britain, does it.  Is it that we are in the shadow of Great Britain in some way in this?  I hope not.</P>
    <P>I have before me an Irish 2d. stamp. It is deplorable.  It is old-fashioned, drab in colour, poor in design, with a blank map of Ireland.  Really, as a symbol of fatuity this stamp is outstanding. The 3d. stamp is better.  It has a good Celtic design.  The 4d. stamp, with the armorial bearings of the Four Provinces, is dull.  We could afford good 2d. and 3d. stamps, constantly changed, because philatelists will see that it will not cost us much money, showing such historic personages as we have had.  But they should be historically famous, rather than figures of national piety.  These could be tourist attractions.  Of the others, Tom Clarke, for example, was a good patriot, but I do not see him as an international tourist attraction. There have been a good many stamps of that kind.  I suggest that the citizens of the United States, France and Germany could be influenced by these <Col N="1586" /> stamps to come to see places and persons they are interested in.  If the stamps were well-designed and well-cut, they would be a very effective way of publicising our history and our scenery assets for the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>Those are only suggestions, but they are based on recent experience, and experience of small countries like our own, countries that are just building up their tourist trade.  However, as I said at the outset, the promoters of our tourist traffic deserve very considerable congratulation, and for that reason I think the Bill should have our full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone in this country is now convinced that anything we can do to encourage the development of the tourist business is in the interests of the country and should be done.  Therefore, there can be no doubt of the goodwill which will be extended to this Bill, not only in Seanad Éireann, but by the people in the country who give any thought to what is behind it.</P>
      <P>Looking at the position as it now is, it is well to recall that incoming shipping traffic in the first six months of this year, compared with the same period last year, shows an increase of six per cent.  Arrivals at Dublin Airport are up by 29 per cent., and in the same period, the car hire business is up by 23 per cent.  C.I.E. coach tours are booked out, and bookings for their monthly and weekly tours are very heavy.  At the same time, there are 19 foreign coach operators running tours here as compared with only 14 last year.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that concession to foreign operators has turned out to be such a success.  I remember at the time it was first mooted a couple of years ago, there was severe criticism of the possibility that it might do damage to C.I.E. and local bus operators.  It has proved, in the event, to be a great boon and it is a tribute to the foresight of those who made it possible for that concession to be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, fishing visitors for the first half of this year are up by 20 per cent. Bord Fáilte have organised, or arcut <Col N="1587" /> ranged, or succeeded in persuading 32 congresses to assemble here during the period compared with 19 last year. Bord Fáilte report a great increase in group travel, and it is a notable fact that many more people are bringing their own cars on their trips to Ireland. There is no need to refer to the amazing increase in the tourists who are arriving via the air lines which do business with this country.  All in all, the picture is bright.  This looks like being a record tourist season.  Hotels along our sea coast are packed.  Anyone who travels up and down the country will notice the amazing number of European visitors who have come here this year.</P>
    <P>I think there will be no hesitation in giving to Bord Fáilte the credit which is due to them for the efficient and satisfactory way in which they have handled the responsible job entrusted to them of developing tourism in this country so that we will get the maximum number of visitors out of the market which is available to the countries trying to promote the tourist business.  I believe Bord Fáilte deserve our thanks.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to offer some criticism also.  The Minister referred to the way in which this money, which will be made available to them by way of grant, will be spent. I should like to draw attention to something to which I referred here in the past on the various tourist development Bills which came before us.  I refer to the provision of single bedrooms in hotels.  I know Bord Fáilte's argument is the cost and the potential profit out of double bedrooms in hotels. Nevertheless, having talked to many hotel people, and having spoken to many visitors, I am convinced that this country is losing a tremendous amount of traffic which will not come here again, because once the name gets about that you cannot get a single bedroom in Ireland, people will go to France, Belgium, Holland or the hostels on the Continent where their needs can be met.</P>
    <P>In the past three years, only 1,600 extra bedrooms have been provided in all of the hotels which come under the Bord Fáilte grant scheme.  Of those <Col N="1588" /> 1,600 bedrooms, only 25 per cent are single bedrooms.  If anyone who knows anything about the tourist business, or about hotels, took the trouble to consult any hotel proprietor in any of our seaside resorts&mdash;Dún Laoghaire, for example&mdash;and asked over a trial period. how many applications he received for a single booking, and how many he has been compelled to turn down, he would be astonished at the amount of tourist traffic that has been lost.</P>
    <P>That is not the worst part: it is the name we are getting, and the way in which the story goes about that there is no use in bringing your girl friend to Ireland because you cannot get two single rooms; that there is no use in a father and mother and grown-up daughter coming to Ireland because, while they can get a double room, they cannot get a single room for the daughter; that there is no use in a brother and sister coming to Ireland because they can get only a double room as no single room is available.</P>
    <P>That is the story I have heard from many visitors.  I have checked with many hotel managers and they confirm the fact that they cannot afford to let a single room in the height of the tourist season.  When these people who write for single accommodation are informed that it is not available and find, if they are lucky, that they can get it on the Continent, they will not try Ireland again.  I feel that Bord Fáilte should make a greater effort. I know that they have done quite an amount in this direction over the past three years but they should redouble their efforts, in the light of developments taking place now on the European scene and in the light of the possibility of increased continental tourist traffic accruing to us as a result of these developments, to influence hoteliers to erect single bedrooms, particularly in the new great hotels to be built in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention the Minister's reference to the need for more promotional activities in Great Britain and the United States.  I noticed last year and this year, too, that in three American news magazines and in one big pictorial magzine, a list of musical festivals throughout <Col N="1589" /> Europe intended for the guidance of American tourists contained no reference whatsoever to Ireland.  I noticed in the list of attractions for American tourists in Europe no reference whatever to the Dublin International Festival of Music and the Arts last year or this year or to the Dublin Theatre Festival this year.  I wonder how is it, with the efficiency of the Bord Fáilte staff in the United States, that they are not able sufficiently to influence the publicity end of these magazines to ensure that Ireland will be mentioned as one of the attractions for American tourists.</P>
    <P>I notice also if you refer to the social and personal or amusement columns of several American newspapers published in Europe, you will find all the attractions of Brussels, Berlin, Ostend, Dinard or Biarritz, but never Ireland.  I wonder why Bord Fáilte is never able to break in either to the news columns or the advertising columns of these American newspapers published in Europe which have a tremendous circulation among hundreds of thousands of American tourists and American forces who have been stationed overseas for the past few years.</P>
    <P>I agree that more money should be spent on promotional activities and I should like to see advertising given a much earlier start by the advertising boys of Bord Fáilte in their campaign in the English press.  Undoubtedly our greatest potential tourist market is Britain, including Scotland and Wales. There is no doubt also that as far as tapping it through the advertising columns of the press is concerned, Bord Fáilte is slow off its mark.  During the past few years, I have watched the British press around the end of December and early January and I find that whereas the Continental resorts are on the ball very early after Christmas, our advertising does not seem to start until much later.  Anyone who knows anything about Britain knows that the British holiday-maker makes up his mind over the Christmas dinner where he will go the following summer and he relies to a great extent on the ads which appear in the newspapers and the offers of brochures. <Col N="1590" /> When he does not see any Irish advertisements but sees attractive ads for the Channel Islands and European centres, he is more likely to avail of the opportunity of an early booking and thereby we lose his custom.  I think, therefore, that the advertising campaign should start much earlier.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to stress the lower priced facilities available here.  I notice that in what one might describe as the class newspapers in Britain, the Sundays which go in for a more cultured and more intelligent type of reader, we do advertise in a fairly consistently planned campaign, but in the other type of newspaper which caters for the ordinary English worker, we do not seem to cut the same ice or use the same pressure, and I would urge Bord Fáilte to think on the lines of a series of attacks through the English provincial press, as well as through the national dailies.  We may spend a lot of money in the United States where advertising rates are high and where competition in amusements is terrific and also in European newspapers, but right beside us there is a potential market which we have not one quarter tapped, which can be got, where there is good will and good solid money.  They have it to spend and a tradition of spending it when they go on holidays.  They bring the money with them and it does not go back with them.  They leave it in the country to which they go on holidays, so every effort we can make to tap the British market for tourists should be made.</P>
    <P>One effort which we can make and which I advocated here on several previous occasions without success up to now is the provision of a day boat on the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire service from, say, the end of May. The weather begins to get fine, the days grow longer and the sea calmer and a tremendous number of older people in the north midlands of England who would like to come to Ireland do not like to travel by air and dread that night journey by boat. They would like to come early and miss the high season when the tourist traffic is so big and pressure so great, <Col N="1591" /> but they have no way of coming unless they travel by night or by air.  I would ask Bord Fáilte to renew their efforts, to back their efforts towards an earlier holiday season, by getting British Railways to put on an early boat service, a daylight service, from the end of May to the end of September. It would pay dividends to British Railways and at the same time, bring to us a considerable number of people whom we now are unable to get because of the long uncomfortable journey they have to make.</P>
    <P>When Senator Stanford referred to Charle's Fort, it reminded me of the efforts Cork has made to capitalise on the nearby Celtic territory of Wales, on the friendship there for this country. They have had special Welsh Welcome weeks in Cork; orchestras have been exchanged; and the usual courtesy greetings between mayors of cities have been arranged.  I feel there is one thing Bord Fáilte could do and do very successfully with little cost.  In Wales, there is a tremendous potential to be tapped.  They have a very fine series of seaside resorts in their own country, very fine mountain scenery, a most attractive land of hills and valleys.  They are a Celtic people with great kinship with us and great desire to be friendly with us and I feel that no effort should be spared to appeal to the Welsh as a separate people.  All the appeal is directed to Great Britain, mainly to England and some to Scotland but little effort has been made to appeal specifically to tourists from Wales.  I would urge Bord Fáilte to take advantage of the opportunities which arise from time to time, through the visits of Welsh choirs, orchestras or distinguished visitors, to try to influence them to increase the tourist traffic from Wales.  Cork has been very successful in doing it and I hope to see that good example repeated in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, for the information of Senator Stanford, I know Charle's Fort very well.  I had the great pleasure of swimming there many a morning. Apart from its being a historic monument, I can highly recommend it as an excellent place for a good swim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1592" /> One other thing strikes me as a consequence of the hospitality which I enjoyed from Bord na Móna last week looking at some of the wonderful developments which have occurred since the development schemes were initiated in the Tullamore area.  One of the greatest tourist attractions we could have would be organised trips to the bogs.  I have met many a foreign visitor who heard about Bord na Móna, about the amazing utilisation of the press button machinery to achieve what in many other countries takes hours of sweat and toil.  They have all asked how does one see one of these bogs, where does one go to see one of these bog railroads and how the briquettes are made?  I believe that if Bord na Móna could be induced&mdash;and I have no doubt they could be&mdash;to cooperate more closely with Bord Fáilte and if an organised series of guided tours to some of the bogs, the briquette factories and the peat-fired electric stations were organised, it would form one of the most attractive tourist shows we could put on in this country.  I hope Bord Fáilte will look into the possibility of doing that.</P>
    <P>American travel is expanding rapidly to Europe.  We are not getting all of it that we could get, but Irish International Airlines or Aerlínte, by reason of the fact that they have the finest aircraft on the North Atlantic and some of the fastest and by reason of their good advertising campaign in the United States, have succeeded in attracting a fair number of genuine Americans&mdash;I do not mean Americans of Irish descent&mdash;but real full-blooded Americans to come here.  I think Bord Fáilte could do a lot more in that respect by using also in that case the American State newspapers rather than the national dailies or even rather than the New York, Chicago or San Francisco television outlets, because in the United States in recent years, there has been growing up a feeling of regard for old countries like ours which are still unspoiled.</P>
    <P>That could be capitalised by an all-in package deal between Aerlínte, the Irish Hotels Federation, C.I.E. and Bord Fáilte.  I think Bord Fáilte would do well if it investigated the possibility <Col N="1593" /> of a package trip sponsored by it or Aerlínte and directed mainly at the upState Americans who are not reached in any way at the moment by our tourist publicity or propaganda.</P>
    <P>I feel this is a very good Bill.  The Minister has done a good service to tourism by introducing it.  I agree with his belief that it will make an important contribution to the development of the tourist industry and I am very glad, indeed, that opportunity offered to say these few words on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1920's the French tourist was almost the wonder and envy of the world.  Undoubtedly, France was the first country in Europe to make a real success of the tourist industry.  It was a combined operation and not something imposed from the top by a board like Bord Fáilte. I do not say that by way of criticism of the efforts and achievements of Bord Fáilte.  In every little town and village in France, there was a local tourist office.  They did all the things that made every part of France interesting and happy for the tourist.</P>
      <P>The tourist was welcome in every part of France.  They gave that type of variety about which Senator Stanford spoke.  They made one mistake. They allowed France to become little by little a high cost economy. They allowed the rapacity of some of the people engaged in the tourist trade to develop in such a way that they felt they could make money easily and little by little France lost her great tourist industry.  It has never recovered to the level at which it stood in the 1920's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great tourist countries today in Europe such as Italy and Spain have reaped the benefit because people feel they are getting value for money.  I think this is one thing that we ought to stress here in Ireland.  When people leave this country to go on holidays, what they are particularly interested in is to get value for money.  I am afraid that the promotion of big luxury hotels may encourage here the type of &ldquo;spivery&rdquo; which grew up in France where you felt that the whole staff turned out for special remuneration when you left after staying for, perhaps, <Col N="1594" /> only a weekend.  The tourist who gets good value and honest to God hospitality in Ireland wants to come back again.  The satisfied tourist is the greatest missionary we have for the development of tourism in this country. He is a far better person and of far greater advantage to us than any advertisement we can put in any paper in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>We must not get the increase in the number of tourists visiting our country out of proportion.  Tourism and travel have become international phenomena. The whole world is travel-conscious. The development of all forms of transport, particularly air, and the means of communication such as television, wireless telegraphy, etc. have made the world small.  Facilities are available and the youth of today are more interested in travel than ever before.  The middle-aged can travel in more comfort and with less disability than ever before.</P>
    <P>The debate has been very interesting in that it has brought out many points that must be helpful to the Minister but, without being facetious, I feel that Senator Stanford's suggestion of developing the clan spirit might have other repercussions.  I am wondering if the terrible O'Flahertys decided to have a clan gathering whether we might have to pray the Lord to deliver us from them.  There are people besides the O'Mahonys and many others whose reputation amongst the rest of us might not be as welcomely received as the clans mentioned by Senator Stanford but be that as it may, I believe that tourism is a combined operation.</P>
    <P>We can all help to make the tourists' visits interesting.  In many towns and villages, they have little to do in the evening unless there is some form of organised tourism.  I believe that Bord Fáilte and C.I.E. should increase planned tours and have discussions with tourist groups in all our provincial centres.  When I speak of provincial centres, I mean centres other than the county boroughs.  If they do, they will come on a greater variety of the type of tourism here than we have had up to the moment.  There is too great a tendency to run our tours along the <Col N="1595" /> seaboard and to forget the inland parts of our country.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin, in suggesting that we would have tours to our bogs, suggests something different from what was thought of before.  I believe that some of the inland scenery, particularly in Munster which has rich wide valleys and high mountains, is almost unique in these islands.  It could be exploited as well as the coastal scenery in Cork and Kerry and in the west generally. There is wonderful scenery in Waterford and other places but roads have not been developed to allow tourism there.  The Nire valley in County Waterford is one of the most picturesque valleys in the country.  The roads do not make it possible for tourist buses to pass through that wonderful and almost unique valley.</P>
    <P>I notice in the grants given for road development in County Waterford that the meagre sum of £5,000 has been allocated for 1960-61 as against a total for the country of some £4,000,000.  If we are to increase our tourism, we shall have to see that the money is diverted to other places as well as to the western counties.</P>

      <P>These are Gaeltacht areas.  I just wanted to make that point. They may not be described as such&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe they are. Whether or not they are, it is of little interest.  In fact, the area I spoke about, the Nire valley, is a Gaeltacht area.  I doubt if any money has ever been spent on it in tourist development.  All through Ireland, there is much unique scenery which is not known and is not sufficiently exploited from the tourist point of view.  If our tourist industry continues to develop at the rate at <Col N="1596" /> which it has been developing, then all I can say with regard to the concentration on tourism in the few areas where it is concentrated upon at the moment is that it would be better to disperse it and make it more widespread through our country.</P>
      <P>There is much that can be seen and much is being done to allow our people to see different things.  For example, the Office of Public Works have almost completely restored the unique 16th century house which was built as an adjunct to Carrick-on-Suir Castle.  I doubt if there is anything like it in the country.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford said that when people are touring, as well as looking at scenery they want to see things of interest.  Many of the 18th century houses in Ireland are wonderful specimens of domestic architecture. Although we may not agree with the reason for building &ldquo;the big house,&rdquo; as it was called, we have very good reason to be proud of our fine examples of Georgian architecture. Americans, who, I suppose, would like to claim to be the lineal descendants of those who stormed the Bastille are probably the greatest potential of visitors to the chateaux in the Loire valley, the same chateaux as stood as sentinels, almost like the Bastille.</P>
      <P>Our Georgian houses are part of our heritage.  Some of these houses are wonderful examples of architecture, decoration and stucco work.  Great European artists and architects worked on many of them.  We should now use them as a tourist potential because they have become our heritage.  In times past when we had horse-driven vehicles, many of the owners of these houses and mansions allowed people from the neighbourhood, in fact, even outsiders, to drive through the beautiful parklands.  Maybe it could be arranged that a limited number of tours in local areas might also be allowed to see these houses which are among the finest examples of that kind of architecture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restoration of places like Bunratty Castle should be proceeded with in other counties.  I said before in this House that I should like to see Kilcash restored.  It would put some <Col N="1597" /> semblance of life into a place out of which came four Archbishops of Cashel and about which that famous poem, The Lament of Kilcash, was written by a person who was grateful for the hospitality he had enjoyed when Lady Iveagh was the Mistress of Kilcash.  Take, for instance, the association of that family with Patrick Sarsfield.  Many of these things could be of special interest to tourists.</P>
    <P>I have never seen a sign on the road from Waterford to Limerick pointing out Ballyneety, a place where an episode of Irish history occurred which would fire the imagination of people friendly or ill-disposed towards us.  It brings back to memory one of the finest examples of courage and audacity in the annals of our history.</P>
    <P>Much is being done by local groups such as the Wexford Festival and the Waterford Festival of Light Opera and such as is being done in Cork, as mentioned by Senator Ó Maoláin, to attract a different type of tourist.  Some of the Welsh opera societies have come to the Waterford Festival.  The Wexford Festival has taken on an international flavour.  It has received State and cultural grants from various sources.  Its tourist attraction is assured.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of Waterford and Wexford, I must say that British Railways must, in this instance, be thanked for bowing to the demands to improve the shipping facilities to the south-east.  The six days a week sailings have been increased this year by about a month and, in addition, mid-day sailings are running during most of the months of July and August.  I was recently informed by a representative of British Railways that they are more than satisfied with the response that service is receiving. The diversification of the traffic and the sending of cars through the south as well as through the port of Dublin will benefit the country and allow the tourist to see the different parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The establishment of museums in the principal cities would give tourism a more regional flavour than it enjoys at present because Dublin seems to be too exclusive and comprehensive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1598" /> It can offer almost everything and that does not induce people to go outside the city.  If the tourist industry is to develop in the way we hope it will, this island of ours will not be big enough to take all the tourists.</P>
    <P>I believe that the British tourist, or the Irish person&mdash;whether he is first or second generation of our kinsfolk who had to seek work in England&mdash; who comes to this country should have to undergo the minimum of customs formalities.  I have received complaints from Americans and others who have travelled widely that they feel a certain awkwardness going through Irish customs, more so than when they are going through the customs of other countries.</P>
    <P>One thing which strikes me is that when the British people visit Ireland, they like to have goods supplied to them by our manufacturers of the greatest possible variety.  By the use of our talent in the fabrication of these goods, we should be able to make things of good design and workmanship of a high quality.  That would attract tourists and that type of industry should be promoted.  Some of our fashion goods have attained a standard of leadership in the world. If an English person comes to Ireland and wants to buy some of these goods, he probably finds he will come under the notice of his own customs officials when he goes back.  Similarly, if Irish people go to Britain and buy something that is different, and they are bound to find things which are different because of Britain's size, they are afraid that they will come under the notice of Irish customs officials.</P>
    <P>If 500,000 Irish people visited Britain and 500,000 British people visited Ireland, and each person bought £10 or £12 worth of goods, what advantage does the British or Irish economy enjoy by putting restrictions and difficulties on these people visiting each other?  On balance, there is no loss to either country.  In fact, there is everything to be gained in both countries because it would encourage a greater exchange of people.  The British population is so many times <Col N="1599" /> greater than ours that we appear to have all the advantage in encouraging tourists by limiting our customs formalities to the very minimum.</P>
    <P>I do not see why some Minister could not arrange with his opposite number in Britain to allow a complete liberalisation of the customs formalities between this country and Britain.  I know that it will be said that people will smuggle in this and smuggle in that.  That may be, but people who travel often find that they become known to the customs authorities. There are not so many points of exit and entry in this country and if people are travelling once a week, they are smuggling watches or jewellery or something else.  You need not be a member of Interpol to be able to pick out such a person.  Anybody can see that where a person is travelling between England and Ireland 50 times in the year, he is not doing it merely because he is fond of travelling, but must have some other reason for it. I believe it is desirable that the people in Britain and Ireland, and it is a combined operation, should be allowed travel without let or hinder and if we have goods to sell which are different from those in Britain, and <i>vice versa,</i> it would encourage trade and tourism if there were that liberalisation of customs formalities.</P>
    <P>We all welcome this Bill and would like to give the Minister whatever money he requires.  I believe we are only beginning to develop this industry and the Common Market will provide a potential of another 250 million people who have seldom heard of Ireland, except as an island in the western ocean on the other side of Britain.  It is bad tourist propaganda that when the weather forecasts are being given, they speak of a depression off Ireland and I wish we could counter that.  When we become part of the Common Market, we should endeavour to see that whoever issues these weather bulletins will frame them differently. If I were living in Denmark or Western Germany and every other night I heard that there were depressions off Ireland, it would not encourage me to visit Ireland.  When <Col N="1600" /> they are giving the weather bulletins for fishermen, they often give names which nobody knows and we might be able to get around it in some such way.</P>
    <P>I believe the matter of tourism is something in which we can all help In every town and village the people can make tourists welcome and if they do the tourists will act as ambassadors on behalf of our industry.</P>

      <P>Ní dóigh liom gur gá dhom a thuille molta a dhéanamh faoin mBille seo.  Ní gá dhom ach oiread a thuille molta a dhéanamh faoi Bhord Fáilte&mdash;dream atá ag déanamh a ndíchill ar son na cuartaíochta.  Tá meas ag gach éinne orthu.  Is eol dóibh tábhacht na hoibre atá ar siúl acu.  San am gcéanna, áfach, ba cheart treorú éigin a bheith ann maidir leis na cuairteoirí a thagann go hÉirinn chun seachtain nó coicís a chaitheamh anso.</P>
      <P>Sé tá ar aigne agam gearán a chuala mé faoi bheirt a tháining go dti cathair áirithe sa tír seo.  Bhí sé déanach.  Cuireadar futhu i dtí ósta de Ghrád A nó B.  Níor tugadh aon tsuipéar dóibh agus b'éigin don bheirt cúig nó sé giní a íoc.  Do chuala mé an gearán sin ach ni dóigh liom gur fíor é.  Im thuairimse, ba cheart go mbeadh cumhacht ag an mBord nithe den tsaghas sin a chosc.  Uime sin, is éigin dúinn bheith dian ar lucht na dtithe ósta.  D'fhéadfadh tí ósta den tsaghas atá i gceist agam obair na dtithe ósta maithe a loit. D'féadfadh siad an chuartaíocht a loit freisin.  Is measa i bhfad gníomhartha den tsórt seo ná gearán ar bith a deintear sna nuachtáin nó gearán ar bith a dheineann na cuairteoirí a thagann go dti an tír seo.</P>
      <P>Tá rud eile gur mhaith liom caint air, go bhfuil baol ann tre shaothar Bhoird Fáilte agus an soláthar a deintear do dhaoine a thagann go hÉirinn, go bhfuil an nós ag leathnú ar árdú costais ar dhaoine a thagann. Tá an gearán sin ag dul i leithead agus i méid, agus is mó is clos é ó dhaoine anso in Éirinn, Éireannaigh &mdash;ná ó na daoine iasachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá meon na &ldquo;luxury hotels&rdquo; ag dul ró-dhlú-cheangailte i ngnó na cuartaíochta. <Col N="1601" /> B'fhearr liomsa fás a fheiscint ar shaghas eile chun aíocht a thúirt do chuairteoirí nach milliúnaithe iad ach a thiocfadh anso chun seachtain nó coicís ar a suaimhneas a chaitheamh agus díol réasunta a dhéanamh orthu gan bheith ag árdu costais orthu nó dhá dteannadh i &ldquo;luxury hotels.&rdquo;  Is mor an dearmad é bheith ag fógraíocht &ldquo;luxury hotels&rdquo; sa tír seo.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh hotels maithe agus hotels compordacha le fáil ag daoine ar chostas réasúnta.  Do thiocfadh i bhfad níos mó daoine dá mbeadh sin acu.  Tá rud amháin a thig de sin agus níor mhiste é a lua.  Tá eagla ag teacht ar ghná-mhuintir na hÉireann&mdash;agus cúis acu leis&mdash;nach bhfuil siad saibhir go leor chun laethe saoire a chaitheamh in Éirinn.  Téann siad go dtí an Ostáir, an Iodáil agus téann siad go hAlbain toisc, dar leo, go bhfuil na táillí anso in aon tí ósta fónta ró-ard agus ró-chostasúil.  Sin smaoineamh atá in aigne a lán daoine. Ba mhaith liom go gcuirfí in iúl é do lucht na cuartaíochta, do Bhord Fáilte, agus deire a chur leis an eagla atá ar dhaoine agus an gearán atá ag cuid mhaith daoine go mbíonn an costas beagán ar an dtaobh árd.  Níl a thuille le rá agam.  Is trua liom go bhfuil aon <Col N="1602" /> ghearán le déanamh air mar is tábhachtach an chuartaíocht d'Éirinn.  Is fónta an obair agus an saothar atá déanta ag Bord Fáilte.</P>
