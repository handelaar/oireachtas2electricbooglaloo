    <Title>Public Business. - Mental Treatment (Detention in Approved Institutions) Bill, 1961: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mental Treatment Act, 1945, provides that in suitable cases patients may be received into mental institutions as temporary patients for a maximum period of six months in the first instance.  Under Section 189 of the Act, whenever the chief medical officer of the institution becomes of opinion that the patient will not have recovered on the expiration of the initial period a request may be made to the Minister to extend the period, and where the Minister by Order so extends the period the patient may be retained in detention in the institution for a further period, not exceeding six months. The Section also provides for further periods of detention where necessary, each time within a limit of six months, and provided that the maximum period of detention may in no case exceed two years.</P>
      <P>Before the 1945 Act was passed, there was no provision for admittance to mental institutions on a temporary basis.  Since then, with the gradual recognition by those affected or their relatives that mental illness, like other illnesses, was amenable to treatment and that in many cases complete cure was possible, the number of persons admitted to such institutions as temporary patients has increased very considerably, and in consequence the number of requests from medical superintendents for orders extending the periods for which particular patients may be retained under treatment has also increased substantially. It is now in fact running at the rate of nearly 3,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> The requests are usually received about a fortnight before the then current period of detention of the patient is due to expire; but it frequently happens that a request is not received until much closer to the current expiry date. Since in the absence of a Ministerial order, there is no legal power to retain a patient after the authorised period of detention has expired, it will, I hope, be appreciated that there is frequently a considerable element of urgency involved in dealing with these requests. Notwithstanding this, no case appears to have arisen until recently in which the relevant order was not made within the due time.</P>
    <P>Every application for extension received has to be put through certain processes.  I can best explain what is involved by reference to an actual file which I have here for the purposes of demonstration.  I have, of course, taken the necessary precautions to ensure that the patient to whom it relates will not be identified.  This pink paper is a copy of the primary document submitted in connection with the initial reception of the patient.  This document arrives in the Department within a few days of that reception. The green paper is a statutory report furnished by the medical officer in the institution to the medical officer in the institution to the Department within twenty-one days after the patient is received.  The white document is the request made, in the form of a letter, by the medical officer of the hospital for an extension of the period of detention.</P>
    <P>When such a request as this is received in the Department, a member of the staff extracts and attaches to it the earlier documents in relation to the patient, that is to say the pink document and the green document which I have shown to the House.  If earlier requests have been received in respect of the particular patient involved, the white documents containing these earlier requests which cannot exceed two&mdash;since not more than three request's for Ministerial orders can be granted in respect of any such temporary patient&mdash;will be already on the file and to these the current white document is added.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1006" /> The file is then referred to the Inspector or Assistant Inspector of Mental Hospitals as the case may be. He examines the reception documents and the application for extension, and advises whether, in his view, there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for the extension. If he so certifies, the name is entered, with other names, in a draft order and the draft order and the documents are referred to a senior officer who certifies that he has personally seen the requests and the supporting documents from the appropriate medical officer in each of the institutions in which the patients to be covered in the order are detained.  This certificate is submitted to the Minister with the draft order for signature.  When the Order has been signed a separate notification in respect of each patient covered by the Order is sent to the mental institution concerned.</P>
    <P>For some time, I have been doubtful and I feel that my predecessors must also have had qualms in this respect as to whether this procedure for the granting of extensions on the order of the Minister for Health constituted any real safeguard for the patient.  In fact, with the sole exception that extensions exceeding six months are not normally granted in the case of addicts, a case cannot be recollected in which an application for an extension was refused by any Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>Last September, in conjunction with other proposals for the amendment of the Mental Treatment Acts, I went into this whole question and I arrived at the conclusion that, subject to certain safeguards which it is unnecessary for me to mention now, the power to authorise extensions should be transferred to the only persons with full knowledge of the mental condition of the patients, that is to say the medical superintendents of the mental treatment institutions.  I recommended accordingly to the Government.  On 18th October last the Government accepted my recommendation and the necessary provision was incorporated in the Mental Treatment Bill, 1960 which is now before the Dáil and the text of which was circulated on 29th November last.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> In December, it came to the notice of my Department that certain irregularities had occurred in dealing with a number of requests for the extension of the period of detention of temporary patients.  It was portion of the duty of a particular member of the staff, on receipt of requests for extensions, to associate with each of them, in the manner which I have demonstrated to the House, the previous papers in relation to the patient concerned and refer the file to the Inspector or the Assistant Inspector of Mental Hospitals as I have described. The officer in question went on sick leave on 13th December and some little time afterwards, it came to light that he had withheld from the Inspector a number of requests which had been received by him and had suppressed them to conceal this fact.  In all, 280 requests were suppressed in this way.  In most of these cases, all but 22 in fact, the default was further cloaked by the irregular issue of a notification to the hospitals concerned that the necessary Ministerial order had been made.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the period within which extensions could be granted in the case of the 280 suppressed requests had expired by the time these irregularities came to notice.  After the initial discovery, on 19th December, full inquiries had to be made to ascertain the full extent of the irregularities. When that was done, consideration had to be given to the further action to be taken.</P>
    <P>The situation was that because of the failure to make the necessary extension orders, a considerable number of patients were being illegally detained.  I gave consideration in the first instance to informing the institutions concerned of this situation and advising the immediate release of these patients but rejected this course for what, I think, were good reasons.  These patients, according to the medical advice submitted to me a short time previously, had needed further detention to facilitate their recovery.  Since that time. some had improved in their medical condition to such an extent that they had been discharged.  Others would soon be fit for discharge.  The majority <Col N="1008" /> still required further treatment.  It would have been upsetting to these patients and a source of worry to their relatives, to have discharged them and put in train again the procedure for their immediate readmission.</P>
    <P>On balance I decided that the best interests of the patients would be served by seeking the authority of the Oireachtas to remedy the situation so far as was possible by legislation and this is the reason for the measure which the Seanad is considering today.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House aims at remedying the situation by providing broadly that where a request for an extension was duly made, the patient may be continued in detention as if an order had been made extending the period, notwithstanding that no order was made.  Provision is also made that no damages shall be recoverable by or on behalf of a person merely by reason of his detention during the period in question.</P>
    <P>Of the 280 patients in respect of whom the applications for extensions were suppressed, it has been ascertained that 53 have since been discharged and discharged in the normal course.  Included in this figure are seven of the 22 cases mentioned earlier whose period of extension had not been authorised and in which no notifications regarding extensions issued to the institutions concerned.  I might mention also that these 22 cases concerned only eight institutions.  In the other institutions, the issue of the notifications gave the impression to the staffs concerned that the extension had been properly authorised.</P>
    <P>Inquiries were made by the staff of the eight institutions to which I have referred about the non-receipt of notifications and they were informed that the matter was being looked into.  So far, however, no hospital authority has been notified of the cases in which the necessary orders had not been made.  I took the decision not to have them notified because I felt that if the managers of the authorities concerned were made aware of the position, they would be faced with the obligation of discharging forthwith from their hospitals over two hundred patients whom the competent medical <Col N="1009" /> officers of such authorities had advised it was necessary to retain in them for further treatment.  I am sure that the Seanad will agree that it would have been unreasonable to have placed these authorities in such a situation.</P>
    <P>The requests which were suppressed have been examined by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  He has indicated that the extensions sought would have been recommended by him in all cases had the requests reached him at the appropriate time.  In the normal course and in the normal way, therefore, all these extensions would have been authorised by me.  In saying this, I am not seeking in any way to minimise the gravity of the irregularities which have occurred, and I may say that I consider what has happened to be most regrettable.</P>
    <P>In asking the Seanad to give this Bill a Second Reading and to allow it to pass through its Subsequent Stages to-day, there are three features of the whole affair, however, to which I am entitled to direct particular attention.  These are: (1) No blame attaches to any medical superintendent or other officer of any mental institution in relation to this matter; (2) no patient has been detained in a mental institution whose detention was not justified by medical certificate; and (3) no patient has been detained for a day longer than was justified by his condition, or will be so detained.</P>

      <P>When I heard of this matter on Monday, and when I understood that, owing to the attitude of the Opposition in the Dáil, it was likely that this Bill would come to the Seanad to-day, I felt a particular temptation.  I did not know all the circumstances, but I felt that I knew the Minister for Health extremely well, and it was a tempting prospect to get up in the Seanad and make the speech that Senator Sean MacEntee would make in circumstances of this kind, if a Minister against whom he was in Opposition had to bring in this kind of Bill.</P>

      <P>The matter is a serious one.  The fact that the Minister finds it necessary to bring a Bill into both Houses of the Oireachtas and pass an Act as rapidly as may be, indicates, as he has said himself, the gravity and the seriousness of the matter.  Let me say at once that I am in favour of passing the Bill and also of the decision the Minister reached, with all the courses open to him.  To bring the Bill into the Dáil was, I think, the correct decision, and I am entirely in agreement with the Minister in that regard.</P>
      <P>I was present in the Dáil yesterday when the matter was being discussed. I knew it would fall for discussion here today and that the Official Report would not be already available.  I must say it seemed to me that the attitude of the Opposition Parties in the Dáil was helpful and generous and I hope the attitude taken here today will be the same.  The Minister's position and the Minister's language and general attitude were, on the other hand, quite different.  He did not, in the Dáil yesterday, so far as my experience went, express any personal regret for what had happened, nor did he when concluding yesterday in the Dáil express himself as in any way grateful to the House for what seemed to me to be the helpful and the generous attitude which the House had taken. The Bill was taken as the first business, all Stages were taken together and we are being enabled to take the Bill in the same way today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one has ever been more insistent on the dignity, the status, the responsibility and powers of Ministers than the Minister for Health and no one has ever been more violent and more unbridled in denunciations of opponents and denunciations of what he called yesterday in the Dáil a slip-up in a Department.  In this case, he says that he is not in any way to blame.  He says the matter is one which occurred owing to a very strange act of omission on the part of a very young and junior official. <Col N="1011" /> Surely it is rather extraordinary that the action of a young and junior official should create a situation which needs legislation to remedy.</P>
    <P>I gather from the Minister to-day&mdash; I was not able to follow the proceedings quite fully yesterday&mdash;that not only did this junior official prevent certain documents from going to his superiors but he was also able to write to the resident medical superintendents in mental hospitals in the Minister's name giving consent for the further detention of mental patients.  Am I right in that?</P>
    <P>It seems to me an extraordinary position if a junior official can convey to the resident medical superintendents in mental hospitals that a particular patient is to be detained with Ministerial sanction.  If he can do that and no one discovers it, surely there must be something wrong with the system. I find that very difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>The Minister very properly at the end of his speech said that the resident medical superintendents were in no case to blame.  I rather gathered from him yesterday that it was due to their action that the matter was discovered.</P>
    <P>I want to be very brief on this.  The Parliamentary convention most certainly is that the Minister is responsible for his civil servants and any departure from that convention would, I think, involve us in rather serious difficulties and change the whole nature of the Civil Service.  Civil servants, as is well known, frequently write speeches for Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they could write the type of speech the Minister often makes but there is no doubt that civil servants do write departmental speeches on certain topics for certain Ministers&mdash;not excluding the Minister for Health. <Col N="1012" /> The Minister is a very pleasing person and is good company, but on his feet he is clean daft.  He cannot stop.  He does not know what he is going to say and, worse still, none of his associates know, either.  He has on several occasions expressed regret for having gone too far in denunciation of political opponents, with, I think, a firm resolution of amendment, a resolution which he has normally failed to keep, as the recent example in Sligo proves.</P>
      <P>I shall come back to the subject of responsibility.  A civil servant writes a speech for the Minister.  The Minister does not say &ldquo;I am informed by a high officer in my Department...&rdquo; and read it out.  The civil servant gets no credit for that kind of thing and that is as it should be.  Surely the position should not be that when a civil servant is right, the Minister takes all the credit but that when he slips up, the Minister can protect himself and his Department and his Ministerial responsibility by saying: &ldquo;This is all due to the action of this young junior.&rdquo; That does not work and it ought not be allowed to work.</P>
      <P>The Minister might have said in the Dáil what he said here to-day and gone a little bit further.  He said to-day it was a most regrettable occurrence.  He might have said: &ldquo;I regret this occurrence and am grateful to the House for what the House is doing for me.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>From the point of view of the patients, of the resident medical superintendents and of the Minister himself, despite the Minister's attitude, the Bill should pass and I am in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all accustomed to listening to members of the Soviet Politburo accuse themselves before congresses of the Soviet Party in Russia of having committed certain crimes against the people, then make an abject confession and apology and, after that, they disappear from the scene.  We had something like that this afternoon from the Minister for Health, with the exception that he has not made the apology and that he is not likely to disappear from the scene until after the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has given us a very poor account of how this incident <Col N="1013" /> occurred.  He spoke about a young and junior officer in the Civil Service. As I understood the Minister, the next step for the young and junior officer was to an officer who apparently dealt with the forms submitted to him by the young junior officer and thereafter to the Inspector or Assistant Inspector of Mental hospitals.  While he was speaking, I looked up the Estimates to see the rank of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  It is Assistant Secretary level.  I take it that the officer below him must rank either principal officer or assistant principal.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister has accused a young and junior officer, he should tell us his rank.  If it is nearer to that of writing assistant or clerical officer, we are entitled to comment that it is extraordinary that such responsibility should be placed on such a junior officer.  If, on the other hand, the officer is a good deal senior, it is extraordinary that those closer to the top and dealing with important administrative matters should be so neglectful of their duties.</P>
    <P>Many Senators will recall an incident in Britain where a certain farmer was entitled to get back certain land taken from him during the war by the Commissioners of Lands over there.  Through some neglect on the part of the officials in the Ministry of Agriculture, the land was not restored as it ought to have been in accordance with the law.  It was the Crichel Down case and the Minister at the time was, I think, Mr. Dugdale.  It was conceded by all sides in the House of Commons at the time that the Minister had no responsibility whatever for the neglect of his officials. However, when he spoke in the House of Commons about the matter, the Minister resigned.  The system on which democratic institutions have been built requires absolute loyalty from State servants and absolute responsibility from the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is not pleasant to have to deal with a situation of this kind.  The Minister has tried to shuffle off responsibility for what has occurred.  I would refer to a ruling by the <Col N="1014" /> Cathaoirleach on 15th December, 1960, as reported at Column 449 of the Official Report, Volume 53.  I was dealing with decisions which it was intended should be made by the Minister for Local Government under the Derelict Sites Bill.</P>
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: The Senator should not continue in that strain with regard to the Civil Service. The Minister is responsible for the acts of his Department.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Quigley: That is so and I quite appreciate that, but I want to get down to what is the reality in putting into a section of the Bill such as this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: The reality, as far as Parliament is concerned, is that the Minister is responsible.</P>
    <P>I continued, apparently, in that strain and the following remarks were made:</P>
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: The Senator may not continue in that strain.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Quigley: With great respect, if we are considering legislation in which we are vesting in a Minister of State a right of appeal, I submit that I am entitled to consider who in fact will deal with that appeal.</P>
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: Parliamentary procedure calls for laying the blame for everything at the door of the Minister.  The Senator must know that by now.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to accept blame which rightly belongs to him.  He should not try to shuffle off his responsibility on some junior official, who may or may not&mdash;we do not know&mdash; be responsible for what has been done.</P>
    <P>It is extremely odd that the Minister should drag through Parliament and through the publicity associated with parliamentary proceedings some anonymous civil servant whom it will be possible to identify not alone among his colleagues but in the public service. This is done by a Minister who on 21st December, 1960, got into a temper with Senator Stanford on the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) <Col N="1015" /> Bill, 1959.  As reported at column 510 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Senator cast doubts upon the loyalty of my officers.</P>
    <P>We regret the Minister should cast doubts not alone on the junior officers but on senior officers and on the administration of his Department. Under Section 189 of the Mental Treatment Act, which this Bill is designed to amend, it is the duty of the Minister to certify or not to certify the extension.  He failed in that duty but he will not confess it.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained how a file in a Civil Service Department is constructed. This one was in technicolour. We have pink, green and white documents. The Minister might give some indication of the number of hands through which the file passed and, more particularly, whether the orders were signed by himself.  He spoke of certain data being sent to a senior officer who signed certain things.  Then he said: &ldquo;The order was then signed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would say whether the order was signed personally in all cases by the Minister.  The Minister was recently down in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency and on the <i>Sunday Press</i> of February 26th, we were told, according to the heading on page 3, that &ldquo;Fine Gael sweeps away the people's safeguards&rdquo;. This was the statement made by the Minister for Health.  Of course the people of Sligo-Leitrim, for whom the Tánaiste made a certain High Court action an issue in the election, have already decided in a very clear way that they do not regard the people's safeguards as having been swept away. On the contrary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am coming back by a very circuitous route through Sligo-Leitrim.  So far from sweeping away the people's rights, we on this side of the House believe in the preservation of the fundamental liberties, and the most fundamental liberty with which this Bill is concerned is that set forth in Article 40, subsection 4 (1) of the Constitution, which says: &ldquo;No person shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law&rdquo;.  The plain and inescapable fact is that unfortunate people who are mentally unstable have been deprived of their liberty, not in accordance with law.  That is what the Minister is here to rectify and against which he seeks to indemnify himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not trying to indemnify himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The strong objection I have to this Bill is that the Minister, knowing that the Constitution had not been observed, did not get in touch with the next-of-kin, the people responsible for these people wrongfully detained in mental institutions, which would have been the minimum requirement.  The Minister should have written telling them that &ldquo;owing to failure of my Department and myself to observe certain requirements as set forth in Section 189 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, so-and-so is being detained at the present time in an institution not in accordance with law.  It is my intention, however, to ask the Oireachtas to regularise this detention in due course.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the Minister nor anybody else has any right to detain anybody, except in accordance with law.  We have enough queer detentions under the Offences against the State Act. When the Minister for Health discovered that because of his failure people were being wrongfully detained in mental institutions, he should have tried immediately to make up to those people as far as he could for the wrongful detention of which he has been the cause.  But so far from trying to do that, the Minister withholds from the county managers the information that <Col N="1018" /> these people are being wrongfully detained. The reason was that he was afraid that if this got out to the county managers, he would have to suffer the consequences of dozens of <i>habeas corpus</i> applications in the courts of justice. In this way, the Minister for Health was able to thwart the workings of the law and of the Constitution. The right of <i>habeas corpus</i> is recognised in Britain and is written into our own Constitution as one of the most fundamental things, but the Minister took very great care that it should not be operated in the case of people who were mentally incapable and afflicted.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has given us all the details we require on this Bill?  As I understand the position, of the 280 people who were detained or discovered to have been wrongfully detained, 53 have since been released. I should like the Minister to assure me that no person was detained one hour longer than was necessary in a mental institution as a result of his failure to comply with the provisions of Section 189.  The Minister has given some kind of general guarantee that no patient was detained whose detention was not justified and that no patient was detained longer than he ought to have been.  Upon what evidence does the Minister base that statement?  Has he got a full and detailed report in relation to every one of these patients? If it be the case that nobody was wrongfully detained, why does the Minister insist on a clause going in that no damages shall be recoverable by or on behalf of any person in respect of his detention?  If a person would have been detained in any event and an order would have been made in respect of that person, then it is quite useless and redundant to put in this section.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Minister is not at all sure of himself in that regard, and that Parliament is being used to ensure that the ordinary rights that a citizen enjoys to recover damages against the Minister for Health, the local authorities or anybody else for wrongful detention and unlawful imprisonment will not apply in the case of these less fortunate among us who are mentally incapable.</P>

      <P>If democratic institutions are to survive and to function properly in this country, then we must have certain, fundamental rules of conduct, which must be observed at all times, especially by Governments and by those entrusted with governing our country and people.  We were told in the past by you, Sir, as Cathaoirleach, on numerous occasions in this House that the Minister is responsible to Parliament for all the work of his Department. On certain occasions when I went to blame civil servants, I was quickly told by the Chair that I could not blame them for anything; that the Minister was responsible, and I would have to blame the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister and all Ministers of this Government take credit any time credit is due.  They make certain they get it and if they do not, Radio Éireann will very soon give it to them, whether they are entitled to it or not.  I think that cannot be denied by anybody.  If they take credit when credit is deserved, then I think that when they are to be blamed for anything or when anything goes wrong in their Departments, the appropriate Minister should shoulder the blame.  In this case, the blame should be placed on the shoulders of the Minister for Health. He is a well-known fighter, but it would have been much better for him if he had fought his way out of this situation and had not adopted the cowardly procedure of sheltering behind a young junior officer of his Department.  I think it is regrettable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, that is what it is.  I do not think there is any necessity for me to withdraw anything I said.  I think it regrettable and deplorable that any Minister should do what he did, that is, to pillory a young junior officer and throw the whole blame on him.  The only proper course open to the Minister is to hand in his resignation to the Taoiseach and let the Taoiseach do what he thinks best in the particular circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> We were told that the purpose of this Bill is to regularise the continued detention of a number of patients who were received into a mental hospital as temporary patients.  We were told that under the 1945 Act, the maximum period of detention was six months.  The order to extend that had to be made by the Minister.  We were told that roughly 3,000 cases were dealt with each year.  Could it have happened that this had become such a routine matter that it was left entirely to a young official to deal with? When this individual fell ill, then something had to happen and it was found that 280 cases had not been dealt with as they should have been. I cannot understand how any young junior officer could suppress 280 applications received in the period from October to mid-December.  Were there no officers senior to this young junior officer who were supposed to go through any of these files?  Were they not supposed to check on them? I have my ideas about others perhaps being concerned but there has to be a scapegoat&mdash;somebody has to be blamed&mdash;and I suppose the easiest way out is to blame a young junior officer.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that this matter should be left in the hands of a young junior officer.  Surely some senior officers of the Department should have checked on the files between October and December&mdash;a period of two and a half months?  If they did not do so, I doubt if they are doing their work properly in the Department.  There is no doubt that there is public uneasiness about the fact that 280 documents relating to the detention of 280 people could be buried for 2½ months, could lie, as we were told by the Minister, in the hands of a young junior official of the Department, without a senior officer appearing to make any inquiry or without the Minister himself making any inquiry.  We wonder, if this young junior officer had not gone sick on 13th December, would any inquiry have been made about these files?  Was there no senior officer in this section to ensure that those applications, which concerned the lives the rights and the freedom of <Col N="1021" /> people who were unable to look after themselves, were dealt with in time?</P>
    <P>I know that, perhaps, the Minister was too busy.  He was down in Sligo-Leitrim talking about Fine Gael snatching the people's safeguards, but he himself, who was responsible for his own Department, was taking away the rights and the safeguards of unfortunate people who were unable to look after themselves.  It is not for me or anybody to advise the Minister, but it would be much better if he looked after the rights and safeguards of those people who are entrusted to him as Minister for Health and left the rights and safeguards of politicians to themselves. They will look after them just as the people of Sligo-Leitrim did in the past week or so.  I agree with Senator Hayes.  I think that in the interests of the patients this Bill should be passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the Bill and I shall relate these matters to the Bill.  I went to the other House yesterday and I listened to the Minister's brief.  In that brief, there was not one word of personal regret from the Minister, from the person responsible for this state of affairs&mdash;not one word of personal regret.  Today all the Minister would say was: &ldquo;I consider what has happened to be most regrettable&rdquo;&mdash;as if he were a judge sitting on the Bench.  He is not a judge sitting on the Bench in this matter.  The Minister is in the equivalent position in this matter of the prisoner at the bar.  That was the farthest the Minister would go.  I do not believe there is another Minister&mdash; and I say this in an honest belief&mdash; in this Government or in the previous Government who would confine himself to that kind of statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole tenor of the Minister's speech today, in my opinion, was wrong, completely and absolutely wrong.  I am not going to go into the case in Britain which illustrated this so very well, when a Minister, remote <Col N="1024" /> from the scene of action, had to resign because the people felt that things were done by officials in his Department which would not be accepted by the people as having been properly attended to.  The Minister did not cover a number of points at all, in my opinion.  It is regrettable that any Minister should come to either House of the Oireachtas and blame a junior official.  I notice that the Minister's brief on that matter was altered between yesterday and today.  It was not nearly as explicit today as it was yesterday and I was glad to note that.  The particular way in which it was put was not nearly as objectionable today as it was yesterday.  It was extremely objectionable yesterday.  When a Minister is responsible&mdash;and we have all been reminded time and again and indeed I think I have been rightly reminded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When the record becomes available, the difference between <Col N="1025" /> what the Minister said yesterday and today will be quite apparent. I shall leave it at that; there is no point in pursuing the matter at this moment because we cannot come to any final decision about it.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that Senator L'Estrange raised a very important point.  Indeed, I have myself on one occasion, in relation to an incident which happened when the previous Government were in office, protested very strongly about the blame for that particular incident being laid at the feet of a porter.  This is the same kind of thing.  This attitude of shelving responsibility is just too easy, say, in relation to a body like C.I.E. &mdash; to say: &ldquo;Oh, the Minister is not responsible.&rdquo; It is too easy in a reasonably large body for an individual to say: &ldquo;Oh, I was partly in it but there were half a dozen others involved also.&rdquo;  This matter is just altogether too easy but it cannot be done by a Minister.  No Minister can divorce himself from his responsibility.  The procedure, the understanding and the parliamentary history in the matter are as clear as daylight.  No Minister by any form of words or capacity to use English can get rid of his parliamentary responsibility or Ministerial responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister, as was pointed out, referred to a file and he referred to this pink paper, this green paper and this white paper.  I do not refer to this lightly, but it is quite obvious that the colour of these papers was designed for a specific purpose.  It was part of the administrative procedure to ensure that the pink paper was followed by the green paper and the white paper, and that anybody handling a file could, by looking into the file, know how far a particular case had gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, and I assert this without fear of contradiction, and if the Minister contradicts me, I am not prepared to accept the contradiction there was responsibility elsewhere in the Department in this case and there was laxity by somebody else.  We could put it this way.  It is the duty of the Minister to do as has been done in many Departments, to assign a list of officers, the most senior of whom do the most <Col N="1026" /> responsible work and carry the authority of the Minister's seal as to what they may do, how far they may go and how far they may commit him. Has the Minister such a list in his Department?  Has the Minister attended to this particular duty, which is usually attended to, when there is a change of Government, by the incoming Minister?  The Minister should pay more attention to the administration of his own Department in relation to procedural matters which have quite obviously gone seriously astray.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this was not a Bill to indemnify him.  That kind of smart legal point is not worth anything to anyone.  If the resident medical superintendent of a mental hospital were pilloried in any way in the courts, arising out of the Minister's action, he would have no option but to bear the costs, if the man were at any loss.  I do not think the Minister would hesitate for a moment and, therefore, it is not right or correct in the administrative sense, or in the parliamentary sense, for the Minister to make that kind of smart point across the House. The Minister has a large Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had forgotten that.  I think he gives less attention to the second than he does to the first. In the course of his speech, the Minister referred to &ldquo;the duty of a particular member of the staff&rdquo;.  The Minister must think we are very ignorant of Government departmental procedure. All the duties of officials of these Departments are interlocked.  There is continuous interlocking and responsibility amongst officials in Departments, and quite rightly so.  Otherwise, how could matters be attended to between principal officers, assistant principal officers and superintending officers, down to the messenger who carries the files around?  It is not a reasonable proposition to put to this House that it is the particular responsibility of &ldquo;an&rdquo; officer to do any particular thing.  It will not wash; it will not pass muster.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1027" /> There is one final point to which reference has already been made.  It is quite improper for a Minister to come into Parliament and blame a person who cannot reply.  That is contrary to the whole system of Governmental responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not only is the Minister responsible but there is joint responsibility on every member of the Government for every act done by a Minister.  That is the system of democratic parliamentary government. There is no getting away from it: it is a completely new introduction, so far as I know, for a Minister to come to the House and not say in the ordinary way: &ldquo;Unfortunately, this has happened and I know it is my responsibility. I am asking the House to help me out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Judging by the reports today of his speech in the House last night, the Minister uttered no word of thanks to the members of the Dáil for taking him out of what is a grave dilemma. I hope when he is concluding on the Bill today&mdash;as has been promised&mdash;he will at least alter that approach and utter a word of thanks to both Houses.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate because I thought the Bill would be accepted by the House without some members having recourse to what I would describe as very extraneous matters which are really not relevant to the Bill.  Listening to Senator O'Donovan, in his defence of this constitutional principle known as the collective responsibility of a Government, I was happy to note that certain members on the other side, and their colleagues, have come to realise the importance of that principle.</P>

      <P>Somebody mentioned the Minister for Education. That is unwise.  I remember a Minister for Education in the Coalition <Col N="1031" /> Government who took four long months to answer questions about the punishment of children which had taken place a year before and which had been on his Departmental files for over 18 months.  Nobody on the then Opposition thought there was anything funny about that delay.</P>
      <P>The Minister is behaving with great expedition in a situation which he not merely regrets but says is deplorable and should never have happened.  It is obvious there is no other course open to him.  It is obvious to anybody listening to his presentation of the case or reading the record that he presented it in an entirely frank way, concealing nothing and making quite clear what happened.</P>
      <P>As a Senator, I regret the manner in which this House has been used to attack the Minister when he has been very frank and met the case well.  The only point that merits a rejoinder from him is the question as to how junior was his officer and what were the seniors doing, while he was failing to deal with 280 applications.  The Minister mentioned that very frequently these applications come in for renewal of a period of detention very shortly before the ultimate date.  It seems surprising that so junior an officer could suppress such a large number of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very surprised to hear that some members on the other side of the House expected thanks for dealing with this Bill of Indemnity.  I can remember two Bills of Indemnity.  One was in relation to the appointment of lecturers to University College.  The second related to the posting of literature by a Fine Gael Presidential candidate which he was not entitled to post.  The present Government brought in Bills of Indemnity to set that position right.  I heard no thanks at all but a bitter diatribe by the members of the Opposition who said neither Bill was necessary and then voted for both of them without a word of thanks.  It comes strangely from such speakers to ask for thanks because we pass what is in the interests, not of the Minister, but of <Col N="1032" /> these patients.  This necessary Bill is introduced with expedition and courtesy by the Minister who on this occasion has unfairly been attacked.</P>

He should have apologised for the error, accepted responsibility, asked the House to deal with the legislation and thanked them for dealing with it with such despatch.</P>
      <P>I would remind Senator Ó Ciosáin that if a junior clerk in a solicitor's office made a mistake, the solicitor would have to bear full responsibility and pay the costs, even if the Incorporated Law Society went as far as striking his name off the Roll.  We cannot get away from the responsibility of the Minister to the officers of his Department or of the solicitor to his client.  An endeavour is being made to put a twist on this debate in relation to the responsibility of people in those positions which we will not accept and which the people outside will not accept, either.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the grant of extensions sought would have been virtually automatic had they been dealt with in the course of usual practice, I do not wish to minimise in any way the seriousness of the fact that the necessary ministerial orders have not been made.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Senator wish me to beat my breast, tear out my hair and wear sack cloth and ashes?  In Dáil Éireann yesterday, I spoke with the dignity and seriousness which became the situation in which I was placed.  The fact that this Bill is before the House is an indication that I am in no way endeavouring to derogate from my Ministerial responsibility. I accept that doctrine fully. I have always lived up to it, but the <Col N="1034" /> principle has to be applied with some sense of realism.  If a paperkeeper or some person charged with petty cash embezzles money, is the Minister to be regarded as being personally responsible to the fullest degree for that?  If in a routine such as I have outlined today an unfortunate junior in a Department fails to fulfil his essential function, which was to collect the relevant papers and to submit them to the officer who was empowered to deal with them, is the Minister to be vilified, as I have been vilified in this House, because of the failure of that person who, though essential, was still a very minor element in the Department?</P>
      <P>People must look at these matters in a realistic way.  They must apply to them the same principles as they would like to apply in the conduct of their own affairs or in relation to their conduct as public representatives.  This matter is a grave and serious one, for this reason, that it has placed the responsible officers of mental authorities in a very serious position <i>vis-à-vis</i> their patients and <i>vis-à-vis</i> the relatives of their patients.  It is also grave and serious because there has been an infringement of the Constitution.  But here is the real position: Because I failed, through no personal default of mine, to sign these Ministerial orders, these people were unlawfully detained; but though I did not sign the Ministerial orders at the due time, I did not wilfully fail to sign them.  It was by no inadvertence or neglect on my part that the orders were not signed.  Nevertheless, because the orders were not signed, certain persons who had been detained in mental institutions for treatment were held there for periods without due authorisation of law, but also were held there because their mental condition forbade their discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation with which I am concerned is in the first place that those medical superintendents who have held these persons, having requested in due time that their period of detention might be further extended, should be indemnified against any action which a relative of any one of those patients, or the patient himself <Col N="1035" /> on his release, might bring against them with a view to extracting damages where in fact no damage had been done, so far as the patient was concerned.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not indemnify me. The indemnification is not necessary in my case.  These patients were not held on my order.  If I had made an order in respect of which a patient was wrongfully detained, there being no medical justification for holding him, then there might be some need to seek an indemnity, if I had done that in good faith, within the ordinary course of my Ministerial duty and responsibility.  But not having made an order detaining these people or authorising their detention, I fail to see how any action could lie against me in either my personal or ministerial capacity.  I did not detain the people who were detained.  On the other hand, though they were detained on medical grounds, they were not detained in accordance with law. Therefore, the persons who did detain them have to be indemnified against the consequences of that action.  No patient was detained because of the Minister's failure to make the necessary order.  Patients were detained because it was assumed that the Minister had made an order, assumed in good faith, and that is why the third paragraph appears in Section 1 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley had a great deal to say about the Minister sheltering behind some person.  He and Senator L'Estrange who followed in the same tone accused me of being cowardly and sheltering behind some junior officer.  That is not true.  I have come here and placed only the full facts before the House.  If I had not done so, I should have been asked as I was, by Senator O'Quigley, for instance, or if not by him, then by Senator L'Estrange, whether I had personally signed the order, as I have been asked today.  It is not my business to answer a question in that matter, because a Minister is still responsible to Dáil Éireann, but for Senator O'Quigley's information, since I was asked the question, I do sign <Col N="1036" /> these orders.  I sign them when they have been properly presented to me with a certificate in these terms: &ldquo;I certify that in each of the cases mentioned the application has been signed by the person in charge of the approved institution for an extension of the period of detention and that application has been accompanied by a certificate signed by the chief medical officer that, in his opinion, the patient will not have recovered on the expiration of the current period of detention.&rdquo;  If that certificate is not attached to the order I do not sign it.</P>
    <P>I would further have been asked again, as Senator O'Quigley asked me, what is the position of the officer whose duty it was first to procure the file, from the store of confidential files, because these files relating to mental patients do not go into the general register, but are kept apart from other papers and preserved in the strictest confidence.  The duty of that officer was to get the file relating to the patient in respect of whom a request was made, to place the request on that file, and to bring it forthwith to the appropriate medical officer in the Department, that is to say, to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals or the Assistant Inspector who is immediately concerned.  There is no intermediary between the junior officer and the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  There is not any place or need for an intermediary.  The Inspector of Mental Hospitals or the Assistant Inspector has not to consult any administrative or executive officer in the Department as to whether or not, in his opinion, a patient to whom the request relates should be detained.  The Inspector is the qualified person whose duty it is to advise on this question.</P>

      <P>It was in order, first of all, that the House should be in possession of all the facts that I detailed the procedure followed in dealing with these requests.  It was not with a view to bringing in the junior officer but merely to indicate what was quite true, that, because the most elementary step had not been <Col N="1037" /> carried out, the rest of the procedure had broken down.</P>
      <P>I have not been satisfied with that procedure.  I do not know whether my predecessors were or not.  My immediate predecessor mentioned, I think, in the Dáil yesterday that he had never known this would break down.  He had not assumed there was any weakness in it, but, when I was dealing with proposals to amend the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, later, I did say that, in my view, this represented no true safeguard for the patient concerned and that it would be very much better if we placed the full responsibility for detaining these patients immediately and directly upon the resident medical superintendent, with this proviso, that, when the medical inspector visited and inspected a mental hospital, as he is bound to do periodically, he should ask for the register and consider the cases of all those patients who were being detained longer than the initial period and should satisfy himself, so far as he could, that their continued retention was warranted by their condition.  That, as I say, had been decided upon before this case came to light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor, speaking in the Dáil, said he could not recollect any similar situation having occurred.  Of course, when one considers the position of a Minister in relation to a Department, I think we are bound to have regard to this fact&mdash;that the Minister is not the administrator; that he can and must necessarily endeavour to see that his Department is run properly and that if any complaints come to his notice in relation to any officer or action of the Department, he should have it fully investigated, but the Minister is not the manager of the Department.  He is responsible for everything the Department does, or improperly fails to do, naturally, as I am responsible for this.  He must necessarily accept the criticism that may be made in respect of anything the officers of his Department have done or not done in the course of his official duties, but nobody&mdash;at least no rational being&mdash;is going to expect the Minister to go down to his Department <Col N="1038" /> and start checking whether a junior officer has assembled certain papers with due expedition and submitted them to the appropriate officer for further action.</P>
    <P>If a Minister were to do that, I think he would certainly destroy the morale of the Department and certainly make it exceedingly difficult for those immediately responsible to him to administer and conduct the affairs of the Department.  Therefore, in relation to all this question of Ministerial responsibility, we have to look at it in a broad and general way with a degree of common sense which was absent in the speech made by Senator O'Quigley and lamentably absent in the speech made by Senator L'Estrange.</P>

      <P>There is no real analogy between what has happened here in Ireland and what happened in Crichel Down.  In the case of Crichel Down, a person was grievously injured and subjected to serious loss.  Here no person has suffered physically or otherwise because of the fact that the necessary Ministerial orders were not signed by me.</P>
      <P>What has happened is this.  People who should have been retained for treatment in the mental hospitals to which they had been committed or whose continued detention was necessary in their own interests were detained. That is the first thing that happened.  They were detained upon the recommendation of those who had medical charge of them, those in whose care they were.  The only thing about it&mdash;and it is a lamentable thing, I admit&mdash;is that those who kept them there had not the authority of the Minister to do it.  That is far removed from what happened in Crichel Down&mdash;very far removed, indeed, because, as I have said, no person was injured in his person or in his property. In fact, he was kept in the care and custody of those who were best qualified to act as his guardians during this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> I am not using that argument as a complete exculpation, but I am using it in order that some sense of proportion and reality will be brought into this debate.  People will see that the heavens are not going to fall; that nothing really calamitous has happened because the Minister did not make orders.  If the Minister had made the orders, the patients concerned would have continued to be detained.</P>
    <P>He did not make the order.  He has not now power to make the order, but he is asking the Oireachtas to give him power which will ensure that the necessary orders will be deemed to have been and will continue to run and that the patients who, for their own benefit, should be detained in mental hospitals, will continue to be detained there.  It is a long way removed from the occurrence of Crichel Down.  What the Oireachtas does, when it passes this Bill, is to ensure that the orders which should have been made some weeks ago will now be regarded as being in force and it will further provide that no action will lie against those officers in mental hospitals and mental authorities who have detained patients when the Ministerial order authorising them to do so was not in truth in existence.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill considered in Committee.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to subparagraph (iii) in the provisions which follow paragraph (b) that &ldquo;no damages shall be recoverable by or on behalf of the person in respect of his detention during the said period ending on the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  The Minister, in his concluding speech on Second Stage, dealt at some considerable length with his own legal position as Minister for Health in relation to the failure by him to make the orders <Col N="1040" /> required to be made under Section 189 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945. Nobody is going to say that the Minister has committed any sin in this matter; no question of morality arises. This is not an institution concerned with assigning moral blame to Ministers. It is concerned with making laws and indeed both Houses are concerned with seeing that the laws which they make are duly observed in certain respects, in regard to making regulations and things of that order.  The Minister talked again about the junior official.  What we are concerned with is the legal position and legal responsibility of the Minister which Section 1 is seeking to rectify.</P>
      <P>The Minister has talked a great deal of law.  I would like to ask him if he ever heard the saying <i>Qui actus per alios actus per se?</i> I expect the Minister has.  The Minister knows very well that we all realise the Minister cannot do everything and that he must act through his officials.  When he does act through his officials, he acts <i>per se.</i> That is all I am saying.  The Minister in law is responsible for the failure to make orders under Section 189. Then we come to look at Section 1 of the Bill and we are asked by the Minister for Health to say that no damages shall be recoverable by or on behalf of the person in respect merely of his detention.  The Minister talks about the commonsense approach to this. If the Minister is so certain that no damage was done to any of the patients concerned by their illegal detention, what then is the necessity for saying that no damages shall be recoverable by or on behalf of the person in respect of the detention?  If the Minister states emphatically that nobody has suffered any wrong, why go to the trouble of incorporating in this Bill the real indemnity clause that no damages shall be recoverable?  If any person has been detained and feels he has been wrongfully detained and has suffered damage, or anybody who has the care of such a person is in a similar position, then it would be better to leave their constitutional rights to them and their rights under law, in the certain knowledge that if any of these people go to law, they will recover nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> Would it not be far better, and show greater regard for the law and the Constitution, if the Minister were to adopt that and say: &ldquo;If these people feel they have a grievance, we will not, by legislative act, deprive them of the right to have that grievance litigated by the courts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister on the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Bill was rather inclined to suggest that a certain matter which I raised should be left in the Bill in its obscurity, so that the lawyers might be able to make some money out of it.  I want to assure the Minister that when I stand up here and speak, it is with a claim I make to some knowledge of the law and the Constitution, but I have no intention whatever of creating or leaving in any Bills that pass through this House any loophole to benefit lawyers.  That would be grossly dishonest.  I am certain the Minister did not mean to impute any such dishonesty to me.  I have a much better opinion of the Minister than he apparently has of me.  I want to suggest to him that he might agree that the law should take its course in relation to the question of damages, in the confident belief he seems to have.  I am sure if he deletes this, the Dáil will be likewise agreeable to let this matter go through.</P>

      <P>Do I take it that the Senator's point is that subparagraph (iii) should be deleted from the Bill and that the people concerned, namely, the patients or the relatives, would be at liberty to take action for damages?  That would be a very unwise decision on the part of the Minister, if he accepted it.  In a case like this, one would never know what situation would develop.  The people for whose protection and good this Bill has been introduced might think they have a right of action and there might be all sorts of vexatious actions in regard to what they might consider their wrongful detention and thereby involve themselves and their people in unnecessary expense.  The Minister was quite right in making sure that some safeguard like this would be <Col N="1042" /> inserted in the Bill and I would advise him to stick to it.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few observations about mental hospitals as one who has been a member of a mental hospital committee for 30 years and a member of a visiting committee for the same period.  I often had great sympathy for the doctors because of the unreasonableness of people coming along and saying: &ldquo;There is nothing wrong with my son; he should be released&rdquo;.  I have two particular cases in mind and in both cases the doctor refused to yield to any appeals by the committee.  One day, the matter was being carried to such lengths that he said: &ldquo;If you agree to take the patient and sign a document accepting full responsibility, I am prepared to release the patient.&rdquo; In those conditions, the patient was released.  What happened?  About three months later, on a Sunday morning, the poor boy who had been released killed his father.  I saw another case like it and certainly I have great sympathy with the R.M.S. and the assistant R.M.S.  I have very close contact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am familiar with this Bill which the Minister has brought in.  He has brought it in to put it through.  It is quite easy to talk about these people being detained a little longer than usual, but it might be no harm if they were detained a little longer.  I know the citizen has the right not to be deprived of his liberty, and I firmly believe it is the ambition of every doctor, every staff, and everyone else to hasten the date of the restoration to full health of these people.  I believe they should not be released until they have reached the stage where they can be regarded as fully cured.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been noticeably silent on Committee Stage.  I want to ask him this question in all seriousness: If someone were unlawfully detained and had a genuine grievance for having been wrongly detained for six, eight or ten weeks longer than he should have been detained, has the Minister authority to make some kind of <i>ex gratia</i> payment to such person?  If a person were unlawfully detained&mdash; and it is only now that this will come to the notice of members of the public &mdash;the Minister should provide himself with some authority to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to compensate him. If the Minister has not authority under this section, he might consider getting it under the new Mental Treatment Bill which is now before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not appreciate the point Senator O'Quigley has made. I am not a lawyer, so perhaps I cannot do so.  I know that when Senator O'Quigley was reading sub-paragraph (iii) of the section, he read it this way:</P>
      <P>no damages shall be recoverable by or on behalf of the person in respect of his detention during the said period ending on the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>That is not what the Bill says.  The Bill says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>no damages shall be recoverable <Col N="1044" /> by or on behalf of the person in respect merely of his detention during the said period ending on the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>I cannot conceive of a person being unlawfully detained, having regard to the fact that the Inspector of Mental Hospitals has exhaustively considered every one of these cases, and has come to the conclusion that if the request had come to him in due course, he would have recommended that the Ministerial order be made.  In those circumstances, I cannot see how any action would lie with a person for being unlawfully detained, having regard to the fact that a limited number of persons are covered, 280 in all, in respect of whom the orders would have been made.  In those circumstances, I cannot see how any exceptional case would arise in which the person would be entitled to recover damages.</P>
    <P>A person is detained in a mental hospital because he has been committed there, in the first instance.  He is detained there at the request of the resident medical superintendent of the hospital who is familiar with his case and considers he should have further treatment.  How could it be determined whether he was unlawfully detained?  Can we expect the R.M.S. to say that when he requested that a Ministerial order should be made, he was not genuinely of the opinion that it was necessary to detain the person for a further period, not exceeding six months?  If so, then, of course, the R.M.S. would have to give evidence in an action against himself, supporting the plaintiff in the matter.  I cannot see how we could expect that type of situation to arise. Therefore, I do not think it necessary to give such an undertaking as Senator O'Quigley requested me to give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to belabour this situation unduly, but according to to-day's <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash;and I think the Minister said it here &mdash;of the 280 patients concerned in this Bill, 53 have been discharged in the normal course since.  Up to the time they were discharged, certainly they, as well as the others, were being unlawfully <Col N="1045" /> detained in a mental institution. It may well be that some of the 53 who we now know have been released were kept for longer than they ought to have been kept, and kept without lawful authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There was, presumably, a good deal of correspondence between the Departments, the local authorities, the resident medical superintendents and the interests concerned, and it may well be&mdash;I do not know: that is why I am asking the Minister to take powers in this or some other Bill&mdash;that someone was detained unlawfully.  We are legislating here and we should legislate properly and in fairness to these people.  If some of these 53 people were detained a month longer than they ought to have been, they would have a very legitimate grievance.  We talk about a month's imprisonment, but a month's imprisonment is nothing compared with a month's unnecessary detention in a mental institution while you are sane.</P>
      <P>As I say, they might have a genuine grievance.  I know the Minister will not expose the resident medical superintendent to legal action, and if he is satisfied, I am quite prepared to leave it, but if, because of this whole departure from the normal procedure, some of these people were detained for a longer period than they should have been, the Minister should have power to make some monetary compensation for the undue period of detention.</P>

      <P>no damages shall be recoverable by or on behalf of the person in respect merely of his detention during the said period ending on the passing of this Act.</P>

      <P>First of all, the Senator has misinformed himself about the fundamental position.  Not one of those responsible for detaining the 280 knew they were wrongfully detaining them.  Senator O'Quigley assumed, and based his speech on the assumption, that some of these resident medical superintendents knew they were detaining people without due authority under the law.  Not one of them knew that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be no answer to an action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.  That is why I have the indemnity here.  There may be some people who were not in fact detained in good faith.  If it should transpire that there were some who were in that position, then I should here and now guarantee to compensate them for the fact that they were unlawfully detained&mdash;that is what the Senator has been arguing. He has not been arguing on the basis that people detained in good faith should be compensated.  He said people who were &ldquo;wrongfully detained.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Secondly, Senator O'Quigley assumed that some of those 53 persons who were discharged since the last properly-authorised period of detention of six months had ended may have been detained longer than was medically necessary by reason of the fact that a Ministerial order was not made.  I think I am not incorrect in saying that was one of the assumptions the Senator made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, there is no reason whatever to believe that any of them were in such a condition that their medical advisers would have felt justified in discharging them from the mental hospital any sooner than they were <Col N="1047" /> discharged.  Accordingly, the assumptions on which the Deputy has based his suggestion that we should delete the subparagraph do not exist.  I cannot see any good reason for allowing people to initiate legal proceedings in which they cannot hope to succeed.</P>
    <P>That is what would happen if we had not this clear barrier.  People would say to themselves: &ldquo;The Minister told the Oireachtas I was wrongfully detained when I was kept in that hospital without due authority.  I was detained there by the county manager&rdquo;&mdash;in the case of a health authority&mdash;&ldquo;or by the medical superintendent.  I have a fine cause of action against these officers.  I will go to a solicitor and take legal advice.  It does not matter how I am advised&mdash;I shall take the action because I think I am on a good wicket.&rdquo;  On the facts as we know them here, that unfortunate person could not succeed in his action but it would cost him quite a substantial amount of money.  It would be quite wrong to give any encouragement to a person to initiate what Senator Ó Ciosáin referred to as vexatious proceedings when he had not a hope of succeeding.</P>
    <P>But there is another side to it.  Think of the psychiatrists or the county managers who acted in good faith.  Are we to subject them to the danger of having proceedings of this sort launched against them?  Must we not have concern for all these people who acted in good faith?  They would, first, have great difficulty with their authorities.  They would have all the worry and anxiety of having to appear in court to defend themselves when in fact they were not culpable in any way because they could not know the true position.  Anything they did in this matter they did in ignorance of the facts.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would be quite wrong that we should place these people, acting in good faith, in the situation in which they would have to defend themselves against proceedings taken for wrongful detention.  It is for that reason that we have this special provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> Senator Sheehy Skeffington raised a point to which I shall refer now rather than on the final stage.  He asked what action would be taken in relation to the officers of higher grade than this junior officers who ought to have seen he was discharging the duties entrusted to him.  At the moment, the whole matter is under investigation. Naturally, that is one aspect of the affair to which consideration will have to be given.</P>

      <P>I am glad to see that in these matters which are <i>sub judice</i> the Minister has revised his views since 25th February.</P>

      <P>The Minister is getting all Stages of the Bill today. Everybody realises the urgency of the situation.  I am quite well aware that this Bill was drafted in great haste. Works of this kind, done in haste, are not liable to be free from all the imperfections from which they would be free, if they were drafted at greater leisure.</P>
      <P>Secondly, despite what the Minister says about my conception of the 53 people, I think that a situation could arise in which we ought not to deprive people of the benefit of the circumstances in which they have been wrongfully detained.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, as I understand the position from the daily papers, this junior officer wrote to the mental institution concerned in all but two cases&mdash; though I think that must be a mis-print&mdash;giving notification that the Minister had approved of the proposed extensions.  It seems to me that there was an apparent authority given to some of the county managers, the medical superintendents and people in charge of mental institutions, and they may have acted upon that and detained people on the basis of that spurious authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> The Minister says that of course no county manager or person in charge of a mental institution had any knowledge of this and that this is the first time they understood that these people were being wrongfully detained, and that, in view of that, no action could lie against the county managers or the heads of institutions.  The Minister must know that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  A new principle has been adopted in this Bill whereby, when a public institution makes a mistake, the citizen who has suffered in consequence is deprived of his right to go to court.  There are echoes of the Sinn Fein Funds Act in this section. The Sinn Fein Funds Act set out to deprive people of a legal right which they enjoyed to have a determination as to who owned certain property litigated in the courts.  This is quite in line with that lack of respect for the Constitution which characterised the Sinn Fein Funds Act and others.  The Minister may say what he likes about lawyers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister for Health may say what he likes about these things <i>sotto voce</i> or in public, but the plain fact is that the Minister is putting in this section to deprive people of the right to take any action, and, in doing so, he is depriving them of the ordinary right they have to go to court to claim that the local authority, the Minister for Health or the head of some private mental institution has wrongfully detained them and to recover damages.  That is what he is doing.  He is abridging the rights of up to 280 people.  For that reason, I strongly oppose that part of the Bill.</P>

He seems to lean very much on the side of the patients and their relatives and their legal rights, and no doubt it <Col N="1050" /> would be a serious thing to deprive them of their legal rights, if in fact those legal rights represented anything or they were being deprived of something they were entitled to.  The Senator, however, should also realise that there are other people involved in this matter.  They are the officers of the local authority who, in all good faith, did what they considered to be their duty.  These are innocent people and it is our duty to safeguard them. The Senator was very careful in his argument not to tell us against whom this alleged action would lie.  Would it lie against the R.M.S. or the county manager?</P>

      <P>The situation seems to me to be abundantly clear.  All these cases are cases of patients for whom the medical authorities have recommended that they should be detained longer than was allowed in the first order, and the Minister made it clear that had the normal procedure been gone through in every case, his Department would have recommended the extension of the time.  This Bill puts the matter right because some of them were in accordance with a fully-qualified request held without in fact a full order having been given.  In these circumstances, it could not be held that they were wrongfully detained, and therefore how could they claim that they were wrongfully detained because a particular legal form was not gone into?  This was merely a formality which was not gone into in each case, and the Minister assures us that his experts in the Department would in every case have fulfilled it.  Therefore, it is quite clear that no action could lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made a good point when he says that it might be made to <Col N="1051" /> appear to an ex-patient who would not fully understand the facts by an unscrupulous lawyer, for instance, that a case might lie in which fees could be collected but no damages.  Therefore, it is quite right for the Minister to make it absolutely clear that no action for damages could possibly lie.</P>

      <P>It is a question whether the law can be made retrospective. They have been deprived of liberty, and not in accordance with law.  I very much doubt if this law can validate the wrongful detention and in that way abridge their constitutional right.  It does not make any difference to me, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington seems to imply in that kind of side-wind of his, whether lawyers will get fees or anybody will be paid. The Senator wants to see nobody being paid for anything.  I often wonder if he cashes his allowance as a member of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, barristers would not be in it.  If a fundamental right is taken away from people not in accordance with the law, then this House of the Oireachtas should not say: &ldquo;Although we have taken away from you for three months, say, a fundamental right, you are not <Col N="1052" /> entitled to go into court to see whether you are entitled to compensation for the abridgment of that right&rdquo;&mdash;because that is what Section 2 is doing, abridging the right of people to go into court.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is so certain, as he has repeated here today, that no action would lie against anybody, then the thing to do is to delete the section, but he will not do that because he is afraid that vexatious actions will be taken against county managers, medical officers of health and such people.  County managers are sued every day; they are sued for malicious injuries, workmen's compensation and things like that.  If somebody has an action against county council so and so or against Dublin Corporation, he takes it against the county manager, though the county manager knows nothing at all about what is going on and it is all dealt with by the legal department. County managers do not hang around the courts of justice in this country awaiting with bated breath the outcome of actions against them in their office as county managers.</P>
      <P>If that is the only obstacle, as Senator Ó Ciosáin has said, I would have no hesitation for one in saying: &ldquo;By all means, indemnify county managers against all costs, damages or expenses arising out of any proceedings in which they had a part and were completely innocent.&rdquo;  I do not think the Minister should have introduced this section into the Bill&mdash;and I regret it very much &mdash;a section which appears to, and, in my view, does, in fact, minimise first, the constitutional right of personal liberty and, secondly, the right of citizens of this country to take, if so advised, legal action against a public authority.  That is not good law.</P>

      <P>I have not the legal learning of Senator O'Quigley but there is a difference between actions for workmen's compensation against a county manager or a health authority <Col N="1053" /> and an action taken in this case because in this case it would be against the county manager personally, in his personal capacity, or the medical officer or medical superintendent in his personal capacity.  They would be personally liable for any damages or costs which might be given against them.</P>
      <P>On the general principle to which subparagraph 3 seeks to give effect, I would commend these words to Senator O'Quigley: Speaking on the Fifth Stage of the 1953 Mental Treatment Bill, the present Leader of the Fine Gael Opposition in the Dáil said this:</P>
      <P>On the Final Stage, it is clear that the Bill contains adequate indemnity for all parties against whom proceedings might lie in the event of actions for damages being instituted, and in case there should be any <i>lacunae</i> would it not be advisable for the Minister, at this Fifth Stage, to say that it is the clear intention of the Oireachtas that if such <i>lacunae</i> should subsequently transpire he would pass retroactive legislation effectively indemnifying any persons for carrying out what they conceive to be their duty under the Act under the <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings?</P>
      <P>That is from Volume 143, cols. 2484-5. We are taking that advice in this case and following the principle laid down by Deputy James Dillon on that occasion.</P>

    <P>The Seanad is aware that the purpose of the Bill is to regularise the legal position from a current date in regard to the 280 temporary patients whose continued detention in mental institutions was irregular by reason of failure to confirm by Ministerial Order requests for extensions made by the authorities of the institutions in which the patients were under treatment.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that that legal position should be regularised at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>It is no harm, however, to emphasise again that while, legally, the continued detention of these patients was irregular, from the treatment point of view, it was necessary and in the interests of the patients.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Building Agency, Ltd., is a company registered under the Companies Acts, having a nominal capital of £100 divided into 100 shares of £1 each.  The primary objects of the Agency are to facilitate the provision of housing and ancillary services at centres where industrial developments <Col N="1055" /> necessitate the recruitment and housing of personnel whose requirements cannot appropriately be met by local authorities and are not otherwise met by private enterprise.</P>
      <P>The necessity for the Agency has proved itself by the extent of the demand for its services which became apparent following the public announcement of its establishment. When the extent of its operations can more clearly be foreseen, consideration will be given to any necessity which may arise for making more adequate long-term arrangements for the financing of its operations.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the Agency may, apart from the purpose outlined, fulfil other functions for the State, such as the building of houses for Gardaí and other Government officers whose duties make them liable to transfer from one district to another and who sometimes encounter rehousing difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a necessary and a good Order, but, at the same time, it is necessary to point to the fact that housing in general has slowed up.  I speak with particular reference to local authority housing.  Figures given in answer to a question last week in the Dáil show that local authority housing has slowed up.  While, of course, a house lasts 60 years and while it is inevitable as we proceed in the post-war era that the demand for houses will become less, at the same time, in most industrial areas of the country, it is true to say there is still a grave need for local authority houses.</P>
      <P>Therefore, while welcoming this Order, I would wish to see an advance not only in the small things portrayed in it but also in the general local authority housing position for people who are sorely in need of new houses. I would inform the Minister that in the constituency in which I do most of my political work, namely, Louth, there is a grave need and the position in the case of many is pitiful.  Therefore, not only should the Minister press forward these proposals but should also make the same efforts in respect of accelerating his local authority housing drive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion for the establishment of this housing trust.  I listened to the Taoiseach in Red Island last October announcing the Government's intention to take this action, but I am afraid that I read more into what he said than has actually been produced because I am concerned with the problem of the lack of houses for letting for people who are subject to transfer around the country.</P>
      <P>One of the purposes of this new company, as stated by the Minister, is the building of houses for the Garda and other Government personnel subject to transfer.  There are, of course, many other people apart from the Garda and Government personnel who, for one reason or another, have to transfer around the country.  A particular instance&mdash;it is a topical one at the moment&mdash;is the reorganisation of C.I.E. which is in the process of decentralisation.</P>
      <P>They are setting up area managements in the larger centres around the country.  That means that people have to go to such places as Limerick and Galway where they have very little opportunity of renting houses.  The Minister may say that such people should be in a position to build and purchase houses but the major difficulty there is that these people are part of a national service and for the good of the service it is necessary that they should be capable of moving about. They are subject to transfer.  Perhaps the transfer will be on promotion but it is very definitely for the good of the service that people should be able to take promotion and transfer from one centre to another.</P>
      <P>When their only possibility of housing is the building and purchasing of houses, inevitably they are tied to that particular house or centre from then on, unless they take the rather courageous step of trying to sell their houses and go elsewhere and start building and buying a new house.  I should like to stress to the Minister the need for such people.  I do not know whether people in the E.S.B. are similarly affected, but it is desirable to try to provide for the letting of houses to such people at an economic rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> I am not advocating in any way that the housing should be subsidised. Such people as these are not entitled to be housed by the local authority. There is nothing available for renting, except a very old house indeed.  I should have thought that this new housing trust would have gone some way towards filling this gap in our housing programme.  We have concentrated for years upon the building and purchase of houses for the salaried people, but there is still a need for houses for letting to such people. I wonder would the Minister clarify the position somewhat for me and raise my hopes a little and say that this new housing company would, in fact, build and let houses in centres at a economic rent for such people who, in one service or another, are subject to transfer around the country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the last speaker has somewhat misunderstood the intentions of the Agency.  While I should clarify the situation and say it is not the intention of the Agency to build houses for letting, at the same time, there is no reason whatsoever why a company such as C.I.E. or the E.S.B. should not avail of the facilities offered by the Agency in order to provide houses at any particular centre throughout the country and let them as they wish to their personnel in order that they may the more readily transfer, as the Senator indicated.  That is inherent in the policy laid down for this Agency.  These people have been made aware of the position.  Any of those who are similarly placed and who have not as yet been made specially aware, will be quite welcomed by the board of this Agency if they wish to get help in the solution of their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the intention of the Agency to set itself up as the owner of houses for letting throughout the country. That is what I want to make clear. At the same time, if these companies want to be dealt with, it will be a matter for them to make a request to this Agency in order to have these houses built.  That is envisaged and may be done.  If a company such as <Col N="1058" /> C.I.E., the E.S.B., or others wish to participate in the benefits that may accrue from this Agency, then an approach by them to the Agency would be quite welcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan somewhat widened the scope of what we intend to discuss here, and possibly quite properly, but the statement in regard to the slowing up of local authority housing is far removed from the actual business we are discussing.  The matter, having been raised, however, I should like to say to the Senator that if local authority housing has slowed up, it has done so through its own volition or the volition of the local authorities.  It has not slowed up through any lack on the part of my Department or on the part of Government policy.  I should like to reiterate that no housing scheme of any worth sent forward by a local authority is or will be held up by the Department of Local Government for lack of money.  That happened in the past but I am happy to say that my experience has been the reverse.</P>

However, the situation, in reply to Senator Donegan&mdash;and I am not taking this on merely for the sake of politics; I want to make it quite clear lest anybody is misled&mdash;is that there is no question of building schemes from local authorities not being welcome in my Department.  They are being dealt with expenditiously and in fact we go out of our way to try to get them to bring them forward.  During the past six months or thereabouts, two special circular letters were sent out to all housing authorities throughout the country, drawing their attention to the needs that may exist, insisting that they carry out a survey of bad housing conditions in their areas and asking for proposals with the view to liquidating those bad housing conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position at the moment is that the grave need which Senator Donegan said exists in Louth is a need which the local authorities in their capacity as a housing authority can remedy.  I ask Senator Donegan, and the other Senators who are members of these housing authorities, to get after the problem and to try to solve <Col N="1060" /> it once and for all.  So far as the existence of a pitiful state in Louth in relation to houses is concerned, all I can say is that if that state exists, then the sooner the members of the housing authority in Louth get down to business and relieve it, the better I shall like it and the better the Government will like it.</P>
      <P>Again, may I say that the question of the slowing down of local authority housing is not of the making of the Department or the Government? Everything possible we can do is being done.  Everything possible has been done and we shall continue to do everything possible to rejuvenate, if that is necessary, and to continue on with the progress that is being made, so that at long last the overall picture of housing, whether rural, urban or town, will have been brought up to a standard of reasonable, decent living accommodation.  That is something which I desire and which I am sure every member of the Seanad desires as well.</P>
      <P>In so far as the building agency which we are discussing is concerned I appreciate the welcome given to it by the two speakers who spoke.  I feel that this Agency&mdash;and this view is confirmed by further negotiations which have taken place and the interest displayed by various groups&mdash;can do a necessary job.  We hope that in time to come, it will be said to have done the necessary job of providing houses where they were not otherwise being provided.  I want to say here, as I said elsewhere, there is no question that the operations of this Agency will in any way conflict with the efforts of private enterprise.  Private enterprise and local authorities are being asked to do the job and if they cannot meet the needs in any particular place for any particular reason, this Agency will come in and do the job.  There is no conflict between private enterprise and the Agency and I am sure none will arise.</P>

There are quite a number of regulations which are authorised to be made from time to time under various statutes and which are laid on the Table of both Houses, but that is the last members of the Oireachtas know about them.  I think the type of procedure which has been adopted here might be more freely and frequently adopted in relation to other statutes.  The Minister has indicated that we are to have summer time this year three weeks earlier than usual. Those of us who have poetic souls will always welcome the hastening of spring and summer, but I do not know, poetry aside, that there is universal welcome for this.  Very often, one hears complaints from those rearing young families that summer time interferes with the normal sleeping habits of the children.  It is a question <Col N="1062" /> of whether or not it is a good thing to have young children out of bed earlier for an earlier three-weeks period than is normal.  I am told that it interferes to quite a considerable degree with the health of children.  I do not know whether the Minister for Justice has ever made any inquiries into that matter of the effect of Summer Time on young children.</P>
      <P>There is another question which arises and to which I have seen references in the daily papers.  It is that the new Summer Time will not correspond with the opening periods of public houses authorised under the recent Intoxicating Liquor Act. I do not know whether that is so, but if it is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My view would be that if we are to follow Britain in considerations of this kind, to eliminate confusion, there does not seem to be any reason why the hours for the consumption of intoxicating liquor should not also follow the ordinary official Summer Time.  I do not see any reason why that should not be done. It may cause a degree of confusion among the drinking public, particularly in view of the fact that these hours are to be so stringently and rigidly enforced.</P>
      <P>The position may arise in which people will be disputing with the publican that they are entitled to remain on until 11.30 p.m. whereas, in fact, until a later date they must leave at 11 p.m. Perhaps the Minister, who is also in charge of the enforcement of the intoxicating liquor laws, might take advantage of this occasion to inform the drinking public, who form quite a considerable part of the population&mdash; and will form a more considerable part after Easter&mdash;that, in fact, the 11 p.m. hour will apply until whatever the date is.  That might relieve the publicans of a lot of argument, and it would help in the enforcement and observation of the law by the Garda and the members of the drinking public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I see two reasons why Summer Time should be extended and I think there is a very strong case which could be made for European time the whole year round, that is, one hour in advance of Greenwich Mean Time.</P>
      <P>Many years ago, the farmers were the greatest opponents of Summer Time and, being our main industrialists, we listened to them.  I was at an N.F.A. meeting about three weeks ago and I heard the opinion expressed that it would be better to have the hour advanced the whole year round.  The reason given was that, as we know, most farmers are dairy farmers, and the cows could be milked even in the dark of the morning because rural electrification is available in most cases.  By the time the cows were let out, natural light would be available. That would provide an extra hour's work in the evening or, if you like, an hour more for agricultural production for several months of the year.</P>
      <P>There is another point which I have not heard mentioned before and which I think is very important.  Road traffic is very much heavier in the evenings than in the mornings, because most heavy transport is loaded in the morning and is returning to different destinations in the evening.  The extra hour would mean there would be an hour less every day in which lights would require to be used on motor cars and all forms of vehicles, with the result that, for most of the year, there would be an hour of safer driving. When we think of the statistics published today showing the further increase in deaths on the road, and the rise in the number of accidents, we should realise that anything that can be done to obviate the horrors that take place on the roads&mdash;many of them caused by blinding during the dusk and evening time&mdash;should be done.  Full use of natural light should be made and of any device which will make for safety on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume we are allowed to voice our opinions on the length Summer Time ought to be in these islands.  The extension should be provided, if possible, during the whole year round.  I know that someone might shoot me <Col N="1064" /> down by saying you cannot have Summer Time the whole year round because it would not be summer time then.  I think an hour in advance of Greenwich Mean Time would be desirable and would be enthusiastically accepted by the agricultural community. It would also give more natural light for driving during the whole year.</P>

      <P>Senator L'Estrange exudes politics and from that point of view, I suppose I can ignore his remarks.  For good or ill, the position is that we must synchronise our time with that of Great Britain and the Six Counties.  We could ignore it, <Col N="1065" /> if we so desired.  It would be a simple thing to do, but Senators and other individuals with commonsense will very easily realise the confusion that would be likely to cause to ourselves &mdash;not to Great Britain or the Six Counties, but to the people of this State&mdash;if, for some reason of our own, or some reason of Senator L'Estrange's we were to ignore the synchronisation of time.</P>
      <P>We synchronise our time with Great Britain and the Six Counties to suit ourselves, to suit the business public and the State services, and for no other reason.  As I said at the beginning, if we wished to do so, we could ignore it but, using commonsense, we do not.</P>

The later licensing hours are from June to September and were specified in the Bill, which is now an Act, and have no relation, good, bad or indifferent, to the Summer Time period of last year or the Summer Time period set out in this Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Burke's suggestion of having an extra hour all the year round, there is again the question of synchronisation.  If there was a suggestion that that would be useful or desirable, we should have to consider the effects if our opposite numbers were not synchronised with us.  Again, I think we could not extend our time by an hour all the year round without careful inquiry as to how it would affect various classes of people&mdash;an investigation by a commission or something of that kind probably would be necessary.  It should not be done just because we think it might help traffic or for isolated reasons of that kind.  It must be done, if at all, in the first instance and in every instance, mainly in relation to the habits of the people and the commerce of the country, and to some extent the suitability of the <Col N="1066" /> hours between ourselves and our opposite numbers on the other side would arise also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Seanad takes note of the Report and Accounts of Córas Iompair Éireann for the year 1959/60.</P>
      <P>In the course of a debate on a similar motion in Dáil Éireann on 16th February, there was considerable discussion on the decision by C.I.E. to close the branch railways lines in West Clare, West Cork and Waterford-Tramore. I should like to remind the House of the legislation governing the operation of C.I.E. just in order to keep the record straight.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas passed a new Transport Act in 1958.  By this Act, C.I.E. were obliged to conduct the undertaking so as to eliminate losses by 31st March, 1964.  As a means towards reaching solvency, C.I.E. were given authority to terminate any train service, provided the Board is satisfied the operation of the service is uneconomic and is also satisfied there is no prospect of its continued operation becoming economic within a reasonable period.  The statutory responsibility for deciding whether to close any particular service is therefore now vested solely in C.I.E.</P>
      <P>Prior to the passing of the 1958 Act and despite the Exchequer subsidy to the extent of £12 million and the raising of £7 million for guaranteed stock in the period 1949/50 to 1955/56, the C.I.E. undertaking continued to lose money at the rate of £1.6 million a year.  In 1956, the Government appointed a Committee of Inquiry into internal transport, known as the Beddy Committee, to consider the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee, in their report, considered that the railways should be given a limited period of years under <Col N="1067" /> conditions wholly different from those applying up to that time to show whether their continuance would be justified.  The committee recommended a radical pruning of the rail system and envisaged a mileage of 850 compared with the then existing system of 1,918 miles.  It was to give effect with certain modifications, to the findings of the Beddy Committee that the Transport Bill, 1958, was enacted.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the Government did not accept the specific suggestions in the report as to the extent to which the railways would have to be reduced.  It took the view that this was a matter which could be determined only by C.I.E., who alone had the day-to-day responsibility and access to all the relevant facts and who alone, therefore, were able to judge the value of any particular railway service to the community and the prospects of operating it economically. At the time the Bill was going through the Oireachtas, it was accepted on all sides that unless some such powers were given the Board, the already desperate position of public transport was likely to show a further deterioration. Very few people have noted the fact that C.I.E. have not closed services and stations to the extent envisaged in the Beddy Committee Report.</P>
    <P>When the west Cork line is closed, the Board will have closed a total of 420 miles of uneconomic rail lines since the date of the report compared with the closing of almost 1,000 miles suggested by the Beddy Committee. That is the last closing envisaged by the Board during the re-organisation period of five years provided for in the 1958 Act.  The Board say that, from inquiries it has made, the substitute road services already provided are operating satisfactorily and efficiently and operating to the satisfaction of the public.  Complaints have been few and, where justified, additional facilities are being provided.  Indeed, the <i>Clare Champion</i> has already praised the substitute services provided for west Clare.</P>
    <P>The whole character of the 1958 <Col N="1068" /> Act clearly indicated there was to be no bias in favour of a railway, if a bus and road freight service were more suitable to the majority of the people. The Board recently announced its intention of providing improved standards of heating, ventilation and comfort in buses.  Improvement in road freight services are also under consideration. In particular, the Board is providing better terminal facilities and more up to date mechanised equipment at goods depots.  The Board has also announced reductions in the weekly charges for provincial buses, bringing these charges in line with rail charges.</P>
    <P>With regard to charges for freight of livestock from fairs, the Board has decided to operate for its regular patrons a system of through rates at stations beyond the rail heads based on rail station to station rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power has already referred to the effect on the roads in west Cork, west Clare and also to the Waterford-Tramore road by the additional traffic likely to be transferred to those roads as a result of the closing of the branch railway lines.  He has indicated the number of vehicles which will be used for the operation of the substitute C.I.E. services.  With the numbers of vehicles at present using the roads, the entire regular substitute road services in west Clare, west Cork and Waterford-Tramore will require only 27 buses and lorries, with some additional vehicles for peak services&mdash;particularly 40 additional lorries for beet in west Cork and some additional buses for summer excursion traffic between Waterford and Tramore.  These figures compare with a total of 9,500 commercial vehicles and 43,800 other vehicles registered in these counties. Obviously, the additional vehicles for the substitute services can have but a marginal effect on the roads, although additional expenditure will no doubt be required.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently explained that it is the policy of the Government to assist local authorities to maintain the roads in their areas in a state suitable for the traffic using them, and he gave an undertaking to <Col N="1069" /> consider carefully any realistic proposals to bring rates up to that standard.  The Minister has also stated that prior to the C.I.E. decision to close branch railway lines in West Cork, West Clare, and Waterford to Tramore, the Board gave the fullest consideration to the effect of the closing of those branch lines on the possible development of new industries and was satisfied that any new industrial development can be served at least as well by road as it would be by rail.  There is no question whatever of any industry or potential industrial development in those areas being adversely affected by the closure of the lines.</P>
    <P>The public is aware that in two years the losses on C.I.E. total operations have been reduced from over £2 million to £750,00 per annum.  In the year ended 31st March, 1960, nearly £850,000 additional revenue had been secured on a previous grand total of about £17,000,000.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the refusal of the Minister and of C.I.E. to receive deputations in advance of rail closings.  Everyone knows that C.I.E. have full authority to close lines under the direction given them by the Oireachtas, but the Minister informs me that of all the letters and representations received by Ministers and by C.I.E., not one contained a specific offer of additional traffic.  On the other hand, none of the claims that closure of the lines would damage industry or agriculture or otherwise adversely affect the public interest has been substantiated.  Obviously, no uneconomic line would ever close if the Minister or C.I.E. listened to deputations, most of whose members never used the rail services, and that has been the experience up to now.</P>
    <P>The Minister is here and will reply to the debate and deal in detail with all the points that may be raised during the discussion on this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to welcome the opportunity being given to the House to debate the report and accounts of C.I.E.  It is an innovation, and a welcome one, and it should be repeated for C.I.E. and <Col N="1070" /> other semi-State organisations.  Might I also say that the report of C.I.E. has reached the public and the members of the Oireachtas at an appreciably earlier date than was the practice formerly? I could never understand how it was that the report of C.I.E. for the year ending on 31st March could not be published until the following Christmas.  Maybe it was thought that people would not then take too much notice of it.</P>
      <P>This report covers the first full year of working under the Transport Act of 1958.  The most important point is the fact that the net deficit is merely £750,000 compared with nearly £1,500,000 for the previous 12 months. That improved result is, to my mind, due to a combination of benefits and reliefs under the 1958 legislation, and not less to the inspired and confident leadership that has existed in what is termed the new C.I.E.  That leadership has had a dynamic effect on the management and staff of the organisation. I do not think I shall be understood as taking in any way from that leadership by making the point that the staff who have worked and have produced this better result, and the management also, are largely the staff and management who have been operating C.I.E. up to now.  They have shown that under the better conditions given under the 1958 Act and under good leadership, they are capable of producing results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that that is so, because these people were largely made to feel in former years that there was something wrong with them, that they were in some way less efficient and less well able to do their jobs than the staff and management of other semi-State organisations.  I do not think, indeed, that the Minister has helped them too much in that by his series of references to the past losses of C.I.E. and the cost to the Exchequer, because that leaves the impression that there has been some inefficiency, some mismanagement, to account for it.  We all now see that the same management and staff, given a proper chance and a proper basis on which to work and with proper leadership, can produce a very satisfactory result.  I know that they <Col N="1071" /> feel vindicated by the more satisfactory result and are keen further to improve the position.  It may be a bit ironical, however, that most of the people who bore the heat of the day in the bad old days and who were left under the cloud of supposed inefficiency because of the continuing losses of C.I.E. now find themselves regarded as perhaps too old to avail of the expansion which has taken place in public transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the House know that for decades public transport here, as indeed in other countries, has been staggering from one crisis to another. There have been a series of amalgama-tions, a series of contractions, and legislation following legislation.  That has left a legacy to the new C.I.E., the C.I.E. incorporated under the 1958 legislation.  It has left a legacy of depressed conditions and depressed rates as compared with the more modern standard in other semi-State organisations.</P>
    <P>I must say that for some time I have been concerned at the difficulty of trying to redress that situation in a position where C.I.E. never have and never will, I think, appear to have a whole lot of money to play around with and to redress it without impairing the good relations and the team spirit built up over the past 18 months in C.I.E.  C.I.E. has inherited a machinery of negotiation formerly used by the Irish railways as a whole.  It fulfilled its purpose and was so successful that there was only one rail stoppage, I think, but in fact it increasingly appears that that machinery has outlived its usefulness.</P>
    <P>When I learned that the C.I.E. report was to be discussed, I was thinking of suggesting to the Minister that he might look at that question and see if anything could be learned from the arrangements made in other State undertakings, particularly the E.S.B., but I am glad to see that other minds have been working along that direction and we can hope that there will be progress to provide a more up to date and a more satisfactory machinery of negotiations to deal with disputes within C.I.E.  I should hope that that machinery would not alone <Col N="1072" /> be efficient and acceptable to all parties but would get its business done without undue publicity, which, I think, is sometimes harmful to all parties concerned.</P>
    <P>The cost of labour is an important factor in C.I.E. and possibly weighs more heavily on public transport than on any other semi-State organisation here.  More money, a greater proportion of money, is spent on remuneration of staff than in any other undertaking. Maybe it was because of that that the Oireachtas made special provision in passing the 1958 legislation and previous legislation regarding C.I.E. that C.I.E. should have regard to the maintenance of reasonable conditions for their employees.  That is not usual.  I do not remember seeing it in the legislation dealing with any other semi-State organisation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it was a recognition of the economic difficulty of public transport and was meant as a solemn declaration from Parliament that C.I.E. in carrying out their other function of attempting to balance its books as soon as may be should not do so by depressing rates of pay and conditions generally of the employees.  It was unique.  Parliament deliberately said to C.I.E. in Subsection 1 of Section 7 that &ldquo;it shall be the general duty of the Board to provide a reasonable, efficient and economic service, with due regard to safety of operation, the encouragement of national economic development and the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment for its employees&rdquo;.  It goes on in the second subsection of that section to say to the Board that they shall &ldquo;so conduct their undertaking that as soon as may be and not later than 31st March, 1964, its operating expenditure, including all charges properly chargeable to revenue, shall not be greater than the revenue of the Board&rdquo;.  I do not know whether it could be argued that subsection (1) takes precedence over subsection (2).  I do not think so, but it is a fact that in telling C.I.E. that they should balance their books, we are also telling C.I.E. that they should so operate their concern as to have regard to the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> In this regard, and with regard to costs, C.I.E. cannot isolate themselves from outside developments.  I think there might be a tendency by C.I.E. and, indeed, by the Minister, to concentrate on this aim of achieving financial viability as early as possible and perhaps involuntarily to overlook that other direction that Parliament has given, namely, the maintenance of reasonable conditions of employment. If, for example, salaries increase in the E.S.B. or other semi-State organisations, sooner or later that is going to affect the situation of C.I.E.  If the working week generally is reduced in the country, again C.I.E. cannot isolate themselves from that development.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the equity of treating their employees no less favourably than comparable employees in other semi-State organisations, I think it would be false economy to the nation in the long run if there were a conscious effort to continue as a permanent feature a low-pay policy in C.I.E.  The House, I think, well knows that the experience now is that schoolchildren who get as far as finishing their secondary education and doing the Leaving Certificate are at that stage persuaded by their teachers to sit for all examinations offering at that time.  If they are good students and qualify in a number of competitive examinations, naturally they tend to take the employment offering the best pay and the best opportunities.  I do not think anybody could argue that C.I.E. can afford to do without their share of the best brains produced from the schools every year.</P>
    <P>It is all right to talk about past experience.  It is a tradition of the old railwaymen, who are born and bred into the job, but now the situation is, as I said, that young people doing the Leaving Certificate sit for every examination.  They are taking the best jobs according to the places they get.  You cannot indefinitely have a situation that by reason of C.I.E. concentrating upon trying to keep down costs, the younger people taking the higher places will not be disposed to take employment with <Col N="1074" /> public transport.  I think that, with the difficulties of public transport, they more than anybody else need their share of the best brains being produced.</P>
    <P>I want again to refer to this question of the deficit.  It was a deficit, as I said, of £750,000&mdash;an improvement over last year's deficit.  To carry out the direction of the 1958 legislation, C.I.E. need to improve by the amount of that deficit.  In other words, they must improve the financial result of their year's operation by another £750,000 in order to comply with the legislation.  I sometimes wonder can it be done.  Last year, owing to a combination of an increase in revenue and a reduction in operating costs, it was possible to make that substantial improvement.</P>
    <P>I think we would all be foolish to imagine that simply by a big drive a substantial improvement materialises; that you can necessarily by maintaining, improving or increasing that drive, produce a big improvement the following year.  I do not think it is quite as easy as that.  C.I.E. last year improved their traffic and the question now, if they are to wipe out that £750,000 deficit, is to generate more traffic and/ or cut costs further.  To put it a little differently: Can they so operate the concern that to earn a £ they need only spend 20/- and at the same time &mdash;and this is something that cannot be overlooked&mdash;provide a satisfactory service?</P>
    <P>I think that more traffic can, in fact, be secured.  I will later say something as to how I think the Minister could help in that direction.  I think that costs can be further reduced but reduced by improving efficiency and by the introduction of new methods. It must be recognised that the cost per head of employment will tend to increase. Whether C.I.E. or the Minister likes it, that will be the tendency.  I think that, generally speaking, there is not any opposition amongst the trade union movement towards improving efficiency and the introduction of new methods, but there is, I know, strong opposition to any policy of trying to pin down the cost per unit on C.I.E. in order to comply as early as possible <Col N="1075" /> with the direction to balance their books.</P>
    <P>The accounts which we have before us show that some £748,000 had to be allocated out of revenue last year for interest and provision for sinking fund for the various Transport Stocks; in other words, a little more than the actual deficit on the year's operation. I recognise that the 1958 legislation gave substantial relief to public transport in regard to capital and the costs of remunerating capital, but I am concerned as to whether or not we went far enough.</P>
    <P>I am concerned to know if the task given to C.I.E. is just that bit too heavy. I suggest that if it is, it would be less costly to the economy as a whole in the long run if we so arranged things that C.I.E. could with confidence give an efficient service and not be embarrassed with a yearly deficit.  I do not think that we should provide a permanent and a general subsidy for C.I.E., but, on the other hand, I think that we could so arrange things that the task placed on them would not be impossible.</P>
    <P>I notice, for example, that in regard to another aspect of public transport, namely, air transport, we have a situation where Aer Lingus can, with good management and with some confidence, expect that, if the year is good, they will balance their books and will not be embarrassed with continuing heavy deficits.  I also notice that in the Appropriation Accounts for 1959/60, there is a total deficiency met from the Central Fund on the operation of Shannon and Dublin Airports.  In other words, the permanent way or whatever you like to call it, for air transport was subsidised to the extent of £500,000.  I think it was right to do so but it was so arranged that Aer Lingus was not embarrassed by being given an impossible task, by being asked to do something which it could not possibly do.  The target set for Aer Lingus was something they could reasonably aim at.</P>
    <P>I said I would suggest to the Minister that he could help somewhat in the desire of C.I.E. to increase their <Col N="1076" /> traffic and, indeed, the desire of the staff of C.I.E. to get more business.  I suggest that the Minister might take every opportunity of discouraging other semi-State undertakings and local authorities from building up their own transport fleets.  I know the Minister will object to asking that these should be compelled to use public transport, but I am not asking that.  I am talking about the undesirability in the national interest of investing public money in building up transport fleets, when the fleet of public transport, owned and remunerated by public moneys is not fully utilised.  I do not think that is good business and it certainly is not in the overall interests of the economy.</P>
    <P>I know it would certainly be good business, good organisation and good management for semi-State organisations to have some transport of their own, but unfortunately it seems to be the experience that when you start on that road, somebody is appointed in charge of the few vans and lorries and the tendency is for him to build up his own empire.  He can, I am sure, very convincingly show his board that it would be more economic for that semi-State organisation to get more lorries and build up a bigger fleet.  That is largely duplication of the investment in that type of lorry and, I suggest, is not in the best overall interest.  I ask the Minister to avail of any opportunity he has to discourage that tendency and point to the desirability of the public transport organisation being utilised to the utmost.</P>
    <P>Another factor which affects C.I.E. in its drive to improve traffic&mdash;and members of my trade union complain about this&mdash;is the incidence of illegal haulage.  However, it would be too early yet to attempt to say whether the new provisions in the 1958 Act have been effective and have curbed this illegal haulage throughout the country.  I know it is still there, but the provisions in the 1958 Act, the fines and punishments that were put in, have a cumulative effect and it might be too early to attempt to say whether they will meet the position or <Col N="1077" /> whether something else will have to be done.</P>
    <P>There is another and rather new aspect of illegal haulage, that is, illegal passenger operations.  I should like the Minister some time to look at the experience of U.T.A. in Northern Ireland, where you had the position that the road passenger side was, as with C.I.E., the paying end. Year after year, they could expect a surplus on that part of the operation in order to help to carry the overall public transport organisation.  The illegal haulage of passengers, particularly by mini-bus operators has torn the guts out of the road passenger services of U.T.A. in the past few years and I am concerned to see that similar developments do not occur here.</P>
    <P>I know that in a matter like this there are other Departments concerned &mdash;the Department of Local Government and the Department of Justice&mdash; and I ask the Minister to look at the problem some time and see that it is not allowed to get out of hand in this part of the country.  I must confess right away that it is a very difficult problem and I have no easy answer to it.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the House, in moving this motion, referred to the closure of branch lines and the report which we have before us refers to the closure of seven such lines.  I am quite sure, from the little knowledge I have of the position, that those seven closures were warranted on a financial basis and furthermore that a suitable alternative transport was provided.  I feel that the obligation of C.I.E. to become financially self-supporting might, however, in certain cases be inconsistent with their obligation to provide public transport services.  It might be right, as I think it is, for C.I.E. under the legislation to close a branch line or, indeed, all lines eventually, to meet the obligation we have put on them under the 1958 legislation of paying their way, but I am sure that whilst that might be the right thing for C.I.E. to do under their charter, it might not necessarily be the right thing for the country and the economy as a whole. Sooner or later if C.I.E. cannot balance their books under the present arrangement, <Col N="1078" /> and they are under continuing pressure to make economies, and to make them where they can be made, namely, by the closing of railway lines, we could reach the situation that railway lines which are important to the economy and to the national interest might be closed by C.I.E. because we have told C.I.E. to do so.</P>
    <P>I remember we had a fair debate on this subject when the 1958 legislation was going through.  I remember that we pressed the then Minister for Industry and Commerce very hard to write into the Bill that the Minister should be consulted, that somebody apart from C.I.E.&mdash;C.I.E. who would be concerned with their own affairs of balancing their books&mdash;somebody concerned with the national interest and answerable to Parliament should be brought into the picture and should, in the national interest, be able to say: &ldquo;This line should not be closed&rdquo; or &ldquo;You may go ahead and close it&rdquo; and accept responsibility to Parliament for it.</P>
    <P>In spite of the good arguments, and I noticed we converted every Independent Senator in the House that day, the Fianna Fáil vote matched the combined vote of the others and it was a tie vote so that the insertion was not put into the Bill.  Therefore, the Leader of the House should not be too happy here tonight in rubbing it in to us and saying the Seanad and the Dáil gave authority to C.I.E. to close branch lines.  We tried our best to provide that at least the Minister from time to time would have responsibility in the matter and would be answerable to Parliament for any decision to close a branch line.  I know, of course, and I suppose this is the main argument against it, that it would be a political embarrassment and I do not think that we have really yet reached the situation that branch lines which are essential to the economy as a whole&mdash;even though Senators from west Cork might not necessarily agree&mdash;have come to be closed.  I know also that C.I.E. have said that they do not expect within the next five years to have to close further branch lines, except the west Cork line, which will be the last gasp.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House again on <Col N="1079" /> the point I was making earlier on.  The fact is C.I.E. cannot isolate themselves. If costs are increasing on C.I.E. and if they cannot make economies to offset them by improved methods or improved efficiency, then they will be under new pressure to reach financial viability as quickly as possible and to look afresh at branch lines.</P>
    <P>We might come to a situation where a branch line such as the eastern line to Wexford and Rosslare might be contemplated for closure.  I do not know enough about that line to say whether it would be essential to the economy or not, but the point I am making is that in view of the C.I.E. position under the Act, it might be right and proper to close the line.  It might not be right in the over-all national interest that a line like that should be closed.  However, as I said, Parliament has decided, even on a tie vote, and the position is that C.I.E. have that authority and, indeed, are obliged under parts of the Act to proceed to make the necessary economies.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words in conclusion about the buses.  I am speaking simply as an ordinarily fare-paying passenger, not as a Senator with trade union or labour connections.  I wonder whether or not some improvement could be made in the Dublin city services?  I have watched people working on the buses and I have seen the hardship on conductors on double-deck buses, particularly in the rush hours, scrambling up and down stairs, trying to collect the fares, trying to get down to punch the bell, trying to watch the platform and a hundred and one things.</P>
    <P>That is all very interesting and I suppose very good for an active young man, but unfortunately bus conductors, like the rest of us, tend to grow old.  I think the hardship of that job must really affect them when they get into the fifties.  I notice that, on the continent, the practice seems to be that they go in for long single-deck buses to provide city services and, which may seem strange to us, the conductor sits down by the door and takes the fares as the passengers enter.  I do not think the passengers think that is any particular hardship on them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> If C.I.E. were to contemplate&mdash;and I am sure they would not look too kindly on this idea&mdash;changing their arrangements, even in a gradual process, they would be involved in p.s.v. regulations, but that is something which, I think, could be got over if it were thought that it was a good and proper arrangement.  The idea might be considered because increasingly bus conductors will be growing old and unable to carry on their jobs for medical reasons, because of the hardship of running up and down stairs a hundred and one times a day.</P>
    <P>I know that already there is the problem, and there will be a further problem when we pass the Road Traffic Bill, of the medical fitness test for bus drivers.  Again, those people, like ourselves, grow old and so far as I can discover, there are not proper arrangements to provide them with reasonable alternative work.  If some arrangement could be made by which some buses were so designed that the conductor could sit and take the fares from the passengers as they entered, it would help the people when they grow old who might otherwise be unable to continue in their work.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be beyond the wit of our designers to produce double-deck buses&mdash;not necessarily long single buses&mdash;with an entrance at the rear, a pretty wide platform, probably, and an exit in the front.  It would mean that instead of one door, there would be two and instead of one stairs, there would be two.  I remember, in the old trams, there were two stairs, one which led down by the driver which you were not supposed to use.  If we had buses with these two stairs and two power-operated doors, the bus conductor would be able to take the fares as people entered and would not have to be dashing around picking up the few pence.  As I said, I am making this suggestion as a fare-paying passenger.  More than C.I.E. would be involved in it.  The Minister and the people dealing with p.s.v. regulations would be involved, but it might be worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I should like to express the hope that next year we shall have the opportunity of discussing again the <Col N="1081" /> annual report and accounts of C.I.E. I hope also that we shall be able to point to a satisfactory improvement as has been achieved for the year ending 31st March, 1960.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot view C.I.E. as an ordinary semi-State company. We must view it as a company with closer ties with the Government than any other semi-State company, in their finances and in every way. The company employ&mdash;to give the House some idea of their strength and influence&mdash;seven times as many employees as Arthur Guinness, Son and Company Limited.  The number of C.I.E. employees is around 20,000, spread all over Ireland in every constituency. That means, of course, that the employees of C.I.E. must wield considerable influence, and that all the machinations of C.I.E., all their ups and downs, react one way or the other for or against the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government are also responsible for the entire financing of C.I.E. They have borne the brunt of their losses, producing fresh capital year by year, some of which has been written off in the past four years.  Therefore, we must view these accounts, not as an ordinary set of accounts, but as a set of accounts which have a closer relation to Government policy and action than any other set of accounts which come to us from any other semi-State company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an improvement in the situation which we are viewing but it is best to look at this improvement, in the first instance, from the material point of view.  How was the improvement effected?  So far as I can gather from the figures, the number of staff who have been rendered redundant, due to improvements or changes that have been made since last year, is 1,188.  The modernisation of C.I.E., the closing of branch lines considered uneconomic and the various other changes have resulted in the necessity for an injection of £3 million capital from the last C.I.E. loan.  The lines which have been closed are Cavan-Leitrim, Dundalk-Clones, Monaghan-Cavan, Inny Junction-Cavan, Headford Junction-Kenmare, Claremorris-Ballinrobe <Col N="1082" /> and Farranfore-Valentia.  There is no doubt that at least some of these closures were necessary.  Perhaps some were ill-advised.  There were votes here and, as stated by Senator Murphy, one got through by the skin of its teeth, although opinion has been divided on the wisdom of voters on that occasion or any occasion.</P>
    <P>When you talk about closing a railway line&mdash;again this set of accounts is only a small part of the story&mdash;you must think of heavy traffic formerly carried on the line it is proposed to close which must move on the roads. Irish country roads as distinct from main roads&mdash;some of which are not up to heavy traffic&mdash;are definitely not up to the large and heavy traffic which has resulted from the closing of a line.</P>
    <P>On my way here to-day I met a cattle lorry and trailer which must be all of 70 feet long and which could not physically operate without taking the complete crown of the road.  I could not see how that trailer with cattle in it and the lorry itself with cattle in it could operate by staying on its own side of the road on the particular occasion to which I refer. The driver would constantly be pulled into the verge.  He made the dangerous turn on the crown of the road.  It was not his fault.  He had blown his horn and so had I.  We both moved over.</P>
    <P>That will give a picture of the difficulties and the colossal capital investment there will have to be in the roads.  We are not looking at a complete picture but at a most incomplete picture and one which, in argument, can be distorted and changed. It is quite difficult for anybody except the most unbiased observer to approach this set of accounts without making some error of judgment in their interpretation.</P>
    <P>As well as the closing of the branch lines and disposing of 1,188 staff members, as far as my memory and my information serve me, the improvement was effected by increases in freight charges and in bus and train fares.  Another matter I must discuss later is the increase as a result of <Col N="1083" /> Government policy in stringency of administration of the Transport Acts and the Transport Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>Another factor was that during the year there was written off&mdash;I refer Senators to the Report ending 31st March, 1960, the last paragraph on page 7 &mdash; a charge of interest and repayment on the 3 per cent. transport stock of 1955-60 of £296,672.  As I understand it, in this paragraph credit it taken for the fact that an additional charge of £146,250 was introduced representing the interest and sinking fund contribution on the new transport stock.  But the new transport stock produced an injection of £3 million into C.I.E. economy.  Just as every company and business has to repay its borrowing and provide for interest thereon, so with C.I.E.  Therefore, while in no way deprecating anybody I would say that the conclusion drawn in that paragraph is incorrect inasmuch as if you get £3 million you must be prepared to pay it.  In fact, the figure presented to us is not true and is worsened by £296,000 written off.  Most unfortunately, it is I think the fourth or fifth writing off of repayment and interest charges during the past four years.  That is not meant to be unfair to C.I.E.  I have the greatest regard for the efforts being made.  One should always be constructively critical where one thinks it might help.  I propose to be such.</P>
    <P>I shall now refer to something which has a strict application to this account and the figures produced to us.  It is the change in the Government interpretation of an Act.  In ordinary business it is unusual that Government policy will change the interpretation of an Act of Parliament.  Indeed, things proceed as they were, more or less.  In a company like C.I.E., where the Government are financing losses, there is a grave danger the Government will seek to change their interpretation of an Act and the administration of the law.  I fear that has been done and I must make mention of it. I refer to Transport Acts.</P>
    <P>Young policemen who showed exceptional ability as they came forth from the passing-out ceremony were <Col N="1084" /> sent to a series of lectures in Dublin for specialist information on how even technical offences could be detected under the Transport Acts.  These young policemen have been spread in different towns all over the country.  Fleets of Vauxhall Wyvern cars were supplied. Every Senator must have seen a young policeman in such a car in the course of the past twelve months. Their job was to stop private hauliers and private firms' carriers and seek a conviction under what was usually a technical offence that never happened before.  It is no good saying that the law was there.  The interpretation and administration of the law had largely been liberal.  A change was effected.  It affected young men who had their lives to live and their bread to eat just as the employees of C.I.E.  I have the greatest sympathy for the 1,188 employees who are no longer there.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that there was considerable interference with private business.  I know that a lorry came to a town and was held for three hours by the Garda Síochána who sought information of all kinds from driver and helper.  That is going too far.  It is obvious an ordinary sort of conviction is not being sought and that strong Government policy is behind such action.  I have the strongest views in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a mistake, as stated by Senator Murphy, to say there is not a necessity for fleets of lorries in other semi-State companies. There is every necessity for an adequate fleet in every business in this country which needs a considerable quantity of transport.  The reason is that the driver and helper who are constantly doing the firm's work know the job and the pitfalls and the difficulties. Even in the proper filling-up of the lorry-man's sheet which, I presume, goes in every day in every organised business, he can succeed in keeping the office out of trouble.  You cannot get just anybody and put him on a job of work in a detailed sort of business and expect him to do it as well as somebody who has been doing that very job for the past ten or twenty <Col N="1085" /> years.  One might think of a package deal so that the same men in C.I.E. might be doing the same work for the same firm all the time.  In fact, it does not work out that way.</P>
      <P>I feel there is necessity for an adequate fleet in every private business, and the problem is to see how we can have C.I.E. with a fleet to look after the business that is not handled by those private firms and, at the same time, seek to reduce our loss.  That is the difficulty, and the way to solve this difficulty is not by interfering with private business.  Such interference, I fear, there has been.</P>
      <P>I was confirmed in my opinion that the implementation of the law has a direct relation to Government policy when Senator Murphy said to the Minister that this question of minibuses engaged in illegal passenger haulage is very serious and urged the Minister to get going; but he did not urge the Guards to get going.  Therefore, I fear that when you see all the best young policemen in every town in Ireland in new Vauxhall cars looking after one particular facet of legislation, while more serious offences are perhaps left unattended to, there is a grave situation, and one in which the Government is perhaps weighing the scales too much on one side to the detriment of other parts of legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I most certainly do say that there has been a change in the administration and interpretation of the law over the past four years, and everybody in this Seanad knows it quite well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other points which should be discussed in these accounts.  I note that the mileage covered by the old G.N.R. has been included as this is the first full year of operation under C.I.E.  That is natural, but the difficulties that arose in Dundalk because of the loss by the railway works there of a lot of work that came to it from the north of Ireland are very much with us.  We are extremely sorry about the situation there.  Again, of course, there is completely excluded from these accounts the fact that £1,500,000 have <Col N="1086" /> been injected as capital and six separate companies have been floated; yet at the same time, it is all part of the railway trouble.</P>
    <P>I would not criticise for one second the action of the Government in putting in the capital, nor would I criticise their efforts.  It is most unfortunate that in the manufacture of Heinkel cars, they struck a situation where, over two years, all the other small cars came on the market which largely out-dated the Heinkel, and at the same time, there were these crises in the motor trade which did not help.</P>
    <P>The Minister can be assured from a politician opposed to him from that area that whatever way I can help to assist the Government in their efforts with those six companies, I will help, and my only worry in that regard is the fact that the information conveyed to us by the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week is sad and sorry news, because the figure he has given is roughly 500 people left, where there were 1,000, and that may be further reduced by the fact that about 150 of those were not there when the railway works were closed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Except for the fact that £1,500,000 of Government money are there.  My view is that what we want is not too stringent an approach to the further closing of lines.  The Government have gone half-way, as the Minister has said, to meeting the report that suggested the closing of 1,000 miles of line.  I feel that the cost of roads must be viewed at Cabinet level, and the Minister must take account of the cost of bringing the roads up to the standard to enable them to take these heavy lorries without damage to the community and the road users.  The Minister may be heading into very deep financial water if he goes any further, and I would urge him not to close any further branch lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have failed to find a break-down of the capital expenditure on the rail and road services of C.I.E.  The accounts have been produced in a rather ingenious, rather modern way, <Col N="1087" /> but they are not quite as explicit as the old fashioned balance sheet, broken down into profit and loss accounts and so on.  I have not succeeded in getting information as to what share of the capital expenditure is represented by roads and what is represented by rail. No new diesel locomotives were bought during the year.  I cannot have any opinion on that, because, when you buy a diesel locomotive, it is a large purchase, so we do not know what are the plans of the Government in that regard, unless the Minister has news for us.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to remember that there are other bodies besides C.I.E., and another thing I should mention is that the deliberate tendering at uneconomic rates for work should be discontinued.  That is a practice of which I have some evidence, and I am quite aware that on occasions there has been tendering which was deliberately uneconomic, the purpose of the tender being to get the work and, having got it, to hold it in following years, because if they got it in one year, presumably the fleet that was there to do it would have been dispersed before the following year.  That is rather like the rich man showing a loss deliberately for two years to squeeze out his competitor.  When you have a Government behind you and when it is either a million pounds or three million pounds next year that is wanted &mdash; the figure is just a paper figure in a book &mdash; a loan will be floated on very generous terms and it will fill. It is quite against our democratic institutions here to quote at uneconomic rates for individual loads.  I do not want to give individual instances.  If the Minister wants them, he can get them privately from me.</P>
    <P>I wish C.I.E. well, but I would say that none of the operations that tend to expand C.I.E. will help to any degree.  If we could get a normal natural flow of fleets of privatelyowned vehicles, with C.I.E. providing the ordinary services without seeking to expand, it might be the best situation.</P>
    <P>On buses, I would say that my <Col N="1088" /> colleague, Senator Murphy, is mistaken in his interpretation on what happens on the continent.  The position on the continent is that the conductor sits or stands at the back and nobody hopes to guarantee himself a seat on the bus. The bus is crowded with people all standing, and there are fewer buses on the streets.  That is quite true in Italy and in France, and my view is that over the years that situation may develop here, too.  I do not think we are ever going to be rich enough to move back buildings to give the true flow of traffic at the pace we would like.</P>
    <P>I think that the difficult answer may be more people on the buses and less comfort.  That is a rather revolutionary thought in this country but it is what happens.  I was often quite annoyed by the fact that some continentals did not give up their seats to old people or to ladies, but nevertheless that was the picture: fewer buses with more people on them.  That will happen here and when it does, it will mean more traffic moving through Dublin city and less comfort in the buses.  That is all I have to say about the accounts, except that I hope that next year we will see fuller production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get this opportunity of discussing proposals of C.I.E. and I must say, coming from the area I come from, that speaking of C.I.E. is like showing a red rag to a bull to the people down there.  An announcement was made some few months ago that the people of west Cork, an area as large as two counties here, say, Longford and Leitrim or Carlow and Louth, are to be completely abandoned by C.I.E. because, they state, they lost £56,000 last year.  That is the reason they give for abandoning 100,000 people who will be expected to contribute their portion of this £750,000 which C.I.E. have lost this year and who will have to contribute as well to any future losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mind you, we do not think of this line as a branch line.  The people there have been a unit to themselves &mdash; over 110 miles of railroad extending throughout the whole southern <Col N="1089" /> seaboard and serving a large area and over 100,000 people.  Since that announcement was made, the people of west Cork and their public representatives have made every effort to meet the chairman of C.I.E., the Minister for Transport and Power and the Taoiseach to discuss with them ways and means of keeping this line open and there is no doubt that, with proper organisation and proper services, this deficit, which I maintain is grossly exaggerated, could be wiped out.</P>

    <P>I shall take one item of goods carried in west Cork.  If they had the complete haulage of the beet crop of west Cork &mdash; we are taking beet alone now &mdash; it would wipe out this deficit of £56,000 which we are led to believe arose last year.  It has been stated by the Minister in the Dáil that, in 1959-60, the total beet crop in west Cork was in the region of 83,000 tons.  It was stated that 41,000 tons of this beet went by rail and the other 40,000 tons by road.  I can assure the Minister and the Chairman of C.I.E., as a member of Mallow beet board, that for many years back, since 1955, we have a path made to the office of the traffic manager in Glanmire trying to get him to give us some facilities to help people <Col N="1090" /> loading their beet at the station.  It took C.I.E. five years to bring a light from the passenger side of Glanmire station to the goods side.  Prior to that, the people were expected to load beet in frost and snow, in rain and cold in the dark or with the help of some few lanterns provided that often went out as soon as they were lighted.</P>
    <P>That is the service they gave the people of west Cork.  We wanted them to improve loading conditions so that beet could be loaded with less effort than at that time when people had to throw it three or four feet up into the wagons.  Nobody considered these hardworking people who, after doing a day's work &mdash; and they did not get overtime &mdash; came in after dark to load beet in these conditions.  Now they say that the people of west Cork did not give them their business.  Why should they?  Surely to goodness, C.I.E. should be expected to provide at least a decent service for the people.  That tonnage which increased probably last year and will be increased in the future could wipe out that deficit completely. Every ton of beet going from Clonakilty is carrying a subsidy of 18/6d or 18/9d a ton.  This increase in one item alone would wipe out the debt if C.I.E. provided any sort of facilities for the people.</P>
    <P>Now what will happen?  This beet will have to go by road.  You can say 43,000 tons or 50,000 tons of beet, plus what was sent by rail last year. Nearly 100,000 tons of beet will be put on the roads of west Cork and we are very well aware, and many Senators who have travelled those roads are aware, of the many corners, turns, railway bridges and the narrow streets of Clonakilty, Bandon and Cork city where all this beet will have to travel to reach Mallow.  They also know the condition of the roads there is such that heavy traffic will completely burst them up.  I have here before me &mdash; the Minister has already seen it &mdash; a document prepared by the county engineer in Cork, who, after giving serious consideration to the matter, in consultation with all his assistant county engineers, decided that the cost of improving the roads <Col N="1091" /> would be considerably greater than the loss supposed to be sustained by C.I.E. during the past year.</P>
    <P>One thing that is not taken into account, even by the county engineer, is the number of railway bridges over the road.  If you are going to have a free flow of road traffic, every one of these bridges will have to be removed. The cost of doing that will be greater than the loss sustained by C.I.E. in one year.</P>
    <P>The peculiar thing about this loss was that last year, for the first time in many years, C.I.E. carried out a decoration scheme in the railway stations and on their houses in West Cork. They introduced the grandest painting scheme I ever saw.  It would do one's heart good to look at it.  If Leinster House had a coat of the paint, it would make it look a lot more attractive.  It was not very good business, knowing that they were going to abandon a certain area, to paint every bridge and house.  As one painter said to me: &ldquo;We put it everywhere except on the grass.&rdquo;  There were tons of it knocking about.  Was it to cause this deficit that all this paint was used? Was it to create a deficit that a couple of miles of new tracks were put in to be ripped up the year after and used, perhaps, in the Congo or elsewhere next year?  I can assure the Minister that if C.I.E., even at this late hour, came down to hard facts and looked after their transport system there and got one item alone, the beet on the rail to Mallow, the line would pay for itself next year.</P>
    <P>Let me now come to the question of the tourist industry.  I hope this line will not be taken up.  I hope that even at this late hour C.I.E. will see reason and give it a chance for another few years and examine the business. I can assure them they will get the co-operation of the people if they do that.</P>
    <P>I travelled by rail from Dublin some time last year.  In the carriage with me was a family coming on holidays from Coventry.  In conversation with them before we arrived in Cork, they asked if they could catch the west <Col N="1092" /> Cork train.  I said they could, although the time between the arrival of the Dublin train and the departure of the west Cork train was so small that it did not give much time to anybody to catch it.  I could see how alarmed they were at the prospect of having to incur the further expense of getting a car.  I could see that this family would have stayed in Cork city and never moved to west Cork, if it were not for the train.  I took them over and had time to load their luggage so that they could get to Bantry.</P>
    <P>The loss of the railway train to a man with a family &mdash; this gentleman was accompanied by his wife and four or five children &mdash; would have been a serious matter.  One can see the considerable expense it would put them to, had they to get private transport to bring them somewhere.  They certainly would not have gone down to west Cork.  We can see by that the harm it will do the tourist industry. It will mean the loss of the tourist trade to west Cork where the people are doing so much to further the industry and hope to get a good share of it, once the Cork Airport is in operation.</P>
    <P>It seems to be the policy of C.I.E. to regard west Cork as a forgotten place that will no longer be on the map.  As the Bishop of Cork says, it is an abandoned area, but we will prove to C.I.E., the Minister and all concerned, that it is not an abandoned area.  We have gone over this at various meetings during the past few months.  I am not going to take up the time of the House since there may be others who wish to speak on the matter, but I certainly appeal to the chairman of C.I.E. and all concerned to give this line a chance for another few years and make every effort to get the business already there.  I can assure them of the help of the people of west Cork.</P>
    <P>Of course, the day has come when every member of this House, no matter on what side he is, will have to consider seriously the question of State-sponsored bodies and the powers given to them.  We have seen the result of dictatorial policy here and there.  It is time we had an appraisal of the situation.  I think that time has already <Col N="1093" /> arrived.  If the Minister and the Government examined the matter, they would be doing a good day's work.</P>

      <P>This motion, as the Leader of the House said, was put down by agreement.  Of course, it was put down entirely for the purpose of discussing the closure of the west Cork railway.  Some Senators who spoke to the motion spoke entirely on the report of C.I.E., but, nevertheless, there is no use closing our eyes to the fact that the motion is intended <Col N="1094" /> to cover something else, too.  It is a peculiar thing that, when a Government want to make any great change towards real progress in an area, many interests, for various reasons, come together to oppose it and to create an organisation which they may use eventually for many different purposes. That is what we have in connection with this noise about the closure of the west Cork railway, without any examination of the facts. It is all a one-sided, one-way argument the whole way through.  If anybody is to blame for the closing of the west Cork railway, surely it is the people of west Cork themselves. Surely the people of west Cork are the very last who should be expected not to progress as well as any other part of the country.</P>
      <P>These railways came to west Cork at a time when they were a wonderful innovation and remember that their coming was not at all popular.  There was plenty of opposition to them because it was held that they would deprive carters, farmers, carpenters, harness-makers and labourers of their employment when all goods were carried by cart from one end of Cork to the other.</P>

      <P>That opposition was there at the time and I have heard the old people talking about it.  The opposition was so great that they felt the railways would not pay without a guarantee.  When any of these branches were extended, they had to be guaranteed by the rates, but it was only on 31st December, 1924, that that baronial guarantee ceased.  It is a strange thing that with all this ballyhoo about closing this railway, there was never a mention about who was to guarantee these losses.  A further proof of the opposition to the opening of that railway is the local tradition, which many people persuade you is a fact, that there was a house built across the railway at Clonakilty to prevent the <Col N="1095" /> railway going any further the next day.  I do not know if that is true or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe.  Make local inquiries.  Every move towards progress has its adherents and its opponents.  For instance, I think it was in 1946 that what we thought at the time was the last link connecting the railhead with Beara was severed, when the <i>Princess Beara</i> was taken out of service.  The people of Beara at the time thought that it was going to be very difficult for them to get their goods inwards and outwards.  They had a service each way on alternate days and they thought it was a terrible thing to lose that service, poor as it was.  Of course it was lost because they themselves failed to support it and it was lost because in the 25 years prior to that, one merchant after another and the carriers had been getting lorries on the peninsula and there were about one dozen of them.  Needless to say, because they could get transport from the railhead in a couple of hours, they were not going to wait three days and therefore there were no goods left for the <i>Princess Beara</i> to carry one way or another and it had to be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I thought at the time that it was going to be a very difficult situation and I had discussions with the Department of Industry and Commerce.  However, they were able to satisfy me that they would give an alternative service by road, a daily service, which in addition to being a service from Beara to Castletownbere, would be a service to places such as Glengarriff, Castletownbere and Allihies, and would actually be a door to door service along the road, and extend far beyond the terminus at Castletownbere.  Therefore, the people really got a much more satisfactory service and what we thought would be, as is described in one motion here, a retrograde step at the time, proved to be great progress and is working very satisfactorily so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not heard much here about the origin of all this.  We have heard <Col N="1096" /> a lot about the 1958 Transport Act but we have not heard much about the Beddy Commission in 1956, when, after pouring £12,000,000 subsidy and £7,000,000 guaranteed stock into the operation of C.I.E., they were still faced with a loss of £1.6 million per annum.  That was a very serious situation and it was tackled seriously at the time by serious men.  They saw no option but to report to the then Minister that about 1,000 miles of railways should be closed.  That report was accepted by both Governments but they did not find it necessary so far to close 1,000 miles of railways.  In fact, when this west Cork line is closed, there will only be 420 miles closed altogether.</P>
    <P>We hope that situation will continue and that there will still be enough traffic left to obviate the necessity to close any further mileage.  So far as I know, trade unions are satisfied with the arrangements made for redundant labour and of course there remains the question as to whether or not a satisfactory alternative service will be provided.</P>
    <P>When we take into account that, at the moment, there are 70-odd merchandise licences in operation in the area formerly served by that railway, that there are a couple of hundred lorries carrying goods to and from that part of the country &mdash; there are lorries with merchandise plates which will carry goods anywhere in Ireland, and are carrying goods all over Ireland &mdash; and that every ton carried by all those lorries is one ton off the freight carried by the railways, we can see how little is left for the railways to carry.</P>

      <P>You did! As I was saying, all these co-operative societies in west Cork are carrying goods to all their clients, every ton of which was formerly carried by the railways.</P>
      <P>Cattle have been mentioned.  Since this ballyhoo began, at a west Cork fair I counted as many as 31 vehicles carrying cattle out of that fair.  How much was left for C.I.E. that day? There is no doubt about it, we must face facts.  There is no one to blame for the closing of the lines except the people themselves who refuse to support them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the beet situation, we are told in these figures that 41,000 tons went by rail and 42,000 tons by road.  If that is so, are we to compel people who have been sending beet by road through all the years to send it by rail now?  I have been sending beet by rail for more than 20 years. It is not the handiest way, I agree, but four others as well as myself are sending beet by rail in my area.  All my side of the country have been sending beet by road for years, at their own option.  I should hate to get the Army out to try to compel them to put their beet on the rail and the same applies to those who sent the 42,000 tons from west Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think that something new was happening now.  As far back as 1927, it was proposed to close a branch of this railway and, many times since, the suggestion has been made to close different branches, or to close half or three-quarters of them.  So far, for one reason or another, no definite effort has been made.  Another strange thing is, that since all this noise began, C.I.E. receipts from any of these stations have not increased by £1.  One would <Col N="1098" /> have thought that over the past four, five or six months people had some opportunity of showing in a practical manner whether or not they wanted a rail service.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to a reverend gentleman home on holidays from Africa, who had got the newspapers faithfully every week and was very interested in the closing of the west Cork line.  He visited a west Cork town.  He went there by car but decided to return by rail to do his little bit towards retaining the railway.  He informed me that there was one person with himself leaving the station that morning and 20-odd people left the same town by bus.  That shows the value the people of that town put on the railway.  We must face the facts.  Propaganda is a wonderful weapon.</P>

      <P>It is great for organising and for creating organisations, but those organisations, created for a certain purpose, may be used for other purposes.  I warn members of the different organisations engaged in that work to be careful, and to do their utmost to ensure that when these lines are closed, the people of west Cork will get as good a service, or a better one.  They will get a door to door, instead of a station to station, service. I hope it will be as satisfactory as many people in South Kerry tell me their service is, since the railway in Kenmare was closed.  With the exception of one extraordinarily large cattle fair, I thing, generally speaking, they are pleased and have made suggestions for small improvements.  If we can honestly ensure that the people of west Cork get a better service then, indeed, we shall be able to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>Some heat seems to have been engendered in this debate, but I should like to remind the House that this is not a political debate.  We are talking about a company in which everyone in this House and in the country is interested, and not only interested, but want to see successfully operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to start off by saying that I, for one, would like to say I <Col N="1099" /> am glad that in the past couple of years C.I.E. have been successful and are slowly working from the red into the black.  Therefore, I must say I do not think I heard anyone here to-night attack the Minister as a Government Minister, or a Fianna Fáil Minister, about anything in connection with C.I.E.  If the present Minister were not here, whatever Minister was here of whatever Party, we would stand up and make criticisms, constructive criticisms, I suggest, for the further improvement of C.I.E.  That is the approach I myself should like to make.</P>
    <P>I should like to start off, as I said, by saying that, on the whole, a very good effort has been made, a realistic effort, a businesslike effort, to make C.I.E. a success and to make it viable. The first right thing that happened in connection with C.I.E. was that they were given more or less the powers of a private enterprise company, and not saddled with obligations which were uneconomic and with which private enterprise is not saddled.  That being so, there was a complementary obligation, in giving these powers, that private enterprise should have a fair show as regards C.I.E., too.  It is a two-way thing.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of disquiet amongst the private enterprise economy in this country about the powers given to C.I.E. and about some of their operations.  I do not want to stress this too much.  There is an intrusion by C.I.E. in certain branches of their operations into the realm of private enterprise.  I feel the law is overdone in pampering C.I.E. about road transport.  Surely any man and a helper on a lorry belonging to a private individual or a private company are as good a pair of workers as any workers in C.I.E.?  Why should one type of Irishman have preferential treatment, because he is in C.I.E., as compared with a private enterprise man?  Another complaint is that C.I.E. are selling goods in their hotel shops during hours which are not permitted by the trade unions to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>These are two examples of operations which I feel are not fair.  I am <Col N="1100" /> all for giving C.I.E. the benefits of operation at private enterprise level. On the other hand, they must have fair competition with private enterprise and private enterprise must have a fair chance against them.  A certain amount of monopoly is still being conceded to C.I.E. which is not conceded to private enterprise.  If these monopolies were created in a private enterprise economy, they would come into conflict with the Restrictive Trade Practices law.</P>
    <P>It is very important, not only in C.I.E. but in the whole question of State companies and their relationship with private enterprise, that there should not be conflict.  For some years past, some of the leaders in State companies have been rather indiscreet in statements about the importance and super-importance of State companies <i>vis-á-vis</i> private enterprise.  That is bad.  It would be bad for people in private enterprise to be too critical and unfairly critical of State bodies.</P>
    <P>We are a small country.  We are starting our industrial life.  We are setting up the infra-structure of our economy.  We should work together. We cannot afford to be against one another in spirit, in practice or in fact.  Therefore, it is very important that at all levels and on all occasions State enterprise and private enterprise should work in harmony in a private enterprise economy.</P>
    <P>It is essential that it be understood that we cannot pile up costs of wages, conditions of employment, and so forth, and other costs based on State companies.  State companies get their capital from the taxpayer.  If they make a loss, it has to be made up by the taxpayer generally.  They are not the people to set the headline for expenses in this country.  State bodies should follow and not lead the private enterprise economy in such matters.  To do otherwise is really putting the cart before the horse: the person leaning on everybody is leading instead of following in these matters.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. have a great responsibility, and are shouldering it, to ensure they are not having imposed upon them a set of wages and conditions that <Col N="1101" /> cannot be carried by other elements in the economy.  We are all for fairness to their workers and for fairness in relation to the general expenses they must incur with different people, but they must not get out of line with what the general economy can stand.</P>
    <P>On the question of making C.I.E. an economic proposition, making it viable and getting it to make profits, I think any business can go too far in cutting out uneconomic operations.  If we reduce any business to its profit-making elements, we may very often lose an important part of the whole.  It happens in the business I know about, the department store.  We may have 50 departments.  At any given time, we may carry five or ten or more departments that are services and create a general service as a whole.  In the same way, our transport services cannot be regarded completely as the paying units and the non-paying units. If we brought that to its logical conclusion, we would not have any bus services in the country at present.  Dublin bus services are carrying the country.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a viable transport in the country, we will have bus transport in Dublin only.  If we carry that further into the realm of the closing-down of branch lines, then, as has already been stated, there are undoubtedly a lot of lines that should not be continued.  On the other hand, the idea has been carried a bit too far in closing down these lines.  Take, for instance, the Waterford-Tramore railway. That was making a loss of about £3,000 a year.  Anybody knowing that railway and the service it provided in the summer for the people living in the area will realise its importance. Thousands of people used it in the summer to get to the seaside.  The bus could not possibly give the same service.  It cannot carry loads of people, as the train could, for a loss of £3,000 a year.  What will the cost on our roads be?  I take that as an example of what may be the position in other cases.  It will be found that the change over will involve a loss of more than £3,000 a year.</P>
    <P>During the war, there was intensive <Col N="1102" /> wheat-growing.  The reason we continue that policy is that the Government say we must not allow ourselves to become too dependent on outside sources and so become vulnerable in times of emergency or war.  If that applies to wheat, surely it applies to transport also.  What is Government policy?  I can see perhaps why these branch lines are closed but I cannot understand why they should be torn up.  Millions of pounds worth of investment has been torn up as we have seen it out from Dublin and I gather down the country.  The rails are being taken up and sent out of the country. What will happen in the event of emergency or war?  How will we manage for transport?  If we kept our railways, they could easily be brought into operation again.  We could use turf as we did during the last emergency. Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to enlighten us on the Government's view on our transport in case of emergency or war and a shortage of oil.</P>
    <P>I hope the Grand Canal will not go the way of the Royal Canal.  It is false economy and false saving to destroy such a passageway which is a means of transport from one side of Ireland to the other.  I do not want to pursue the subject too long.  We all know the arguments in favour of keeping the canal which has a future, not only from a transport point of view but from a holiday point of view, from the point of view of canoes, yachts and so on when the Shannon is developed, as, I am sure, it will be, as it should, in the future.  We have not begun to realise the value of the river Shannon to this country as a tourist amenity for yachts and for visitors, and we are only at the beginning of our tourist business.  To destroy an artery, and such a pleasant artery, from one side of the country to the other would be sheer vandalism not to say completely bad business.</P>
    <P>There are a few minor points which I do not want to go deeply into at this late hour.  I will touch on a few lighter notes.  I am sure everybody agrees that the policy of the present administration of C.I.E. in brightening up and cleaning up their services, <Col N="1103" /> equipment and stations is very welcome. The whole look of C.I.E. has taken a turn for brightness and cleanliness which was sadly lacking in the past.  I do not altogether agree with some of the colours used, but that is a matter of taste.  Many of the colours are rather faded and anaemic.  I wrote to the papers about this recently and mentioned that I saw a bus in St. Stephen's Green painted a red which looks like the undercoating or the second last coating before putting on the real red.  We should have colours of character and quality.  At the same time, I would not like to be too critical on this subject, as I feel that the brightening of the stations and the cleanliness of the rolling stock and, above all, of the engines and trains is very much to be commended.</P>
    <P>There is one engine, however, that does not live up to what we would expect, that is, the diesel engine.  Anybody who has travelled in the carriage behind the driver's cabin must have been shocked by the state of neglect in which the operating machinery is kept.  I am sorry to say that I have travelled between Dublin and Cork and Dublin and Galway and I do not think a rag has been used over the working parts of the steering box since these diesels were bought.  I am sure that the mere mention of this tonight will mean that we will see them gleaming and bright like a battleship, as they should be.</P>
    <P>One final point I should like to make is that we know the bus drivers all over the country have a very onerous and responsible job, but there is a general complaint about the lack of signals by bus drivers.  I would say that they pull out 75 times out of a hundred, if not more, without any signal whatever.  On the other hand&mdash; and this is something the drivers have nothing to do with&mdash;the lights on the backs of the buses are practically useless. They are the smallest red lights I have ever seen, instead of being the biggest, and very often a bus can pull up quite dangerously and without any proper signal that it is about to do so. In country areas, these buses can be a positive danger to traffic, no less than <Col N="1104" /> the badly lighted lorries on country roads.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept anything I have said as being said in a purely constructive spirit and with the wish to see continued improvement by C.I.E. on the lines we have seen in the past few years.</P>

      <P>The motion on the Order paper, as has been stated, was put down by agreement, and in consequence, the debate has widened to a considerable extent beyond the object of Senator J. L. O'Sullivan's motion, which should not be on the Order paper at all.</P>

      <P>The reason I referred to it is that despite the fact that Senator J. L. O'Sullivan's motion is out of order, he has gained his point by having this discussion here and has got Dublin repercussions to what is going on in west Cork over a considerable period.  It has been referred to in discussion already that all the criticism that originates and is carried on previous to the closing of a branch line simply fades away when the closure occurs and an alternative service is supplied by C.I.E. road transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if there is any case where lines were closed previously and there has been complaint against the alternative services supplied by the road transport section of C.I.E.  We have heard Bundoran referred to as one of the places, a prominent seaside resort, which was to be totally destroyed.  I have had it confirmed that that is not so and will not be so under the alternative system. The line through the Connemara district was also referred to.  I have not heard any complaints about the transport to Clifden, Carraroe or any other western portion of Co. Galway, so I would ask the Minister if he would confirm whether in any cases in which a branch line or any line of C.I.E. has been closed, there have been persistent and sustained consequential complaints against the alternative service supplied. If the answer is, as I believe, that there has not been, then surely this hostility <Col N="1105" /> carried on so persistently by public representatives in west Cork and by the press there is not in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I might say stronger words on that before I conclude, but I should say that this controversy, this criticism, this hostile publicity to a national undertaking, is not in the public interest.  As a west Cork man myself, I would say to the representatives and people of west Cork that if they had taken a proper line of approach with C.I.E. and its officers, we would be in a far better position today both in west Cork and nationally.  They should have co-operated by asking what alternative services were being given them, what services would be provided in an area in which the rail service was to be discontinued, or by suggesting that they would prefer a different road should be taken, but no such attitude was adopted.  We had instead a back-to-the-wall attitude, saying: &ldquo;We will not have this; we will not have dictation from the State or from C.I.E., a semi-State body.  This is coercion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall quote some of the statements from the organ which has been mainly responsible for this campaign &mdash; the paper known as <i>Réalt an Deiscirt</i>&mdash;the <i>Southern Star</i>&mdash;but before I come to these quotations, I want to emphasise that this was a mistaken attitude and these were wrong tactics taken by such intelligent people as those of west Cork to whom I claim to belong, and such an attitude was taken for no effective purpose.</P>
    <P>Senator J. L. O'Sullivan may think he has got through today by getting this discussion on a motion which does not relate to west Cork alone but to the whole position as set out in the annual report of C.I.E.  C.I.E. are carrying out a dictated mandate given to them by the Oireachtas, which is the body governing public policy, so what is the meaning of this absolute hostility, refusing to accept the authority of the State?  I would say that in west Cork that is bad tactics, in view of things which happened there years ago, that they should hold themselves up as opposing the public administration of the Oireachtas.  This campaign was carried out mainly through the vindictive perversion of <Col N="1106" /> facts by <i>Réalt an Deiscirt</i>, followed up by the subversion of lawful authority. Those are strong statements and those are statements <i>Réalt an Deiscirt</i> have been guilty of.  This thing first appeared in <i>Réalt an Deiscirt</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is serious and that was followed up as far as could be done by agitators throughout west Cork.  It reminded me of the national demonstration against conscription during the national fight. Signatures were taken at church doors. We had signatures taken at church doors throughout west Cork objecting to the closure of this line, though every signatory knew he was acting to no effect.  I say that emphatically. They knew quite well that this was only a sort of mass hysteria.  Instead of doing what I would like to see them <Col N="1109" /> doing in west Cork&mdash;adopting an attitude of co-operation from the start when the service was showing a loss of £50,000 or £60,000 annually&mdash;instead of discussing what alternatives were to be most effective, they started into a mass hysteria of opposition.

      <P>As a matter of fact, one of my criticisms is that C.I.E. during those years provided a bus service as well as a rail service.

      <P>The people went by train in 1955.  Would they be going there still?  Not a ton of beet goes from Bandon by rail.  A light on one side of the station at Clonakilty is not going to help.  It is being sent by their own lorries.  I suppose C.I.E. would have difficulty in getting the transport in competition with the local transport.  Senator J.L. O'Sullivan spoke about contributing to the losses elsewhere.  The object is to prevent the losses.  If we take our business seriously, we should ensure that C.I.E., if not a profit-making concern, will not lose the ratepayers' money.  I cannot see the point of the Senator's argument.  I do not wish to delay the House further.  Let me conclude, therefore, by saying that I deplore the fact that this action was taken in west Cork.  I think that people like Senator J.L.

      <P>I think I have no option but to declare the House adjourned.  There have been two longish statements since we originally mentioned this subject at ten past nine.  I am aware that we are going to have at least one further longish statement.  In these circumstances, I do not think there is any advantage in continuing the debate. If I felt that one side of the House as against the other had not got a fair showing during the debate so far, I would allow the debate to continue. <Col N="1114" /> In fact, as I see it, there was a fairly even debate on both sides of the House.</P>
