      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (1), before paragraph <Col N="106" /> (g) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) one person nominated by the Minister for Lands with special knowledge and experience of wild life,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My interpretation of the function of the Comhairle to be established under this Bill is that it will be advisory to the Minister in relation to matters set out in the Bill.  For that reason, I think that I interpret the provisions of the section correctly when I say that the most ample representation that might be provided to the immediate interest is being provided in subsection (1) of Section 4, which provides that the Council shall consist of medical practitioners, pharmaceutical chemists, veterinary surgeons, a dentist and a person with a special knowledge and experience of agriculture.</P>
    <P>It has occurred to me that it might be well to consider the purpose of the amendment.  Its purpose is to provide that the Minister for Lands will be empowered to nominate to the Council one of the three persons who remain in paragraph (g) who would have knowledge and experience of wild life. My information is that as a result of the introduction of chemical or toxic sprays and dressings, there is a real danger of considerable damage being done to wild life, and particularly to game birds.  I believe that is the experience of sportsmen and, indeed, of farmers who have observed the numbers of birds that have been killed as a result of eating seeds which were dressed with certain kinds of poisonous substances and sprays or by eating fruit and things of that kind which have been sprayed with toxic chemicals.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the general observations of farmers and sportsmen, there is a report which I am sure the Minister has seen.  It was compiled by the British Trust for Ornithology, the Royal Society for the Protection of birds and the Game Research Association.  I must apologise, as I always do, for reading an English document to the House because I think in this country we ought to do our own researches into these matters. <Col N="107" /> I merely produce this document to illustrate that across the water there is also anxiety about the effect of toxic chemicals on wild life.  I take it that wild life in this country is no less immune to those substances than it is in Britain.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we ought to consider giving representation on this Council to people with experience of wild life.  The game, and the facilities for gunmen and sportsmen of every kind in this country, is one of our tourist attractions.  We ought to ensure that nothing is done to diminish that attraction but that, on the contrary, everything is done to preserve it.  In that connection, I note it is already the policy of the Legislature, as indicated in the Vote for the Department of Lands, to preserve wild life.  In that Vote a grant of £7,500 is devoted for the preservation and improvement of game preserves in accordance with approved schemes.  It would be the height of folly, and most wasteful, to spend £7,500 on preserving wild life and, at the same time, to let pass unheeded the effects which toxic chemicals might have on the game preserves of the country.</P>
    <P>I gather from the Report of the British bodies to which I have already referred, that, from the point of view of cruelty to animals, these chemicals cause dreadful pain and suffering to the unfortunate wild life which happens to become poisoned by them.  Therefore, I think it behoves us, when establishing a Council to deal with poisonous substances, to bear in mind that it is the policy of the Legislature, and the view of the ordinary people, that we should minimise, as far as possible, cruelty to animals from any cause.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if animals such as hares and foxes are liable to be caused dreadful pain, as I gather from this Report, from eating birds and animals which have been poisoned by these toxic chemicals, we should make every effort to prevent that or minimise it. I suggest to the Minister for his consideration that, by having on the <Col N="108" /> Council a person experienced in game and wild life&mdash;I take it that &ldquo;wild life&rdquo; in the amendment includes game&mdash;would be well worth while.  I should not in the ordinary course, when an executive council is being established rather than an advisory council, urge an amendment of this kind, but in the case of an advisory council, the more views we have that can conveniently be represented on it the better the council would be for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree most wholeheartedly with the sentiments expressed by my colleague Senator O'Quigley on this matter.  Ten years ago the sprays and seed-dressings in general use were almost restricted to the ordinary Bordeaux mixture for potatoes and the ordinary mercurial seed-dressing for seed.  In the past ten years there has been a complete revolution in this field.  Now there is what is known as the dual-purpose seed-dressing, which not only gives protection to seed against bunt and smut and other diseases but, at the same time, protects the young plant from the ravages of wire worm.  There are two types of it. They are both extremely toxic substances and one happens to be worse than the other.  The two substances which are used are that on the B.H.C. base and the Dieldrin base.</P>
      <P>The Dieldrin based substance is regarded as absolutely fatal to wild life which partake of the seed.  I understand that this year some farmers ordered Dieldrin based dual purpose seed dressing for the purpose, not only of protecting the seed from the ravages of wire worm, but also of killing crows in rookeries beside the fields.  If that seed dressing with the Dieldrin base will kill crows, it will certainly kill pheasants and partridges.  It will certainly kill all kinds of wild life that partake of the seed.  One can imagine that one of the functions of this body might be to restrict the sale of that type of seed dressing to the one with the B.H.C. base rather than the one with the Dieldrin base to preserve wild life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, in the use of sprays there <Col N="109" /> is a necessity for regulation because, as I mentioned on Second Reading, there are two types of sprays in general use, the D.N.O.C. spray and the hormone sprays which are described as M.C.P.A., M.C.P.B. and other letters denoting chemical formulae.  There is no doubt that it is necessary to use the more toxic of the two because, in certain instances, it has a range of kill over weeds which is greater and indeed can be different as well, inasmuch as that the weed that is killed by D.N.O.C. spray might not be killed by the M.C.P.A. spray, and similarly the weed killed by the M.C.P.A. hormone spray might not be killed by the toxic D.N.O.C. spray.</P>
    <P>If there is need of both sprays, as I contend there is, there is absolute need for regulation in their use.  For instance, if a regulation were made whereby when D.N.O.C. sprays were used or when the dual purpose seed dressing was used on a crop of cereals the sower of the seed or the user of the spray must compulsorily place small heaps of ordinary grain on the headlands and on the ditches where pheasants and partridge most commonly eat the seed then most of the birds which are lost would be saved.</P>
    <P>One might ask if it is worth all the trouble.  People have discovered it is worth the trouble.  Since the prohibition on the shooting of hen pheasants, the number of pheasants here has increased enormously.  People have discovered that the shooting on their lands is now worth almost as much as it is worth in England.  In England, if one were to take a shoot of 1,000 acres, it might be over the land of four or five persons.  One would pay not only for the covers thereon but for the fields, where a bird would never be shot, as much as 7/6d. an acre and one would have the right to propagate game therein and come and shoot there and preserve.</P>
    <P>It is now being discovered at the same time in Ireland that those game rights are of value.  Everywhere you have shoots being taken by people who want to have their sport and amusement in this form and who want to propagate game therein.  If that is <Col N="110" /> so, is it not necessary that on this council there should be a representative who will see to it that, in a general way, where we have not wakened up just yet in districts to the value of shooting, wild life will be preserved? It is not a very hard thing to put small heaps of unpoisoned seed along the hedgerows and ditches where this highly toxic spray or seed dressing is used.  It is not hard to insist that instead of using dual purpose dieldrin base seed dressing you should use BHC.  When all the known opinion will tell you that BHC is just as good a base as dieldrin, I think there is room for Senator O'Quigley's amendment and that it should seriously be considered.</P>
    <P>It is rather funny that the firm that manufactures the greatest quantity in the world of these toxic poisons is also the firm that has done most for the preservation of wild life.  It is probably because they also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the danger of poisoning fish in the cleaning out of sprayers and containers in which toxic weed sprays and seed dressings have been mixed or carried.  There have been instances where wild life, to wit, fish, have been destroyed in large numbers, because people, having used a sprayer, with this highly toxic seed dressing in it, washed out the sprayer in the local river before putting it aside or using it for another purpose.  Therefore, <Col N="111" /> the regulation is required to govern that particular use and that regulation would probably be introduced by a person on the Council who would have an interest in wild life.  There is at the moment far too great a disregard for the side effects of using these preparations and I believe the amendment would be of great value in changing this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my support to this amendment.  It seems to me that there are four clear reasons why a member of this kind is desirable on the Council which is being set up.  The first is, as has already been pointed out, that we have a valuable natural asset in our game and fish.  Are we going to risk losing some of that asset by carelessness in the use of these poisons?  Again, sportsmen and fishermen and people throughout the country primarily interested in sport will be liable to suffer considerably if the wrong kinds of poisons are used on the land.  Further we must remember the risk of upsetting the balance of nature by the drastic use of these chemicals.  I imagine the farmer mentioned by Senator Donegan who massacred the local rookery may eventually have cause to regret it.  He has upset the balance of nature.  The rookery was probably there for at least 100 years. He does not know what the chain reaction to his action may be.  He does not know the consequences of his drastic step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fourth reason is that we have a moral duty to dumb animals and, as a matter simply of the prevention of cruelty, this step is desirable.  Saint Francis called the birds and animals our brothers and sisters and we know that he was right.  If we put poisons on the fields and into the streams and kill these animals, I am quite certain we are morally doing wrong.  I should very much like to see as a member of this Council a person who is either associated with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals or who is interested in the preservation of game.  Otherwise, the Council may <Col N="112" /> make wrong decisions on many occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I had better try to bring the House back on to the track again by reminding Senators of what I said on the Second Reading of this Bill.  The purpose of this Bill is to protect human life against the misuse of toxic substances. While I would regret as greatly as any Senator that wild life should ruthlessly or needlessly be destroyed, I am concerned to ensure that the use of any substance that may be used either in industry or agriculture&mdash;the misuse of which, let me repeat, would be dangerous to human beings&mdash;will be subject to control and regulations.</P>
      <P>If a farmer finds it useful and profitable to himself and the community to employ a spray and if the spray is effective in protecting his crops against the various diseases to which we are subject, are we to prevent the farmer from using that spray because it might&mdash;and it only might&mdash;be detrimental to game birds or wild animals? Is that not the issue that Senator O'Quigley and those Senators who have supported him have failed to look at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the proposed amendment not misdirected?  Let me repeat that the purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the Minister will have advisers who will say that, in certain circumstances, certain substances may be used without endangering human beings.  That is all I am concerned with and all, as Minister for Health, I am entitled to be concerned about.  If Senators wish, they may promote a Bill to set up a council which will consider the use of poisonous substances in agriculture and regulate their use in such a way as not to endanger wild life.  But let the cobbler stick to his last and what we are concerned about in this Bill, let me repeat, is to safeguard the ordinary common human being who has to use or who in some way or other comes in contact with these highly toxic substances now being produced in such great measure and that they will not become utilised in such a way, as I have said, to become a source of danger either to himself as a user or to his neighbour.  That is <Col N="113" /> all we are concerned about in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley, in introducing his amendment, referred to the Council as representing certain interests.  No appointments are being made to this Council as representing special, in the sense of sectional, interests.  What is proposed is to bring together persons who have special value as counsellors and advisers by virtue of the particular avocations which they follow and who will be able, in discussion amongst themselves, to determine whether a particular substance can be safely used by human beings.  I was indeed surprised when Senator Donegan supported this amendment because the Senator has an amendment down to a later section of the Bill, the effect of which would be to allow a veterinary medicine, no matter how dangerous, to be used without any control or regulation. One of the bye-products&mdash;let me put it that way&mdash;of the use of certain of these medicines would be to leave around on the surface of the ground certain products which would be highly toxic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is quite entitled to interrupt me in that very elegant way but it is quite true there are certain preparations used in veterinary medicine, which, if not used with care and discretion, will produce toxic effects, as, for instance, a certain veterinary medicine used in the case of certain cattle diseases will produce toxic effects in the individuals who afterwards consume the milk of these animals.  Therefore, it is not, as the Senator so elegantly remarked, baloney.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I think we had better try to get the Seanad back on the rails again.  This Bill is designed to protect human beings and to ensure so far as we can by regulation that these new drugs which are being produced in such great quantities and in such variety can safely be used by human beings.  That is the purpose of the Bill and I do not think the Seanad should be allowed to meander off on <Col N="114" /> the trail upon which Senator O'Quigley has tried to start it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a very well known Celtic scholar who wrote a book on &ldquo;Early Irish History and Mythology&rdquo; and who made great fun at the end of one chapter of the scholars who believed in departmental deities like the god of love and the god of war and said that in the old days that was not so.  The Minister appears to take the same strictly departmental view.  Surely all that he is being asked to do in the amendment, of which I have no special knowledge, is that in a Council of 15 people, one person shall be included who has a knowledge of wild life.  Is there anything wrong, when we want to protect human beings, in taking a mild step like that, asking the Minister for Lands to put one person on to a Council of 15, who have only power to advise, who has a knowledge of wild life?  Is it sufficient to say scornfully that the Seanad is off the track and that this Bill and the Minister are concerned only with human life?</P>
      <P>There is no such thing as departmentalising human lives from other lives.  Unfortunately or fortunately, the animals and ourselves all live together and the argument for doing this is surely overwhelming.  If the only objection is a departmental objection, then I really think the Minister should not take up that attitude. Does the Minister not think that when people show some concern in a Bill like this which concerns the use of poisons, for wild life, which on various grounds, as has been said, is valuable to us we should take a simple step like this?  I wonder if the Minister had made a point of order, would it have been ruled that wild life was out of order?  I doubt it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and one of the favourite themes of the Minister, when he waxes eloquent, is to refer to collective responsibility.  Surely the Minister has collective responsibility for everything the Government do and surely a mere debating point, a mere <Col N="115" /> point of departmentalisation, should not be used to avoid discussion of the merits of something which is important and which has merits.  If that is the only objection, it seems to me to be an entirely invalid objection.</P>
      <P>The three Senators who spoke showed considerable knowledge of this matter and my friend, Senator Donegan, seems to know a great deal about chemicals, more than I do.  All that Senator O'Quigley asked in the beginning was that under paragraph (g) of Section 4, where there are three people mentioned, it might be inserted that one of them should be a person deemed by the Minister for Lands to have special knowledge and experience of wild life.  I do not see what harm it would do to put that in.  Certainly from the point of view of the tidiness and effectiveness of our legislation, it would not do any harm.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he is taking a very narrow view of something which is quite useful and the kind of thing this House might reasonably do.  Wild life is important from several aspects and one aspect that has been stressed is its importance from the point of view of income for the State, but there are other aspects. I suggest that what the Minister has been asked to do has nothing to do with politics or with government.  It is quite a simple thing.  He might do it and it would not do him a bit of harm and the responsibility would be on the Minister for Lands.  If we can ensure that when chemicals are being used for agricultural purposes, they do not do harm to wild life, we shall be doing a good thing.</P>
      <P>What Senator O'Quigley is asking for is not power to prevent people from doing things but merely to ensure that in a Council of 15 people, there will be one voice, a person with a certain type of knowledge, who will say when discussing certain things that certain substances would do great harm to game.  That is not an unreasonable request; it is not an unworkable request.  It would not do a bit of harm to the Bill.  I suggest, with some knowledge of relevancy, that it could not be regarded as irrelevant or improper in a Bill of this kind.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his speech repeated now that the poisoning of wild life is outside the scope of the Bill as it is before us.  I am glad that Senator Donegan mentioned fish.  The most dangerous weapon used in the catching of fish is explosives.  I do not suppose explosives would be classified as poisons but I would have no mercy for people who use explosives to kill fish in rivers.  However, I suppose that does not come within the scope of the Bill. The greatest cruelty to animals was unfortunately practised by the community to which I belong, namely, the farmers, in the eradication of the rabbit life of this country.  Myxomatosis was the cause of the most excruciating death to rabbits.  Rabbits are creatures which do the greatest damage to farmers' crops.  I may, perhaps, be out of order.</P>

I will not be quarrelsome in replying and dealing with any of the matters raised by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I think it rather strange that the Minister said that the only purpose of this Bill was to deal with poisons dangerous to human life.  The Long Title of the Bill is:</P>
      <P>An Act to provide for the establishment of a Council to be called and known as Comhairle na Nimheanna and to define its functions, to provide for the regulation and control of the distribution, transport, storage and sale of poisons and of the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations containing poisons and of the use of poisons for agricultural and veterinary purposes ...</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that that was the impression I gathered from the Long Title of the Bill.  I am sure we are entitled to refer to the Long Title.  Section 15 brings in the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Agriculture is to be entitled to make regulations conformable with what is contained in the Long Title of the Bill prohibiting:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the application or administration of <Col N="118" /> poisons or particular poisons for agricultural or veterinary purposes or particular agricultural or veterinary purposes otherwise than by methods or processes specified in the regulations....</P>
    <P>It would seem to me from that&mdash;and I trust the Minister will confirm that I am correct in my opinion&mdash;that the Bill is concerned with poisons for the protection of human life and is also concerned with the use and application of these poisons for veterinary and agricultural purposes.  It is not correct to say that one is off the rails if one talks about the effect of poisons on wild life, animals, birds or insects.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of becoming quarrelsome in regard to a matter upon which I think one may have different views but I do not see why they ought to be expressed in a quarrelsome way or, at any rate, in an unnecessarily quarrelsome way.  I did think that when the Minister spoke about protection of human life, he might bear in mind the possibility that some of the toxic chemicals used in seed-dressing and for the purpose of spraying accumulate in the bodies of birds.  It has been known&mdash;and so the report I read for the Minister earlier establishes-that foxes and other predatory animals which had eaten birds which had partaken of these toxic chemicals had been killed by the amount of poison in the birds they had eaten.  It is not unknown that people eat partridge and pheasant.  Therein&mdash;I put this seriously to the Minister for consideration&mdash;lies a possible danger to human life.  The Minister does not want to yield upon this modest amendment, notwithstanding all the technical deficiencies that Senator Ó Donnabháin sees in it.  I hope that the debate on the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Seán Ó Donnabháin Seán Ó Donnabháin">
      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, I should like to ask the Senator what does he want Does he want one or three or the amendment as he has put it down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>At least this debate will have this effect: It will alert the Minister's Department and the Council <Col N="119" /> to the possibility that human life&mdash;even one human life&mdash;may be destroyed by reason of the consumption of partridge, pheasant or other game which have partaken of some of these toxic chemicals.  That is a danger which the Minister may not have considered up to the present time.  To me, it seems to be a fairly probable source of danger, although it may be of rare occurrence.  We ought to consider well the effect on human life of the use of these poisons in sprays and chemicals. Consequently, if you want to make this amendment relevant to the Minister's statement that the sole purpose of the Bill is the conservation and preservation of human life, there is undoubtedly a way to make it immediately and pertinently relevant.</P>
      <P>In answer to Senator Ó Donnabháin, I do not mind whether the Council consists of 17 or 18 members.  I merely said there are three hanging around at the end in paragraph (g), as I said earlier.  I suggested that were the Minister to take out one of those three, that would involve another amendment, a procedure with which Senator Ó Donnabháin and other people are familiar.</P>

I want to have one person taken out of those three and have a person with a special knowledge and experience of wild life appointed by the Minister for Lands. That would leave two in paragraph <Col N="120" /> (g).  On Report Stage, that paragraph would have to be amended.  That is a simple, well-known and regular procedure in this Parliament, and one with which I should have imagined Senator Ó Donnabháin would be quite familiar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could hardly yield to Senator O'Quigley's amendment.  As the Minister rightly said his Department is not a society for the protection of wild life.  The Council is provided for in Section 2 of the Bill, and Section 4 provides for its composition.  How do we know that each and every one of the 17 members who may make up the Council will not have knowledge and experience of wild life?  At any rate, with all the eloquence we have heard in introducing the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Why did the Senator not give an objective and descriptive definition of his idea of an expert on wild life?  This Bill, as the Minister rightly says, deals with the protection of human life.  It deals with a range of poisons in two categories.  I think that is where Senator Donegan possibly got mixed up and missed the point. The categories can be divided into poisons for agricultural use and poisons for veterinary use.  Therefore, there is no obligation whatever on the Minister, in common sense, to accept an amendment of this sort.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, if Senators are so interested in wild life, they could set up a society for the protection of wild life and sponsor a Private Members' Bill. That is the obvious way to do it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The object of the Bill is to protect, as my colleague said, the human subject. That is the only object of the Bill. It is proposed to set up a Council of 17 members.  I cannot imagine that such a group of men could be appointed without at least one of them&mdash;and, I suggest, more than one&mdash;being reasonably expert on matters in regard to wild life and the habits of birds, insects and fishes.  If experts have a balanced education&mdash; and there are times when I think they do not get a balanced education&mdash;I cannot imagine a group of 17 men who would not have some knowledge of and some interest in the habits of wild animals, birds, fish and insects.  Even university lecturers and professors are sometimes interested in the habits of such wild life.</P>

      <P>If we want to be practical, we must agree that there are risks in the use of all these proprietary articles.  I am prepared to agree there is some need for better control and protection, but that is a very complicated matter and it cannot be done by putting down an amendment and succeeding in adding one person, who is supposed to be qualified, to the membership of a body of this sort.  Perhaps it can be strongly argued that there is a need for the competent authority, the Department of Agriculture, to take some steps in regard to the sale, distribution and use of these substances, having regard to their toxic effect on animals, birds, insects and fish.  No matter what regulations are made, unless there is cooperation on the part of the people, the regulations are not much use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very big question and cannot <Col N="122" /> be solved by an amendment along these lines.  If there is a need, and I am inclined to think there may be, for the taking of some steps, the Department of Agriculture could make a comprehensive survey of the whole problem.  It is a big problem.  If there is a non-toxic or a reasonably toxic substance which would do the job properly with regard to agriculture, then a highly toxic substance should not be employed or sold.  Most of these preparations are sold under trade names and the farmer, in his desire for them, will probably claim that he has the right to buy them and that he should not be restricted in that right.</P>

      <P>Yes, and that one person was to be appointed, I believe, as an expert in advising him as to how the farmer should be restricted.  I am quite certain that the person who would object most loudly would be Senator Donegan.  The tone of some of the speeches on the Second Reading was quite the opposite of the tone adopted now.  The note on the Second Reading was that the farmer was to be restricted, unduly restricted.  The case was made that the farmer should be quite free, in fact, exempt altogether, in regard to the use of substances. Now it appears there is a complete change around.  It does not appear they were very practical in this.  To me, it does not appear to be a consistent <Col N="123" /> line of approach.  I take the view that, if there is need, a proper survey could be made by the Department of Agriculture because it cannot be solved by an amendment to put one person with any particular specialised knowledge on to this Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider his arguments against this amendment.  He takes a strictly departmental view. That view has been supported by Senators beside him.  But, even accepting that point of view, is he wise in his interpretation for his strict departmental view?  I suggest that as Minister for Health, he is responsible for the total health of this country, the whole picture of Irish health.</P>
      <P>It has been made very clear by earlier speakers that the poisoning of birds or fish may affect the health of human beings.  I feel it is the responsibility of the Minister departmentally in that way.  Consequently, I suggest that even his assumption that this is a departmental Bill is not a reasonable assumption.  This is a Government Bill; the Government are behind this Bill.  The Government are responsible for this Bill and the Minister is acting as a Minister of the Government in that respect.  Undoubtedly, it has Government sanction.  Presumably, it has been considered as a matter of general policy.  In that way, I do not think it is fair to say that this amendment more properly concerns agriculture, local government or something of that kind.  Why should Bills be strictly departmental in this way, if they have Government approval?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that at Cabinet meetings every Minister is entitled to comment on another Minister's Bill, if it affects the general wellbeing of the country. I suggest this does so.  Though the Minister may say, taking a strictly departmental view, that we are not entitled to make this change in the Bill, why should this House as a Seanad take a departmental view on the matter?  We are here to improve legislation for the country as a whole as well as we can.  We consider it is better to base this Bill more broadly <Col N="124" /> for the health of the country.  I suggest the Minister for Health should be a general practitioner in Government and not a specialist in one particular line of this kind.</P>

      <P>I would say that, notwithstanding the Minister's statement, the kernel of the reply was that the purpose of this Bill is to protect human life.  His reply has entirely been exploded by Senator O'Quigley when he drew attention to Section 15 which draws in the Minister for Agriculture.  So, in fact, one must imagine what happened in the production of this Bill.  Presumably, if normal Cabinet procedure were followed, the draft of this Bill was circulated to every Department of State and every Department of State made its comments and had its right to make suggestions.  Inevitably, it is obvious that the Minister for Health made suggestions and, as a result, we have Section 15.  The Minister for Lands has been speaking on the propagation of game and on encouraging game.  He has been spending money over the past two years to encourage game.  It has every relevance, I respectfully submit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When one deals with the question of collective responsibility as mentioned <Col N="125" /> by Senator Hayes, I should like to give an example of collective responsibility and how it can enter if this amendment is disregarded.  Suppose a group of people take a shoot and spend a considerable sum of money on it.  If a farmer next door can get exactly the same result by using B.H.C. base spray rather than a Dieldrin base but uses a Dieldrin base and, as a result, many birds are destroyed, should there not be somebody to look after that aspect?</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  It seems to me to be the sort of amendment we might legitimately add.  Really, the amendment will affect the constitution of the Council.  The Council's function as laid down in Section 3 and as amplified in Sections 14 and 15 is to advise the Minister in relation to all kinds of regulations about the sale, distribution and even the prohibition of the use of certain toxic substances. It would appear to me to be valuable to have on the Council a member with specific knowledge of the effects of the use of certain toxic substances upon wild life.  I should like to ask the Minister&mdash;and possibly his secretary might note the question so that we might hear the answer&mdash;does he feel that it would be out of order for him to ask the advice of this Council as to the effect they think the use of certain toxic substances would have upon the balance of wild life?  I should like to know if he would consider it would be <i>ultra vires</i> to ask for that type of advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to develop a point that has been made.  It is quite proper to suppose that a toxic spray or seed dressing might truthfully be said to <Col N="126" /> kill one pest quite effectively, but, in so doing, it might kill the natural enemies of that or another pest.  That is what Senator Stanford was referring to when he spoke about upsetting the balance of nature.  It seems to me that that is the sort of advice the Minister might legitimately seek from this Council.  It seems to me that we might be concerned to see that that special knowledge of what constitutes in wild life the natural enemy of certain pests might be extremely useful and therefore it seems to me the amendment is one the Minister should consider accepting.</P>

      <P>The Minister gets up and becomes very querulous about a straightforward amendment and then we have Senator Carter asking for a definition of wild life.  I always thought wild life was a well-known term, embracing birds, game and fish.  It is obvious that the Senator does not read the <i>Evening Press</i> which has an admirable feature called, I believe, &ldquo;Wild Wisdom,&rdquo; which is excellently written and deals with wild life.  If the Senator wants to know what I meant by wild life, I can do not better than to recommend him to spend a few weeks reading &ldquo;Wild Wisdom&rdquo; in the <i>Evening Press.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perfectly obvious that there is a greater deal of support for this amendment. Even Senator O'Reilly, who took a very reasonable view, admits that it is a big question.  I recognise, and the sportsmen of this country recognise, that this is not a matter which can be solved overnight, nor is it easy to find out the exact substances which give <Col N="127" /> rise to the destruction of wild life.  It is a very costly thing.  To use an oftquoted phrase, I think we ought &ldquo;to take a step in the right direction&rdquo; and it would be a step in the right direction to put on the Council somebody with special knowledge and experience of wild life.  I do not think there is anything extraordinary in asking that that be done.  I think it would inure to the benefit of wild life and, if the Minister for Health has any doubts about its relevance in the Bill, to human life also.</P>

      <P>Whenever Senator Hayes talks with an air of sweet reasonableness and with that plausibility of which he is a master, we may be certain that he is going to advance a completely disorderly proposition. Now, the first law of the universe is order.  We cannot permit an Act which has a very serious purpose to become a sort of rubbish cart for any miscellaneous proposals that may be advanced during the course of its progress to becoming a statute.  That is why I say, in the first instance, that this amendment is not proper to the Bill.  It is not, as Senator O'Quigley pointed out quite rightly, excluded by the terms of the Long Title but still it is not in character and it is not consistent with the purpose of the Bill.  It is not going to be very effective.  If this proposal is put forward seriously as a proposal which is going in some way to protect wild life against the unwarranted use of substances by the farmer, it will be completely ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just consider what is to be referred to the Council under Section 15 by the Minister for Agriculture.  He will refer sprays and other mixtures which are used by the farmer in the course of his agricultural pursuits and some of these sprays as used by the farmer must have merit and virtue in them from the point of view of protecting the farmer's crops.  In the course of discussion on a proposal coming from the Minister for Agriculture to the Council, somebody gets up and says: &ldquo;That may be very effective as a safeguard against certain virus diseases and other things which will attack the farmer's crops, but it is going to be very dangerous <Col N="128" /> to crows&rdquo;&mdash;and they are wild life, too &mdash;and accordingly, I being a person with special knowledge and experience of wild life, think that regulation should not be accepted by the Council and that the Council should recommend the Minister for Agriculture not to make it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What would happen in those circumstances? What if Senator Donegan, who is anxious to preserve the crows as against the crops, were a member of Comhairle na Nimheanna? What would he do if he happened to be a member of the Council nominated by the Minister for Lands?  Would he say: &ldquo;I am on the side of the crows and against the farmer?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the basis upon which this proposal has been put forward.  If there had been a rather better approach by Senator O'Quigley when proposing the amendment, it could have been considered but certainly not in the context in which he advocated it.  If he had said: &ldquo;Well, if the Minister for Lands is prepared to nominate a person having this special knowledge and experience of wild life, it will not do much good but it will not do much harm,&rdquo; one might have said: &ldquo;I will concede a great deal to the sentimentalism of the Senator,&rdquo; and I might be prepared to consult with the Minister for Lands on a matter of this sort, but then I am up against this very practical difficulty: there are 17 members already on this Council and some people might think that it is a little too unwieldy for its purpose.  It may lead to prolonged discussions and waste of time in that, perhaps, a personal attitude, a personal interest and a personal point of view may be very strongly held, when an important matter is under consideration.  If I make it 18 because I am pressed to do so by certain members of the Seanad, am I not immediately making it much easier for some other person to say: &ldquo;Make it 19 because we have a special interest which we think ought to be represented on this Council also&rdquo;.</P>

I have a great regard for the Senator's capacity, even if I do not agree with his point of view, but when he put the case before the Seanad in the way he did, I had to guide the Seanad back on the rails and, in doing so, I hope this amendment will not be pressed.</P>

      <P>In the absence of the Minister on other business, <Col N="130" /> I ventured to put a question to him which I am afraid he has not adverted to.  I think it is relevant.  Could he say whether he could consider it <i>ultra vires</i> to ask the advice of this Council on such a question as whether a toxic substance which was known to wipe out one pest might also wipe out its natural enemy or the natural enemy of other pests?  Would he say, having regard to what he says about relevancy, whether it would be <i>ultra vires</i> even to consult the Council on that point?  It seems to me to be of community interest and not of sectional interest.</P>

      <P>The actual position at the moment is very similar to what the Senator has suggested.  The Minister for Lands will be consulted both by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Health in the course of drafting regulations which he will submit to the Council, so that in so far as the Minister for Lands has a special function in relation to wild life, his views will be ascertained and given great weight in the formulation of any regulations which may be submitted to the Council for advice.</P>

      <P>The Minister provides under subsection (5) that the Minister shall appoint a person to act as secretary to the Council.  I was wondering whether the intention was that the secretary would be whole time or part time, and, in either event, who would determine his conditions of service?  I have a recollection that under the Prices Act, 1958, there were advisory committees and it was provided that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may appoint such officers and servants as he thinks necessary to assist the advisory committees.  That being so, those appointed hold office on such terms and receive such remuneration as the Minister for Finance determines. That seems to be the standard practice, as we hear so often said, the common form, in this kind of thing.  I am wondering whether any special remuneration or allowance, which I would support, will be payable to any officer of the Minister who may be appointed, or whether the person will be altogether outside the Minister's Department.  If he is to be outside the Department, it does not seem to me that there is power in this section to enable the Minister to fix his terms of remuneration.  Another question arises as to how the person to be appointed will be recruited.  Will he be subject to the Civil Service Commissioners and to Civil Service regulations?</P>

      <P>This section says that a member of the Council <Col N="133" /> who ceases for any reason to hold office shall be eligible for reappointment.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) making it an offence for any person to distribute, supply or sell or give gratuitously for use, poison in any container which has been previously, or is normally, used for keeping non-poisonous substances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment will not have any far-reaching consequences or will not, I hope, greatly upset the general provisions of the Bill.  I am rather inclined to adopt that line in relation to this amendment, because, in his concluding speech on the first amendment in my name, the Minister said that if I had adopted the attitude that it would not do a great deal of harm, I might have got further with my amendment.  I am therefore, rather tempted to adopt a wishy-washy, milk and water, lukewarm attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> I think it is relevant to point out that the recent introduction of the Road Traffic Bill has been welcomed by all sides in Parliament, and outside by many members of the public, as an effort chiefly to preserve human life and to avoid, so far as possible, as a result of road traffic law and regulation, injury and damage to human beings.  Recently, we passed a Bill relating to oil burners because it was found out that deaths, unfortunate and avoidable, had resulted from failure to take care in the use and manufacture of oil burners.</P>
    <P>I am concerned in this amendment to give power to the Minister to make it an offence for any person to distribute, supply or sell or give gratuitously for use&mdash;that is, one person lending to another&mdash;poison in any container normally used for non-poisonous substances.  I have in mind particularly the type of thing that happens in relation to various kinds of poisons, such as the use of whiskey bottles, gin bottles or things like that that are normally used for non-poisonous substances.  Perhaps whiskey is not a good example to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that a wishywashy example?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>If a bottle of whiskey or a large quantity of whiskey were consumed at one standing, it would not result in immediate death, although it contains poison.  It would have drastic consequences, of course.  They may be regarded by some people as amusing or having a lighthearted effect, but it is not.  Everyone who reads the papers will have read time and again of unfortunate people who have drunk poison out of containers which were normally used for non-poisonous substances. The risk is greater than one might imagine.  Not everyone has the same capacity for seeing, and it might well happen that a person with bad sight might be confused in darkened places, such as cupboards or presses which very often are not well lighted, and in which poisons are kept.  There might be one bottle which everyone in the household knows contains a poisonous substance, but a person might take <Col N="135" /> it accidentally.  That has happened. There are no two ways about it.  A person might take a poisonous substance accidentally and die as a result.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Reilly said this evening, you cannot do everything by regulation. If we were to stop at that, we would make no regulations and there would be no Poisons Bill or anything else, but we can try to minimise avoidable deaths so far as possible.  I suggest the Minister should have power to make it an offence to distribute these poisonous substances in a bottle of the kind I have in mind, as suggested in the amendment.  This is an amendment which the Minister should consider seriously.  I do not think, if we read the provisions of the Bill carefully, that there is adequate power elsewhere, in Section 14 or in any section which would make it an offence to use containers which are ordinarily used for non-poisonous substances for the purpose of supplying or handing gratuitously to one's neighbour, poisonous substances.  I accordingly recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate Senator O'Quigley on putting down this amendment and it certainly comes, to my mind, within the sphere of discussion on this section of the Bill.  I should also like to tell him that I appreciate the manner in which he has introduced the amendment. Senator O'Quigley should not always take it that, if he is reasonably correct, no one else will agree with him.  It has happened before, and we have agreed with him on occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister cannot convince us that the subject matter of this amendment is covered, or can be covered by a clause in the section, I certainly support Senator O'Quigley.  This section deals with the prohibiting, limiting, regulation and manufacture of poisons generally, and if the subject matter of the amendment is not intended to be covered by the regulations in the Bill, I should like the Minister to consider the amendment, because I think it is a serious matter.  There is no <Col N="136" /> doubt that it is relevant to the use and distribution of medicines for human beings and veterinary medicines. By mistake, people have taken liquids from lemonade bottles or whiskey bottles&mdash;I think the smaller bottle is the more likely&mdash;and illnesses and poisonings have occurred. To be as brief as possible, I recommend the subject matter of the amendment for the Minister's consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to overcome my natural infirmities because I should like to elicit from Senator O'Quigley what exactly he has in mind in proposing this amendment.  When I read it first, I thought the emphasis might be on the phrase &ldquo;give gratuitously&rdquo;, but I am advised that is covered by the word &ldquo;distribute&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;supply&rdquo; appears to introduce a new concept in so far as it would ensure that any person giving a poisonous substance as a gift&mdash;one from the Greeks, perhaps&mdash;would be certain to present it in a bottle, a case or a casket, which would conform with the ordinary regulations governing the shape of containers for poisonous substances.</P>
      <P>The Senator did not elaborate on that point.  Instead, he referred to the case of an old woman moving in the dark who might take down a bottle which contained a poisonous substance, not being able to distinguish in the dark between it and the bottle which she really intended to use.  That raised the question of storage and that is provided for in subsection (2) (b) where the Minister may make regulations with respect to the storage, transport, distribution, supply and sale of poisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can make all the regulations one can conceive in order to ensure that poisonous substances shall be contained only in bottles or receptacles of a definite and distinctive shape.  No person could ensure that these substances <Col N="137" /> will always be allowed to remain in the particular specified receptacles or containers and that they will not be decanted into some other vessel which might normally be used for keeping non-poisonous substances. Even if I felt it necessary to take additional powers under this section, I doubt if I could make a regulation which would be an invariable safeguard against the risk which Senator O'Quigley would wish us to ensure against.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary, so far as the distribution, supply or storage of any particular container is concerned, to incorporate a new subsection in the section because paragraph (a) of subsection (3) is prefaced by the saver that, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (2) of the section, regulations may be made under the section to regulate the distribution, storage, sale and manufacture of poisonous substances.  I think, and I am advised, that the Senator's amendment is not necessary to enable a regulation to be made that a poisonous substance shall always be contained or kept in a package or container of definite and distinctive shape and colour.  Unless the Senator bases his case for the amendment on transfer by gift rather than on transfer by sale, I do not think there is much purpose in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has fairly well taken up what I had in mind.  Perhaps I did not express myself as clearly as I might. Someone goes into a retail shop to get some poisonous substance.  He gets it in a container, say, a whiskey bottle. It is sold to him in that bottle and he brings it home.  That is one of the things I think a regulation should be made to prohibit absolutely.  In the past, that has been known to lead to certain death for some unfortunate people.  The putting of poisonous substances into bottles ordinarily used for perfectly harmless things would constitute the real danger.  The Minister points out that in subsection (2) (b) storage, distribution and sale might cover it.  If he is so advised, I am quite happy about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="138" /> I want to get to the other part of the amendment&mdash;&ldquo;or give gratuitously&rdquo;. Suppose I happen to want some poisonous substance and I go down the road to my neighbour and he gives it to me in a bottle of the kind I am talking about, a whiskey bottle or something like that, and I bring it home.  That is as great a source of danger, though not as frequently, as if the poisonous substance had been sold in that type of container. It may appear to interfere with the ordinary relations between neighbours, and so on.  I do not hesitate to do that in the interests of human life.</P>
    <P>As frequently happens, if a person goes into a retailer's shop and hands in the kind of bottle we want prohibited from use and asks for this or that poisonous substance, we want to ensure that the shopkeeper will say it is an offence to use that bottle for that purpose.  In time, we will build up the knowledge that this is an unsafe and dangerous thing to do.  I would hope that by an amendment of this kind we could have the belief that we would avoid the kind of loss of life which has occurred through that particular practice up to the present.  I think the giving gratuitously of poisons in the kinds of containers I am talking about is not adequately dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in withdrawing this amendment for further consideration by the Minister, in the light of his explanation, if he would undertake to consider it and see if it is dealt with also in Section 14 and have an amendment for it on Report Stage.</P>

That is a real danger and has been the cause of one death, to my knowledge.  I think it should be done by law and not by regulation.  To put poison into a container of any kind that is not clearly <Col N="139" /> marked &ldquo;Poison&rdquo; should be an offence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) (e), line 56, before &ldquo;pharmaceutical&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;registered veterinary practitioners.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the discussion in the other House the concentration was practically entirely on the constitution of the Council. I think that, even though we have been somewhat out of order here up to the present, the discussion has been more of an examination of the details of the Bill.  My amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;registered veterinary practitioners&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;registered medical practitioners.&rdquo;  I presume that veterinary surgeons and veterinary practitioners are not included in the interpretation of the words &ldquo;registered medical practitioners&rdquo; and therefore I want the Seanad and the Minister to consider the insertion of the words &ldquo;registered veterinary practitioners&rdquo;.  If a registered veterinary practitioner is excluded from this clause without being licensed by the local authority, we are in a very awkward position.  Surely the members of the veterinary profession have not to be licensed by the local authority or their premises supervised? To my mind, it is quite clear from the wording that they are excluded and therefore become liable to be licensed and registered by the local authority.  The registered veterinary practitioner has equal rights with the registered medical practitioner and pharmaceutical chemists, dispensing chemists and druggists and the others specifically mentioned in paragraph (e).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why there has been such a concentration of criticism of members of the veterinary profession in the other House and in this House. As a member of the profession, I should like the Minister to consider this amendment.  The veterinary profession, by virtue of its qualifications, <Col N="140" /> is entitled to a nomination for membership of this House and in all other walks of life, they are recognised as a learned profession, and therefore I cannot understand why they are not included in this section with equal rights as the other professions who are dealing with dangerous drugs and poisons.</P>
    <P>Section 14 deals with the sale of poisons and drugs.  There is nothing in section 15 dealing with sales and my reading is a veterinary surgeon, when a client comes to him and receives professional advice, cannot charge for any medicines, poisonous or otherwise, under this section.  That would be a terrible wrong to inflict on any veterinary practitioner. The Minister is anxious to give an explanation and I hope he has a satisfactory explanation.  In so far as the medical practitioner is concerned, when a patient calls to him, he advises the patient as to his illness and he is entitled to and does supply him with medicine and can charge for it.  He can give a prescription to the patient and the chemist will supply the prescription, but as far as I can see, the veterinary surgeon is precluded from that right here.</P>

      <P>There is nothing in paragraph (e) of the subsection which is intended to discriminate against veterinary surgeons.  The position is, if the Senator will look at the paragraph, that the authorities may provide for the licensing or registering of people engaged in selling or offering or keeping for sale poisons, and of premises in which these poisons are kept or sold.  However, under the existing law, under the Pharmacy Act, 1875, there are four classes of persons who, by virtue of that Act, are entitled to sell and deal in poisons.  Those are the people recited within the brackets; registered medical practitioners, pharmaceutical chemists, dispensing chemists and druggists and registered druggists.  Those under the existing statute are entitled to keep and sell poisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No other person, no matter what his profession may be, is entitled to do that, unless he is licensed to do it, and that applies to a veterinary surgeon.  Now it is not intended that <Col N="141" /> members of the veterinary profession should have to apply to the health authorities for a licence.  They will be dealt with by regulation made under paragraph (b) of subsection (3).  Under that paragraph, the Minister for Health, and in particular the Minister for Agriculture, have power to specify persons or classes of persons by whom poisons may be distributed, supplied or sold or offered or kept for sale and the general intention is that veterinary surgeons will be among the specified classes of persons who are entitled to do this.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it was not necessary in dealing with paragraph (e), which is to protect and preserve an existing statute, to refer to them in any way. Indeed, if the Senator's amendment were to be accepted, it would be an added discrimination against the veterinary profession, because while general merchants might be licensed by health authorities to deal in and keep for sale certain toxic substances under this, the one profession outside the four which at the moment enjoy statutory rights which would be excluded would be the veterinary profession.  So, as I say the amendment which Senator Ó Donnabháin proposes is not necessary and if it were to be accepted, it would be more detrimental than advantageous to the profession.</P>

      <P>Would it not be preferable and better if the veterinary surgeons were included in this section?  I have not discussed this with anybody, other than members of the profession, and it was obvious to us that the fact of being excluded meant we were put in a category in which we would have to be registered or licensed by the local authority.  If, however, the Minister guarantees that <Col N="142" /> that is not the case, the subject matter of my amendment is covered.</P>

It is provided in subparagraph (h) that any person affected by the decision of a health authority which cancels or suspends a licence or registration may appeal to the Minister.

      <P>My political forebears always stood four square behind the Constitution, law and order.  I trust the Minister will pardon my reference to the Constitution.  I referred to it on the Greyhound Bill with which the Minister dealt in the Seanad.  Once a man's livelihood depends upon registration, then if you withdraw his registration, you deprive him of his livelihood.  The effect of the decision of the Supreme Court&mdash;of course, the official report of the decision has not <Col N="143" /> been published yet&mdash;on the Solicitors Act which required amendment of the Act by the Oireachtas was that, when it comes to striking a solicitor off the register and thereby depriving him of the opportunity of making his livelihood, it is a matter which falls to be done by the courts of justice alone. That is a judicial act and the rights of anybody in that regard may not be dealt with by inferior tribunals, the Minister or anybody else.</P>
      <P>The shopkeeper's business depends on a substantial proportion of sales of seed dressings and sprays.  It does not do for a health authority to withdraw his rights to earn his livelihood in that way.  Unfortunately, I have not got the benefit of the official report of the decision in respect of the Solicitors Act case.  The Minister no doubt has access to that.  It seems to me to follow from that decision that if a person's licence or registration is withdrawn by a health authority, an appeal to the Minister will not meet the Constitutional requirements and that we must provide, as I am suggesting in this section, that where an appeal to the Minister is not successful, there shall be an appeal to the High Court.</P>
      <P>I want to put this point of view to the Minister and the House.  Appeals to the High Court and High Court proceedings are not trifling matters for anybody, but if a man feels he has been wrongly deprived of his licence or registration to carry on the business of selling, storing or distributing poisons, then I do not see any objection to his being given the right, which I believe he has at any rate, of appealing to the High Court on that matter from the decision of the Minister.  It need not cost the Minister anything.  The matter would depend upon the local authority but the fact that a local authority or the Minister will be aware that they are not the final court of decision in this matter will make them pause before interfering with the livelihood of a citizen.  Accordingly, I recommend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether we should take this amendment <Col N="144" /> seriously or not.  A lot of time has been wasted on other amendments for which I see no necessity.  The Senator mentioned a decision by the Supreme Court.  There was such a decision but some of us have doubts as to whether all things were taken into consideration in arriving at that decision. In any event, it was not a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court; it was just a majority decision.  Because of that, I do not know whether it has the sanctity the Senator would attach to it. I know very well that we must all accept a decision of the Supreme Court as final.  There is no doubt about that and we are accepting it.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to the rights of traders and merchants in his discussion of this amendment.  He tried to make the point that they should have the right of appeal to the High Court. The point is that these have not got a licence as matters stand.  It is only in connection with the application for a licence to deal in the distribution of poisonous matters that it arises.  They have no existing rights.  If there is any reason for not granting a licence, surely it is quite sufficient that an appeal could be made to the Minister who would thus be given an opportunity of looking into the pros and cons of the case from the point of view of the number of people licensed in the particular area and whether it would be right at all to grant a licence.  I do not think the amendment is at all necessary.</P>

      <P>...provide for an appeal to the Minister by the person affected from the decision of a health authority to refuse an application for, or to cancel or suspend, a licence or registration...</P>
      <P>That deals with the cancellation or the suspension of a licence where a person has been in business, perhaps, for 20 years and who falls foul of the health authority and is put out of business by a decision to cancel or suspend his licence to engage in the sale and distribution of poisonous substances.  That is what I am talking about.  That is what the decision of the Supreme Court is about.  You cannot put a man out of business except by a judicial act.  I am not prepared to see the Minister for Health make these decisions vicariously. I am not prepared to say that is good enough.  Subject to correction, I do not think it is constitutional.</P>
      <P>In any event, what is the objection by the Minister or by Senator Ó Ciosáin to enabling a citizen of this country to go into the High Court and say: &ldquo;I have been wrongly put out of business by a decision of the health authority and a refusal by the Minister&rdquo;?  If he is wrong, he will pay the costs, and that is always a sobering consideration which operates in determining whether or not he will go into court.

      <P>I do not know any <Col N="148" /> provision in the Constitution or in the law which would prevent any person from going to the High Court to challenge this Bill on the grounds that it was repugnant to the Constitution. That would have practically the same effect as the amendment which Senator O'Quigley has put down.  He bases his amendment on the Court decision in relation to another Bill affecting officers of the court.  Do not forget that there is a very significant difference between the Solicitors Act and what is proposed here under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The local authorities have had, since 1908, power to issue licences in certain circumstances to persons who want to use nicotinic preparations in sheep dips and for other purposes.  Before the local authority issues that licence, it is bound to assure itself that sufficient provision has not already been made for the distribution and sale of these particular substances in that area. That is what is involved here.  The existing procedure will continue.  Under paragraph (e), the licensing health authorities are to be authorised to license or register persons who are engaged in the selling or offering or keeping for sale of poisons and of premises from which such poisons are sold.  The local authority at the moment can turn such persons down and there is no appeal against a decision of the local authority, if it refuses to grant a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is proposed here is a further relaxation, if one likes, in favour of the applicant in so far as a local authority's decision will not be final. The matter can then go to the Minister, who will then on the facts before him as submitted by the applicant or by a solicitor acting on behalf of the applicant, determine the issue.  Is it necessary in the case of a function such as this exercised by the local authority to provide for an appeal to the High Court?  If there is anything repugnant to the Constitution in paragraphs (e) and (h) of this Bill, of course it can be simply tested in the High Court once and for all.  Are we to encourage people to go to the High Court quite unnecessarily? I understand that at the present <Col N="149" /> moment the courts are sufficiently fully occupied to keep all the lawyers, or at least all the judges, occupied.  I do not know that it is going to help the community very much to compel us, in order to deal with appeals to the High Court upon trivial matters such as this, to have to increase the size and cost of the judiciary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has succeeded in partly confusing me on one issue and, at the same time, clarifying another issue for me.  He says that a citizen can go to the High Court and test whether or not a Bill is repugnant to the Constitution.  I believe that Senator O'Quigley's amendment is intended to do quite a different thing.  It would give him, by statute, an appeal from which he could hope to gain his rights in the High Court, and for that reason I find it a proper and valid amendment.  The Minister says the position is that there is no appeal to the High Court.</P>

Is it not conceivable, as the Minister says, that it may be repugnant to the Constitution, and is that not an extraordinarily big issue to take up because a person down the country is no longer permitted to sell articles dealt with in this Bill?  I feel that Senator O'Quigley's amendment has now proved to be of value as a safeguard for the citizens.  There is no doubt about that.  No matter how sure of himself the Minister may be, or how categorically he lays down the law in regard to that situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the present situation there is no appeal against the Act of 1908 or to the Minister under the new Bill.  The citizen is fully entitled to the safeguards of Senator O'Quigley's amendment.  I believe it is a great clarification.</P>

I think the proposer of the <Col N="150" /> amendment realises that because he said in his opening speech that he felt the right of appeal to the High Court should be included, though he believed everyone had the right, anyway.  That being so&mdash;and I think he is right in it &mdash;and granted that the Bill itself does not say the Minister's decision shall be final and, therefore, the Minister cannot attempt to deprive anyone of that right which he believes everyone has anyway, I think it disposes of any necessity which one might otherwise feel there was for the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Senator Sheehy Skeffington quite understood what I meant when I spoke about the citizen's right being there anyway.  What I meant was that every citizen has a right constitutionally to have matters determined in the High Court, if he wants to exercise that right, but there are certain matters which a citizen may not raise.  For instance, the law under the Social Welfare Acts is that certain matters are appealable and others are not appealable and that is the end of it. The High Court was established to protect citizens and citizens should at all times have free access to it if they want to avail of it.  The Supreme Court, in the case of the Solicitors Act, laid down a principle in its decision and that is the end of it.  There is no use in talking about variants or the type of people concerned.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any objection to the Minister permitting somebody to appeal from him.  He says that the courts are cluttered up.  If the courts are cluttered up nowadays, it certainly is not the fault of the judges and is not due to any increase in litigation. It is due to one other cause to which I shall not refer further.  The cost of appeal to the High Court is not as great as the Minister might imagine. Every six months when the High Court goes on circuit, there are appeals to it from the decisions of the circuit court refusing applications for intoxicating liquor licences, and that has never proved to be an expensive form of litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason in the wide earthly world why that facility should not be provided here.  There is only <Col N="151" /> one reason the Minister has such a constitutional repugnance, that is, that we must not, in any circumstances, interfere with the decisions made by the Minister on the basis of recommendations made by his Department. The Minister feels repugnance to any interference of that kind and that is his only reason&mdash;not solicitude for people being penalised in costs and not solicitude for the state of business in the courts, but because the Minister will not have his decision upset by such things as High Court decisions or anything of that kind.</P>

      <P>Perhaps this amendment may be quite unnecessary, and I do not want to speak on it in any great length.  The subsection which we have endeavoured unsuccessfully to amend provides for appeal to the Minister.  If there is appeal to the Minister, I should like to know how it will be conducted.  The Minister might not be aware of the case at the time, and it has not been unknown for a person to have been constituted by the Legislature as an appeals officer under the Department of Social Welfare, another Department with which the Minister is concerned. He is appointed not only to act as judge in the case between the Minister for Social Welfare and the citizen, but to go rooting around finding information to aid the Minister in his decision on the case which the appeals officer heard, and then found in favour of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> That is not my idea of an appeal to the Minister.  If there is to be an appeal to the Minister, it should be an appeal to the Minister himself.  If the Minister wants to hear both sides of the case, that is the only way of doing it.  It should be at the option of the person concerned to have an audience with the Minister.  If the Minister does not want that kind of thing, or has not time for hearing appeals from people who have been deprived of their livelihood by the decision of a local authority, then the Minister should not take unto himself the right finally to decide, as he is doing in this Bill under which a person can be deprived of his licence to sell, store or distribute poisons. Anything else, and anything short of what I suggest in the amendment, is making a legislative farce to which we are all a party.</P>
    <P>I know there is the stock answer and that the Minister can say that is common form.  We hear that very frequently.  I think it is time we put an end to that kind of common form. If there are to be decisions as between citizens and great bodies such as local authorities and the Minister, these decisions should not be taken in a kind of hugger-mugger way, on the basis, perhaps, of incomplete information, with no opportunity on the part of the person aggrieved by the decision, to question, cross-question or examine the basis of the information, or assert to the contrary before some competent authority as the Minister would undoubtedly be.</P>
    <P>It is the business of everyone.  We are inclined to say: &ldquo;Oh, appeal to the Minister.  It is all right because we know the Minister for Health and his predecessor and predecessors before him were just, liberal-minded men&rdquo;, but, of course, we all know also that Ministers cannot do everything in the few hours they can spend in their offices every day.  If the decision were to be taken at leisure, or at comparative leisure, by the Minister, that would be one thing, but I feel the Minister would not be in a position to take decisions in that way.  Consequently, I would impose upon him the obligation, before he deprived a person of his livelihood in a case of <Col N="153" /> this seriousness, to get the evidence on the option of the person concerned only.</P>

      <P>I am not accepting this amendment.  I do not think any reasons are required to justify my refusal to agree to it.  The Senator has spoken about an appeal to the High Court.  He wants to robe the Minister with all the trappings of a High Court.  Having spoken about the few hours available to a Minister to perform certain functions, he then proposed to encroach further upon them by obliging the Minister to hear oral evidence.</P>

My general function is as follows: All appeals come to me in the first instance and I refer them to the Department for observation and investigation which means that they verify whether or not the statements in the appeal are true.  Then, on the basis of a recital of the facts, when the appeal comes to me, I read them all carefully and come to a decision myself on the merits of the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (b), lines 13 and 14, to delete the words &ldquo;and veterinary&rdquo; and in lines 16 and 17, the words &ldquo;or veterinary&rdquo; where these words, respectively, occur.</P>
      <P>This amendment is exactly similar to an amendment moved by Deputy O'Higgins in the Dáil.  It relates to veterinary medicines.  In the matter of veterinary medicines, the practice over a long number of years has been that wholesale pharamaceutical firms pay a yearly or a bi-yearly call to farmers and sell them their supplies of various vaccines and veterinary medicines which last them until the next call.  There was a battle over the years as to whether or not this practice was proper, whether or not certain vaccines and certain injections should be given direct by these pharmaceutical firms to the farmer or whether they should be supplied only to the veterinary profession. That difference of opinion has largely been decided over the past number of years in favour of the practice of delivering these vaccines and veterinary medicines direct to the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike sprays and weedicides, there is no history of death to animals or danger to humans because of the farmer having access, at what might be termed wholesale prices, to veterinary vaccines, medicines and injections. Most of these preparations are in general use.  They are applied in the <Col N="155" /> same way and in the same quantity for the same sickness, the same disease, on all occasions.  We are considering here Comhairle na Nimheanna which will consist of 17 people.  When one considers the 17 persons, one finds that specifically only two people are nominated by the Minister for Agriculture whose main occupation is farming and that there could be three other persons who would have a certain special affiliation with farming and farmers.  However there is no compulsory provision whereby they must have that affiliation to farmers.</P>
    <P>I have the same worry as Deputy O'Higgins, that there might be a tendency, if not for the other preparations and those already on the market to be removed from direct sale by wholesale pharmaceutical chemists to farmers, for new drugs, vaccines and preparations to be removed from direct sale to farmers and to be directed to sale only to veterinary surgeons.</P>
    <P>One must remember that, in this world to-day and in this country, vested interests work strenuously for themselves.  I would not point the finger of scorn at any particular vested interest.  At the same time, it is proved that medical practitioners, veterinary surgeons, pharmaceutical chemists and various people&mdash;these vested interests &mdash;could very well make decisions in relation to new vaccines and new preparations which would be prejudicial to the interests of farmers.  I rejected the suggestion during the discussion on the previous amendment that there is any danger in this.  I am a farmer and a farmer's son.  I know of no case in which the application of veterinary medicines could be dangerous to human life.  I know of very few cases where normal intelligent use of veterinary medicines to-day is dangerous to animal life.  I feel that these two amendments should be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is repeating what has already been said in the Dáil and to which I referred on Second Reading.  Is it not good for us to repeat that this Bill is <Col N="156" /> to safeguard the human subject?  I am appalled that a certain vaccine is being sold in chemist shops and in public houses throughout the country which is a definite danger to the human subject.  I refer to a vaccine against contagious abortion which is a grave danger to the human subject who can get undulant fever from it.  Undulant fever is a bad disease.</P>
      <P>There is a relation all the time between the medical practitioner's medicines and poisons which are administered in small doses to the human subject and practically similar medicines being used by veterinary surgeons in the treatment of animals.  Too much of anything is a poison.  Too much alcohol is definitely a poison.  I could quote several other things.  I would say that for the representatives of the farming community or of any other community to insinuate that the veterinary profession is not the best friend of the farmers and that they will interfere with the rights of the farming community, of which they are members themselves, is unfair, unreasonable and simply not true.  Veterinary surgeons are the sons of farmers. They do not become impostors when they become members of the veterinary profession.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that Senator Donegan has changed from the view he held a while ago when he did not want to allow farmers to treat their seeds and lands with insecticides and vermicides because they might endanger wild life.  He was restricting the farmer's right to treat his crops and to safeguard them from damage.  Now he comes practically to attack the veterinary profession as if they were trying to put something over on the farmers and restrict the use of veterinary medicines.  If the distribution of veterinary medicines&mdash;and by veterinary medicines I mean medicines of any kind that are a danger to the human subject&mdash;is to be controlled in the hands of the farmers, you might as well not have any control at all because there is that co-relation between that which is human medicine and that which is animal medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one vaccine which is being sold indiscriminately and it is a <Col N="157" /> danger to the human subject, if it is any good when it is bought.  Perhaps Senator Donegan knows something about this vaccine which is used for the prevention of contagious abortion in cattle.  If it has not been contained in a refrigerator and if it is shaken about too much in a car or elsewhere for 24 hours, it loses its efficacy but if it is effective and used by a person who does not know how to use it, he can contaminate himself and get a fever which may last for two years before he gets rid of it.  Such things have occurred even with people who know how to handle it.  I cannot quote any case of Mr. So-and-So getting undulant fever from the ignorant use of the vaccine but it is a danger.</P>
    <P>Thank God, we have gone a long way towards the eradication of bovine tuberculosis but the next immediate problem that was at one time coincident with bovine tuberculosis is bovine abortion.  It is being eradicated in the north of Ireland at present and in England and Denmark and America have been freed of contagious abortion.  It is preposterous to say that the control of a vaccine like Strain 19 is restricting the farmer's rights to use a syringe on his cattle.  People talk about the farmer's right to do what he considers necessary.  It was said that a man is entitled to poison his own animals.  I think he is not.  If this legislation is to safeguard the human subject from the danger that would arise from the indiscriminate use of poisonous drugs, I cannot see what is to be defined as a poisonous drug.</P>
    <P>I understand that of the 17 members of the Council the Minister for Agriculture will nominate only two members of the veterinary profession to the Minister for Health and if he is satisfied, those two will be appointed. Only two veterinary surgeons will be members of Comhairle na Nimheanna, a Council of seventeen whose purpose is surely to do their best for the citizens. They can do it only by recommendation to the Minister and his regulations are subsequently placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas to reject or accept as they think fit.</P>
    <P>I emphatically express my disgust at <Col N="158" /> the attitude of members of the other House and of this House in trying to put over on the community that something is being done to take from the rights of the farmers.  We all know that due to Macra na Feirme, Muintir na Tíre and other farming organisations, the farmers are more educated now than they were, but that argument cuts the other way, for a little learning may be a dangerous thing.</P>
    <P>I conclude by repeating that there is one vaccine which unfortunately is being distributed indiscriminately through chemists and I am told that even publichouses can buy this Strain 19 which is alleged to confer immunity on cattle from contagious abortion.  It is definitely dangerous if used ignorantly by a human being, if he is using a syringe and is not accustomed to using it from day to day.  Anyone might easily inject some of this vaccine into his hand or into his eyes and I do not see why we should come along with this sort or argument that we are taking rights from the farming community or from any other citizen when we are merely safeguarding them from themselves and ourselves from ourselves. I only hope we will not further delay the enactment of this legislation by arguments which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Comparisons have been made between my attitude on Senator O'Quigley's amendment, which was defeated, on wild life, and my attitude on this amendment.  There is no comparison at all between a man going out to a field to spray 10 acres with a highly toxic substance and spreading it in a haze of fog&mdash;a toxic haze which a child could assimilate and poison himself or herself quite easily&mdash;and the risk of a person injecting his eye or his flesh with Strain 19.  In the publichouses all over the country, cartridges are normally sold and if you inject your heart or your head with a <Col N="159" /> cartridge, it is lethal.  Cartridges are even more lethal than undulant fever. There are thousands of them lined up on the shelves and all you want is a licence to buy them.  We have heard a most notable member of the veterinary surgeons' profession.  I do not want to elaborate on his qualifications or noted career.  He says Strain 19 is comparable with the sort of thing I have been talking about in sprays and weedicides.  We are selling lethal things all over the country in publichouses.  That can be extended to a four-pronged fork which is lethal, if you stick it into yourself.  I did not insinuate that veterinary surgeons were acting in any improper way and I did not say that they were not friends of the farmer.  If I were standing in an election to-morrow, I would be very pleased to stand on the result of that in relation to the veterinary surgeons in my own county of Louth.</P>
      <P>With Comhairle na Nimheanna having 17 members, the great majority of whom represent&mdash;and this is not a derogatory term&mdash;vested interests, there is a danger that new drugs will come on the market which will be restricted in their use to veterinary surgeons and veterinary surgeons might find themselves on that Council in a situation in which doctors and pharmaceutical chemists were tending in that direction and they, willy nilly, must tend in that direction.  Any of us who have been on boards, a county council, in the Dáil or other public body know the way things go.  There is the danger that the farmer's opportunity to use new medical discoveries may be interfered with, if this amendment is not accepted.</P>

      <P>By accepting this amendment, the Minister would be emasculating the whole Bill.  We all know that publicans selling cartridges are licensed firearms dealers.  Similarly, those who sell tobacco and whiskey are licensed for the sale of these commodities.  That is a ridiculous argument and only a child would make that argument in defence of this amendment.  There are two categories <Col N="160" /> of medicines or drugs involved here. There are medicines, drugs, weedicides, and all the rest, for agricultural use which are sold through garages, chemists, agricultural merchants and so on.  Then there is the higher group of drugs dealing with animal sickness which are sold largely by chemists, people who understand the business. The upshot of Senator Donegan's amendment would be that any huckster's shop could sell the most potent drug on the market.  That would not be a very happy state of affairs for any Minister for Health to deal with.</P>

      <P>I said at the beginning that the purpose of this Bill is to protect human life against the misuse or careless use of poisonous substances, not merely substances for traditional remedies which farmers use from time to time but the new drugs which Senator Donegan has emphasised and which are produced in such great numbers and with such rapidity from day to day.  These drugs are much more potent toxically than those which our farmers have been accustomed to use and the effect of the amendment which the Senator is submitting to the House is that if one of those drugs were labelled as being sold for veterinary purposes, no control or regulation whatsoever could be exercised over its use.</P>

      <P>Yes, use.  Therefore, we could not say to a farmer using one of those drugs that he must take certain precautions to ensure that he or his employees or some person who might consume either the meat or the milk of the animal would not suffer in health.  Is that what Senator Donegan is standing over?  That is what the effect of his amendment would be.  I suggest to the House that while no person will decry the important part which agriculture plays in our economy, we must have some regard <Col N="161" /> to the fact that our primary function is to regulate the administration of our affairs in the interests of the human beings who compose our population. Every other interest must be secondary to that.  The fallacy underlying the attitude of Senator Donegan and those who have associated themselves with this agitation is that they are losing sight of that fact and are saying that a farmer requires much greater consideration in relation to the health of his animals than the farmer, his children and his neighbours are entitled to from the agricultural community. That is a position which no rational, intelligent assembly could entertain for a moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to ensure that the development of agriculture will not be hampered by lack of reasonable credit facilities.  Similar action has already been taken as regards credit for industrial development.  The subject of credit for agriculture has been under study for some time past.  The survey of agricultural credit in Ireland made by Mr. F.W. Gilmore, Deputy Governor of the U.S.A.  Farm Credit Administration, which has been presented to the Seanad, has greatly facilitated this study and the Government's thanks are due to Mr. Gilmore for his valuable report.  The changes in the law which the Government considered desirable following the study made are contained in the Bill now before you.</P>
      <P>The Government's aim is to enable the Agricultural Credit Corporation fully to perform its functions of extending the prudent use of credit for agricultural purposes and financing the general modernisation of our agriculture and the other capital outlays necessary for the improvement of the productivity of our farms.  The Corporation must have sufficient resources to be able to lend money for all agricultural purposes at reasonable rates of interest, and any obstacles to judicious borrowing by farmers from the Corporation must be removed.  It is also proposed to create conditions in which arrangements can be worked out for participation by farmers in the membership of the Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> The present authorised capital of the Agricultural Credit Corporation is £300,000.  All of this has been issued and it is held by the Minister for Finance except for a few shares held by his nominees.  The Government envisage a greatly increased future scale of activity for the Corporation and, accordingly, the Bill provides for the increase of the authorised capital to a maximum of £2 million.  The availability of substantial funds in the form of share capital will provide greater flexibility for the Corporation in dealing with the demands on it for credit and the Government hope that these demands will be on a growing scale.  While it is expected that a major part of the demands will come from the individual enterprising farmers who are the backbone of the agricultural industry, there will also be an increasing demand by co-operative and corporate enterprises undertaking investments in specialised forms of agricultural production and processing. Enterprises of this kind will not be operating against the individual farmer but can be used constructively to strengthen his position in production and marketing.</P>
    <P>The pattern of agricultural production and distribution is undergoing profound changes in countries with advanced economies.  The changes involve new techniques and processes and integrated forms of development requiring the investment of large sums designed to give vast increases in production and productivity.  These are developments that we must face in export markets and it is the Government's intention that we will not fail to do so through lack of reasonable credit facilities for farming or for ancillary agricultural enterprises.</P>
    <P>Some agricultural co-operative societies are already engaged in, or are proposing to engage in, specialised or integrated forms of agricultural production involving close co-operation with local farmers.  These societies are setting a headline for sister societies throughout the country and I earnestly hope that many other co-operatives will follow the example in ways best suited to farming needs and prospects in their <Col N="164" /> areas.  The need for a widespread and energetic development of the co-operative movement in this way was never greater, particularly in the interests of smaller farmers who, in a rapidly changing agricultural world, are likely to find it very difficult, if not altogether impossible, to prosper without the help and guidance of the co-operatives.  Credit must, of course, be used wisely if it is to be profitable.</P>
    <P>The Government are now taking steps to ensure that the Agricultural Credit Corporation will have adequate funds to enable it to consider applications from co-operative societies for credit for all soundly based projects which cannot be financed from other sources.  The Corporation will not be expected to pay a greater dividend on share capital provided from the Exchequer than it is in a position to pay when it has met its various obligations, including provision for reserves and for the remuneration of any special credit officers who may be appointed to the staff.  This will meet the recommendation made by Mr. Gilmore that the Corporation should be enabled to employ credit officers so as to improve its services to farmers. The extra resources being provided should enable the Corporation to invest in, or lend to agricultural enterprises which, while profit earning eventually, may not prove remunerative for some time.  The Corporation is already considering what special scheme or schemes it can introduce to encourage development by co-operative societies in the desired direction.</P>
    <P>As the law stands, shares of the Corporation may be held by the Minister for Finance only, except that the directors may hold qualification shares and other nominees of the Minister may hold one share each for the purpose of complying with the requirements of the Companies Acts.  The Bill empowers the Corporation to issue shares or stock to persons other than the Minister for Finance but the Minister's consent is necessary so long as he holds not less than half of the issued capital.  The Minister is also being given a general power to purchase and sell the Corporation's shares.  These powers in addition to the increase in the <Col N="165" /> authorised capital which is being provided for will enable arrangements to be made for the purchase of shares by farmers as soon as this becomes opportune.</P>
    <P>However, as is proper for an institution which is primarily of a banking nature, most of the Corporation's capital will continue to be raised by borrowing.  The existing borrowing powers are unduly restricted.  It is proposed, therefore, to confer power to borrow money in any way the Board thinks fit and to raise the effective borrowing limit of £8.3 million to £10 million.  Provision is being made to widen the power of the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowing by the Corporation and a new power is being provided to enable the Minister to make direct advances from the Central Fund to the Corporation.  The total of guarantees, advances and any other borrowings must not exceed the limit of £10 million already mentioned.  Provision is also being made for the guarantee of the Corporation in approved cases against losses on agricultural credit schemes subject to a maximum of £5 million at any one time.  The additional powers should facilitate greatly the financing and operation of the Corporation.</P>
    <P>The principal objects and powers of the Corporation are being re-enacted in more general form and are being widened in certain respects.  Under the powers as proposed, the Corporation will be able to lend or advance money or to guarantee credit for any purpose which the Board consider likely to increase the productivity of or be otherwise of benefit to agriculture.  The definition of the expression agriculture is being widened to cover such activities as tree-planting and fish-farming as well as all the usual farm operations and the marketing, processing or completion for sale of any farm produce.</P>
    <P>The existing limit of £10,000 on loans other than to co-operative societies is being abolished and the Corporation is being explicitly empowered to issue and accept bills of exchange and to engage in hire-purchase arrangements.  It will also be able to take up shares and, if necessary, to sponsor special projects and <Col N="166" /> companies for the benefit of agriculture. It is hoped that such activities and the further development of co-operatives will be of particular assistance and benefit to farmers in meeting the challenge of modern conditions in agricultural production and marketing and will result in increased exports of agricultural produce.  The Corporation will be able to draw on the specialised knowledge and experience of the Department of Agriculture and of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society in the development of production, processing and marketing enterprises, thus ensuring that these projects will benefit the individual farmer.</P>
    <P>To simplify loan procedure the Corporation is being given power to make orders charging loans on land, subject to the consent of the owner, or of the occupier, if the loan is for work of permanent improvement.  Charging orders made by the Corporation may be varied with the consent of the owner or occupier.  The Corporation will make no charge for its services in ordinary cases and neither stamp duty nor Land Registry fees will be payable. This arrangement should be of great assistance to farmers in borrowing from the Corporation.  It is similar to the systems used in the administration of Gaeltacht housing loans and of the fertiliser scheme operated as part of the Land Project under which charging orders are made by the Office of Public Works and the Land Commission, respectively.  These systems have proved very satisfactory in practice.</P>
    <P>As a further measure to assist in the provision of credit for farmers the system of chattel mortgages, that is, mortgages on livestock, crops and agricultural equipment, is being extended to cover contractual liabilities generally.  Under the existing legislation a chattel mortgage can be used to secure a direct loan only; under the new provisions it will be possible to use it, for example, to secure a guarantee given by or to the Corporation to cover the supply of agricultural requisites to a farmer on credit.</P>
    <P>In the present legislation loans <Col N="167" /> charged in favour of the Corporation on registered land the title to which is marked &ldquo;subject to equities&rdquo; are given priority over the &ldquo;equities&rdquo; up to a limit of £400.  The position is similar in the case of the corresponding burdens on unregistered land.  The limit of £400 was fixed as far back as 1928 and the Gilmore Survey recommended that it be increased to £800. In view, however, of the decline in the value of money since 1928 an increase to £1,000 is justified.  The change will simplify procedure for many loan applications.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made to raise the maximum number of directors of the Corporation from five to seven to enable the Board to be strengthened as desirable to cope with the increase in its activities.  It will be possible to avail of this provision to give greater representation to farming interests according as may be justified by investment by farmers in the Corporation. At present there are no effective arrangements in operation by which farmers or other members of the public can invest in the Corporation. With its new powers the Corporation intends to launch a scheme of investment designed to appeal to farmers.  I hope this scheme will meet with an enthusiastic response.</P>
    <P>As regards the scale on which the Corporation has been operating, I may mention that the aggregate of loans issued since it commenced business in 1928 up to 1960 was £9.4 million, an average of £300,000 a year.  The present level of lending is of the order of £800,000 a year which approaches three times the average.  This is still far from being adequate and it is the Government's hope that, following the enactment of the Bill, the Corporation will operate on a growing scale, performing fully its part in the provision of credit for agricultural development.</P>
    <P>Before I close, I should like to refer to the commercial banks who in recent years have introduced various special farm credit schemes and are improving their relations and contacts with farmers.  These progressive policies are very welcome.  The banks with their country-wide machinery <Col N="168" /> have, and will continue to have, a most important rôle to play in making investment in farming possible and fruitful.</P>
    <P>Increasing attention is now being paid by the agricultural advisory services to farm management problems, including the use of credit.  Educational work in this sphere is also being undertaken through the agricultural classes organised by the county committees of agriculture and the winter farm schools organised jointly by these committees and the vocational education committees. Farmers are approaching the agricultural advisers in greater numbers for advice on farm management problems and are being helped to place their programmes on a sound financial basis.  The farmers' organisations have also been doing good work in educating farmers in the use of credit.  As I said earlier, credit must be used wisely if it is to be profitable. The educational and advisory services point the way and there will be general agreement on the desirability of farmers availing of these services to the full.  On this will depend largely the success of the improved credit arrangements now being made.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Senators will be sympathetic to the objects and intentions of the Bill.  I have sketched its main provisions and I now commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not consider reducing the rate of interest to three per cent.?  That would be a great deal more effective than all the hotch-potch the Minister read out.  Nobody can say that I have not got a very profound sympathy with the problem of agricultural credit.  The organisation to which the Minister referred was established in the year 1927 by the late Patrick Hogan.  At that time, the share capital was £500,000.  The borrowing powers of the Corporation were £7,500,000.  In effect, the Corporation had a capital of £8,000,000 to lend.  Much water has flown under the bridge since then, but at that time the rate of interest on loans was six per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a young student of economics and I can remember considerable discussion <Col N="169" /> on that rate and the general condemnation of it.  It was regarded as being too high.  On the whole, the Corporation did fairly good work until the world depression in agriculture hit this country in 1931, to be followed by the Economic War which hit the country from 1932 to 1936, when the Agricultural Credit Corporation almost went out of business.  Not alone that, but the people administering it ran into such desperately stormy weather they have never recovered their nerve, except in one particular respect which I shall mention later on and which does credit to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This appearance of an enormous increase in resources is merely an apparent increase.  At the moment, the total amount of mortgage stock outstanding is £2,500,000.  That has been adequate.  At 30th April, 1960, there was still £300,000 left, which was quite adequate for their demands to date. The financial position of the Corporation in a few years' time will not, of course, be anything like as good as it has been in the past, because the £1,000,000 three per cent. guaranteed mortgage stock will cease in 1967 and, if it has to be replaced by moneys of some other kind, it may cost the Corporation quite a bit.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not detail in his brief various extremely important questions in relation to this matter.  One entire part of the 1947 Act related to chattel mortgages.  One would have thought that, with the number of tractors increasing from 5,000 to their present figure of 45,000 hire purchase credit would have been the easiest to operate.  The Minister gave us a figure of £9,500,000 advanced by the Corporation in the past 35 years but he did not tell us that the total of loans issued on the sole security of chattel mortgages up to 30th April, 1961, was £15,365.  I do not know who the lucky men were who got this £15,365 on chattel mortgages.  I do not know whether they got it on cattle or tractors or anything else.  Certainly the amount involved would not set the threshing machines humming or the tractors going.</P>
    <P>The reason I deal so trenchantly with this aspect is that I know the farmers went out and borrowed money, until the banks became interested a <Col N="170" /> few years ago, from various hire purchase corporations and they paid anything from 12 to 15 or 16 per cent. on the moneys they borrowed.  They did not borrow £15,365 from these hire purchase corporations.  They borrowed millions and they paid 12 to 15 per cent. interest.  Recently, the rate has increased to 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>The truth is that the people running the organisation had lost their nerve completely, despite the excellent provisions in the Agricultural Credit Act, 1947, an Act which is still extant but which the organisation never implemented. The Minister referred to that in passing.  It is suggested that they will operate the provisions of the Act on a widespread scale from now on.  Beyond question, that would be the most significant action this Corporation could take.</P>
    <P>I have cavilled&mdash;I think, rightly so &mdash;at the rate of interest charged by the Corporation.  Six per cent. is too high for permanent loans for agriculture, the kind of loan one makes on land mortgage and the only kind of loan the Corporation has made to any extent at all.  The rate in America, as I was informed by some Americans some years ago, is three per cent.  I cannot understand why we cannot make money available at the same rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister had various suggestions to make.  He used some nice phrases, for example, &ldquo;a reasonable rate of interest&rdquo;.  The Minister may have thought I was trying to be smart in my opening query.  Look at the front page of the last report: the rate of interest for new loans was increased from 5¾ per cent. to 6¼ per cent. per annum as from 8th March, 1960.  That does not suggest to me any trend towards a reasonable rate of interest. In fact, it rather suggests a Tory financial policy and putting a veneer on the policy will not change its character.</P>
    <P>At one period, an effort was made to get the rate of interest reduced.  I think the Minister was concerned in that effort, but the person who was really responsible for its origin was the late Senator Counihan about 1942. The rate of interest at the time was 6 per cent. and as a result of prolonged <Col N="171" /> discussions and a tremendous volume of evidence before one of these very useful <i>ad hoc</i> committees, the rate was reduced to 4½ per cent. If the Minister had come in here this evening and said that the Agricultural Credit Corporation would make money available for long-term loans at 4½ per cent., I would have welcomed him and I would have said he was doing something worth while.</P>
    <P>I do not exaggerate.  I have some knowledge of this subject.  There was a most extraordinary atmosphere of unreality about the Minister's brief.  It was a kind of hotch-potch, stuff put together by people away from the problem and who had never really got to grips with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister did say to me last year &mdash;indeed, he could make quite a good point of it&mdash;that the banks had done this job in a big way in the past few years.  It would be quite unfair of me not to admit that that is so. I worked out the figures as to what the increase in lending was in 1959-60 compared with 1958-59 and, right enough, the net increase in lending by the Corporation was about £300,000 in that year, that is to say, they lent what they had lent the previous year, plus another £300,000.  I would not sneer at that at all.  I think they have done better this year.  I would not have any criticism of the way the Corporation has been going on on the general front in the past few years&mdash;none at all.  I think it has been doing well on the whole.  But, of course, these questions of no advance by way of chattel mortgage and the high rate of interest are both, in my opinion, extremely objectionable.</P>
    <P>Let me put the problem as I see it. I do not understand why the Minister comes into this House with quite a flourish of trumpets about this Bill when, in fact, he did say last year, quite truthfully, that there had been a great change in the attitude of the commercial banks.  I think the influence of one particular chairman of one of the banks had something to say to that.  At least, I will say this <Col N="172" /> for them on this occasion, that the commercial banks, having made a lot of advances in the year 1958 when cattle were sky high in price, for once, did not pull out last year and throw their hats at it; they kept at it, which is a change for the better on the part of the commercial banks.</P>
    <P>This organisation has had a number of wonderful opportunities in this country.  No State organisation ever had better.  It has foozled the catch every time up to the present.  Let me give one example.  The then Minister for Finance would have given them any quantity of money they wanted out of the Marshall Aid money&mdash; literally millions&mdash;and, in fact, when Deputy MacEntee, as Minister for Finance, was throwing the Marshall Aid moneys overboard, the last £100,000 was siphoned over to the Agricultural Credit Corporation but Deputy McGilligan when Minister for Finance would have given these people millions.  It is not as if the opportunity was not there.</P>
    <P>The Act was passed in 1947, when cattle prices were very low, when agriculture was at a low ebb here.  I do not intend to go back and make a political point about that.  It was a fact.  It was an ideal moment for starting.  As I say, there was their sad experience in the '30's when the same people were in charge.  Nobody would complain that the chairman at the time was not a gentlemanly man.  Indeed, he was.  Nobody would complain that the officials were not upright and honourable people.  Indeed, they were, and are.  But, certainly, the people in control of the organisation&mdash;I mean the chairman and the managing director &mdash;really did not behave towards agricultural credit the way I understand the subject.  That is all I will say about it.  They did not.  &ldquo;You will get the farmers into debt&rdquo; or &ldquo;You will have the farmers buying tractors and how could a small farmer use a tractor.&rdquo;  Those comments which I can only think of in retrospect as smart aleck remarks, were all used in connection with this subject.</P>
    <P>This Bill has certain good things in it.  I suppose one of the most significant is the obliteration of the limit of <Col N="173" /> £10,000 as the maximum loan the Corporation can make.  Where did that £10,000 limit come from?  We all know where it came from.  It came from the commercial banks.  They were the people who put this limit of £10,000 on the Corporation's lending. I should like to hear from the Minister whether he is going to complete this operation and get rid of the commercial banking director off the board of directors of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  If he would be so good as to mention that subject, I should be grateful.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the commercial banks should be able to nominate a director on this board, as they have been doing.  They did originally nominate about half the board, when they subscribed half the capital, but they were paid off in 1947 and they struck a good bargain.  When they subscribed half the capital originally, they got rid of an equivalent chunk of frozen loans to the Corporation, which was not a bad bargain from their point of view.  I can understand why they should have had, as they had, about half the board of directors at that time; they had subscribed half the capital.  Then the board of directors were reduced to three at one time, one of whom was a director of a commercial bank.  I cannot understand why the Government of this country should be so fond of the commercial banking system that they would not appoint people to this board who are quite independent. One could say without stretching one's imagination that that director is there, in fact, as a spy for the commercial banking system.  Now that the Minister wants to extend the number of directors to seven, I hope they will all be as good as the present chairman; that other equally good men will be appointed.  I should be glad if the Minister would also tell me that he is getting rid of the commercial banker off the board.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not deal at all with a most important point.  It is known, and in replies to Parliamentary Questions it has been established time and time again, that 40 per cent. of the applications for loans to the Agricultural <Col N="174" /> Credit Corporation cannot, under their system, be entertained because the man in occupation of the land is not the registered owner.  What is the Minister going to do about that?  That is to say, of all the applications they receive they have to knock off 40 per cent.  I did not hear a word about that from the Minister.  The father or the grandfather of the man in occupation of the land became the registered owner of the land in the Land Registry and registered title to it under the 1891 Registration of Title Act following the purchase of the land from the original landlord, but, of course, wills sometimes are not made in rural Ireland or are lost, or there is a brother in the Antipodes who cannot be located or will not reply to letters. Accordingly the man concerned cannot give a charge on land.</P>
    <P>The House has heard of the sum out on loan on 30th April, 1960.  Loans guaranteed by the Minister for Agriculture amounted to about half a million pounds.  They are for haysheds and that kind of thing taken over from the Board of Works.  There was a system operated by the Board of Works which, very properly, was transferred some years ago by the Department of Finance to the Agriculster gave us.  These other loans, amounted to £2½ million.  This is at 30th April last year.  I suppose that would probably now be about £3 million, in view of the figure the Minister gave us.  These other loans. amounting to £3 million, are all secured by what are called loan mortgages&mdash;not all of them, but 99 and odd per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has explained it to a small extent.  He says that Section 9 empowers the Corporation to make orders charging loans on land subject to the consent of the owner, or of the occupier, if the loan is for work of permanent improvement.  I have already pointed out that a six per cent. rate is not a suitable rate for a loan for permanent improvement.  The owner legally is not the owner unless he has this indefeasible Parliamentary title in the Land Registry.  The occupier, of course, was brought in, very skilfully indeed by Deputy Dillon in the Land <Col N="175" /> Act of 1949, so that the occupier can charge the land.</P>
    <P>The trouble here is the work of permanent improvement.  That does not include seeds or manures, the purchase of cattle or the buying of tractors. Loans charged will also put a personal liability on the owner-occupier and the charging orders for these can be varied.  That is all right, but the snag is that this is for work of permanent improvement, which, I might point out, has not been badly taken care of over the past nine or ten years.  A great deal of it has been done under the Land Project.  I should like the Minister to answer these questions.</P>
    <P>The Minister made large scale references to the co-operatives.  That was all very nice historically.  One would be surprised at the extent to which agricultural co-operation was referred to in 1927.  We went right through the entire system from the various committees of inquiry set up by the British Government.  A great deal of the legislation, the first Agricultural Credit Act of 1927, related to tying in the co-operative societies with this work and extending the co-operative credit system.</P>
    <P>One must be honest, however.  It is a complete loss.  There is a considerable advantage, on the other hand, in this obliteration of the limit of £10,000.  Take the example of the Killeshandra Co-operative Dairy Society and others who can now borrow anything up to £100,000.  Indeed, there were such arrangements made already for some of them, like the Irish Agricultural Wholesale Society, but again, of course, the Corporation did not have too much courage in that connection, either.  The fact is that the nerves of the people connected with it were shattered in the 1930s.  The coincidence of a world depression in agriculture and the economic dispute with Britain was really too much for the organisation and they never recovered.</P>
    <P>The Minister ended his statement by a suggestion about the increase in capital and he said he expected an <Col N="176" /> enthusiastic response from farmers. That kind of phraseology is, quite frankly, no use at all.  If the Minister had brought in a measure only authorising the Corporation to lend people more than £10,000, I would say the Bill would be of some use and he could scrap the rest of it.  The financial end is not necessary at all because if the Corporation has power at the moment to get £7,500,000 and has only lent £2,500,000, and consequently has had only to get £2,500,000 in the 40 years of its existence, there is no point in suggesting that the £7,500,000 should be increased to £9.8 million.  It may look well on paper or as a preparation for a general election but of what practical use is it?</P>
    <P>My criticism really comes under three main heads.  From this criticism, it is not to be taken that I do not appreciate the Minister has done something. I am not saying he has not. The most significant thing he has done is to give the Corporation power to lend more money and there is some little improvement in the system under which the occupier would charge moneys on the holding.  However, I would much prefer it had the Minister come in and told us this Corporation is going out to do big business by way of chattel mortgage.  I would have welcomed it had he said the Corporation was going into the hire purchase business in a big way.  Then I could say that the organisation was doing something good because their rate of six per cent.  could be compared with the 12 per cent. to 16 per cent. rates the hire purchase companies are charging.</P>
    <P>But, frankly, a six per cent. rate when the occupier, as distinct from the owner, can charge the holding only for work of permanent improvement is nothing at all.  Think of the problem from an economic point of view and imagine that the period of inflation was over.  In such a background, I would reckon that two per cent. would be the proper economic rate.</P>

The Minister has not shown such a bad effort at creating money.  I spoke on the Central Fund Bill this year and pointed out that there was increased credit from the commercial banks of about £30 millions and that hire purchase was up, from £11 millions in 1956, when everybody was squawking about it, to £25 million.  Of course, the particular document that produces the figures&mdash; the Quarterly Bulletin of the Central Bank&mdash;did not give them to us again. I would give one warning, particularly to Senator Lenihan and his five million halfpennies.  He would be surprised at how quickly the commercial banks would bale out&mdash;and I want to stress that I do not mean this in any personal way&mdash;once they decided that they had lent enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The two fashionable things which occupied the attention of Fianna Fáil at the last election were agricultural marketing and agricultural credit.  We have waited since for the birth of the children conceived at that time.  The first child was stillborn but the second child, whilst an improvement on the first, is not good enough.</P>
      <P>In a general way, it is necessary to examine the situation in regard to agricultural credit in this country.  It is also-necessary to find out what our necessities are, so far as agricultural credit is concerned.  There is not the slightest doubt that our agriculture is undeveloped. All one has to do is to go to Scotland and see how much money is invested in the farms.  In Scotland, only a small percentage of the farms are owned.  When a farm is being leased, the questions asked are: &ldquo;How much money has the person got to invest? How much money has he for machinery?  How many cattle has he got?&rdquo; In other words, can the person run the farm economically getting for himself a reasonable profit and at the same time pay his rent?  In this country, we are very far from that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are vast areas in this country in which there is only subsistence farming. The major problem is not the problem of money.  The major problem, of course, is how to inject the money. I could give two examples of what I have in mind.  I know two politicians in this House who are businessmen as well.  Both of them show a reasonable profit on their farms.  They both admit that, no matter how tough the times were, they could always finance the farms because their businesses were bigger than their farms.  They could show a reasonable profit.  I can quote the case of a farmer not far from the town of Drogheda who was also a businessman.  He invested £40,000 in the modernisation of his farm and in the provision of stock and equipment. His profit last year on an investment of £40,000 was £60, excluding pigs, on which he lost about £2,000.  Nevertheless, he took only £60 profit on an investment of £40,000.  Wrong investment in agriculture is the thing that <Col N="179" /> can damn a farmer&mdash;investment without any specialist attention as to how it is put in.</P>
    <P>The first problem, more important than the problem of money, is the problem of an organisation to invest the money in the right way with the certainty of a profit.  There are two ways to achieve that&mdash;the knowledge of the farmers and the knowledge of the institution which loans them the money.</P>
    <P>The second example was the heifer loans.  Deputy Sweetman referred to that in the Dáil on this Bill.  I refer to it now.  All Senators have read the agricultural statistics and know that the number of in-calf heifers in this country are down by 11.9 per cent. since the time the N.F.A. heifer-loan scheme was first established.  Things in agriculture become fashionable.  They are like ladies' hats.  When runners, single suckled calves or multiple suckled calves, were fashionable and they were paying, the farmers got loans. The trouble is that the trend of prices went against that situation.  Now the farmers have disposed of their heifers, paid back the loans or have not yet paid them back and heifers are down in numbers by 11.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Here we have the case where money was channelled in pretty generously with no results&mdash;in fact with opposite results.  What are the ways in which we can increase agricultural credit with the certainty of building upon a solid foundation?  How can this Bill do the job?  The Bill extends the scope of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. They can now loan more easily to co-operative societies and organisations for specific purposes.  It is wise, therefore, to discuss these ways of lending money.  They were utilised, as far as agriculture was concerned, by the commercial banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  In the early days co-operative societies, as Senator O'Donovan mentioned, were the things which were to solve all our problems.</P>
    <P>Co-operation has done a lot but it is right to say that, if the Agricultural Credit Corporation utilised its new powers to go further into co-operation by lending to co-operative societies, it might not be the best way.  A <Col N="180" /> co-operative society might start out to produce milk and you would have a vast area in the country producing milk but it is a question whether we should be more diversified, whether in fact that society in setting out to do a thing became so over-zealous and enthusiastic that it did not bother about the other opportunities which the members had on their own farms.  It may have been a mistake to lend to businesses which deal with farms.  In the main, businessmen could not exert in competition the same degree of regimentation on their customers that a co-operative society could exert on its members.  That could be criticised from two points of view.  If it is going to be an all-out effort, is it the right thing to have co-operative societies increasing attention to one particular product or is it the right thing to have business increasing in general?</P>
    <P>I feel that there is an argument against over-regimentation, against the loan for specific purposes, against the doctrinaire going out into an area and saying: &ldquo;We will lend you money for a specific thing.&rdquo; The Agricultural Credit Corporation was better as a normal banking concern, giving individual loans to individual people, based on their belief in the ability of those people to make repayments and carry out the purposes of the loans.</P>
    <P>The N.F.A. produced a booklet on agricultural credit, and on page four, there were answers to the question: &ldquo;Should the agricultural instructors' help and advice be a basic condition to the giving of a loan?&rdquo; Thirty-nine branches considered that it should be but 65 considered that it should not be.  In other words, we have the decided opinion now from a section of over 100 branches of the N.F.A. that ultimate regimentation would be a bad thing.</P>
    <P>I hark back to the main trouble, that is, the organisation that can do this job.  Any of us who are politicians have cause to go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and discuss perhaps our neighbour's business.  The neighbours know that we are going to Dublin and that we know the offices of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and they ask us to discuss with them <Col N="181" /> whether or not they should have a loan extension, or a loan, or any other such business.  When we go there, we see the officers are all doing their job as best they can, but if the Minister were to try, as many of us hoped he would have tried, to extend the scope, the volume of business of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, with one stroke of the pen, would go up two or three times.  The first problem would not be how they would get the money but how they would do the business.</P>
    <P>It goes right back to the question of why it is that a bank manager in a country town prefers to give to a merchant down the street or anyone in contact with a farm, on the basis of a balance sheet, a large loan rather than a series of small loans to farmers who could then deal with him for cash. Why does he prefer to deal with one man to whom he will give long term credit rather than with a number of men who will deal in their purchases of goods for cash?  It would be ideal to have 200 or 300 small men all dealing in cash because they would be in a better position to bargain, but eventually the thing comes to the physical fact that he would not be capable of knowing all about these loans that he was giving.  The man down the street has travellers on the road and has contacts, and as a result, he knows whether he can give this credit, and it is over such a broad spectrum that if two per cent. go down, he has the other 98 to pay for it and he has lost profit and not principal.</P>
    <P>I therefore say that this Bill is a small change.  For the moment, it is like Brian O'Lynn's mare.  It will do. But if I thought it were a step towards much bigger and better things and that the people in the Agricultural Credit Corporation would be told: &ldquo;You have by promotion and by recruiting and by every other way possible, perhaps by taking in efficiency experts, to examine what avenues of expansion are available&rdquo; I would be satisfied, but the limitations of the Bill are such that I am not satisfied, even though I welcome it as a small step forward.</P>
    <P>The authorised capital is increased to £2 million and the permissive investment by the Minister is up to £5 million. It is not a fair comparison, I <Col N="182" /> admit before I say it, but just to get a broad comparison of figures of what people do and what we are up against in our export trade, Denmark, as quoted in this evening's papers, has increased its supports to agriculture this year from £16 million to £24 million. This is in fact direct subsidy, while we are talking in terms of investment in an absolutely undercapitalised country as far as agriculture is concerned, in relation to a permissive increase of investment by the Minister of up to £5 million.</P>
    <P>This is just one indication given when I picked up the evening paper tonight of where we stand in relation to competition with our neighbours in Europe.  We have to do far better. The whole legislation is permissive and there is no statement by the Minister, tonight, nor was there any in the Dáil, that £1 will be forthcoming, so that the whole thing hinges entirely on what the position may be in the years to come and how the Agricultural Credit Corporation will do its job.</P>
    <P>The borrowing limit is up from £8.3 millions to £10 millions.  It is not a big amount.  The leader of our Party quotes a figure which I think is pretty factual of £1,000,000,000 tied up in agriculture, and the Government agency that is supposed to give the lead, that was started by Paddy Hogan to give loans to farmers, has its borrowing limit increased from £8.3 millions to £10 millions.  Comparisons with what is being done for tourism and industry would not help at all, because these things have to be considered, and I will not make these comparisons.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in respect of bills of exchange.  Bills of exchange and promissory notes are convenient methods of dealing.  You might call them post-dated cheques.  They are absolutely essential to business in large sums today.  The bill of exchange dated back for six months whereby a man takes in a fair load of commodities, a large quantity of fertiliser or of expensive agricultural requisites, is an established way of doing business, and it is only right that the Agricultural Credit Corporation, just like the banks, should accept <Col N="183" /> them.  They are accepted freely when signed by both buyer and seller and dated six months back through practically all the banks in the world, and with the constant drop in the value of money and the rise in the cost of goods, that is absolutely essential.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that hire purchase has come in under this Bill.  I hope that the borrowing figure will be extremely realistic; in other words, that six per cent.  or something of that order will prevail, because it will have two effects: one, it will make money available under hire purchase facilities for necessary farm implements at six per cent.; and, secondly, it will kill the hold of the other hire purchase companies who have been overcharging in this field.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I should mention another mistake made in agricultural credit which is well accepted and known to all agriculturists in this country, that is, the fact that the small farmer has spent in the past ten years in relation to his capital far too much money on machinery, which has resulted in many cases in the depletion of his stock.  I can imagine the young lad growing up on the farm, his father being there.  He wants to have a tractor, or a combine harvester or various articles of machinery to take away the drudgery and give him a certain status in the parish.  He tells his girl friend on Sunday night about the new combine harvester instead of telling her things about herself as he should do.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that has been the pattern.  The trouble is that such a man says: &ldquo;I have ten acres of corn of my own and 30 rented, and that is 40 acres.  I have to pay £5 an acre to have it harvested and that is £200.  I will get this `yoke' for £250 and in two or three years, I will have the thing paid off and it will have cost me, with the repayments, only £300.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not so because the trouble is that probably his total capital is about the cost of the combine harvester in the first instance, and he has not taken depreciation into account, nor has he taken wear and tear into account.  The result is that when his <Col N="184" /> second year or his third year half-yearly instalment falls due, in shame, he has to sell a cow the wrong day of the year, or in shame, has to sell two or three bullocks for half nothing. That trend is also one that will have to be watched to a fantastic extent.</P>
    <P>Continental countries such as Denmark and Sweden have arranged preferential rates of interest in respect of agriculture.  The question was asked: &ldquo;Where would we get the money?&rdquo;  If we used cold hard economics, we might be better off if we subsidised the rate of interest for agriculture rather than subsidise the purchase of jet aircraft.  I am not making a political point of this, and I do not want to offend the people opposite, but they can take it any way they like.</P>
    <P>I cannot resist the temptation&mdash;and I am sure the Minister and Senator Lenihan will forgive me&mdash;to have a little political cut.  I should like to quote from a document which is, of course, the clippings of the <i>Irish Press.</i> The address is 13 Upper Mount Street and the date is a little hazy.</P>

Mr. Dillon knows very well that this transfer of the responsibility for the making of loans is tantamount to saying to the farmers of the country: &ldquo;You are not going to get any money.&rdquo; Everyone knows how difficult it is to get money from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  A farmer who once got through the Corporation could get all the money he needed in any bank in the country.

      <P>I do not intend to pursue Senator O'Donovan down the highways and the byways he travelled to-night, nor do I intend to follow on the lines taken by Senator Donegan because this Bill is a very practical measure.  It is primarily a machinery measure which gives power to the Agricultural Credit Corporation to increase its potential capital from £800,000 to £2,000,000 and to increase its borrowing powers to £10,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> In addition, there are practical improvements in regard to the limit of £10,000 on loans, and a provision enabling the Corporation to get into the hire purchase business.  I agree that is very important.  For too long, the hire purchase companies have been engaging in very profitable business at the expense of the small farmers with regard to the sale of machinery.  That is a very desirable improvement.  It is now positively stated in legislative form that the Agricultural Credit Corporation can go into the hire purchase business.  In addition, there are simplifications of the security procedure and direct power is given to the Corporation to engage in agricultural development schemes.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is really the framework within which the Corporation can engage in work to the greater benefit of the Irish farmer and I believe that the main improvement will be an administrative improvement.  We now have in legislative form the increased borrowing powers, the increased capital, the abolition of restriction on security arrangements, and the challenge to the Corporation will be to work out progressive administration in regard to agricultural credit within that framework.  In that direction, I feel that constructive suggestions might be made in this debate.</P>
    <P>First of all, the major problem at the moment is the long term credit associated with farm planning in this country. There is no machinery at the moment for long term credit or for agricultural advisers to draw up a practical plan for five or ten years and to link up the credit schemes within that plan.  That is referred to in the Gilmore Report in a very definite fashion. On page 8 of that report, Mr. Gilmore refers to the two causes which he says have curtailed the growth of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in large measure.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one of these causes which has certainly militated against the Corporation taking the part it should take in the field of agricultural finance.  In the middle of page 8 of the Report Mr. Gilmore says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> An organisation furnishing credit directly to farmers cannot operate effectively from one central point. This method of operation requires that it must deal with farmers on an impersonal basis and obtain information from police officers or others who, no matter how well intentioned, are not versed in agricultural credit needs, farm debt-paying ability, etc. Red tape and delays were mentioned repeatedly by farmers as reasons for not applying to the Corporation.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gilmore mentioned that as the principal cause militating against the Agricultural Credit Corporation and I agree with him wholeheartedly.  I feel that over the years the fact that the Agricultural Credit Corporation, admirable though its officers may have been and well staffed as it may have been, operated from Kildare Street dealing with applications from the western seaboard, the southern seaboard and the midlands in regard to individual farmers whose calibre they were not acquainted with was a major cause in preventing the better growth of the organisation.  This is an administrative matter.</P>
    <P>I feel that if within the framework of this Bill, the Corporation will have any significance in the future, it will have to decentralise its administration. I feel it is essential to have at least an office in every county where there will be an agricultural finance officer, an official of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, who will advise the farmer. Perhaps in association with the Land Project officials, agricultural advisers would advise a farmer who wants to draw up a long-term farming plan and make the necessary finance available to further that plan.  That is essential.</P>
    <P>In a way, you have the existing administration with which to link that up.  At the moment, in every town in the country there is a Land Project office from which that scheme is administered.  The officials operating in the office are men who are in touch with the farmers in the county.  They know the worthwhile ones and the men not so worthwhile, and so on.  An additional room for an agricultural <Col N="188" /> finance officer might be provided in that office.  It is essential that he should work in co-operation with the Land Project officials or the local agricultural adviser.</P>
    <P>If the Agricultural Credit Corporation is to function as heretofore in its administration from Kildare Street and not have this decentralised administration, I do not think the situation will improve enormously, even though the measures we are debating tonight, notwithstanding the scope of the Corporation, would enable it to work its administration more efficiently.  I feel that the principles in this Bill would be prejudiced if the administration is not effective in the way I suggest and in the way Mr. Gilmore referred to on page 8, namely, that this organisation cannot operate effectively working from one central point.</P>
    <P>Because of the large numbers of farmers all over the country with different needs in different localities, with different types of farming and different types of credit needed, unless you have agricultural finance officers there on the spot to work with the existing agricultural advisory and development agencies, there will be no hope of success of the Corporation in the future.  That suggestion is largely one of administration.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome.  Any attempts to throw cold water on it have been weak.  It enlarges the scope of the Corporation.  It provides the framework. My hope is that out of that framework so admirably provided in this Bill an efficient lending organisation will be built up in a decentralised way throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to chattel mortgages and to the-small amounts apparently that have gone into circulation since they were first introduced.  In my opinion, the reason they have not become more popular is the fact that we have very few farmers who would know anything good, bad or indifferent, about chattel mortages.  If they are to be extended some method will have to be found to explain the meaning of chattel mortgages to would-be borrowers.  If that could be done, I believe there would be a good increase in the number of applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> I should like to point out that it has been found, not merely here but throughout the world, that the farmers as a section of the community are credit-worthy.  Business people have found that out.  Hitherto farmers have mostly been financed from one part of the year to the other by the local shopkeepers. That may be an expensive way of financing them.  Naturally, the shopkeeper who is advancing goods on credit&mdash;fertilisers, seeds, and so on&mdash; has to have an overdraft in the bank on which he is probably paying six per cent.  As well as that, he has to cover himself against whatever small percentage of losses he may have to face. Nevertheless, I think the Agricultural Credit Corporation should take its courage in its hands and take the farmers into its confidence.  It will find that at least 95 per cent. or perhaps 98 per cent. of the farmers would repay whatever they borrowed.</P>
    <P>The question every time is largely the same as that which confronts a bank manager.  If a bank manager is approached for a loan by anybody, whether he be a farmer or a business man, he will have to size up the applicant.  These men are specially trained for that purpose, after long years of service before they reach the stage of bank manager.  They are able, largely, to size up a man and to know whether or not he is credit-worthy. In my opinion it is the man rather than his means of living that should be the deciding factor in the mind of any person or Corporation lending money.</P>
    <P>A man with very small capital and perhaps handicapped in many other ways will be able to make good, whereas another man with a large amount of capital may not.  As pointed out by Senator Donegan, a man may invest £40,000 and find himself losing money at the end of the year.  As against that, I could recite stories of several farmers whom I know who began not from scratch but from behind scratch and who succeeded through sheer industry.  I know one man who a few years ago was working in County Dublin as an agricultural labourer.  Through sheer industry, hard work and intelligent application of his knowledge, he <Col N="190" /> managed to acquire a small holding. Later on, through his own industry, he was able to purchase a neighbouring farm at a cost of £3,000.  That may sound a small amount to some people but to an agricultural labourer, it is a very fine advance.  I believe that that man will make a living on the land, no matter what hardships may be involved.</P>
    <P>It occurred to me while listening to the debate on the question of these loans and how they are to be made that the Minister is more than anxious to make this money available to help especially the small farmers.  There is in most parts of the country at present a chain of creameries.  I would suggest that they should be utilised.  It should be possible to work out machinery whereby, through the creameries, the creamery manager and his staff would lend money, the money to be advanced, if necessary, by the Corporation.  I know of one creamery manager who, some years ago, when the heifer loans were first introduced, advanced the price of a heifer, in some cases, the price of two heifers in other cases, and who had the collection of the money in his own hands.  When the heifers came into milk, the farmer who borrowed sent the milk to the creamery and repaid so much per week to the creamery manager by having the amount deducted from his creamery cheque.  That is one idea which I think is worthy of investigation.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister to say that credit officers would be appointed. That is very sensible.  The central office here in Dublin cannot possibly know much about a farmer down the country.  Unless some machinery is devised whereby the Agricultural Credit Corporation can be informed as to the credit-worthiness of would-be borrowers, it will be in an extraordinarily difficult position.  If credit officers were appointed, they would be able, through their knowledge of the country, to advise the Corporation as to those who should be given money.  As well as that, they would be able to advise the farmers how that money should be spent.  I do not for a <Col N="191" /> moment advocate that money should be doled out to everybody who would take it and spend it without having due regard to putting it to profitable use.</P>
    <P>There is another obstacle in the way and one for which I cannot suggest a remedy that would be absolutely certain. I understand that, if you want to borrow money, you must get somebody to guarantee you with the Corporation just the same as you have to be guaranteed with the bank.  Why not go the whole hog and cut out the guarantors?  If that were done, there would be very little loss to the Corporation or the Minister and there would be a large increase in the number of applications for loans. Very few people like to ask a neighbour, a friend or even a relative to act as guarantor for a loan.  I should not like to do it and I know many others who are deterred from approaching banks or credit corporations because of having to get somebody who will guarantee payment.  The loans through the creamery in the case I have referred to&mdash;I do not want to mention names but if they are of advantage to anybody I can supply them in confidence to the Minister&mdash; have been repaid in full in the district I know well and it should be possible to improve on that by making loans more freely available, not merely in that particular area, but throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In the south and west of Ireland, you have creameries established and these, with co-operative societies, should be able to reach the vast majority of the farmers.  Here in Leinster, it might be different but they are nearer to the Corporation and it might be possible to deal with them by a different means.  It is essential, of course, that wherever a man borrows money the lender should assure himself that that money is going to be put to good use and not wasted.  It should be put to increasing agricultural production.</P>
    <P>As I have referred to agricultural production I should say that it seems <Col N="192" /> to me that there would be very little use in having increased agricultural production unless the markets can be made available for it.  The unfortunate experience of the farming community is that whenever production increases in any particular line, it reaches a certain point and at that point the price drops.  It is a sickening experience for farmers who have put in a year's work producing a crop, or animals, for sale to find that just when the commodity is saleable the price drops.  It is noteworthy that for commodities where you have a guaranteed price, wheat or beet and so on, there is no difficulty about production.  If anything can be done to stabilise the market there is no doubt that the farmers would provide the product. If they are given a reasonable chance of security and a reasonable hope of having a market for a commodity, whether it be beet, wheat or beef or whatever they can produce from the land, it would be forthcoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance could do worse than listen to the very constructive and instructive speech which has just been made by Senator O'Grady.  I think the Senator had something to do with Agricultural Bills in his time and he has gained a great deal of practical experience as a member of the community in the part of the country in which he lives. I entirely agree from my own experience of the agricultural community, that the vast majority of farmers are creditworthy, honourable and honest people who do not want to owe a penny to anybody and a very independent-minded class of people, such indeed that they do not want to be beholden to anybody.  For that reason, I agree with Senator O'Grady that there are very few farmers who like to go to a neighbour or even to a relative to ask him to go guarantor for them in the bank or with any merchant.  Whatever can be done to loosen up the requirements of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in finding guarantors for farmers should be done if it is intended that the farmers should benefit from legislation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> The Minister would also do very well to pay some attention to what has been said by Senator O'Donovan. It has been a constant source of imagined grievance by the Minister in debates here that he never hears anything constructive from the Opposition. There are none so deaf as those who will not hear.

      <P>Of course effect could be given to them.  At any rate, what I want to point out is that consructive suggestions have been made and the Minister would do well to read the speech made by Senator O'Donovan in a more leisurely atmosphere, away from this Chamber, and he might learn a great deal from it.  I do not understand much about companies and this business of credit and consequently at this stage I do not propose to speak at great length about them.  From what I know, and I may be wrong, it seems to me that the most which the Agricultural Credit Corporation can have put in credit at any time to the farmers is a sum of £10 million.  That seems to be the extent of the amount of credit which the farmers can hope to obtain from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. If that is so, the advance from £8.3 million to £10 million cannot be said in any sense to be even a step in the right direction because it does not in any way match up to the requirements of the agricultural community at present.  I understood Senator Brady to ask Senator O'Donovan how money could be provided as cheaply as two per cent.  Senator O'Donovan was suggesting that money should be provided for agricultural credit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Apparently there is because Senator Brady has attempted to intervene in the debate in a most disorderly fashion to ask where is the money to be found.  I understand there is no shortage of money whatever. On the contrary, we have an economic investment unit or some such section recently established in the Department of Finance and the head of that section was at some function down in Greystones over the week-end, following the pattern of the Taoiseach's letter to the county councils and other institutions, and said that what there was a shortage of was not money but ideas.</P>

It shows precisely&mdash;and I wish the farmers would realise it&mdash;that as far as this Government are concerned, agriculture takes second place, even in the matter of credit.  I want to ask the Minister for Finance what would be wrong with providing a subsidy of £50,000 per annum to the agricultural community for credit purposes?  When I ask that, I have in mind that the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Finance ought to be in a position to raise £1,000,000 per annum and to lend it free of interest for credit purposes to the agricultural community.</P>

      <P>I do not believe it is but we will see whether it is or not. The Minister for Finance may be able to read into this Bill things that ordinary mortals do not see in it.  I want to come to a matter which was raised by Senator Lenihan.  He extols this Bill because he sees in it provision being made for the extension of hire purchase facilities by the Agricultural Credit Corporation to the agricultural community.  Unless my memory is greatly at fault, I think these facilities were provided in the 1947 Act but were not used.  My memory is aided by the side-note on page 5 of the Bill &ldquo;1947, No. 14.&rdquo; in relation to <Col N="197" /> paragraph (v) which says: &ldquo;engaging in the provision of hire-purchase facilities...&rdquo; That suggests rather conclusively to me that these facilities were already available in the 1947 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the increase in the borrowing powers of the Agricultural Credit Corporation from £8.3 million to £10 million, can the Minister give any indication as to how much of that will be laid out by the Agricultural Credit Corporation in taking over these companies and establishing these projects which they will be entitled to establish under Section 8 of the Bill, and how much of the £1.7 million will not be used in the sense in which agricultural credit has been used to date, but will be used in expanding hire purchase activities which Senator Lenihan and others apparently think will result from the loosening up of the powers the Agricultural Credit Corporation has had to date?  If the major portion of the £1.7 million which the Agricultural Credit Corporation will have under this Bill is to be absorbed in the use of hire purchase facilities by the agricultural community, it may very well turn out, as Senator Donegan has suggested, that that very activity of the Corporation will not inure to the benefit of the agricultural community, but that the contrary will be the result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to hark back to a small point which emphasises what has been said by an earlier speaker as to how the Fianna Fáil Government always progress in a backward direction.  The 1927 Agricultural Credit Act, when setting out the powers of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, was limited to a matter of ten or twelve lines.  In the 1947 Act, these powers occupied four pages.  Now we find at last, as in other things, that this Government realise that it is very hard to improve <Col N="198" /> upon the things done by Fine Gael or by the inter-Party governments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that this is one of the best Bills we have had before us for some time.  The object is quite clear, to make it easier for the Agricultural Credit Corporation to lend and to make it easier for farmers to borrow. It will be judged in practice by its success in fulfilling this double objective. It is possible to have a good Bill and to have a credit corporation so cautions that it will not make it easier to lend and not make it easier to borrow.  I believe the whole spirit of the debate and the spirit in which the Government introduced the Bill is to effect that double purpose.</P>
      <P>I remember reading nearly 20 years ago a pamphlet published by the Statistical Society of Ireland written by Dr. Beddy, which made a statistical comparison of Denmark and Ireland. He divided it into two parts: first, the natural advantages of each country, and, second, the benefits accruing from what man had done with these natural advantages.  In the first part, there was no question statistically but that Ireland had the advantage all the way&mdash;the natural advantages of wealth of soil, distribution of rainfall and so on.  In the second part, what man had done with these advantages, Denmark had the advantage all the way&mdash;in production per farmer, production per agricultural labourer, the capital investment per farm, per acre and the amount of money&mdash;this is very close to what we are now considering&mdash;lent to farmers by the farmers' co-operative banks.</P>
      <P>There are a number of reasons in the history of this country why we might seem to lag behind Denmark. I do not think we have to be ashamed of that, provided we are determined to try, so far as it lies within our power, to catch up.  I think this measure attempts to do that in placing at the disposal of the farmer a little more of that vitally necessary capital which would be capable of transforming the whole aspect of Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> I agree with Senator O'Quigley, however, that this £10,000,000 is, quite clearly, not going to be enough.  The N.F.A. issued most of us with a detailed document stating what they think of this Bill, which they welcome in general terms.  Appended to it is a table of the advances made by the Agricultural Credit Corporation from 1928 to 1960.  I do not propose to quote all the figures, but I propose to quote the figures from 1947 on.  They are as follows: 1947, £406,000; 1948, £203,000; 1949, £185,000; 1950, £319,000; 1951, £380,000; 1952, £540,000; 1953, £552,000; 1954, £799,000; 1955, £614,000; 1956, £448,000; 1957, £349,000; 1958, £419,000; 1959, £702,000; 1960, £805,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the point that the aggregate of loans issued by the Agricultural Credit Corporation since 1928 right down to 1960 was £9,442,696.  It was, in fact, over the whole period, something like the £10,000,000 about which we are talking now.  Never in any given year did it much exceed £800,000.  I would consider, granted the very limited extent to which agriculture is capitalised in this country, that those sums are a miserable amount; they are far too few and represent an attitude of caution which is well nigh criminal in the circumstances of this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if it would be possible for him to give us the figures relating to the years from 1947 down, not just of the amounts granted, but, first, of the numbers of farmers who made applications and, second, of the amounts asked.  I would be prepared to bet that the applications made and the amounts asked were very far in excess of the amounts granted.  I would suggest that that excess represents the degree of caution of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, which was almost pathologically afraid to take any risk whatever in lending any money to farmers.  It is a wellknown fact in this country that for a farmer to borrow money, he has to prove absolutely he does not require <Col N="200" /> it.  If there is any suggestion he needs the money, he does not get the loan.</P>
    <P>The point is made in subsection (1) of Section 7, paragraph (b) that the Corporation shall be entitled to receive deposits of money from co-operative societies.  I should like to see that extended so that the Agricultural Credit Corporation would be entitled to accept deposits of money direct from farmers.  That would seem to be a logical step towards the system obtaining in Denmark, where a very large percentage of the capital investment in farming is provided by the farmers themselves.  Is there any reason why the Corporation should not receive deposits from farmers and pay them a rate of interest in excess of the rate of interest they would get from the Post Office?  Why should they not pay to farmers a rate of three-and-a-half per cent. on deposits made, in order to get from the farmers some of the money which would go to the financing of agriculture?  I should feel inclined to put down an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer to the excellent section&mdash;perhaps the central section from the point of view of the future of the country&mdash;Section 8 of the Bill, in which the Corporation is entitled to participate in certain schemes and projects relating to agriculture. I do not want to dwell too long at this late hour on this point. It seems to me of absolutely capital importance that the Corporation should be allowed, as it is allowed under the terms of this section, to engage in schemes and projects, to encourage them, to finance them and to inquire into how they are going.  That seems to me to be an indication that the Government intend the Corporation to take something more than a passive interest in agriculture, that they will be prepared to take an active interest in it which could lead to all kinds of developments by force of example and experiment.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the question of the interest being charged to farmers.  I believe the rate now being charged is six and a quarter per cent.  Senator O'Quigley was laughed at when he suggested interest-free loans.  Why <Col N="201" /> should that appear so funny?  Why should it appear funny that a Senator should get up and suggest interest-free loans should be made to those who are working in the front line of our major industry?  Senator Lenihan interjected that that sort of stuff was all right for Ballyhaunis fair.  I would be inclined to wager that the audience at Ballyhaunis fair would know a lot more about agriculture than the members of the Seanad.  If it is all right for them, it probably is a very good idea for agriculture.  I should like to hear some of the sneerers at this idea justifying their refusal even to contemplate seriously the suggestion that interest-free loans should be given to Irish farmers.  They are given to Swiss farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the fact that it is possible for the Government to underwrite certain things for the Corporation so that it could become possible.  I should like to see the Bill treated in that spirit rather than the spirit of thinking it quite impossible to do what can be done in Switzerland.  In New Zealand the farmers are charged at a rate of three per cent.; in France the rate is four per cent. for short-term loans; in Western Germany they are charged a rate of one per cent. per annum, and in Belgium three per cent. These facts are in the document of the N.F.A. supplied to us all.  They indicate that it is possible to do better by the farmers than we are doing.  I would urge very strongly upon the Minister the notion that the Agricultural Credit Corporation might well be helped with the powers in this Bill to reduce very. considerably the amount of interest charged to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a small point mentioned by the National Farmers Association but it is a point of quite considerable interest to farmers.  They say that farmers take exception to Garda inquiries in regard to their applications.  It is perfectly true that farmers applying for loans do not want other people, be <Col N="202" /> they Civic Guards, representatives of the Government or the Corporation or whoever they may be, coming around to see if they are creditworthy.  I suggest that sort of thing should be cut to the minimum.  I agree with Senator O'Quigley in praising what Senator O'Grady said because he was absolutely right in suggesting that to insist on a farmer supplying one or two guarantors is simply placing an obstacle&mdash;a psychological rather than a physical obstacle&mdash;in his path because he will hesitate, and the more honest he is, the more he will hesitate.</P>
    <P>It is all nonsense to suppose that the decision to force a farmer to get guarantors before he borrows is sound business practice; in fact I should say that sound business practice is for the Agricultural Credit Corporation to be encouraged to take risks and, if necessary, occasionally to lose money because, what bedevils the whole thing is the notion that if there is a balance sheet loss on any item or anything that looks like a bad debt&mdash;which is regarded as a run of the mill occurrence in business&mdash;it is regarded as a crime in the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  That is something we must fight&mdash;all this &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; for guarantors for a man who, after all, has a stake in the country, who has a farm and a house and can be got at far more easily than any other member of the community. To insist that he should provide guarantors is to make a farce of the whole matter of making money easily available to the farming community.</P>
    <P>Linked with that is what several Senators, particularly Senator O'Grady, said, the fact that the Irish farmer is creditworthy and that he tends, when he asks for a loan, to be able to justify that to the hilt and show that it will be used for useful purposes.  The remark was made, and I think it should be quoted here, by Mr. F.W. Gilmore, Deputy Governor of the U.S. Farm Credit Administration, in his report which was before both Houses. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An industrious small Irish farmer of good character who has not previously repudiated an obligation is worthy of credit up to £100 without <Col N="203" /> security other than his own good name.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is common sense and it is in that sense that I should like to see this Bill being implemented and to see that the powers that are being sensibly granted to the Agricultural Corporation in relation to the agricultural community, are sensibly and audaciously used for the purpose of making it easier, as I said at the beginning, to lend money to the agricultural community and making it easier for the farmer to borrow.  My hope then is that the Bill will be used imaginatively, that these new powers will be used imaginatively and courageously for these two purposes.</P>

      <P>Notwithsanding that some Opposition speakers attempted to tear the Bill to pieces, the real criticism made was that the measure was not sufficiently ambitious, not sufficiently wide or generous.  I should like to say the same thing.  If and when circumstances permit, I trust the Minister will be as generous in future years as he is this year.  I agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington that the Corporation may be, or may have been, a little overcautious in regard to risks.  They have been too cautious and I hope they will be a little less so in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would welcome a much lower rate of interest and, as a matter of fact, I agree with the Senators who say the rate of interest is too high. When you borrow at all, the interest is too high.  I have always found it so and I would welcome a much lower rate not only in the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation but also in the case of the commercial banks. Surely if people are forced by circumstances to borrow for the purchase of machinery in some cases, trucks, tractors, cars and television sets and <Col N="205" /> pay 12 per cent. interest&mdash;I think somebody mentioned as high a rate as 15 or 16 per cent.&mdash;surely 6½ per cent. is reasonable in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief.  I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.  I should like to see the money advanced by the Corporation spent on good husbandry. Like Senator Donegan, I feel people are going a bit too far in the purchase of machinery and many articles which are unnecessary.  These articles are being purchased simply because neighbours have them.  It is like the craze for motor cars and everything else.  I have a deep and abiding interest in good farming and good husbandry, in the feeding of potentially good cattle and in their disposal at as high a profit as possible.  That has been my policy since I was a young lad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commercial banks have a tremendous advantage over the Agricultural Credit Corporation because <Col N="206" /> they are located in towns all over the country.  They have local knowledge and experience.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation could not make the advances it should have made because it had no proper liaison.  It has been at a tremendous disadvantage all the time.  It is essential that the organisation should have some kind of information as to the credit-worthiness of farmers and their ability to meet their loan commitments, to say nothing of information as to the ability to increase the productivity of the land, thereby increasing their own and the nation's wealth.  Too much money has been put into machinery.  I have known the finest of Ransome threshers to be discarded the moment the combine harvester appeared.  Indeed, the Ransome thresher is looked upon in the same way as the bicycle; it is obsolete.</P>
    <P>I believe in liming the land, manuring the land, raising the standard and quality of one's cattle and one's crops. That is what will increase the farmers' income and the national income.  Giving loans will probably be detrimental in some respects because people will be involved in commitments they will not be able to meet.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am very anxious that the farmers should be made credit-worthy.  I interjected when Senator O'Donovan was speaking merely in order to ask a question.  I asked him where could one get money at two per cent?  This sum of £10,000,000 is not the limit.  If the Minister finds at some future date that more money is necessary, and that the money now provided has been spent usefully and judiciously to increase the productivity of the land and the farmers' income, there is nothing to prevent him coming here again and getting exactly the same reception as he has got tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister has brought in this Bill.  I think, however, that it is rather parsimonious. I took him to task on the Central Fund Bill with regard to the general approach to agriculture and the necessity there was to stimulate that industry more than any other industry.  In <Col N="207" /> 1959, when the Industrial Credit Corporation Bill was brought in, it was possible to increase the amount available from £5,000,000 to £15,000,000. I hope it will not be long before the Minister comes in here, and asks us to increase the sum available for the Agricultural Credit Corporation from £15,000,000 to £30,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator puts down an, amendment to that effect, I will accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  I think it is most desirable that it should be increased.  I shall be delighted to take the Minister up on that and I shall put down an amendment on the lines suggested, with, I am sure, the support of many of my colleagues here.</P>
      <P>In the Golden Vale, there are some 50,000 acres which are let every year on the 11-months system.  Most of the lettings are made because those who own the land cannot engage in the sort of husbandry to which Senator Brady referred.  For one reason or another, they have not got the money to invest in the land.  It may be a question of giving a dowry to a girl who wants to get her portion and so the money is not readily available for investment in the soil.  They keep ten, fifteen, or twenty acres.  They put some cattle on them and, little by little, they work their way back until, they are able to farm the lot themselves.  It would be far better if they farmed their own land all the time instead of letting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall probably be described as a neo-socialist, but I do not mind that. I cannot see why in a country town where there are already fifty public houses, at least four banks will compete to give someone the money to open another public house.  At the same time, a farmer will not be able to get a loan from any bank, unless he can find one or two people to go security for him.  If someone wants to build a dancehall or a cinema, the money is available at the same rate as it is made available for agricultural production.  When a farmer puts £100 on deposit, he gets half the rate of <Col N="208" /> interest the bank would pay if he had £15,000 or £20,000.  There seems to be a distinction drawn as between small, loans and big loans, but there is no difference made as between one sort of credit against another.</P>
    <P>Services with which the community is adequately supplied should be dealt with after a certain fashion.  If someone wants to engage in an enterprise which is not productive, he ought to pay the highest rate of interest.  Possibly a little lower rate should be demanded in the case of amenities. Industry ought to pay more than agriculture because agriculture is the most important item in the whole economy.  One way or another, we shall have to stimulate it.  I am very glad the Minister has taken up the challenge and that he will be prepared to increase the amount to £20,000,000 by way of amendment.  I shall certainly put down the necessary amendment. I thank the, Minister for so readily agreeing to increase the amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unfair to the House, at this late hour, to say all the things I should like to say. There has been a long debate on this Bill, which is not really an over-important measure.  All it proposes to do is to increase the share capital and the borrowing power of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and to allow it to go into competition with the banks in the matter of hire purchase. That, in substance, is what the Bill proposes to do.  Some of the speeches were overshadowed by what Senators. propose to say on the Appropriation Bill.  Hence, we had the type of debate that we had and some statements outside the scope of the measure, in my opinion.  That, of course, is a matter for the Chair.  It was refreshing to hear Senator O'Grady and Senator Burke, who seemed to be fairly practical and fairly critical of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not cynically welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for bringing it in because I am rather critical of the Corporation's affairs.  I have expressed that criticism whenever I got the opportunity.  I have referred to their ever-cautions financial policy. <Col N="209" /> The Minister hopes that there will be an improvement and hence he brings in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he could easily increase the borrowing powers of the Corporation.  If the Minister did increase the borrowing powers from £12 million to £20 million, does Senator Burke think that the Corporation would be able to use that money?  My opinion is that they would not be able to do so in the foreseeable future because of the ever-cautious financial policy they have operated in the past.  They have not succeeded in growing up and becoming an adult financial institution in competition with the commercial banks, as they should have done in their length of life.  The Corporation has been in existence a long time.  It has operated from one centre.  It has no agencies throughout the country.  It has not become adult. I hope there is a new approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say this.  I am not making a personal attack on members of the Corporation or the managing directors, as one speaker appeared to do.  Perhaps I took a wrong view of his speech.  I am not making any personal attack because I do not know anything about them.  I know only the results of their operations.  I know nobody connected with the Board.</P>
    <P>We have had suggestions by people who do not take this matter seriously. Senator Sheehy Skeffington and Senator O'Quigley suggested interest-free loans. I wonder did they give a moment's thought to the suggestion?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was done once before by Fianna Fáil, in 1947.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>If I get an interest-free loan, I can lend the money to Senator O'Donovan and I will get a rate for it.  I can lend it to Senator Burke, who may want it for some worthwhile proposition at a cheaper rate than the rate at which he can borrow from any source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall not allow Senator O'Donovan to make the sort of reference he got away with making to Senator Brady. He suggested that Senator Brady <Col N="210" /> jingled money in his pocket and that that was his idea of money.  I suggest that Senator O'Donovan jingles it in his mind.  It is easy enough for people to get half-baked ideas about money, but in the long run, it is on the ability of this country to give goods and services that credit is based and it cannot be based on anything else.  It is easy enough to get half-baked ideas and to make nasty references to Senator Brady.  I do not want to lose my temper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister's hope will be justified.  I heard a former Parliamentary Secretary, who is now a member of this House, on this side, expressing the genuine hope that the Board would grow up and be able to give better service to the farmer than the commercial banks gave.  That was when he was introducing the 1947 measure.  That hope has not been justified by the Corporation.  The Minister has the same hope and says he will increase the borrowing powers of the Board to £20 million.  I know quite well that they could not use £20 million but I hope the Minister's hopes will be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley said he hoped that when I got up, I would not say that no constructive suggestions had come from that side of the House and he advised me, if I thought that, to wait and read Senator O'Donovan's speech in case I had missed the constructive, suggestions.  I am afraid I will have to wait and read the speech.</P>
      <P>Not so much Senator O'Donovan but Senator Donegan and Senator O'Quigley set out to find fault with the Bill without trying to see if anything could be done to improve it in any way.  It was fault-finding all through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say, as I said here on the last debate, that I find the Fine Gael Party in the Dáil much more intelligent at any rate on Bills I bring in.  There was not the same approach to this Bill in the Dáil.  They discussed the Bill on <Col N="211" /> its merits, made suggestions, asked questions, and so on, and there was none of this cheap talk about putting in £10 million as the limit the farmers would get.  That is the most ridiculous suggestion ever made and it was Senator O'Quigley's contribution to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Senator O'Quigley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; it was his contribution. With regard to the six per cent., Senator O'Donovan said that if I had come in and said the rate would be three per cent., that would be much more useful than all my talk in introducing the Bill.  I could say back to Senator O'Donovan that if we can achieve in this country a better approach to agriculture by applicants and if they use the money they get intelligently and wisely, it will be a very much more important thing than giving it to them at three per cent. because, if a man gets a loan at three per cent. and does not use it, he loses money and never gets it back, whereas if a man gets a loan at six per cent. and uses it properly, he will be able to pay his six per cent, That is where the difference comes in.  Anybody can argue, of course, that the interest is too high and that it would be much better if it were low, but there are other considerations to be kept in mind.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley said that if I came to the Seanad and said that I was going to give £50,000 a year to help the Agricultural Credit Corporation to keep down interest rates and pay for their bad debts, he would applaud the Bill as it was being applauded on this side.  I explained in the Dáil very fully and in introducing the Bill here that the capital is being increased from £300,000 to £2 million. I said in the Dáil very plainly that the Corporation was to run its business, charge whatever it regarded as a reasonable rate of interest&mdash;the lowest possible, of course&mdash;and take risks.  I said there was no use in its being there if it would not take risks because the commercial banks would take any case where there was no risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="212" /> It was there for the purpose of taking risks.  If it loses money, we do not regard it as a crime.  I made that very plain to them.  Then when it paid for all its losses and so on, it would consider what interest it could pay on the £2,000,000.  If I have to forgo £120,000 a year or whatever the interest is on £2,000,000, that is all right.  If Senator O'Quigley had read my introductory speech, he would see I was prepared to contribute more than £50,000 a year to the Corporation in order to help it to keep the rate of interest at a reasonable level.  If I did not do that and the Corporation was going to take risks, it would have to make some calculation of what its losses would be.  If the losses were going to be two per cent. per year by way of bad debts, it would have to charge a higher rate of interest, so that the interest would be higher still. If it could pay a lower interest on the capital, it could keep its rates at a reasonable figure and take risks at the same time.</P>
    <P>The reason chattel mortgages were not used in the past was that they were administratively cumbersome. There were restrictions which were almost impossible to get over.  They were there by law and the Board could not get over them.  That is why the amount advanced on chattel mortgage was so very low.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator need not do that.  Let him read the Bill.  The Bill lays that down.  We are taking those restrictions away and the Corporation will be in the position to make a hire purchase deal the same as the ordinary banks can make it.  That should enable the Corporation to make loans for machinery and so on which were <Col N="213" /> mentioned here, just as well as any ordinary bank or hire purchase company can do it.  I hope it will be able to do it cheaper than these people are doing it.  At any rate, no unnecessary restrictions will be put upon the Corporation.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, appoints the members of the Board and amongst them a representative of the commercial banks is appointed, but it is not mandatory on the Minister to appoint a representative of the commercial banks.  I do not know when this arose first.  I suppose it was out of courtesy that the Minister reappointed one of the bank representatives when the obligation remained that he should appoint three.</P>
      <P>It is true, as Senator O'Donovan says, that the first chairman talked a lot about co-operation.  As a matter of fact, I remember going myself, as other Deputies did, with the first chairman to many meetings all over the country.  We all did that at the time. If there was a good thing Fianna Fáil supported&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether is was good or not, Fine Gael are opposed to it and do their best to quash it.  When we first started in opposition, we took a proper view of those things.  I went to many meetings with the chairman of the corporation, who was trying to organise credit societies.  He suggested on many occasions that the co-operative societies should try to form a credit society and, through these, the banks would then make their loans.  It would have been a good idea if it had been operative, but it was impossible to get the farmers to club together to form a credit society.  The chairman's idea was a very good one, indeed, but it was never adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan also spoke of the man living on a farm and not having administration taken out who was therefore ineligible to take a loan.  The Land Registry rules in 1959 made a change.  Where the valuation is below £40, they made the change that the registrar, if application is made to him, <Col N="214" /> can cancel the equities more or less following the rule of the Statute of Limitations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not equities at all.  This has nothing to do with equities.  This is a case where there is no land registry title extant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is where it arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Senator's Party were in power, why did they not make a grant of limited administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises mostly in this way and I am talking from experience. Suppose a grandfather was not fully sure of proper title.  He might have a few brothers in America but does not know what became of them.  He might not know whether his brothers had families or not.  The title went to this man's father and this man came into it next.  There is no doubt in that case that as far as he is concerned, he got it from his father and the father got it from the grandfather.  They can go back more than 30 years.  In that case, the man can get himself registered as the owner and that is the end of it. Everything is all right.  Let us take the case where the doubt arises.  The owner himself may have a brother in America of whom he never heard.  In that case, it will be a much longer procedure.  He will have to be there for 30 years before the matter can be fixed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Donegan raised a question which was also raised by Senator Sweetman in the Dáil.  He referred to a decline in the number of in-calf heifers. There has been a steady increase over the past five or six years.  There was a set-back in January this year but it was not a very serious one.  I do not think we should take it as a trend backwards again.  It may have been accidental, due to some cause which I have not been able to discover.  I asked one farmer because I thought he would be able to give me a fair reason for this.  He said it really did not pay to keep over heifers and have them in-calf.  Therefore, the number went down.  A few days afterwards, I met another farmer and I asked him how he was doing in regard to the business of in-calf heifers.  He replied: <Col N="215" />&ldquo;It is the one line in this country that pays; it is the best line of all.&rdquo;  There you had one farmer saying it was no good and another saying it was the best line of all.  It is very hard to get an explanation.  We need not take it too seriously.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan talked about Denmark and said that the farmers there are getting a 50 per cent increase in direct help.  He tried to give the impression that we are endeavouring to say we are doing the same thing.  We are not saying we are doing the same thing.  If Denmark is giving another £12 million for subsidies, are we to say that we had better not bring in this Bill at all because some foolish man like Senator Donegan, suggests that?  It would be impossible to do business in that manner.</P>
    <P>Let us get some more reliable authority than Senator Donegan.  The last Report of the O.E.E.C. on the matter of giving help to agriculture was in 1955-56.  At any rate, it gives the comparative figures at the time. The total State assistance to agriculture was 4.9 per cent. of gross national product and the percentage in Britain, Austria, the Netherlands and Switzerland was 2.  The percentage in Belgium, France, West Germany and Denmark was 1.  So in 1955-56 we were giving 4.9 per cent of our gross national product to agriculture and Denmark were giving I per cent.  Since that, as Senators are aware, the amount we are giving has doubled.  I do not know if Denmark have doubled theirs, but they would have to multiply it 16 times to be up to us, and Senator Donegan asked what we were doing for agriculture compared with Denmark. I should like to remind Fine Gael stalwarts that I am quoting the 1956 figures.  Of course, I can quote them because they are now double what they were then.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan wound up with another political gibe, of course, which we are so accustomed to getting from him.  He said it might be better to subsidise the rate of interest in respect to agriculture rather than to purchase more jet airplanes.  The two things are completely different.  If we subsidise the lending rates on agriculture that <Col N="216" /> must be taken out of current account, year after year&mdash;not once but every year.  If we buy jet airplanes and make a success of them we get our interest back.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, it was your friend.  I want to say again that if we subsidise the lending rates, that is a current expense and must be met by the Budget and so on, year after year, and if we buy jet airplanes and, as I said, make them pay, we get the interest back on that money every year instead of giving it out.  That is quite a different thing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to get Fine Gael to look at anything in a rational manner.  They are prejudiced against anything which Fianna Fáil try to make a success of.  Senator Lenihan spoke of the Gilmore principle, as it were, of having provincial centres throughout the country.  I do not think that would be possible.  It would be terribly expensive.  Senator O'Grady also mentioned that point.  It would be very expensive and I do not think that, even taking the most optimistic view of the amount of business the Corporation do, we could justify the <Col N="217" /> expense of having these centres throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The idea is to have credit officers&mdash; perhaps two for a start, maybe more&mdash; who would visit the applicant who seeks a loan at a certain level.  The credit officer would visit the applicant and have a talk with him about his position.  If the applicant wants to, he can show his farm or his stock, and that is all right but the inspector&mdash;if you like to so call him&mdash;will not force himself on the applicant.  His main job is to have a talk with him.</P>
      <P>That is the idea and I think it is an idea that should be followed for the moment, at any rate, until it grows bigger.  Under a certain level it would not pay, because the cost of sending the inspector down to visit the applicant&mdash;after all there are applications for £100, £150 and £200&mdash;and the cost of his day, his travelling expenses and other allowances, would be a very big amount to add to that loan.  It would, in fact, be too big and, therefore, that has to be dealt with in another way.</P>
      <P>We now come to the point: how will they be dealt with?  Up to this they write to the Garda Síochána.  I think the Corporation are not very keen on employing the Garda Síochána but what is the alternative?  After all, they cannot give a loan just because a person asks for it.  They must make some inquiry.  Every Senator will admit I think, even though he may be a very innocent man, that there are chancers in this country.  Therefore some examination must be made of the application and the applicant and the simplest thing for the moment is to ask the Garda Síochána.  If another scheme can be suggested that is just as good, I shall certainly convey it to the Board for their consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Grady talked about making loans to creameries.  That is a very good idea.  It goes back to the original idea of the Chairman who started the Corporation.  If the creameries want to get money to lend to their members and especially if they take the responsibility, as it were, of collecting the loan out of the milk <Col N="218" /> cheque, there is no doubt they will be lent money.  There would be no hesitation about it.  That is a good idea in many ways.</P>
    <P>It is said the Corporation ask for guarantors.  Perhaps because I am the Minister in touch with the Corporation, I get a great number of letters from people looking for loans.  The Corporation seldom ask for guarantors. The usual thing is to get a mortgage and once there is a mortgage, no guarantor is asked for.  Sometimes one mortgage is not sufficient or there may be a second mortgage and the applicant says: &ldquo;We have not enough security so we will get a guarantor as well,&rdquo; but that is only the occasional case.  Under this new power, they can charge the land.  It may be much simpler than a mortgage.  A mortgage means the signing of two huge documents&mdash;it is like voting for the Seanad when there were 80 names on one page.</P>
    <P>Now the man applies for the loan and if the Corporation think it is all right, they say: &ldquo;Yes, we will give it. Do you agree to our charging the land in the Registry?&rdquo; and he writes and says: &ldquo;I agree.&rdquo;  That is all he has to do.  They do the rest and do not charge him.  They do not say: &ldquo;You owe us so much for having it charged.&rdquo;  There is no Land Registry fee and no stamp fee and the Corporation does the necessary correspondence.  This will make it easier for the Corporation to give loans and it will certainly make it much more simple for the applicant.</P>
    <P>We come now to the matter of the £1,000,000.  Every Bill of this type brought in here&mdash;for example, the Electricity Supply Bill and the Bill dealing with Bord na Móna&mdash;has a limit.  There must be a limit.  The idea of that limit at the beginning was to curb the Government and nothing else. It was put there in the beginning because the Opposition said: &ldquo;We want the Government to come back to us again after a certain amount of money has been spent.&rdquo;  That is the idea behind it: the Government say: &ldquo;We want £5,000,000,&rdquo; and the Opposition say: &ldquo;All right; when you have spent that money, come back to us again and we will have a discussion about how things are going.&rdquo;  The idea of the <Col N="219" /> limit is that the Dáil in particular and the Oireachtas in general shall control the spending of public money.</P>
    <P>They have the control there by saying: &ldquo;You can spend that much but no more.  Come back to us when that is spent.&rdquo;  That was why we did not want to go too far.  Now they are handing out £800,000 this year. Suppose they double that next year. I do not think they could do more. I think it would cost too much.  There is about five years' spending there before they will come back again.  As well as the £10 million, there will be £2 million capital, which means £12 million.  There is £3 million out at present so they have £9 million to spend before looking for more.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley tries to give the impression to the farmers on this side &mdash;there are no farmers on that side&mdash; that we are not friendly to the farmers. You need not look around you&mdash;there are no farmers in your Party.  They never had any farmers in that Party.</P>

      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked if I could give any figures about the amount of money applied for and spent in the past few years.  I have figures only for the past couple of years but they may be some indication of what the Senator wants.  In the past two years, the Agricultural Credit Corporation issued 1,938 and 2,084 loans respectively.  The number of applicants refused loans in those two-years represented about 18 per cent. of the total number of applications received.</P>
      <P>One thing we must keep in mind is that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is largely the lender of last resort. I have received several letters in my time from people who were refused by the joint stock banks and then, having been refused by them, they tried the Agricultural Credit Corporation. You will naturally, therefore, expect to find a fairly large number of refusals. I should like to repeat that I personally have told the board of the Agricultural Credit Corporation that they should take risks.  I said: &ldquo;You will not find me coming back and reprimanding you if you lose money on this thing by taking risks.&rdquo;  As I explained already, by putting in £2 million capital, we say to them: &ldquo;If you do take risks and lose, then I shall suffer.  In other words, when you come to pay me the dividend on whatever you have left, if you are taking risks on losses, I know the dividend will be small.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation can take deposits now.  I think there was <Col N="221" /> some difficulty up to this.  However, we shall be able to deal with this on Committee Stage.  The board of the Agricultural Credit Corporation are preparing a scheme.  Their office is in Dublin.  They have no branches throughout the country and they are therefore at a disadvantage in taking deposits from farmers.  It is possible that they may devise a scheme such as bonds, and so on.  They are being freed in one respect in this Bill inasmuch as they need not insist on a 30 days' notification before a deposit is withdrawn, as they had to do up to this.</P>

Their purpose is to extend liability for jury service to women, except women who are mothers of children under ten years of age.  I accept your ruling, of course, but it seems to me that, the stated purpose of the Bill being to remove the onerous burden from the shoulders of male jurymen, that purpose would be served by extending the liability to women.

      <P>This is the section in which, as the Minister told us on the previous occasion, the practice which now obtains in Dublin is extended.  I think I am not distorting his words when I say he said the purpose of this section was to relieve the burden on jurors in Cork.  I notice it is also now to apply to Limerick and Waterford.</P>
      <P>If the purpose of the Bill is to relieve the pressure upon Cork jurors, it seems to me that portion of this section does not serve that purpose.  It relates to Limerick and Waterford.  I should like to hear the Minister upon the necessity to extend it to these two cities.</P>

      <P>Whenever a panel of jurors is lawfully in attendance before a commissioner under a commission <i>de lunatico inquirendo,</i> then, for the purpose of the application of Part V of the Principal Act, the commissioner shall be a court and also the judge of such court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment would mean that the phrase would read: &ldquo;the commissioner shall be deemed to be a court and also the judge of such court.&rdquo;  In reading the Bill it seemed to me absurd to imagine that we in the Oireachtas have the power to turn a commissioner into a court and I wondered if he is the court where is the panel of jurors going to sit?  You have got a jury in this court and the court is the commissioner. <Col N="224" /> Does the jury have to sit in the commissioner's lap?  Are we not making ourselves ridiculous by saying that the commissioner shall be a court and also the judge?  It seems to me that he will have to try to swallow himself if he is to be both court and judge and contain an extraneous body such as a panel of jurors.  It would be more logical to say that we deem him to be the judge and deem him to be the court.</P>

      <P>We find in the Agricultural Credit Bill that the Government are going back to other Acts and you find that in other legislation. Senator Sheehy Skeffington may be under some kind of misapprehension when he talks about a jury sitting in the lap of the court.  That kind of statement reminds me of the story of Lott's wife being turned into a pillar of salt.  Here we have a kind of living metamorphosis whereby the commissioner is turned into a building of stone.  No such thing was intended or envisaged in the 1927 Act.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington might know that there is a phrase, frequently used in statutes of ancient origin and in statutes of more recent and modern origin, which refers to a court consisting <Col N="225" /> of three judges or a court consisting of five judges, and a court, Senator Sheehy Skeffington will be pleased to know, will be relieved from the nightmare of having a panel of jurors sitting in the lap of a single commissioner.</P>

      <P>This Bill is necessary because of a shortage of jurors, because of the difficulty of getting juries for the many cases for which jurors are now used and because it has been found that juries have to act too <Col N="226" /> frequently.  The fact of the matter is that, at present, juries are acting in a great number of civil cases as well as in criminal cases.  They are acting, for instance, in the ordinary running-down actions which are quite distinct from criminal actions or from defamation actions.  In my opinion, it is quite unnecessary to have a jury in the ordinary running-down action or in many of the cases in which they are used at present.  It does not strictly arise under the Bill, but I believe that the Minister should look into the possibility and desirability of limiting the type of case in which juries are used, limiting them to criminal cases and to a certain category of civil cases such as defamation cases, where a jury is necessary. They are quite unnecessary in many of the civil actions heard today and the Minister should consider the possibility of introducing amending legislation to deal with the problem.</P>
