      <P>That surely is an unreasonable programme.  I think it reasonable to say that this House has proved itself very co-operative to Ministers.  What I should like to suggest is a modification of this fearsome list of Bills in front of us.  In the first place, we promised the Minister for Industry and Commerce yesterday that we would take all Stages of the Tourist Traffic Bill next week and that will be done.  For this week and next week, when I hope we could adjourn, we could do Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 as on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>There are then four very substantial Bills from the Department of Justice which deal with law.  One of these, No. 7, the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill, 1959, is a short Bill but it is a very important Bill.  If it betokens any doubt as to the position of the courts, I think we ought to do it and as far as we are concerned, we are prepared to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Civil Liability Bill, 1960, which was, I think, originally based on a text book, has been considerably altered in the other House.  The Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, 1959, is a very big Bill with more than 50 sections and eight Schedules.  The Defamation Bill, 1961, is a technical Bill.  I think we should not be asked to deal with this Bill this side of the Adjournment because the Second Stage of the Bill, if we agree to it, and we will, in any circumstances, would lead to a Committee <Col N="1604" /> Stage.  It is the kind of Bill which really requires consideration by a Special Committee.</P>
    <P>These Bills can get no real consideration, I do suggest in all seriousness and in all reasonableness, at this moment and in this atmosphere.  If we do pass an amendment, the Dáil will not be reassembled to consider it.  First and foremost, my friends opposite&mdash;I have already told Senator Ó Ciosáin my view&mdash;will make sure that we do not pass any amendment, no matter how reasonable.  If we did, I am perfectly certain that the Taoiseach, who is a seasoned warrior, would do no such thing as reassemble the Dáil. What he said yesterday was: &ldquo;The Dáil may be reassembled&rdquo; and he certainly will not in the atmosphere of an election bring the Dáil back to deal with an amendment.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the Seanad can meet after the election and do these Bills in the interval between the assembly of the new Dáil and the election of the new Seanad and that is a reason why I say that we should not do them now in this session.  These Bills have taken years to hatch in the Department and it is unreasonable, unfair and a prostitution of the whole process of Parliamentary procedure to expect us to do them now in a hurry. I think we ought not be asked to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been the practice here to declare the Order <Col N="1605" /> of business and allow comment upon that order.  Indeed, it is generally agreed and I think Senator Ó Ciosáin and everybody will recognise that there has generally been co-operation on the matter.  I suggest that there is agreement now but that it excludes consideration of three big technical Bills which we have no machinery to consider.</P>

      <P>The nature of the programme with which we have been asked to deal at the end of the session has been discussed between Senators in the past ten days or so.  I know, of course, that a large chunk of this programme, as I said yesterday, is in the nature of election literature and we are giving the Government all their election literature.  The Defamation Bill, the Civil Liability Bill and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill will, I hope, not become subjects for discussion in the election and the election will not be concerned in any way with them.  This House has prided itself that when big technical Bills come in here, they get the kind of examination they frequently do not get in the other House.  The fact of the matter is that there would be no trouble at all in keeping this House for another fortnight on these Bills.  There is enough material in them to talk about until the cows come home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Hayes has said, the custom and tradition in this House has been to give the Government, whatever Government are in office, what they reasonably require and certainly the suggestion that the first five Bills on the Order Paper should be dealt with completely before the recess and No. 7, if the Government feel it should be dealt with&mdash;although indeed it is a very odd Bill&mdash;is, I think, a very fair and reasonable approach to the absurd position that has arisen because the Government did not continue the tradition instituted by the inter-Party Government of originating Bills in this House.  If that had been done, there would be no need for this congestion at the end of the session.  We are now already in the first week in August and will go into the second.  But if we are <Col N="1606" /> to sit here for the whole month of August, so be it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Leader of the House is aware that the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill reached the hands of Senators only this morning?  We are to be asked, 24 years after the enactment of the Constitution which provides for the establishment of courts, to give a Second Reading to a Bill which we have had in our hands for a few hours.  We are now to be asked to do in 24 hours what the Government failed to do in 24 years.  I think that it is most unreasonable.</P>
      <P>I should also like to address a question, through the Chair, to the Leader of the House.  Is he aware that in the Fourth Schedule of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, there are 72 statutes which are being adapted for the purposes of the Bill, and that in the Fifth Schedule, there are another 31 statutes dealt with and then 20 statutes which are amended in whole or in part in another Schedule?  Unless this Parliament is to become a laughing stock, or a machine through which Bills are passed in and out, how is anybody to have the opportunity of examining this Bill in detail?  So much for that Bill.</P>
      <P>The Civil Liability Bill is in the same position.  We did not get it until this morning.  How are we supposed to give it a Second Reading when we have not had the opportunity of studying, even in broad outline, what the Bill contains?  The Leader of the House should consider another Standing Order, that is, the Standing Order which requires that Seanad Éireann should get three or four days notice of Bills before they are asked to consider them.  That is a very important Standing Order also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Éamon Ó Ciosáin Éamon Ó Ciosáin">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I do not want to steamroll the Seanad or anything like that.  What I want to do is dispose of the business we have before us.  These Bills have been passed by Dáil Éireann and it would be wrong to leave them hanging in the air after Dáil Éireann has gone into recess for the summer holidays. Whether Dáil Éireann will or will not <Col N="1607" /> come back again after the summer holidays is not for me to say.</P>
      <P>I do not think that it can be said we are rushing these Bills as quickly as some of the members opposite try to persuade us we are doing.  It is true they have come to us from the Dáil, but at the same time, these Bills have been in our hands for longer than that.  There is no doubt about that. There should have been time to read them for those members who are interested in them.  Some members will be interested in one Bill and others will be specially interested in another Bill, and so on, and we all have a general interest in all the Bills. I think there is nothing wrong with presenting these Bills to the Seanad because, after all, we have not been burdened with so much work during the past six months and if we have to sit a week or two extra, there can be nothing wrong with that.  We are prepared to sit next week and the week after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ó Ciosáin says that these Bills have been with us for some time.  When I got the Civil Liability Bill, I read it right through, but it has been amended since and requires complete re-reading. The same applies to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill.  It has been amended extensively in the Dáil and the fact that one has read it already does not avail anything at this stage.  If the Government want to get these Bills, I see no reason why they should not get them and there is no objection to their getting them at the earliest possible date.  I think the Seanad should adjourn consideration of these Bills until some time towards the middle of September.  In the meantime, there would be ample time to consider them and have amendments drafted.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Workers (Holidays) (Amendment) Bill, 1961&mdash;Second and Committee Stages.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend and extend the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts, 1950 and 1952, so as to provide additional holidays for agricultural workers.  Under existing legislation, an agricultural worker is entitled to six holidays in each year of continuous employment or to one holiday in every two months of continuous employment.  Sundays and such half-holidays, public holidays and Church holidays as are allowed to the worker by arrangement with his employer do not count as holidays under the 1950 Act.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for an increase in the number of holidays to be allowed to an agricultural worker from six to twelve in each year of continuous employment, or a holiday in each month of continuous employment instead of the present allowance of one holiday for each two months continuous employment. Under the 1950 Act, a worker who is entitled to three or more holidays in any year is entitled to take them on consecutive days.  If he is continuously employed for the year he is entitled to take up to six days consecutively.  In the Bill before the House he will be entitled to take twelve days in two separate periods of six days each.  Workers and employers may, as heretofore, make such arrangements as they wish in regard to the way the holidays are to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators are, no doubt, aware some agricultural employers are accustomed to giving their workers free days off with full wages to attend sporting and other events held on a day other than a Sunday, Church holiday or public holiday.  This Bill provides that where such a practice exists such free day or days may be reckoned as an offset against the worker's holidays subject to such offset being limited to six holidays in a year. Under this provision workers can still avail themselves of such privilege days <Col N="1610" /> with full pay while employers who have been generous enough to grant them will not be treated unfairly by making it compulsory on them to give the full twelve holidays in addition.</P>
    <P>With regard to the current year, the Bill provides that holidays should be allowed to a worker at the old rate of one day for every two months of continuous employment up to the date of commencement of the new Act and, thereafter, at the rate of one day for each month of continuous employment. The provisions I have outlined are designed to bring about a substantial improvement in the holiday conditions of agricultural workers without being unfair to the interests of employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome this Bill.  It is, of course, parallel legislation to the Bill we dealt with last night in regard to holidays.  Quite properly, it has a great degree of flexibility because that is necessary in the agricultural industry. The provision whereby free days can be arranged between employer and employee, which already exists, is a good one.  Most of us who live in the country know that, for example, the day of the local race meeting in certain areas is normally taken by the agricultural worker as a free day.  I think also that the flexibility this Bill contains is good from the point of view of the excellent arrangement of hours that is in existence between agricultural employers and employees inasmuch as each seems to help the other out.  We should welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Like the Bill we had yesterday, I am sorry it did not reach us sooner.  I have never quite understood why it has been necessary to provide in two separate pieces of legislation for somewhat similar conditions of service for industrial and agricultural workers. It seems to me that what we are doing is bringing the minimum holidays up to what is generally applicable as a result of trade union negotiations over the past 15 years or so.  We provided for that minimum being legally enforceable in the Bill we adopted yesterday in regard to industrial workers, <Col N="1611" /> and now we are dealing with agricultural workers.  Would the Minister in his reply explain why it is necessary to have two separate pieces of legislation? We all support the principle that agricultural workers and, indeed, anybody connected with agriculture should be able to get as good a livelihood and as good conditions of employment in agricultural work as his urban counterpart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  There is no doubt that the agricultural worker and his employer had always the best of relations, and this Bill shows clearly that those good relations are to continue.  From what I know of the arrangements between employer and employee in agricultural service, when the employee wanted a holiday at any given period, he got it on request.  I am glad to see the 12 days provided for in this Bill, though I am sure that the majority of these workers had ten or 20 days holidays. I welcome the Bill and I am sure that every agricultural employer will welcome it also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. Ted O'Sullivan Mr. Ted O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if this Bill improves the lot of agricultural workers generally or not?  Like the previous speaker, I have never heard of any trouble between employer and employee with regard to holidays, at any rate, because, generally speaking, the agricultural worker has opportunities of getting holidays that possibly other workers have not got&mdash;for instance, wet or frosty days and so on, on which not much work can be done on the land.  If the worker feels like taking the day off, he gets permission.  I do not know any agricultural worker who was confined to six days holidays heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if this Bill means that in addition to the six or seven Church holidays he has off, and the other days he will get off for one purpose or another, such as race meetings, he will be entitled also to 12 days?  Will he have about 21 days holidays in the year?  Is that being made compulsory? It is a good thing that this Bill has been brought in because not all employers are the same and possibly the same conditions do not exist <Col N="1612" /> everywhere, though I do not know any farmer who did not give more than 12 days holidays in the year.  I should like to know if this means that the employer is compelled to give 12 days holidays, or to give 12 along with the seven Church holidays and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the employers of agricultural labourers in Cork are so good, because it is my experience that there are agricultural workers in and around County Dublin who never had a holiday in their lives, except, of course, Church holidays when the boss would be ashamed to have them working, until the last few years, when whatever was done was got through the trade unions.  It is very nice to hear that the agricultural employers in Cork are as considerate as we have been told here.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  I am very glad that at long last the agricultural worker is to take his place in the ranks of the nation's workers and is not an outcast as heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertLahiffe" hpid="Mr. Lahiffe Mr. Lahiffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lahiffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Sullivan, I doubt whether this Bill will in fact give any improvement, especially to agricultural employees in the West of Ireland.  I welcome it in so far as, on paper at least, it will give the agricultural worker to understand that he is placed on the same pedestal as his companion in industry.  The sooner we get the agricultural worker on the same level as his companion in industry, the better it will be for the agricultural community as a whole.  I doubt whether the agricultural workers in the west will get any advantage whatever, and I think other Senators from midland and western areas will agree, because as far as I know, the agricultural worker is living as a member of the family who employ him and can get a day's holiday any day he wishes, and is paid for it.  I hope this Bill will not interfere in any way with that relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as, on paper, it places the agricultural worker on the same level as the worker, maybe his own brother, in industry.  The sooner I see the agricultural and the industrial workers getting the same <Col N="1613" /> wages, the better I shall like it and the better inducement will be given to those workers to remain in agricultural employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very glad to welcome this Bill if I could convince myself that it meant in fact an improvement in the holidays of agricultural workers but, so far as I can see, the Bill will not change the position regarding holidays for these workers.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1950 gave six days annual holidays which did not include six public holidays but there is no guarantee that the employer will not now say that the six Church holidays enjoyed by the agricultural workers constitute six of the twelve days mentioned in the Bill and which he is now legally bound to give his workers.  If this is so, then the worker is not, in fact, one day's holiday the richer by the operation of this measure which, at first glance, seemed to give a great lift to what is still a depressed class of worker.  To bring the agricultural worker with his wages lagging far behind his industrial brother to the same level of holidays as the man in industrial employment would require that Section 2 (1) (a) of the new Bill should read</P>
      <P>&ldquo;eighteen holidays where the worker is continuously employed by him during that year&rdquo;</P>
      <P>because, in the Holidays (Employees) Bill, 1961, the wording is &ldquo;fourteen consecutive whole holidays including two Sundays&rdquo; and then six other Church or public holidays are named as statutory holidays in addition.</P>
      <P>Is it fair, I would ask the Minister, that we should continue to treat our skilled, most valuable agricultural workers as second-class citizens to whom we give only the lowest possible wages and the fewest possible holidays?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During wars or national emergencies, it is the agricultural worker who saves the day for us and many millions of other people.  This underpaid, underprivileged agricultural worker is the man who feeds the nation but when danger has passed, he is left forgotten in his poverty or near-poverty, much <Col N="1614" /> in the same way as the common British soldier of long ago days was treated and whose plight was summed up by Kipling when he said:</P>
    <P>It's Tommy this and Tommy that</P>
    <P>When the guns begin to shoot,</P>
    <P>But when the war is over</P>
    <P>It's kick him out, the brute!</P>
    <P>I am sorry to see also that the Minister did not, in this amending Bill, take the opportunity to correct the definition of &ldquo;agricultural employer&rdquo; who because he can prove his main income is not derived from agriculture, can avail of a legal loophole to evade the terms of the Holidays Acts and deprive agricultural workers of their rights under them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see that this Bill has been welcomed by speakers from all sides of the House. There will be very little difficulty about implementing it.  The wise employer in agriculture will be only too anxious to facilitate good workers when he has them.  He knows that unless he treats them fairly, no matter how careful he may be in looking after them, they can take reprisals in their own way which he cannot overcome.  Besides, it is so difficult nowadays to get agricultural workers to remain on the land that every progressive farmer, in his own interests, will treat his employees fairly and give them the holidays to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>It is not general throughout the country but, here and there, particularly in a home where sobriety rules, we have the industrious agricultural worker with his little car, just like the farmer.  Thank God, I have lived to see that day.  I hope that under the new system which will obtain in Europe, the agricultural worker will be treated at least as well as his brother in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have known men who left the land to go into industrial employment a few miles away.  Perhaps they felt they would not have to work so hard; perhaps they felt they would not have the same hardships in regard to weather, and so on, which those working on the land must bear.  Nevertheless, the man who is a farmer or a farm worker and who was born on the land would prefer <Col N="1615" /> to continue in that occupation, irrespective of remuneration, provided he can obtain a fairly decent livelihood.</P>
    <P>Despite all the criticisms of native government, I must say that, looking back over a fairly long lifetime, there have been some wonderful improvements in this country.  I remember seeing undernourished young children in Dublin city.  Today, it is a joy to behold the well-nourished children in this city.  It shows they are being well fed and well cared for.</P>
    <P>I am sure that in this enlightened age employers will realise it is in their interests to treat their employees fairly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill can scarcely be said to satisfy everybody on every point but it is necessary to keep in mind that there are conflicting interests to be satisfied in the matter of holidays and conditions for agricultural workers.  We must keep very much in mind the diverse pattern of our farms and our farming.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy asked why there should be two Bills, one following the other, one on the industrial side and the other on the agricultural side.  I think the diversity of the pattern of farming is one of the reasons why it is felt a separate Bill is more likely to benefit that situation than to try to weld the entire working community of the State, regardless of their occupation, into one measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to industrial workers, office workers, and so on, some factories and offices designate a particular two weeks in the year or a fixed and known period during which all of their workers are allowed on holiday at the one time and the entire premises or works are closed down.  Our farms cannot be switched on and off, nor can there be any close-down at any time of the year.  It is a difficult and complex problem and one which could not be covered by an umbrella measure such as is possible in the industrial sphere.  With the traditional good relationships, despite what some might think, between our farm workers and our farmers, the position is not on a par with the employer-employee relationship. <Col N="1616" /> It is not so clearly distinguished as it is in other walks of life.</P>
    <P>The farm worker, in the great majority of cases, is one of the household and one of the family.  There may be instances where he is not quite that, but, by and large, the relationship is of a co-operative kind and, of necessity, it is so.  That we should deal with this matter of holidays in not too strict a manner is in keeping with the tradition that exists between farm workers and farmers.  The pattern of our farming, the needs of our farmers and the diversity of the work on our farms dictate that there should be looseness in these things so that the co-operation of the workers and the farmers can be used to the benefit both of the worker and the employer.</P>
    <P>By and large, the answer to the Senator, who raised the point of the two separate measures dealing with the two groups of workers, is that it is better all round that we should have this separate approach to our agricultural workers in respect of their holiday conditions because of the dissimilarity between their pattern of life, their work and, indeed, their relationship with their employers, which is much more personal, than the pattern in the industrial field.  That we should have a separate measure is all to the good and in fact serves the intention better than if we tried to lump them all together as would seem at first glance to be the appropriate thing to do.</P>
    <P>It was said that there seems to be no improvement in this Bill as against the 1950 Act.  I think the plain fact of the matter is that there is the improvement in regard to the number of holidays and the length of holidays which is double, under this measure, what was designated in the 1950 Act. I know of quite a number of cases myself where it was said that over-all the bringing in of the right to 12 holidays may not be an improvement but it is an improvement on the law. It may not be an improvement in practice.  I know that the loose co-operative, friendly, personal terms on which our agricultural workers get on <Col N="1617" /> with their employers ensure that in very many cases compulsion or right has never been raised as to the number of holidays that an employee may get or has been getting by tradition over a long number of years.</P>
    <P>On the strict interpretation of the Bill as proposed and the Act as it has been in operation since 1950, there is the net improvement of six days over the six that were already there.  In other words, there are 12 days now as against six.  That is superimposed on the conditions applying otherwise in regard to Church holidays, public holidays and half-holidays and such like.  There is no worsening in that regard.  The 12 days are an addition to whatever was there already and to what has been enjoyed.  That is to be compared with the six days granted under the 1950 Act.  There is that net improvement when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the absence of a new definition of agricultural employee, agricultural worker, or agricultural employer gives a legal let-out for certain employers to evade their responsibilities to their workers. The definition which is in existence at the moment is fairly wide.  In Section 2, paragraph (1) of the Agricultural Wages Act, 1936, it is stated:</P>
    <P>In this Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo; means a person employed under a contract of service or apprenticeship whose work under such contract is or includes work in agriculture, but does not include a person whose work under any such contract is mainly domestic service:</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;agricultural employer&rdquo; means a person who carries on the trade or business of agriculture and who employs other persons as agricultural workers for the purposes of such trade or business.</P>
    <P>(3) In this section the word &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; includes dairy-farming and the use of land as grazing, meadow, or pasture land or orchard or osier land or woodland or for market gardens or nursery grounds.</P>
    <P>I think that definition is pretty all-embracing <Col N="1618" /> in so far as those who work on and derive any substance from the soil are concerned.</P>
    <P>Over and above that, I cannot understand this idea of there being a let-out to avoid the responsibilities of employers to employees because if they can be said to get a let-out and if they get themselves out of the expression &ldquo;agricultural employer,&rdquo; then their employees must fall into the category of industrial workers under the Industrial Acts we have been discussing. I cannot see where the let-out is.  If the person is not caught under the one, he is caught under the other and in that sense there is no real let-out.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the expression of opinion and the conviction of some of the members here should be commented upon.  The bringing up of the conditions of our agricultural workers to compare not unfavourably with their counterparts in other walks of life, and in the industrial field in particular, is something to be desired.  I am fully and emphatically in agreement with that belief and that expression.</P>
    <P>Our agricultural workers, possibly without knowledge, are regarded as unskilled but they should not be regarded as such.  Indeed, it is becoming obvious throughout the country that the knowledge of these agricultural workers, even though they may not have had any specific academic training as such, and may not hold any diplomas or come from any particular university or school, nevertheless, is something which has been acquired down through the generations and the centuries.  That is something that places them in a category apart.  Far from being of an inferior status, in my opinion, they are the superior group without whom our agricultural community cannot hope to survive, not to mention progress, in the future. Anything we do to level up or even put these people ahead in the matter of their conditions of employment is in the very best interests, not only of the workers and the farmers but of the community in general.  This Bill does bring us in that direction and I think for that reason, if for no other, this <Col N="1619" /> is a measure which has been rightly and justly welcomed by all who spoke on it.</P>
    <P>The question of Church holidays was raised.  They are not to be reckoned for the purpose of this Bill as holidays.  No change has taken place as against the manner in which they are dealt with under the 1950 Act.  It will be for the farmers and the workers to make their own arrangements as heretofore in regard to these Church holidays. The worker and the farmer can arrange to have a Church holiday off and they can arrange to be paid or it can be so arranged that the worker may take the Church holiday off and will not get paid.  That is not being changed or altered in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the definition &ldquo;agricultural employer&rdquo; really meant a man whose main income comes from agriculture but a man might have a hotel or some business that would bring him an income and run the farm only as a sideline but employ a number of agricultural workers.  Under the definition in the Principal Act, it seems to me that he has a let out.  He is not an agricultural employer because he does not derive his main income from the agricultural part of his business.  He may keep the farm as a hobby and still have agricultural workers or he may have it to supply his own home or maybe a hotel.  He may live on dividends and that lets him out because he is not an agricultural employer and therefore his employees do not get the benefits of the Act.</P>

      <P>I hope I see where we are at some variance.  The Senator's understanding of it seems to be that if the person employing the worker on some form of farming is not mainly or solely deriving his income from the pursuit of farming, the worker falls between two stools.  The definition I have already quoted in the Agricultural Wages Act does not mention &ldquo;solely or mainly deriving a livelihood.&rdquo;  The agricultural employer is a person who carries on the trade or business of agriculture and who employs other persons as agricultural workers for the purpose of that trade or business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>An individual might be farming but he could be regarded as not being a farmer.  My interpretation of the Act is that it relates to the man, not to the farm.  Would it not be better if farming were defined rather than the employer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am trying to get across.  As outlined in the 1936 Agricultural Wages Act, which is carried on in the later Act and will be the law in the determination of this matter in the future as in the past, an agricultural employer is a person who carries out the trade or business of agriculture.  It does not say that he must solely or mainly derive his income from it to be so described.  If he carries it on at all, he is an agricultural employer in respect of the persons employed, although he may have varied interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>

      <P>If he carries on the trade or business of agriculture and employs others as agricultural workers.

If the work is agricultural in basis, I do not see how he gets out of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has disposed of it, I think.  A humorous <Col N="1622" /> definition occurs to me: a politician, when things are going badly, always describes it as a &ldquo;way of life&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I follow the Minister's explanation and it adds up to something to me, but the trade union which deals with these workers says that that difficulty exists as the Principal Act stands at the moment. Senator Miss Davidson says that that is her information and if that is so, we should, I think, avail of the opportunity to make a correction, if a correction is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>When what the Minister has said about a person owning land not having it as his sole or main occupation was inserted in the original Act of 1936, that would mean that even if he had dividends from investments up to £10,000, so long as he had a person employed working the land that belonged to him, then eligibility under this section would apply to the agricultural labourer.  In other words, the agricultural labourer would be entitled to the holidays, no matter what the income or varied interests of the employer might be.  That is my reading of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is some point in what Senator Miss Davidson said.  I have a recollection of a case where an old gentleman had retired. He was a wealthy merchant who had land.  Before he retired, he had a yardman and the yardman continued in his employment after his retirement, when the merchant was living on his income.  The merchant employed him in connection with land but that yardman tried to establish the point that he should be entitled to the benefits of the Agricultural Wages Act and the contention was that the employer was a retired merchant and was not engaged in the business of agriculture. I think the definition of what constitutes an agricultural worker or, alternatively, an agricultural employer, should be amended in some respects with regard to that type of employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I do not hold with the doubts expressed at all. I am quite satisfied that what is defined in the 1936 Wages Act, and carried <Col N="1623" /> through thereafter, is in fact wide and sufficiently detailed to gather in all that fall within the generally accepted term of those who work on the land, or agricultural workers.  But in the 1961 Holidays Act, which has gone through the Oireachtas, there are in Section 3 those who are excluded from the provisions of that Act.  One of the exclusions is an agricultural worker to whom the Agricultural Holidays Act 1950 applies, and it will be this Act in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable each District Milk Board established under the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936 to provide a superannuation scheme for its chairman and staff.  Two such Boards have been established &mdash; the Dublin District Milk Board in 1936, and the Cork District Milk Board in 1937. They regulate the supply and distribution of milk for human consumption in their respective areas.  In addition, they advise the Minister for Agriculture in regard to minimum producer prices for milk, promote schemes designed to secure increased liquid consumption of milk and operate artificial insemination services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each Board comprises a chairman nominated by the Minister and a number of ordinary members who are elected by milk producers, wholesalers and retailers.  The ordinary members receive no remuneration for their services which are given on a part-time basis, but are paid allowances for expenses incurred in attending Board meetings.  The Chairman's remuneration is fixed by the Minister for Agriculture, after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  At present the same person is chairman of the Dublin and Cork Boards.  Each Board employs such staff as are necessary for the performance of its functions. The terms and conditions of employment of the staffs are determined by the Minister for Agriculture. At present there are 79 persons on <Col N="1625" /> the staff of the Dublin Board and 11 on that of the Cork Board.</P>
    <P>Expenditure incurred by a Board is met entirely from its own income which is derived from a statutory levy on milk sold in its area, and from the operation of its artificial insemination service.  Each Board keeps a fund into which all money received by it is paid and out of which its expenditure is met.  The Dublin Board has in fact already sought my approval to operate a superannuation scheme for its staff and I have given my approval in principle, subject to the enactment of the necessary legislation which of course would also apply to the staff of the Cork Board.  In approving of the proposal in principle, I had regard to the fact that numerous other statutory bodies such as An Bord Bainne, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Bord na Móna, Electricity Supply Board, Bord Fáilte Éireann, An Foras Talúntais, etc., have been given authority by statute to operate superannuation schemes for their staffs, and I did not see any reason why the Milk Board staffs should be treated any less favourably in this respect.  So far as can be foreseen, the District Milk Boards will remain a permanent feature of the liquid milk trade in this country.</P>
    <P>The introduction of superannuation schemes for the employees of Milk Boards will also necessitate the introduction of a scheme for the chairman, providing his services are on a whole-time basis.  As already mentioned the Chairman is the only Board member who is remunerated for his services.</P>
    <P>This Bill follows generally the pattern of previous legislation relating to the operation of superannuation schemes by statutory bodies.  It has been necessary, however, to make special provision to cover the case of a person who, as at present, is chairman of more than one board, in view of the fact that his service in relation to either board alone might be regarded as part-time, although his joint service is wholetime.  Recent social welfare legislation providing for contributory old age pensions will be taken into account when schemes under the Bill are being considered.  The Bill will <Col N="1626" /> not involve any cost to the Exchequer, as the cost of the superannuation schemes will be met entirely out of the Boards' own funds into which any staff contributions will be paid.  I trust this Bill will commend itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which, as the Minister has indicated, follows the pattern of Bills relating to the establishment of semi-State bodies.  It is, of course, a matter of satisfaction that these bodies, which do not come so much into the public eye, are not being forgotten in the matter of their superannuation.  Accordingly, I am glad this Bill is being introduced because it will bring a sense of security to the employees of these Milk Boards throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The matter which intrigues me in this Bill is the provision made for the superannuation of part-time employees. That must be something new in legislation of this kind.  I am glad to see that a bold effort has been made in this regard.  Though it is a matter entirely for the Department of Agriculture and the Milk Boards, one would imagine, the Minister for Finance is liberally spattered throughout the Bill. The presence of the Minister for Finance in the Bill will not conduce to better superannuation schemes for the employees.  That much can be taken as certain.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why, if the superannuation allowances are to be taken from the funds of the Board and staff contributions, the Minister for Finance must enter into it.  I do not see where his function is, except the general desire of the Minister for Finance to have a finger in every pie, even where he is not wanted.</P>

    <P>I do not understand the provision in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of Section 2 with regard to the payment of a chairman who renders part-time service to more than one Board.  At one stage, it appears that there may be a chairman of more than two boards.  In other places in the section, it appears that it is not contemplated that a man will be the chairman of more than two boards.  What surprises and intrigues me about this is that if in relation to the allowance which is <Col N="1627" /> to be paid to a part-time chairman by two Boards, they are able to agree as to the proportions in which they are to be paid, they may agree among themselves and there is an end to it; but if they cannot agree, they have to refer the matter to the Minister, who then must consult with the Minister for Finance and have his concurrence. I should like the Minister to indicate the circumstances which require the concurrence of the Minister for Finance in such a case.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I should like to make on Section 3.  The House will recall that on a Friday morning, we sought here for some hours to amend the Central Bank Bill dealing with superannuation, and Senator O'Donovan and I had a lengthy debate with the Minister for Finance upon the necessity of having a clause in the Bill providing for the citation and construction of the Central Bank Bill and the main Central Bank Acts. We could not convince the Minister for Finance of the necessity or desirability of such a necessary amendment, but I am glad to see that in this Bill it is provided in subsections (2) and (3), and particularly in subsection (3) of Section 3 that this Bill and the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Prices) Acts, 1936 to 1952, shall be construed together.  That is proper legislation which puts beyond any question the linking up of this Bill and the Acts which it amends, unlike what was done on the Central Bank Bill in relation to superannuation about which we had such a lengthy debate with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides that a Milk Board may provide superannuation for its staff, and as such it is welcome.  There are, however, some questions I should like to ask and I hope the Minister can satisfy me on them.  The first arises under Section 2, subsection (1) which provides that the superannuation scheme shall cover employees whom the Board determines shall be pensionable.  Could the Minister tell us what employees will be covered by the scheme?  Will it be <Col N="1628" /> all the employees of the Board or simply a section of them?</P>
      <P>Other questions arise with regard to the preparation of the scheme itself. I should like to have certain assurances about it.  Could I take it that the superannuation scheme will in the course of preparation be the subject of consultation with the trade unions representing the staff?  In other words will the Board make an effort to agree with the trade unions about the superannuation scheme before making its submission to the Minister? Secondly, when the Minister gets the proposals of the Board, will he provide for consultation again with the trade unions, if such is necessary?</P>
      <P>We find a similar type of provision made in various legislation dealing with public transport where it is specifically provided by the Oireachtas that the Board of C.I.E. will hear the representatives of the staff affected and if no agreement is reached, the Minister is, I think, obliged to hear the trade unions before finally making up his mind on the question at issue.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister can give me these assurances.  It would certainly be desirable that the Board should as far as possible agree on the scheme with the trade union, and if there are some outstanding matters arising out of these discussions, it is certainly desirable that the Minister should hear both sides before making up his mind and sending the proposals to his colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The next question on which I should like some clarification is when it is envisaged these schemes will be prepared.  I do not know what progress has been made.  I know that the trade union concerned were some time ago expressing anxiety about the question and I do not know whether in the meantime progress has been made and a scheme has been the subject of negotiation between the Board and the trade union.  Perhaps the Minister would say what are the expectations in regard to implementing a scheme which the Board is empowered to make under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill, too.  These Boards have been in <Col N="1629" /> operation for a considerable period now and I suppose that, like every other section of the people, they want a superannuation scheme.  I was surprised to find so many employees working for the Dublin and Cork Milk Boards, and I should like to know how they were recruited.  As a matter of fact, the two Boards have the same Chairman, who is a great personal friend of mine and has given a lot of service to the country back through the years, but I was agreeably surprised to find that there are a number of others, reaching 79 in Dublin and 11 in Cork, and I should like to know how these men are recruited.  Could I get this information?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The main feature of this Bill, the operative feature, is that it is permissive legislation.  It is proposed to be permissive legislation giving power to the Boards to bring forward their proposals by way of proposed schemes through the Minister and ultimately with the concurrence and agreement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question as to why the Minister for Finance should come into this matter has been raised.  The fact that it is permissive legislation must surely imply that somebody at some stage is envisaged as having to give his consent. Over and above that, there is the other aspect that many boards and semi-State bodies who have power at the moment to make these types of schemes are channelled through the Minister and the Department of Finance.  The main purpose there would be to channel them through the one agency, as it were, so that uniformity, or near-uniformity, depending on the circumstances of a scheme, would actually be brought into existence <Col N="1630" /> rather than the position if each board and each semi-State body were a complete law unto itself and there were no means whereby any sort of uniform approach could be made to the whole matter.  By and large, I think that is the overall reason why the Minister for Finance is supposed to act in this capacity in this Bill, if and when a scheme is put forward to him.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy has asked about the groups to whom many of these schemes may apply.  The groups would be permanent, and whole-time workers. That would be a matter in which somebody&mdash;possibly the Minister for Finance&mdash;should be in a position to satisfy himself that they are in fact of these particular categories, if it is proposed to bring them under a scheme.</P>
    <P>The question of consultation with the union is a matter beyond the ambit of the Minister for Agriculture.  I have no doubt whatever that since these schemes will be designed and devised to meet the wishes and to improve the lot of the workers, the views of their unions and the views of the workers themselves will be ascertained in order that the best possible solution of the problem or the best possible scheme may in fact come into existence.</P>
    <P>While there is no power of compulsion&mdash;nor is it desirable that there should be&mdash;the views of the workers through their unions and representatives will, no doubt, be ascertained and very likely sought if the end for which these schemes are designed is to come to pass.</P>
    <P>The question of the progress of any such scheme under this measure is a matter over which the Department or the Minister has no direct authority, nor any guiding rights, as it were. The belief, I think, is that the Department of Agriculture are aware that the boards are desirous that something in this way should be done&mdash; hence the reason for the measure&mdash; and, without any commitment on the part of the Department, that the schemes will come into being as soon as may be after the passage of this Bill through this House.</P>

How they recruit them, where they recruit them and when they have recruited them is not a matter which the Department of Agriculture have knowledge of or, officially, are entitled or expected to have knowledge of.</P>

      <P>One would imagine the Minister can indicate if there is any intention that, instead of every board preparing a separate scheme, several boards together might prepare one scheme which would operate jointly with them.  It seems to be a waste of energy to have different boards, with small numbers, preparing different schemes.  In relation to superannuation, it seems to me that the greatest credit risk is to lower the premiums that have to be paid both by the employers and by the persons to be benefited.  I wonder whether there is any power in subsection (2) (a) for different boards to prepare the one scheme for all their employees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two boards.  There is no way whereby the two boards can draw up a scheme which will have any legal binding on the two separate boards thereafter. It is the belief, and I think it will so work out&mdash;with the assistance, if necessary, of the controlling interest of the Minister for Finance&mdash;that the schemes will be put forward as separate schemes, though they may be identical, from each of the two boards or any further boards that may develop <Col N="1632" /> thereafter.  In other words, we can have similar schemes applying to the separate boards but not put up as a joint scheme by one of the two boards. We will attain the same end.</P>

      <P>One would come to the conclusion from the Bill that there are at least three boards.  Paragraph (b) refers to the board which pays the greatest amount to a part-time chairman.  That would suggest to a simple-minded person that there were at least three part-time chairmen of the board.  However, we might be pardoned for having a knowledge of English.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>One would imagine the Bill would relate in some way to the facts as they exist.  If possible, there should be included in the Bill &ldquo;which pays the greater or the greatest amount, as the case may be&rdquo;.  In a measure where &ldquo;the Minister for Finance&rdquo; is spattered all over the place, we might just as well do things properly.  The point which vitally concerns the part-time chairman concerned&mdash;and it applies equally to the staff, perhaps&mdash;is that there is no reference to what the position will be in relation to the payment of contributions by the part-time chairman.  It appears that the two Boards are to bear in mind between themselves what proportion of the superannuation allowance each of them will pay to the part-time chairman.  There does not seem to be any provision in paragraph (b) as to what proportion of the superannuation contribution the part-time chairman would pay in respect of his employment under the different boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the joint responsibility of the two Boards who may be asked to contribute towards the superannuation of one and the same person as chairman or retired chairman, it is not really determined yet that there will be a contribution but if there should be, and if there is a contribution in regard to this superannuation, <Col N="1633" /> then we take it that those contributions will be related to the levels of remuneration being paid by the respective employers as at the date of retirement or possibly with reference to some years before retirement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister quite got my point.  Where there is a part-time chairman, it is at the end of the period when he is to be paid his allowance that the two Boards decide the proportion they will pay him.  There does not seem to be any provision here as to the contribution they will make in advance in respect of the employer's contributions to the fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

That will come within the actual terms of the scheme as submitted.  Without it, it would not be an effective scheme.</P>

      <P>The main objects of the Bill are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) to increase from £1,500,000 to £3,000,000 the aggregate amount of the shares in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited which the Minister for Finance may take up;</P>
      <P>(ii)&nbsp; to increase from £500,000 to £1,250,000 the aggregate of the grants which may be provided for the company; and</P>
      <P>(iii)  to provide for the issue by the Minister for Finance of repayable advances to the company to meet one-half of the expenditure by the Company on the provision of dwellings for workers employed on the Industrial Estate established at Shannon Airport.  The aggregate amount of advances shall not exceed £400,000.</P>
      <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited was incorporated as a limited company under the Companies Acts on 28th January, 1959.  The main function of the company is to promote the increased use of Shannon Airport for passenger and freight traffic and for tourist, commercial and industrial purposes.  To that end, the main activities of the company have been concentrated on attracting industrialists to set up factories in the Customs Free Airport area.  Under the provisions of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1958, industries established in the Customs Free Airport enjoy certain taxation privileges, in particular, total exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax until 1983 on profits derived from export business.  To facilitate prospective industrialists the company has undertaken a factory building programme, and factories can be provided for industrial undertakings at Shannon in the following ways:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) The undertaking may lease a site from the company on which to build its own factory and for this purpose a building grant from the company may he negotiated;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> (ii)&nbsp; The company may build a factory to a special design to be leased to the undertaking;</P>
    <P>(iii)  The undertaking may lease one of the company's standard factories.</P>
    <P>As an adjunct to the factory building programme, the company has also undertaken the provision of housing accommodation for a proportion of the workers employed on the Industrial Estate.  A scheme of houses and flats, for renting to tenants, is in hands.</P>
    <P>The company's main sources of finance are provided under the authority of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Act, 1959.  The Act authorises:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) The Minister for Finance to subscribe for shares in the company up to an aggregate limit of £1,500,000 and</P>
    <P>(ii)&nbsp; the provision by way of grant-in-aid voted annually of sums which in the aggregate shall not exceed £500,000.</P>
    <P>The capital is being used by the company to acquire revenue-earning assets such as factory buildings and dwellinghouses, the income from which will go to supplement the company's grant income.  The grant-in-aid is applied by the company towards meeting its running expenses and providing financial assistance to new industrial undertakings at the Airport.  Capital issued to the company up to 30th June, 1961, amounted to £1,358,000 and payments by way of Grant-in-Aid to £402,500. It will be seen that these figures are approaching the existing statutory limits.  Accordingly, it is now necessary to increase these limits so that the company may continue its operations. Of the share capital expenditure up to 30th June, 1961, £939,000 was expended on factory buildings and £394,000 on dwellings.</P>
    <P>Up to 30th June, 1961, 15 factory bays had been completed together with a special factory of approximately 53,200 square feet constructed by an industrialist with the aid of a grant from the company.  Including the special factory mentioned the total area of factory floor space provided as at <Col N="1636" /> that date was 285,340 square feet.  All the factories are, of course, situated within the Customs Free Airport area. At present five factory bays are under construction.  Ancillary services such as water, sewerage, electricity and boilerhouse have also been provided. The company has almost completed 10 houses and a scheme of 137 flats is nearing completion.  Plans are in hands for the construction of a further 100 houses.</P>
    <P>As at 30th June, 1961, eight factories were in operation in the Industrial Estate and the total number of workers employed was 724.  Of these, 64 per cent. are male.  A good number of skilled craftsmen have immigrated to Shannon.  Among the commodities being manufactured are transistor radios, floor maintenance machinery, knitted jersey fabrics and knitted garments, wire gauze for industrial purposes, precision threaded fasteners and miniature capacitors, pianos and record players and radiograms, tungsten carbide inserts and diamond drilling equipment. All these industries are primarily export industries and are not in competition for the home market with other Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The company is in active negotiation with a number of potential industrialists and I am happy to say that there is every reason to be confident that this Estate&mdash;the first industrial estate in the world to be situated in an airport&mdash;will succeed and will continue to develop.  The industries already established have given a very considerable fillip to air freight traffic at the Airport and it is estimated that by 1965 over 5,000 tons of air freight will be generated annually by the factory operations now established or planned at Shannon.  It is abundantly clear that industrialists are attracted to the estate by reason of the availability of the convenient air freight facilities.</P>
    <P>The company, on my direction, is concentrating its efforts on the creation of an air freight industrial community and is seeking new industries of a kind likely to make the fullest possible use of the air freight facilities. The examination of inquiries made by industrialists about the Shannon Estate, <Col N="1637" /> and the origin of these inquiries, make it quite clear that the great majority of these firms are interested in this aspect.  A major advantage in the regular use of air freight is of course that the manufacturers can avoid having to tie up a large proportion of their capital in maintaining large stocks of materials, while the finished goods can be dispatched all over the world in a matter of days&mdash;sometimes of hours.</P>
    <P>The economic rent of the factories has been calculated on a basis of recovering the capital investment in 40 years together with interest at the rate of 5½ per cent. per annum.  An addition of 1 per cent. per annum of the capital cost is also included for the cost of external repairs and maintenance. Some of the factories have been let at the full economic rent, but in some cases the factories have been let at less than economic rents for a limited number of years.  It is hoped that at the end of the initial period, all factories will be let at economic rents.  The lessees are responsible for rates and internal maintenance.</P>
    <P>All the indications are that factories can be leased as soon as they can be built.  Apart from the five factory bays now under construction plans are being prepared for the provision of a further 32 factory bays over the next four years.  Capital expenditure during the current financial year on the development of the industrial estate is estimated at about £550,000.  It is difficult to forecast the probable capital expenditure after that date because this is naturally related to the continuing success of the company's efforts to attract industrialists.  If the rate of capital expenditure to date is maintained the increase of £1,500,000 provided for in the Bill would sustain operations for perhaps three to four years.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an increase from £500,000 to £1,250,000 in the aggregate amount of the grants which may be made to the company.  These grants are to cover the running expenses of the company and to enable the company to do such things as are calculated to encourage the establishment <Col N="1638" /> of commercial, industrial and trading enterprises at the Airport. Receipts by the company up to 30th June, 1961, amounted to £422,000, made up of grants-in-aid of £402,000 and £20,000 in other receipts.  The company paid out £202,500 in running expenses and £216,000 in grants to industrialists.  The latter figure is made up of grants as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>It emerged at an early stage of the operation of the company that the provision of suitable type housing was an integral part of the industrial development. The Airport is somewhat isolated from existing communities and industrialists already in production and firms about to commence production urged that housing should be provided in the immediate vicinity of the factories for a proportion of the workers.  As I have already indicated, expenditure on the provision of housing at the Airport up to 30tht June, 1961 was £394,000.  Here again, precise estimation of probable expenditure is difficult because expenditure will, of course, be related to the demand for housing which in turn will depend upon the rate of increase in the number of workers employed in the industrial estate.  However, it is estimated that expenditure on housing in the current financial year will be of the order of £580,000.  The cost of housing will be met as to one half from the company's share capital, the other half being met by way of repayable advances under this Bill.</P>
    <P>These advances will be on the same basis as loans from the local loans fund, both as to rate of interest and repayments.  The rents proposed for the housing accommodation are such as to amortise the total capital cost over 35 years including interest at an average rate of about 3½ per cent. per annum.  The rent also includes provision for repairs, maintenance, insurance, ground rent, administration and caretaking.  The tenants will be liable for rates.  After making a most thorough investigation into housing requirements for the industrial estate <Col N="1639" /> the company reached the conclusion that, subject to constant re-evaluation, up to one-third of the workers would seek housing accommodation adjacent to their work.</P>
    <P>In view of the many factors involved it has, however, been decided to limit the first stage of the housing estate to 250 houses and flats and to have a full reassessment of the housing problem from every aspect before reaching any decision to proceed further.  The scheme for the 100 houses now being put in hands will cater for the needs of workers requiring accommodation at lower rents than those which can be charged for the flats now in course of completion.  The industrial expansion at the Airport has also led to consideration by local authorities and private interests of house building programmes in adjacent towns and this is a development which I am sure all of us will welcome.</P>
    <P>The work being undertaken by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. is unique in the Irish economy and is probably without parallel in the economy of any other country.  It is an experiment which involves considerable financial risk for the State but from the encouraging progress made so far I am satisfied that the State should continue to finance the operation.  The company has shown commendable enterprise, vision and enthusiasm in attracting industrialists to Shannon and I feel that I must take this opportunity of congratulating the directors and staff of the company on the results already achieved.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

Maybe indeed the necessity to salvage the Airport was grossly exaggerated but at any rate when this company had been in operation&mdash;it has now been in operation for a few years&mdash; and when it was found that no progress <Col N="1640" /> whatever was being made in its industrial effort at Shannon Airport, I think instead of presenting proposals involving an increase in expenditure altogether of £2,650,000, it would have been much better if the Government had adopted that over-worked word &ldquo;pause&rdquo;.  In this context, the word &ldquo;pause&rdquo; has a great deal more relevance than in certain other financial contexts.</P>
      <P>Lest anybody might think that I am exaggerating, I should like to point out that the report for the year ending March 31st, 1960, which is the last available report, on page 14 says: &ldquo;On March 31st, 1960, definite arrangements to begin manufacture had been made with ten overseas firms. Details are given in Table I.  Most of these firms will be in production by the end of 1960&rdquo;.  Now I do not propose to name the firms but there are in fact eight firms named in Table I appended to the report.  That was at 31st March, 1960, and the Minister in Dáil Éireann said at column 1648, Vol. 191, No. 10 that on 30th June, 1961 eight factories were in operation in the Industrial Estate and the total number of workers employed was 724.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want any misapprehension of what I have said to arise.  It is apparent from Table 1 which is appended to the report for the year ending 31st March, 1960, that the whole eight were not in operation at that time.  The fact is that 15 months afterwards, the Minister comes to both Houses of the Oireachtas, and tells us he is going to build 32 new factories, or something of that order&mdash; one of those astronomical figures by comparison with what has been used already.  He says: &ldquo;Apart from the five factory bays now under construction plans are being prepared for the provision of a further 32 factory bays over the next four years&rdquo;&mdash; about four times as many as have been used up to the present.  Anything less would not do!  Do things in a big way!  Up to the present, the provision in the previous Bill, as stated by the Minister, was £1,500,000 for capital and £500,000 gross for grants-in-air. Now it is proposed that there <Col N="1641" /> should be £3,000,000 capital, £1,250,000 for grants and £400,000 for the dwellings for workers.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw the attention of the House to the manner in which the moneys given by way of grants-in-aid have been expended up to 30th June, 1961.  The Minister told us that out of £422,000, £216,000 was by way of grants, that is to say, moneys given to industrialists, which is explained partly by grants for machinery and equipment and the factories built by some of the firms.  There was a sum of £202,000 for running expenses, that is, compared with the grants given, there is an equivalent amount, pound for pound, spent for running expenses.  This is an outrageous ratio.  It is a matter which is just beyond comment.</P>
    <P>The company in its report talks about putting five million kilograms of freight into the air from the Estate. I am glad to say that that has been translated.  I am not able to twit the Minister about that, at any rate, for he says in his brief that it is estimated that by 1965 over 5,000 tons of air freight will be generated annually by the factory operations, as compared, I suppose, with a couple of hundred tons at the moment.  I cannot twit the Minister for talking about kilograms but I can twit the Minister about some of the exaggerated English he has used towards the end of his brief.</P>

      <P>re-evaluation&mdash;the word &ldquo;evaluation&rdquo; is bad enough without putting in the prefix &ldquo;re&rdquo;.  Just look at it as a word.  Of course the Germans are fond of concocting words and I suppose we are going to adopt the German system now.  He continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;up to one-third of the workers <Col N="1642" /> would seek housing accommodation adjacent to their work.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say that they have taken a lesser decision and decided to limit the first stage of the housing estate.  I have no objection to that.  The Minister goes on to say that this is unique in the Irish economy and probably without parallel in the economy of any other country.  The financial end is without parallel in any country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is honest of the Minister to say that there has been one just started but the English is exaggerated and there is this exaggeration all along the line in regard to the prospects of this kind of thing.  He says:</P>
      <P>It is an experiment which involves considerable financial risk for the State but from the encouraging progress made so far I am satisfied that the State should continue to finance the operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had simply said: &ldquo;We have considered the project and we have decided to take further risk,&rdquo; it would have been different but he should not hitch it on the other phrase &ldquo;the encouraging progress made so far.&rdquo;  I have demonstrated from the report, and from the Minister's words, that no progress has been made in the past 15 months at all.  The number of enterprises are the same and of course with the Common Market looming up, I cannot see that any new people will now inquire about the Estate in the circumstances that will arise.  The advantage, of course&mdash;and I want to make a personal comment on this <Col N="1643" /> aspect&mdash;of the arrangement for such companies as have come in is that they are inside the British Commonwealth preference system.</P>
    <P>I regret to say I had a very sad experience in connection with that subject, when I attempted to help some people who wanted to start a boot factory at Listowel to manufacture high-class Italian shoes.  The Industrial Development Authority told us if we started this, we would jeopardise the market in Britain for the existing Irish boot and shoe industry. Apparently with the change of Government, the Industrial Development Authority changed their minds, or their minds were changed for them &mdash;I do not know which.  Both approaches cannot be correct.  The necessary money was subscribed for the shoe factory in Listowel and it was shot down by the Industrial Development Authority.  Apparently their influence on this project, unless there was something else in it, was less than it was on that particular project in 1956.  I am glad to say that great credit was due to the people of Listowel who were organising it.  Those who subscribed money got all of it back except a few pounds which were required for expenses for the formation of the company.  That was a completely different outlook in the I.D.A. from the outlook at that time. Again, when the Minister speaks, we have this exaggeration in the reference to exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax until 1983, that is to say, 22 years ahead.  I do not think that either the Minister or I will be much concerned with Parliamentary matters in 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, we can get a laugh out of it.  What does <Col N="1644" /> the Minister mean by saying that these are primarily export industries? I take it that it means that if we take the piano manufacturing company, there being no other company as far as I know manufacturing pianos here, it is allowed to sell them in the home market where they do not compete with any existing firm.  I should like just to be clear about that.</P>
      <P>There is provision in the original Act and in this Bill also for interest on advances.  Quite frankly, on the figures shown up to the present and the figures given by the Minister in his brief as regards the result of this company's operations, I do not see any possibility whatever of the company paying interest on advances.</P>
      <P>If we analyse the position, approximately £2,000,000 has been spent and there are 700 people employed.  That would make a figure of almost £3,000 per worker put into employment, which would be a very much larger figure for this kind of small industry, but it would not be quite fair to the project.  It has been doing other work, for example, the kind of work that is referred to at page 10 of the report for the period ended 31st March, 1960.</P>
      <P>Its work in the field of amenity development is exemplified by its encouragement of the Shannon Shamrock Inn project, its agreement to manage and operate Bunratty Castle....</P>
      <P>My only comment on that would be that it was Lord Gort who went to the trouble of originating and developing Bunratty Castle, and the management and operation of it cannot cost the Shannon Free Airport Development Company a lot of money anyway.  I could wish that some of its other operations were at least as little costly as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also mentions &ldquo;its participation with the Irish Tourist Association in the provision of a new tourist inquiry office in Limerick.&rdquo;  I am one of those people who believe that a particular institution or organisation should be engaged in a limited sphere of activities.  If the Government have the feeling that the Irish Tourist <Col N="1645" /> Association should open a new tourist inquiry office in the city of Limerick, the financing of that project, if the Irish Tourist Association have not got enough moneys already, should be done, and it would be proper financial procedure, by means of an increase in the annual grant to the Irish Tourist Association.</P>
    <P>The Minister and some members of the House may think that I am too harsh about this project.  Only a few days ago, a big bunch of ambassadors were taken down to be shown over this project.  I do not think the time of ambassadors is so valuable that it matters a great deal what they spend a couple of days doing, but I do think that they might, at least, have been taken down there by internal transport rather than by flying them down on planes which are wanted for other purposes at the height of the tourist season and at the period of maximum operation of the Aer Lingus fleet.  The very fact that these men whose normal duty scatters them all over the world were taken down to this place at this time does vindicate my opinion that there is something further required to justify the expenditure up to the present.</P>
    <P>This Bill was not opposed in Dáil Éireann.  It is an enabling measure and as usual with these measures nowadays from the Government, it has millions of extra pounds in it.  It does not matter a great deal really about the Bill itself except as showing an attitude of mind.  We have had the Minister in this House with three or four other Bills of a similar sort, by far the most important of which was the Electricity Bill, which I criticised at very considerable length.  As regards this Bill, the attitude adopted in the other House is the correct one, that this kind of legislation is not necessary at this time, since quite obviously the company has not reached the limit of the available authorisations yet, and there is no reason why it should not have waited until the general election was over, as, in strict propriety, it should have waited.</P>
    <P>As regards my point that there is no immedate need for this Bill, might I point out that by statutory instrument <Col N="1646" /> No. 49 of 1959, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. was added to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act.  The Minister for Finance by that Order was authorised to guarantee the company up to £200,000, but by an Order made on the 28th April, 1961, by the Taoiseach under the State Guarantees Act, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company was, with other companies, removed from the Schedule.  In those circumstances, first of all I want to ask two questions.  The Minister may not be able to answer them and if he cannot, I can quite understand it.</P>
    <P>First of all, I should like to ask how it is that the company has ceased to require a guarantee of these sums up to £200,000 and is at the same time now being provided with advances under Section 4 of this Bill of up to £400,000 for housing?  If the Minister has not the information in this kind of territory, it is not of great importance. When you are faced with a proposal to spend a sum of £2? millions, whether something has been properly attended to technically does not matter a great deal.  The Government, by pushing ahead in this fashion with these projects with the one hand, at a time when they have written to the headquarters of the EEC at Brussels, with the other hand are showing that they are looking in two directions at the one time.  We all know very well that that is an undesirable state of affairs in economic planning.</P>
    <P>The original Bill was enacted in 1959.  In two years, we have the Minister back here again.  It is not necessary that he should be back again in two years.  We had this yesterday with another Bill.  But, quite apart from my opinion, that it is not necessary that he should be back here again in two years, if it were necessary for him to be back here again in two years it would show extremely bad planning, indeed.  To talk about the year 1983 in that context is the height of absurdity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister defined the main function of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company in his opening speech on this matter in the Dáil.  I quote from column 1647 of the <Col N="1647" /> Official Report, Volume 191, No. 10:</P>
      <P>The main function of the company is to promote the increased use of Shannon Airport for passenger and freight traffic and for tourist, commercial and industrial purposes.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, it was not exactly that.  It was an effort to employ the people who would be disemployed if Shannon were overflown by many planes and at the same time to protect our capital investment in Shannon.  It was an excellent project.  The return of the Minister for more money today gives us an opportunity to discuss how that project has been proceeded with and to what effect&mdash;whether, in fact, there might be a better way to reach an end which was of itself good, necessary and proper.</P>
      <P>In the same speech the Minister tells us at the end of column 1648:</P>
      <P>As at 30th June, 1961, eight factories were in operation in the Industrial Estate and the total number of workers employed was 724.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, somewhere between £3,000 per worker was spent to achieve that present state of affairs.  I do not regard that as an excessive sum.  The old figure used to be £1,000 per worker.  There is not the slightest doubt about it that the present figure in industry is, on the average, over £2,000 so that the figure portrayed in the Minister's statement has not got anything wrong with it on the basis of capital investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were true, if we were satisfied that the capital investment was wise, that the employment would continue and would be of a nature which would give ancillary employment in the production of raw materials for these industries in the country, if they are factories which completely remove the opportunity of providing ancillary employment in other parts of the country then that indeed is a disability in the measure we are discussing today. The Minister will hold all the share capital.  He now wants to increase it from £1½ million to £3 million.  We are putting in for another £1½ million and he asked for £1¼ million to be <Col N="1648" /> given in grants-in-aid at the maximum rate of £500,000 a year.  Our experience in this House and in the other House has always been that these maxima become minima.  So you may take it that when this Bill passes today and goes back to the Dáil the position will be that the Government will be putting in another £1½ million and that, for the next two years, they will put in £500,000 each year in grants-in-aid as distinct from extra share capital</P>
    <P>At this stage, we must take a long look at the whole project to see where it has got us and to see where we are going.  It is at this stage that I find myself departing from the Minister. Before we treat the matter in a general way, I should like to say, on the question of houses, that perhaps it is a good thing the Minister has decided that only one-third of the workers eventually employed there, if employment continues, will want to live at the Airport.  The point was made in the Dáil&mdash;it seemed a very human point but I think it is a very real one&mdash;that nobody wants to live at an airport.  It reminded me of the old song about the railroad track in the middle of the house.  I could not imagine anything worse than living in an airport.  The figure of one-third probably represents the people who cannot find accommodation elsewhere. The people who cannot afford houses will never be re-housed by any local authority nearby because under the regulations governing re-housing the position is that persons in good houses, no matter where they are, do not get other houses.  Therefore, it is perhaps wise that we are proceeding on the basis that one worker in three will require re-housing.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I feel the figure is false inasmuch as we are proceeding on the basis that we shall have a greatly increased number of workers. I have the greatest trepidation as to whether we shall have such.  We must examine the setting-up of Shannon Free Airport.  As far as I can see, apart from the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Act, there were two other Acts of Parliament which affected it.  One was the Finance <Col N="1649" /> (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1958 and I want to refer to Part II, Section 3.  I do not think there is any point in quoting the entire section.  The Minister will accept my word that in this section certain trading operations in an airport are exempted from taxation.  Those trading operations would extend to any normal industrial operation.  More important still, when one considers the situation today, in the Customs Free Airport (Amendment) Act, 1958, Section 9 (1) we read:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, subject to such conditions as he may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, impose, permit goods to be brought</P>
    <P>(a)  directly into the airport from outside the State, or</P>
    <P>(b)  into the airport from another part of the State without payment of any duty of customs or excise which may be chargeable thereon</P>
    <P>for sale by retail within the airport either for shipment as aircraft stores or to persons leaving or outside the State.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the idea behind the introduction of industries here was that persons could manufacture goods on the raw materials of which we did not impose an import duty and could then export them as coming from the Republic of Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has always had and can be sure of economic membership of the British Commonwealth.  In other words, we could send all goods manufactured in the Shannon Free Airport Development Area to Britain or to Commonwealth countries, avail of our preferential rate of duty and not charge duty ourselves on the raw materials coming into our country.</P>
    <P>So that, as I see it, this whole project is based on imports from abroad and exports from the Airport without having left the factory site itself for production.  One might almost term it, in its first birth, a panic measure because there was at that time the feeling that Shannon might be constantly overflown.  It seems obvious now that Shannon, for economic <Col N="1650" /> reasons, will not be overflown but, at that time, it did seem as if it would. Therefore, we must look at these industries, if they are to proceed on present customs provisions both here and in the British Commonwealth, as industries which will tend to be those which import their raw materials and export them again.  As far as we are concerned, the total good in employment that can be got from the activities of this company is situated in the company itself.  The ancillary employment of which I spoke will not be forthcoming in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There is also the undesirable fact that people might use the Shannon Free Airport Development Company site for the purpose of bringing in goods which are easily processed and easily assembled.  There is the joke in the new list of factories licensed last year in Dublin, the factory producing ballpoint pens.  That is an exaggeration.  It is something that is more in keeping with music halls than this Assembly.  If people can bring in the raw materials for goods and easily and quickly assemble them here, with a minimum of Irish labour, at the Shannon Free Airport site, they can, under the present provisions, avail of Commonwealth preference.  The list given by the Minister at column 1649 of the Official Report tends to show us that that sort of thing has been happening up to date.  It is undesirable.</P>
    <P>Let me quote the entire list: transistor radios, floor maintenance machinery, knitted jersey fabrics and knitted garments, wire gauze for industrial purposes, precision threaded fasteners and miniature capacitors, pianos and record players and radiograms, tungsten carbide inserts and diamond drilling equipment.  In my opinion, it might well be that transistor radios, precision threaded fasteners and miniature capacitors, record players and radiograms, tungsten carbide inserts and diamond drilling equipment could all come into the category of goods which could come in here either slightly broken down or in such a way that they could be quickly assembled in order to avail of the Commonwealth preference.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1651" /> We must view the activities of this company in the light of exactly what good it does upon its own site and not in the light of a general increase in our economy from the normal industrial operations that one hopes would bring employment not only within their confines but all over the country.</P>
    <P>The receipts of the company as quoted by the Minister are £422,000, which includes two figures&mdash;ordinary receipts of £20,000 and grants-in-aid from the Government of £402,000, so that the ordinary trading receipts are so small as to mean that the company has not really got going at all.  It is, perhaps, a little hard on my part to take the line I am taking, but at the same time it appears from an ordinary examination of the figures set up before us in the extremely out of date last report and accounts dated 31st March, 1960, and the figures provided by the Minister, that, as Senator O'Donovan said, there is no hope of the repayment of capital.  I would not be as hard as he has been and say there is no hope of the repayment of interest but I would say that there is very little hope of the repayment of interest.  In subsection (3) of Section 7 there is provision relating to the nonpayment of these very necessary matters as far as the ordinary businessman is concerned.</P>
    <P>What will be the position of the Shannon Free Airport Company if we enter the Common Market under the present provisions of the Rome Treaty?  If we did, the position would be that we would be here indulging in a comic opera.  The position is that under the Rome Treaty there would be absolute freedom of movement for goods within the British Isles and the Six countries.  There would be a delay of some years.  Naturally, that delay will give a certain term of life to the present set up of the Shannon Free Airport Development site.  Having examined these industries, it is quite clear that they all came here because they were industries that could so easily assemble the raw materials they brought in under the provisions of the Act of 1958 free of duty and were then <Col N="1652" /> available for Commonwealth preference.</P>
    <P>The position would be that those industries which are mostly based in Europe would, if they had factories in Europe, be in as good a position without manufacturing at Shannon.  In the second place, those industries, which had factories based outside Europe, whether they were subsidiaries of Japanese factories or American factories, could no longer bring into the Shannon Free Development Area free of duty the raw materials which they meant to process or broken down parts which they meant to assemble on that site in order to get that free economic access to Europe.  That would be barred to them.</P>
    <P>It is a question of what, in fact, should be done.  I honestly believe&mdash; I do not think the Minister will admit it&mdash;that the Government have been, as Senator O'Donovan pointed out, pausing about the whole thing for the past eight months.  The Government have been in a dilemma and finally they decided at a most inopportune moment to go ahead.</P>
    <P>The only question about this Bill we are passing today is that it is permissive legislation.  My hope and wish is that the Government and the Minister will watch the situation because it is so tragically easy to throw £2,000,000, in the shape of £1,500,000, as share and investment, and £500,000 grant-in-aid, into a project which might find itself completely cancelled out when we know the terms under which the British Isles will enter the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters of detail that I should like to refer to and one is in relation to an industry the details of which I shall not mention for obvious reasons.  I refer to the chinchilla breeding industry which has now ceased to function.  The chinchilla breeding industry was based on the purchase by customers in this country and outside it of pairs of breeding chinchillas.  The position was that there was an absolute guarantee as to the success of the breeding operation and there was provision for the issue <Col N="1653" /> of further animals if it were not a success.  The price at which these animals were sold was, in fact&mdash; ludicrous though it be&mdash;150 times the value of the fur, so the whole thing was a chain hanky operation.  So long as you could get enough people to start breeding chinchillas, you could keep it going and make huge sums, but when people stopped taking them, that was the end of the chain hanky and it became a huge and shabby failure.  I hesitate to use another word because I do not like to say anything about an enterprise that has failed.</P>
    <P>It recalls to my mind another case in which the Minister for External Affairs and I were implicated in 1955 in Louth when the same thing was going on in the breeding of tulip bulbs. When both he and I proceeded to the Minister for Justice, somebody was left in the country whose permit was withdrawn. The reason given by the Department of Justice was that it was a chain hanky operation.  To the political disgrace, if you like, of the then Minister for Finance and myself, the thing blew up in our faces.  Within 18 months the thing blew up and lots of people did not get paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister in charge of such a development as the Shannon Free Airport where such extraordinary measures are taken to attract industries should be ultra-conservative, ultra-careful, to see that there are not any undesirable results from the arrival of such industries.  The world is a large place and it takes all sorts to make it up.  What may at first sight seem to be an extremely logical and proper effort to employ labour and make a profit may not in fact be that at all.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that we are discussing this legislation at all because when we discuss it, our responsibility and duty is to view it in the light of the expenditure of public money and the return the country may have.  The expenditure we have been discussing here is of great magnitude and not one word has been said by the Minister in charge to date about the effect of the European Economic Community, if it impinges on the operation of the company.  I should like him before he leaves the Seanad to talk to us about the Shannon <Col N="1654" /> Free Airport Company and tell us why, as Senator O'Donovan pointed out, there seems to have been a pause since March, 1960.  He should tell us also why this Bill was not delayed until such time as we had up-to-date accounts, because after all, if a businessman who runs a company were to go to his bank manager to seek overdraft accommodation, would he go in August, 1961, with March, 1960 accounts?  If he did what would he get?  I compare the two Houses of the Oireachtas with the bank manager because the bank manager is the custodian of the bank's money, the money owned by the depositors, and we in the Oireachtas must look on ourselves as the custodians of the people's money.  Therefore, I am sorry that this legislation has come before us as it did. I hope the Minister will now address himself to the Shannon Free Airport and the Common Market and tell us as much more as he can about the present financial situation, instead of leaving us completely in the dark.</P>

      <P>When this Shannon Free Airport Development Company Bill came before us just two years ago, many of us expressed grave doubts as to the feasibility of what was proposed.  At that time, we were derided as defeatists and all the rest. Personally, I exposed at that time the chinchilla company and the chain hanky on which it depended.  It was the type of industry that should not for one moment have been considered in a practical development such as that at Shannon Airport especially when State funds were involved.  This time the bill is for almost £3,000,000. I know it is highly unpopular to say a word against giving away free money, that I should not try to prevent giving free money to the poor people of Clare or wherever it is.  That would be all very well if the free money came as manna from heaven but it comes from the taxpayers here, and besides we are all only too acutely aware of the many other parts of our national life which call for whatever we can give them from the taxpayers. The attitude towards many of these, particularly education, is parsimonious and in stark contrast to the policy <Col N="1655" /> adopted regarding industry and especially regarding the Shannon development.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the company was set up solely to promote the increased use of Shannon Airport for passenger and freight traffic.  The only connection with these industries is freight and the target held out is that, by 1965, after we have spent this additional sum of almost £3,000,000 air freight will increase by 5,000 tons per annum.  Five thousand tons seem an enormous amount but what is the cost of air freight?  Between here and the European mainland, it costs for small weights 9d. or 10d. per lb.  If you level it out at a shilling a lb.&mdash; which is too high&mdash;the total value of the air freight will be a mere £500,000 and that is not all profit.  In fact, the accounts of the air company show that if you make a few per cent. profit on that, you are doing mighty well. In the context in which we find ourselves facing free competition, we cannot expect that it is our airline which will gather all the fruits.  I think our main hope is that this legislation is permissive and our main wish for the future is that there will be far greater study and far more detailed examination of this project before any appreciable amount of this money is spent on it.</P>
      <P>In particular, I am amazed at this grandiose idea of building almost a city at the Airport.  The justification given by the Minister in the Dáil on July 25, at column 1650, was:</P>
      <P>The Airport is somewhat isolated from existing communities and industrialists already in production and firms about to commence production urged that housing should be provided in the immediate vicinity of the factory for a proportion of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think that Shannon Free Airport was in wild Indian country, whereas in fact it is 12 miles from Limerick, and about the same distance or maybe 14 miles from Ennis and considerably less from Sixmilebridge. Seeing that we are now taking the <Col N="1656" /> plunge into the European Common Market, beginning to broaden our horizons and taking the large scale view of industry and of distances, we might regard Shannon Airport as a suburb of Limerick or Ennis, whichever you wish to call it.  With the splendid road available between Limerick and Shannon, it should scarcely involve more than 20 or 25 minutes bus travel.  In those countries we will compete with in the Common Market, in Britain, Germany or France, workers in industrial areas would consider that they were living with the job, if they had to travel for only 20 minutes.  In fact a worker in New York would consider that he was quite well off if he was within an hour's journey of his office, so that as a start we should scrap this idea of a residential area there.</P>
    <P>Consider everything that goes to make up a residential area.  We need schools, primary and secondary, and we might even need a vocational school.  We need churches and hospitals. Where do we stop?  All these are available in superabundance in the adjoining city of Limerick and in Ennis.  I hope the first sign of realism will be a recognition of these areas. Again, we find that the taxpayers' money is being shovelled out to subsidise these residences.  The Minister stated that the average cost of a dwelling for the workers is £2,800 and that it is proposed in the coming year to spend £580,000 on housing.  That works out at even more than £2,800 per house.  Half of this amount is to be provided by way of free grant to the company and the rent to be charged to the workers is to be £7 a week.</P>
    <P>That does not seem to hang together. I cannot see workers in the industries listed here being capable of paying £7 a week for these houses.  I do not see why the taxpayer should be called on to pay £1,400 per house, for the pleasure of letting workers live closer to the jet aircraft flying overhead.  They say you get accustomed to the noise and even that it puts babies to sleep. That may be why they want to live there.  The money is to come back at 3½ per cent. per annum, spread over 30 <Col N="1657" /> years.  With our continuous inflation, we must realise that the spreading of the money over such a long period will mean that it will really never come back because the interest paid in the intervening period will scarcely make up for the depreciation in real value of the sum in that period.  Consequently, the whole project does not seem to make sense.</P>
    <P>There is the essence there of a scheme that could make sense, provided the neighbouring regions are properly utilised.  If the primary purpose of the company is to get air freight, surely in the future the main source of air freight from this country will be, we hope, fresh agricultural produce flown out to the large centres of population in Europe and, as we hope, at a later stage, even to America?  If that is to be the case, then obviously the company should look outwards much more.  Some of the money being spent would be far better spent in helping to subsidise some of the other companies, although I do not like to use the word &ldquo;subsidise&rdquo;.  A friend told me of a very promising meat industry in Limerick which was just beaten for the European markets because the cost per lb. of air freight from Shannon was a 1d. or 2d. more than would pay them in prevailing market conditions. I take it that he and his company would give far better value to the nation for any surplus money we have than the subsidising of residences around the Airport.</P>
    <P>The future of this project, and the spending of this £3,000,000 which we are voting to-day, is so completely and intimately tied up with the European Economic Community that we should pause here more than at any stage of our industrial effort and see precisely how it is to fare in the future before we commit large sums of State money. As an extra reason why this money should be given the Minister stated at column 1649 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>All these industries are primarily export industries and are not in competition for the home market with other Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Obviously, anybody reading the Treaty of Rome will see that that can no <Col N="1658" /> longer hold.  We cannot exclude them from the Irish market.  Likewise the attractions of a customs free zone will no longer hold when the countries in the European Economic Community form the union.  Consequently, this is a project on which we should go slowly and evaluate before we take the policy of throwing good money after bad, as it were.</P>
    <P>The Airport will stand on its own feet as an important commercial and industrial enterprise in Western Europe.  As an important transit and passenger and air freight terminal, it has its future, but before we begin building up new towns, let us concentrate on developing the towns and cities we have.  There is room enough to build there for the next 50 years before we start planning new townships. If we are after air freight, let us reach out to the whole hinterland at Shannon and do not let us limit ourselves to the confines of the airport town itself.</P>

    <Title>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1961    (Certified Money Bill):    Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clear up some misapprehensions voiced by some of the Fine Gael Senators in the course of their observations on the Second Reading of this Bill.  So far, there are about 60 fewer persons employed in Shannon Airport, which at the moment is doing very well.  Some <Col N="1659" /> 400,000 passengers passed through the Airport last year.  The number of terminal passengers is growing remarkably, as anyone can see from reading the report of Aerlínte for the past financial year.  The Industrial Estate is becoming more than a replacer of unemployed persons at the Airport.  It is becoming a new industrial project of its own with a very definite purpose of bringing industries to this country who wish to use air freight as a part of their general purpose in so coming.  I wish to make that clear beyond all doubt&mdash;that it has gone beyond the stage of what Senator O'Donovan described as a salvage operation.  It may be that the number of transit passengers in the Airport will diminish in time and that the Industrial Estate will pick up some of those unemployed persons and, in general, maintain the employment level, but at the moment that is not the case.</P>
      <P>Next, I want to say that there is not going to be any pause when this Bill is passed, if our Government are returned at the general election. Factories will be built ahead of time but in relation to the demand for them. The Shannon Development Company have no intention of building 32 factories all at once, without having any idea whether they will be needed. Factories will be built to the order of a concern in some cases and in advance in others, to ensure sufficiency in advance, but there is no warrant for the statement that money is being extravagantly spent, without due regard to the interests of the taxpayer, and, much more important in this case, of the citizens of this country, who, through the payment of interest and sinking fund, have in the first instance to provide the capital for the company, although, as I have already said, much of it will be repaid in the course of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By April 1st 1961, the present factory lessees tell us that about 1,262 people will be employed, and that if all goes well, about 2,000 people will eventually be employed: that is, in the factories already built and in the extensions that have been ordered by a number of those industrialists because they want to go ahead and <Col N="1660" /> increase the extent of their manufacture, or to manufacture commodities additional to those which they listed when they originally planned to come into the Airport.  On 30th June, 1961, there had been in the previous quarter 180 inquiries in regard to factory building and, of these, 77 came from the United Kingdom.  There are seven firms at the moment planning to start industries in the Shannon Industrial Estate and where the arrangements have reached an advanced stage.  We believe all seven will start.  That accounts quite completely for the envisaged factory building programme at the present time.</P>
    <P>I want also to repeat that the Shannon Air Estate is absolutely unique in the world.  There is no other estate where planes can taxi to the door of a factory and take on goods delivered by fork-lift truck and where the factory promoters can take delivery of materials delivered by fork-lift truck. The <i>raison d'être</i> of the Shannon Air Estate is the absence of double handling.  I hear that Luxembourg propose to do the same and good luck to them.  The Indians have made some inquiries of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company and I believe something of the kind will be set up in India, and good luck to them, too.  At the moment, this happens to be an absolute Irish first in our economy.  There is no reason why we should not speak not perhaps extravagantly but perhaps excitedly about this project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason this money is being asked for in advance of the <Col N="1662" /> general election is that some of the money is required before the general election, no matter what date it takes place, and the second reason is that we hope that if we pass the Bill and that if by any sorry chance, any other Government should be elected to office, they will not torpedo the project as happened in the case of the design to initiate an air service across the Atlantic some years ago.</P>
      <P>In regard to the position of the Shannon Industrial Estate, should we subscribe to the Rome Treaty and should the negotiations be completed, it would be impossible for me to say what steps will be taken in regard to the estate.  It may be desirable to incorporate the area within the Rome-Treaty area.  Other arrangements may be made.  At the moment, the number of inquiries continues to be just as great as it was before the project of adhering to the Rome Treaty was mooted.  There are reasons for that, too.  Labour is getting very scarce in most countries in Europe.  Twenty-five per cent. of the entire working labour force in Switzerland is foreign at the moment.  There are only a few countries where there is an available supply of labour.  There is not an available supply of labour here in quite a number of areas but there is in a great many areas.  It is our problem to reduce emigration and provide employment. Shannon offers very excellent prospects to manufacturers.</P>
      <P>We hope that the Shannon Industrial Estate will be a showpiece for this country in regard to industrial relations.  The very greatest care is being taken by the Shannon Airport Development Company to invite trade unionists and manufacturers who are interested in productivity, particularly all those who are expert, and in trying to see, when the new industries start, that labour relations will be good from the very first.  We hope that the Shannon Airport estate will set an example to the rest of the country because it is entirely new and there need be no old prejudices on the part of either employers or workers in relation to industrial relations.  That in itself should be an attraction to industrialists, regardless of the results of the Rome Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> Another advantage is that the industrialists who are now coming, genuinely believe in the idea of air freight.  It satisfies them.  For example, the main reason why the firm of Rippon came to manufacture pianos at Shannon was that they were looking for a site all over Europe from which they could distribute pianos by air and from which the pianos could be moved directly into the freight plane. That is a matter of very great importance to them in relation to freight costs and general expenses.  I give that as one example.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators tried to make calculations in regard to the capital cost per worker employed in setting up the estate.  On the basis that the maximum number employed in Shannon will be some 2,264 persons, the company's total investment will work out at £660 per worker.  The factory investment will be £2 million, in actual fact.  In terms of working capital and plant or £916 per worker, the total combined investment by the development company and the firms will work out at £1,576 per worker. That is on the basis that none of the options which exist in connection with the factory buildings to purchase these buildings by the companies concerned is taken up.  If the options are exercised and all the factories are purchased, the Development Company's total investment would be reduced to £298 per worker.</P>
    <P>One Senator gave a figure of £3,000 per worker which is a figure we received from the O.E.E.C.  The average cost of establishing a worker in full-time employment from the standpoint of capital required for all purposes in about £3,000.  Even if only two-thirds of the number predicted by the company, 2,264, were actually employed, the amount per worker would still fall below the level considered necessary by O.E.E.C.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, I should say that a number of expert town planners, Irish and foreign, have been employed in trying to decide how many people should live within the Airport area. The number of one in every three has been the result of the expert advice <Col N="1664" /> received from a number of persons, including people who established new satellite towns in Great Britain and also including Swedish, Dutch and our own experts.  I can assure the House that there are a great many people who would not object to living adjacent to the Airport from the point of view of noise.  The main runway is some distance away and the jet engines point forwards and backwards at right angles to the housing estate.  That eliminates a great deal of the unpleasant noise.  We are all getting used to living in noisy conditions.  There can be no doubt that people are getting used to the kind of noise they will have to experience in the housing area there.</P>
    <P>The rents of the flats will vary from £3 to £4 per week, according to the size of the flat.  They will be used by the better paid workers.  The houses will be used by executives.  The rents for them are higher.  The rent of the 100 houses will be more moderate and will be for the less highly paid type of worker.  I am glad to say that many of these flats have been booked and some of the industries have even asked for options to reserve accommodation for workers in the houses which have not yet been started.</P>
    <P>If all goes well, much of the capital will be repaid with interest over a long period.  If anybody wants to raise that matter on Committee Stage, I shall be glad to give the information. In connection with the factory buildings, there is an economic rental which, including maintenance of the outside of the buildings and all the other items of expense, should ensure the repayment of capital with interest over a period of 40 years.  In regard to the rental established for the various industries, some were established from the very beginning at an economic rent, while others were not.  It is a varying picture. It is impossible to say how far the whole operation will be fully economic. It is hoped they should be able to pay the quite reasonable economic rents judged by standards abroad.  The actual rent for the largest type of factory, including all expenses for maintenance &mdash; everything but rates &mdash; is 3/9d. per square foot, a reasonable figure.  Some are paying this figure and <Col N="1665" /> some are paying rents increasing by stages.</P>
    <P>In answer to Senator O'Donovan, the banks do not like lending long-term loans for industrial purposes and, as a result, the State capital guarantee system was given up and is being replaced by repayable advances.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to me that I should keep the sphere of the Company's operation within extremely narrow limits.  I am afraid that we do not intend anything of the kind.  Anything which adds to the name of Shannon, which increases the number of people coming to Shannon and touring from Shannon to other parts of the country will be promoted by the Shannon Development Company Ltd. If we can afford the money for it, I hope the promotional effort will grow more and more.  To avoid duplication, there are continuous meetings of the co-ordinating committee on which there are representatives of the air companies, Bord Fáilte, the Shannon Development Company and my Department so that wasteful expenditure can be avoided and every penny spent by the Company is put to good account.</P>
    <P>One of the Senators spoke about the scandalous expenditure for management by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  He referred to the fact that half of the money spent was for grants to industry and the other half purely on management.  The other half spent on management included over £100,000 spent on advertising the Industrial Estate and on a number of promotional ventures to advertise Shannon itself and to encourage people to start from Shannon on a tour of Ireland.  The actual running expenses which are naturally heavy in the early stages amount only to a quarter of the total grants issued by the Government and not to a half. Perhaps I should have given those figures in the course of my Second Reading speech.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan suggested that the value of industries in the Shannon Industrial Estate was limited in some way because of the way raw materials <Col N="1666" /> were imported and finished goods exported in the duty free areas.  In common with other places in this country, in order to qualify for Commonwealth preference, they must add an amount of manufacture to raw materials which varies from 25 per cent. &mdash; in the case of a great number of industries at Shannon, it is 50 per cent. &mdash; to as high as 75 per cent. value to be added to the cost of the raw materials if they are imported from outside the Commonwealth or British areas.  There are rebates on dutiable goods imported into the Republic and not only to the Airport area where those same goods are reexported, an arrangement has been made by the Government in a very large number of cases to ensure that export costs are kept down.</P>
    <P>I regret that the accounts were not ready for this debate.  A sinister implication was found in that in the Dáil, but in actual fact, as I remarked to Deputy McGilligan in the Dáil, all the accounts of the companies over which I have supervision arise to be presented just at the time the Dáil ends its session.  Therefore the ideal position would be that we should undergo the unusual procedure of voting the amount in this session and having the debate next session which carries with it disadvantages.  The Shannon Development Company's report was just a little later than other well established State Companies' reports due to the period of stress and strain they have gone through in the promotional activity of a new kind.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would remind the Seanad, the company started operation only in January 1959 and got going only about June 1959.  It has made very rapid progress.  Everything it has done had to be started <i>de novo</i>.  Nobody was experienced in this country in building factories in advance for people.  Nobody was experienced in building factories close to an airport and the whole of the propaganda, the whole promotional work for this novel idea, became successful in two years.  I would also add in regard to the suggestion that there was a pause in the development that some of the factories are not yet fully in operation.  The <Col N="1667" /> Rippon piano company is working only a quarter or one fifth of its full operation.  Workers are still being trained.  A great deal of machinery has not yet been installed in some of the other factories.  This is an entirely new venture and I hope it will have the support of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by saying that there will be no wild spending of money. Both the industries and the houses will be built <i>pari passu</i> with the demand for them.  I hope the project is going to succeed.  It would not on any account result in a whole collection of empty buildings built a long time ahead of the need for them.  It is a project that can grow steadily through the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that under the State Guarantees Act the Government guaranteed money to the banks but the banks do not like lending money for long term capital purposes.  They do not like making long term loans and it was felt wise to promote a company and to give the company power to have shares issued to it by the Minister for Finance.  At the same time, repayable advances can be made to the company under the terms of the Bill which can be paid on the same basis as that applying to the Local Loans Fund, namely, the principal amortised over a period of 35 years at an interest rate of 5½ per cent. Such an arrangement, I understand, is not readily possible to the commercial banks, so the State guarantees system came to an end in the normal way when the company itself was set up.</P>

      <P>This is the section that deals with the investment of moneys of the State.  On Second Reading, the Minister told us that this is not a salvage operation with no hope. It is hoped that any other Government elected will proceed with it.  He has told us that he has not got the foggiest notion what will happen if the Rome Treaty interferes with the undertaking and says that at this stage it is impossible to give an indication of the position. He did tell us that it is going on, that there is to be no pause and that this must go forward.  If the Common Market and its terms are carried through and the British Isles enter the Common Market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this happens, the advantage to the State so far as I can see will be the increase in freight caused by the existence of the Free Airport Company and the subsidiary factories.  The increase mentioned was 5,000 tons.  Five thousand tons is tiny. In freight, it is absolutely tiny.  Air freight is so expensive that it could be paid only on a piano or something like that or some of these things like precision threaded fasteners, miniature capacitors or transistor radios.  You could not send any bulky object by air freight even though it were relatively valuable.  Air freight rates are prohibitive in the ordinary course of commerce, but if the Minister makes the point that this is going to increase air freight, then he is restricting the commodities which can be produced at the factories at Shannon to exceedingly valuable, but exceedingly small objects. If I were to give an example, diamond drilling equipment is one and that is almost a laboratory operation.  We must face facts and that is what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> As Senator O'Donovan pointed out, we had in April this year an indication in the fact that for the first time the Shannon Free Airport accounts were removed from the State Guarantees Act and it now is actually voted money like the Local Loans Fund.  The reason given by the Minister is that the banks do not like lending money for long term commercial purposes.  He comes in here with the March 1960 accounts. May I make the point, as I did on Second Reading, that we here are the bank managers who hold the coffers of the ordinary citizens who are really the bank directors.  We have now moved from the commercial world where bank directors and bank managers do not like lending money for long-term commercial enterprise&mdash; I do not go along with the Minister in that; of course they like to lend money for commercial purposes if they are sound enterprises &mdash; into the realm of the State and the money is to be lent from the public purse.</P>
    <P>In fact the defence is made by the Minister in this case that of an expenditure of £400,000, £100,000 was spent on television and advertising, the promotion not only of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company but of Shannon Airport itself and everything that will increase traffic, and that this was a co-ordinated effort between Bord Fáilte, his Department and Shannon Airport.  Now we have gone into a different realm.  This is no longer a commercial proposition. We are going into the position whereby we are to spend money for the promotion of Shannon Airport as Shannon Airport.  I have no objection to the spending of public money for the promotion of Shannon Airport as Shannon Airport, but it is not right to come here and say it is a commercial proposition and that it is going to do extremely well and that the public money will be repaid, when in fact a defence of the expenditure of over £400,000 is that £100,000 went on the promotion of various things that have no relation to the real activities of the company itself.</P>
    <P>In reply to my allegation in regard to the manufacture of certain articles <Col N="1670" /> here that we were bringing in the broken down parts for a composite thing like a transistor radio, the Minister said that to gain the imperial preference you had to do at least 25 per cent. ranging upwards.  Some of these factories at Shannon are in fact doing 25 per cent. of the work on the end product and the best boast the Minister made was that in some cases they were getting up as high as 75 per cent.  I have little knowledge of what happens in radio factories but I suggest that, for instance, in the case of transistor radios, if you bring in the broken down parts, the assembling of them is in the neighbourhood of 25 per cent. of the total work on the project.  So there you are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>But in the case of some, it is 25 per cent.  I do not want to see this thing fail but I do not want to see this colossal expenditure at a time when we are about to enter the Common Market.  If the Minister had said: this is permissive legislation and the Government desire that not one penny will be spent and we are not going ahead until we see that it is a proposition under the Rome Treaty; we are not going to build factory space until we see whether under the Rome Treaty it is a proposition: we are not going to build houses for the workers there until we see clearly that under the Rome Treaty it is a practical proposition, then it would be possible to give it unqualified support.  But the Minister does not do that.  He says this is going on without a pause, that this will go on after the election and that that is their desire whatever Government are elected.  He said that that is why they brought this before the Houses of the Oireachtas, that <Col N="1671" /> whatever Government are elected they will go on with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall relate it entirely to Section 2.  The Minister for Transport and Power, speaking on the Air Navigation and Transport Bill, indicated the nature of this project <Col N="1672" /> which Senator O'Donovan said is a salvage project and which the Minister said is not.  Speaking at Column 828, Volume 51, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Some Senators have suggested that Shannon Airport may become a white elephant.  The Government are doing all they can to preserve, develop and expand activity there through the Shannon Development Company and through the promotion of this Bill.</P>
      <P>That was the Minister speaking in 1959 but there was a more recent authority and one which I am sure will commend itself to the Minister and the Government members.  It is the independent testimony of Deputy Russell who represents Limerick city. Speaking at Column 1655, Volume 191, of the Official Report, on this Bill he said:</P>
      <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company followed the establishment of the Shannon Free Airport Development Authority in November, 1957.  At a meeting held in Shannon Airport, some time around that period, the aims of the new Authority were set out.  It was visualised that with the development of jet aircraft Shannon Airport would be overflown to a considerable extent and that that would react particularly on the transit passenger traffic and the transit freight traffic, which has brought such considerable expansion and employment to the Airport.  It was felt that unless a vigorous effort was made by a body charged with that duty, Shannon Airport might dwindle considerably from the point of view of giving employment.</P>
      <P>I should be rather inclined to accept this independent testimony of Deputy Russell who presumably, as an active Deputy, was engaged in these vital negotiations to preserve Shannon Airport.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the financial risk to which the Minister referred earlier in the evening.  He had also stated at Column 1651, Vol. 191 that this Shannon Airport Development Company was an experiment involving considerable risk. Those are weighty words, and their relevance to this section is that here we propose to increase the capital of the company from £1,500,000 to £3,000,000.  I think it proper, therefore, to inquire into the justification of increasing the capital of the company by that amount.</P>
      <P>I would have long since concluded on this section if I had been permitted to do so.  All I wanted to say was that here we are increasing the capital for this project which involves considerable risk, and I trust that the Minister in making these disbursements to the company, will take into account the circumstances of the present time and, in particular, the possibility that this may well be the white elephant to which he referred on the Air Navigation and Transport Bill debate in this House in 1959.</P>

      <P>That is very much the point.  We had an Agricultural Workers Bill this evening, and a Holidays Bill and, in both, the term &ldquo;workers&rdquo; was defined.  In the context of this section and in the ordinary course of events, one would expect the word &ldquo;workers&rdquo; to mean those employed in the manipulative work of factories, not top-class executives and company directors drawing perhaps £2,000, £3,000 or £4,000 per year.  If we are to make grants or advances on particularly attractive terms and conditions for the building of houses, we ought to know whether these are to be made available to people drawing such incomes, or confined to people engaged in production and people in offices earning, say, under £1,000 per annum. It does not do for the Minister to say that everybody is a worker.  Everybody is a worker, including a millionaire, for sometimes millionaires work.</P>

In the case of this section enabling repayable advances to be issued out of the Central Fund, the whole of the <Col N="1677" /> principal with interest has to be repaid as in the manner of Local Loans, so that so far as this section is concerned the matter is completely as Senator O'Quigley would wish it to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one observation I want to make, arising out of the Minister's reply on Second Stage. It was very interesting to hear the circumstances in which the Shannon Free Airport Development Company has been removed from the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954. Apparently, the views which were expressed by Senator O'Donovan and Senator Donegan this afternoon were shared by the banks.  The Minister told us the banks would not lend money for a project of this kind, that they did not like lending money for periods of as long as 25 years, that they did not like that kind of business, that they believed only in short-term loans.  I took the Minister down as giving that indication.</P>
      <P>The Minister should realise that we all know that banks do in fact lend money to local authorities for house-building purposes and other such things for periods up to at least 25 years.  It is significant that in relation to this Bill the banks would not lend money for a similar period, even though the loans were being guaranteed by the State.  That view shows that the opinions expressed by Senators on this side of the House this afternoon and the doubts and anxiety they have concerning this project were not unfounded and certainly were shared in other quarters &mdash; or perhaps it is that the declining stock of the Government is noted by the banks and that they will not make any more loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I want to raise on <Col N="1678" /> this final stage is that the Minister apparently has assumed to himself&mdash; upon what authority I do not know&mdash; the right to give directions to this company in relation to the utilisation of the money.  I understood that this company had its own board of directors.  I do not know on what authority the Minister for Transport and Power can give directions to the company as to the manner in which they shall expend this money.  If it should happen that the project &mdash; or some parts of it&mdash;does not succeed, the Minister can say: &ldquo;This is the company's business.  If you establish an independent company, there is nothing you can do about it.  You must let them run their own business.&rdquo; On the other hand, it will be very difficult for a company, knowing all the facts and carrying out their business from day to day, successfully to utilise the moneys to the best advantage, if they are to have the interference of the Minister in matters in which, not being Minister for Industry and Commerce, he is not technically qualified to give any directions.  Where does the Minister find authority to, as he puts it &ldquo;give directions to the company&rdquo; as to the manner in which they shall direct their efforts in relation to the expenditure of money under this Bill?</P>

      <P>I should like to express my complete disapproval of the Bill. I appeal to the Minister to go very slowly.  I would say that no member of this House or of the Dáil has a greater admiration than I have for any member of the Cabinet who will take steps to forward any project to help to give employment to our people. I say with all sincerity that, with the present position in regard to Europe, this is the silliest proposal that has ever been put before a House of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister lays great stress on being near Shannon Airport.  I do not want to repeat all that Senator Donegan said.  Is it not a fact that in our time we shall not be able to use planes for really heavy traffic? Is it not true that they can carry only certain light valuable articles? Therefore, the setting-up of a <Col N="1679" /> satellite town and the building of houses at Shannon Airport at a time when the doors of many houses in Mayo, Galway, Donegal and other places are being closed, and have been closed in the past 10 or 12 years, is surely not reasonable.</P>
    <P>This very doubtful project would make some sense if it had been proposed before there was any question of joining the Common Market but now I am satisfied that it is a very foolish move.  It is putting a burden on our people that should not be placed on them.  We cannot build the nation from Shannon Airport as we can build it from the homes in Connaught and elsewhere.  The people there are the right type of people on which to build the nation.  If help and encouragement were given to them to stay in this country and to continue with their own way of life, it would be a much wiser course.  I am sorry that a Minister who is so able&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A lot of people are coming in here because we have protection and the right of entry to the British and Commonwealth markets.  I like to hear of people coming into this country and starting industries but what will the people I have been referring to do, if a change should now take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said they would build those houses for executive officers and that the full economic rent would be paid.  That is sensible.  However, suppose the industries do not succeed. Already two out of ten have failed. What guarantee have we that 32 more will succeed?  If the Minister erects these houses and these people lose their employment, who will occupy the houses?  We have often heard talk about white elephants.  This project may very well become a white elephant.  I appeal very specially to the Minister to go more slowly in the erection of the satellite town.  I hope <Col N="1680" /> I am wrong but I am afraid that he is making a grave mistake nationally.</P>

      <P>I think I answered nearly all the points in my Second Reading speech.  The Minister for Transport and Power has the right to give a general direction to State companies indicating the extent to which they should conform with Government policy in relation to the national economy.  I would refer Senator O'Quigley to my speech on the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power.  I dealt in general with the extent to which my Department deals with State companies and the Senator might find it interesting reading.</P>
      <P>I totally and utterly disagree with any Senator who says it is not an excellent thing to found light engineering industries in this country.  I hope they will dot the countryside.  We need far more people with scientific skill. Nothing could be better than the development of engineering industries and of industries requiring precision, where the parts are small.  It will result eventually in the development of ancillary industries.  One of our great needs is the establishment of light engineering industries making laboratory instruments.  Please heavens, we will be able to make laboratory instruments in the course of the next 20 years and from that will come the beginning of what we have got to have here if we are to have a truly industrial era, namely, industrial research and invention.  We can never do that until we have light engineering industries and, above all, industries which will build laboratory instruments.  I would almost go down on my knees to have that happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as employment is concerned, many people employed at Shannon come from the small farms in the neighbourhood.  In regard to the European Economic Community, I believe that there is room for an air industrial estate working in conformity with the Rome Treaty regulations modified to the extent that is necessary as a result of negotiation.  It would be quite wrong for me to start to indicate the various alternative methods of providing for that co-ordination. I think I have answered all <Col N="1681" /> the points made in the course of the debate on the Final Stage.</P>

    <Title>Local Authorities (Education Scholarships) (Amendment) Bill, 1961: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Seanad are aware of the inadequacy of scholarships both in regard to numbers and value.  When the Taoiseach announced in Dáil Éireann in October, 1959, that it was the intention to set about remedying that position it fell to me to investigate as to how this might best be done. Three alternatives presented themselves. The first was to establish a scheme of direct State scholarships side by side with the local authority schemes which have been functioning under the 1908 Universities Act and the 1944 Education Scholarships Act.  The second was to scrap the local authority schemes and to replace them entirely by a State scheme.  The third was to allow the local authority schemes to function as at present but to supplement and increase by way of State subvention the moneys for scholarships which the local authorities are already providing under the 1908 and 1944 Acts.</P>
      <P>The third course appealed to me most.  The existing schemes have worked well.  Their main fault was that the money provided under them was grossly inadequate.  Their administration involved, amongst other things, the creation of a local interest in matters appertaining to education&mdash; something very much to be desired. In education, especially, local opinion contributes a great deal to the creation of that climate which is so essential to all reforms.  Furthermore, it is a sound maxim that if you have a satisfactory structure it is preferable to build on it rather than to tear it down and build afresh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position in the matter of scholarships is that about £150,000 per annum is provided under the local authority schemes.  The contributions of the local authorities vary.  In one <Col N="1682" /> case the contribution is as low as the product of 1d. in the £ valuation. In the majority of cases, the contribution is in the 3d. to 4d. in the £ bracket and in one case it is over 5d. in the £.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House represents a new step in so far as it is the first time that the State contemplates providing money on a general scale for scholarships.  In the first year of its operation, the State would contribute £ per £ up to the equivalent of the amount raised by a rate of 1d. in the £.  In the second, the State's contributions on a £1 per £1 basis would be extended to the equivalent of the amount raised by 2d. in the £.  In the third and fourth years, the State's contribution would be on the basis £1.  10 to £1 and would be extended to the 3rd and 4th pennies in the £ respectively.</P>
    <P>It is felt that the provisions of the Bill contain the necessary incentives to those local authorities that have not been as forthcoming as others in their scholarship provision.  Consequently, it is hoped that by the end of the 4th year all local authorities will have availed fully of its provisions and that then the position will be reached where the State will be contributing annually about £300,000 for scholarships as against about £240,000 from the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I do not claim for this Bill that it is the answer to all complaints in the matter of our provision for scholarships. I do claim for it, however, that it sows the seed in a very substantial way and that it fulfils the promise made.</P>
    <P>The most important feature of the Bill is that it acknowledges the right of a very talented child to an opportunity of climbing the whole educational ladder.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum which accompanied the draft Bill gives details of what is involved in relation to each section of the Bill.  There are, however, two features of the Bill to which I would like to make special reference.  The first relates to the fact that it is proposed that one-fourth of the monies will be allocated to scholarships to be awarded on merit alone, <Col N="1683" /> that is, without a means test.  The difficulty about a means test is that it does not matter at what level it is settled there will be some one talented boy or girl excluded from a scholarship whose parents for one reason or another would not be able without the scholarship to give that boy or girl further education.  It is vital in the world in which we live that all the best talent at our disposal is developed to the full without reference to the economic level from which such talent comes.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to make special reference is that it is intended under the Bill that in future schemes the amount to be allocated for university scholarships should not be more than half the amount to be allocated for post-primary scholarships. At the present time we have in some counties the entirely disproportionate position of the major portion of the money allocated for scholarships being devoted to university scholarships. The proportion of 2 to 1 is, it is felt, a fair one taking into account on the one hand the proportion of post-primary pupils who proceed to the university and on the other the relative costs of post-primary and university education.</P>
    <P>There is the further benefit to be derived from the Bill that the fact that State money is being provided for scholarships would place the Minister for Education in the position of being able to insist that anomalies in existing schemes are removed.  Heretofore, the Minister had very little power in that regard.</P>
    <P>All in all, I feel that the Bill represents a considerable step forward in the recognition of the fact that it is our duty to develop our best national resources which are the brains and ability of our people.  I hope that all members of this House, in common with other public men, will use their influence to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are fully availed of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this Bill represents a step forward.  It makes provision for money for the first time from central funds for the educational ladder in <Col N="1684" /> regard to scholarships.  The Minister hopes&mdash;I think he is probably right&mdash; that this scheme will increase the amount of money given by local bodies. Since the scheme provides more money, it cannot be opposed and it should be welcomed but, in my view, it has two defects.  As compared with other countries, we make a very small provision for what the Minister called, and what was called in the old Sinn Féin days, the educational ladder.</P>
      <P>There are two reasons for providing scholarships for talented children.  One is that it does justice to them and the other&mdash;and a very important one&mdash;is that it adds to the national resources, adds to our general position in the world, adds to our productivity and improves our situation generally.  Up to the present, we have taken very poor steps in comparison with other people in that direction.  That is one of my objections.  The Minister's answer to that, I presume, will be that this is a beginning.</P>
      <P>My other objection is that I do not agree that the Minister who had three choices before him adopted the right course by endeavouring to adapt and improve the present machinery.  On the Minister's own showing, that machinery would require a great deal of improvement.  First of all, there are many differences in the county council schemes.  In the beginning, when the county councils and borough councils were given power to give scholarships to the universities under the 1908 University Act, I take it that the British Government were trying to associate the only Irish institutions which then existed with university education.  As this Bill itself indicates, the situation is different now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an Irish State and an Irish Government.  I must say that it seems to me at any rate that in the matter of scholarships to the universities there should be combined with the present local schemes a State scheme which would have no means test, where scholarships would be given on merit alone.  Such a scheme would be very fruitful both from the point of view of giving students of merit an opportunity of going forward to higher education and from the point of view <Col N="1685" /> of providing the country with better educated people generally.</P>
    <P>The local schemes vary.  First and foremost, they tend to be inadequate. Some counties have a rate as low as one penny; one has a rate of over 5d. Some counties&mdash;I speak of university scholarships because I have some experience of them&mdash;go to something as low as £95 and £95 is a wholly inadequate sum.  Each local body differs in the amount granted, differs in the conditions under which scholarships may be won, differs in the means test.  A means test is a difficult thing to work.  Speaking entirely for myself &mdash;and I am sure some of my rural rate-paying colleagues would not agree with me&mdash;it should be abolished altogether, but we cannot do that under this particular Bill.  The means test works unfairly.  I have never closely investigated the cases, but over and over again it has been pointed out that young Murphy fails to get a scholarship because everybody knows what Murphy's father has per year.  He is a county surveyor or in some kind of post like that, or the father and mother are both teachers.  Their income is ascertainable, whereas young Kelly is given a scholarship, although his father is better off than Murphy.  His work is of a different kind and his income is not so ascertainable, so provable.  It is constantly said&mdash;I think with some force&mdash;that the means test works inequitably.  The level of the means test is too low when you consider the present value of money.  There is a great case for uniformity.</P>
    <P>The amount of money necessary for either a post-primary scholarship or for a university scholarship should of course be very substantially raised. I should like to make the point through you, Sir, to the House and to the Minister that we have not by any means kept pace with the position in 1908, to go back as far as that.  The entrance scholarship to the old Jesuit college, University College, Dublin, was £30.  It has now for University College, Dublin, been raised to £250 and there is an opinion that even that is not an adequate sum and that it should be £300.  A great many people would agree that an adequate university <Col N="1686" /> scholarship would be £300.  Under the private bishop's scholarship scheme a £50 scholarship was given as far back as 1905 or 1904.  The amount of a scholarship now would have to be very substantial to measure up to £50 given in 1904, and I can testify that before the 1914 war and even before the University Act of 1908 it was possible for a university student to make in prizes over £100 which was more than any skilled craftsman in Dublin could earn at that time.  It would not be possible now for a similarly circumstanced boy to make anything to approach what his father would earn as a wage.  So scholarships should be much higher if they are to keep pace with the fall in the value of money and the general increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>There is, from my point of view, one grain of light in the Bill which is that the Minister by virtue of the grants he proposes to make to local bodies will have certain powers to create uniformity.  But I doubt if he has the power to compel them to increase the rate.  I do not think he has.  All he can says is: &ldquo;If you give more money for scholarships the State will give more as well&rdquo; and there are places where, I feel, he will find that that argument will not cut a very great deal of ice.</P>
    <P>The whole machinery is creaking none too satisfactorily and it would be much better if we could have a scheme of State Scholarships.  Apart from the differences in schemes this is a rather delicate subject to approach and argue on, but it is much easier to get scholarships in certain counties than in others.  I had something to do, as a member of a scholarship board for a number of years, with looking at scholarship marks.  There are places where there are five scholarships and the sixth candidate who gets 70 per cent. does not get a scholarship.  In other places, no candidate has more than 60 per cent. and the fourth or fifth candidate may get a little less than 50 per cent. and have to be raised for the purpose of qualifying them for scholarships. Your chance of getting a scholarship therefore depends to some extent on <Col N="1687" /> where you live.  That, I think, is not what the Minister wants or what anyone wants.  It is more difficult to get scholarships in certain places than in others.</P>
    <P>I know that it would be argued that it would not be fair to have a complete State scheme whereby certain areas might never come into the picture at all perhaps&mdash;but surely the Minister could devote some part of the money he proposes to put to this particular use now to giving scholarships on, say, the Leaving Certificate examination, given on the performance of the student in that examination irrespective of his place of residence and irrespective of his means.  I think that would be a very great advantage.  In the old Intermediate Board days, there were exhibitions in the senior grade and I think the last one was £40.  It would have to be very much greater now, but that was a great help to a person going into a university those days.</P>
    <P>It might be necessary to make certain changes in the Leaving Certificate examination, but that is a thing that could be seen to.  I think it would be desirable that scholarships to the universities should be given on the Leaving Certificates examination or on a special examination if you like conducted by the Department or conducted as arranged.  It would be a significant improvement because good candidates would get into the universities with adequate scholarships on merit without any regard to location, the residence of their parents, or their parents' means.  I think that would be a highly desirable thing.  I do not think that the Minister could do it under this scheme but if it is contemplated that more money should be spent on scholarships, scholarships to universities in particular, it should be considered.</P>
    <P>There are certain anomalies which you cannot get over.  In the case of scholarships, as everybody knows, boys are better off than girls for the reason that the Christian Brothers provide education for nothing or at a very low rate for boys while very little of these facilities are available for girls and I do think the Minister will have his <Col N="1688" /> work cut out for him when he starts to deal with local bodies on scholarships. I do not envy him the task he will have and it would be better if the extra money were devoted to seeing where we could get the best talent available.</P>
    <P>Section 1 prescribes that one-fourth of the money is to be given on merit alone.  I do not know how that is to be worked.  Where there are five scholarships, which is the common figure, how many scholarships will you give on merit alone and how will you decide?  That will be difficult, but it is an improvement.  I am not quite clear as to how the Minister arrives at the conclusion that he should give twice as much money for scholarships from primary to post-primary institutions than he gives from secondary schools to universities.  The cost of maintenance either in Dublin, Cork or Galway, for a full academic year, with the necessary money for taking part in college activities, involves a very substantial sum.</P>
    <P>There have been regulations, for example, to the effect that county council scholars must take Honour courses.  In fact that is not always feasible and it does not work.  It is possible for a man or woman to get a scholarship and to find after the first year in the university that he or she cannot be advised to take Honour courses.  It is certainly very unfair to put a professor or a couple of professors, discussing this matter from the point of the student, in the position that if they advise him not to do Honours he loses the scholarship.  That is a regulation that is not desirable.</P>
    <P>There will be £300,000 allocated to these schemes and of that, £100,000 will be devoted to university scholarships. If £50,000, or £25,000 were given in exhibitions on the Leaving Certificate, tenable in a university college, you would get a fair number of scholarships worth £300, which, I think, would be very desirable.  I agree with the aims of the Minister and of the Bill; I merely differ with regard to how these aims can be achieved.  I appeal to the Minister to find a scheme which will allow a student of merit, irrespective <Col N="1689" /> of residence or means, to get to the university.</P>
    <P>We all agree that economic circumstances should not be a bar to the person who deserves a better education, either secondary, vocational or university.  It would not be extremely costly because it is not true, although it is sometimes said in enthusiastic speeches, that there is an enormous fund of genius and talent awaiting development if the Government would give enough money for its development. That is not so, but it is the case that there are people who could benefit from more education and whose economic circumstances, the circumstances of their parents, prevent them from getting it.  I am entirely in agreement with the Minister in endeavouring to get an improvement in that regard.  While this Bill goes a certain distance, and will have the effect of evening out the inadequacies and differences in local schemes, there is another scheme which would have a better result without spending any more money.  In the meantime I agree with the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely support what Senator Hayes has said. There is no doubt that a State scheme would have very great advantages, and I hope the Minister will work towards that end.  There is also no doubt that at present the scholarships generally are entirely inadequate.  The sum of £95 is ludicrous for any student going to the university.  The very least that is required, from my experience with a son living at home, is about £250 a year.  If he was not living at home it would be about £300.  That is in Trinity College, Dublin.  It may not be quite as much elsewhere, but for us it is pretty well a basic figure.  Some of the English authorities are giving scholarships of £300, so that in any circumstances £95 is totally inadequate. Senator Hayes mentioned a figure of something like £300, with which I entirely agree.  If you want students to live decently and get from the university something more than merely slogging at their books and at examinations they must be given more.  And probably it will be that little bit more <Col N="1690" /> that will help them most in later life. I also agree with Senator Hayes that award of scholarships on the Leaving Certificate is very often the best basis. I hope the Minister will keep that in mind.</P>
      <P>Taking the Bill as a whole, I am sure very few taxpayers will begrudge this small addition to their burden. Some might readily accept the addition of a few more shillings for a more generous scheme.  It is of course the greatest platitude, but it must be repeated, that in this competitive, scientific age we must have the highest possible scientific and technological education.  It must also be argued and asserted that in a world which is so distracted in morals and standards we need the best possible philosophical and humanistic education, in the good sense of the word humanistic.  I hope the Minister will never fall for the science-above-all doctrine which is exploited in some quarters.  I think our scientific colleagues in this House and elsewhere would be the first to agree that the other basis, the philosophical basis and the humanistic basis, is also essential.</P>
      <P>I should like to speak on one special aspect of the Bill.  The Minister said he intended to remove anomalies in the existing scheme as far as possible.  There are some anomalies in the present scheme as he probably knows and it is his duty, since he is spending public funds on this&mdash;and I know he realises it, as he has said so&mdash; to reconsider certain aspects of the schemes in certain parts of the country. The fact is that a proportion of the local authorities refuse to grant their scholarships to Trinity College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put it on record just which of them do, and which do not, grant their scholarships to T.C.D. Those authorities which grant scholarships freely to Trinity are the following: Cavan, Donegal, County Dublin, Kerry, Kildare, Leix, Limerick City, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Roscommon, Westmeath and Wicklow.  Under certain conditions scholarships can be held at Trinity from the following: Carlow, Leitrim, Louth, Sligo, Waterford and Wexford.  The rest for various reasons, some from geographical <Col N="1691" /> and some others, refuse to allow their scholars to come to us.  On the other hand, all the authorities in Northern Ireland, without any condition or question, say that their scholars can come to Trinity College or to University College.  There is no restriction of any kind so far as I know from the Northern Ireland counties.  That is considerably to their credit.  It shows in a rather remarkable way that there is no boundary in the educational world, unless I am misinformed.</P>
    <P>What perhaps some of us, including a few of us in this House, feel particularly is the peculiar situation in the City of Dublin.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to this very carefully. In 1910 Dublin Corporation decided that they would not grant scholarships to Trinity College unless Irish were made compulsory for all students in Trinity College at the matriculation examination.  This is 1961, and things have changed a good deal.  In the Intermediate Certificate Irish is compulsory and for the scholarship candidates in the Leaving Certificate in the Dublin city scheme Irish is compulsory.  There is no question whatever that those candidates who get the required marks in the Leaving Certificate are fully qualified in Irish, but still they cannot come to Trinity College, Dublin&mdash;its other name is Dublin University&mdash;not through any fault of theirs but, if any fault there be, because Trinity College has not thought fit to make Irish compulsory in its matriculation examination.</P>
    <P>That, I understand, is the situation, and I appeal to the Minister to think it over.  Is it reasonable in the capital city of our country that a provision laid down in 1910 in completely different circumstances should still be operative? In this city, there are a good many paying substantial rates and taxes who would like to send their children to Trinity College, Dublin.  I have no figures, but I suppose that perhaps one-fifth of the taxes is the possible figure: if you allow for big firms like Guinness, perhaps more. Those taxpayers and ratepayers cannot <Col N="1692" /> send their children to Dublin University, not through any lack of qualification in Irish on the part of the candidates but simply because Dublin University has not made Irish compulsory at the matriculation examination. I suggest to the Minister that this perhaps is one of the anomalies he ought to look into.  Some of the other county councils take something like the same view.  It does not seem a reasonable view to me and to others.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister wants to interfere as little as possible with the autonomy of the local authorities.  I feel very much the same myself.  I would like to see as much local autonomy as possible.  But this situation is bordering on national injustice. I would like the Minister to consider it very seriously in that light. If he can do anything to persuade the County Councils and Corporation to change these conditions he would be doing the State in general some service. There is a certain indignation, even a rankling sense of injustice&mdash;I do not say a blazing sense of injustice &mdash;in this matter.  Why should we pay taxes and rates in Dublin and not have this opportunity?  To be quite frank, it is almost a kind of blackmail on behalf of the national language.</P>
    <P>It comes to this: these local authorities say, &ldquo;If Dublin University does not make Irish compulsory in the entrance examination, we will not let any scholars go there.&rdquo;  Leaving aside any question of justice towards Trinity College, Dublin, is it fair to the children of Dublin citizens, that they should be the victims of what to my mind, to speak frankly, amounts to a kind of pressure, at any rate?</P>
    <P>The circumstances are pretty well familiar to the whole House and I will not labour them.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to courageously tackle &mdash;as I have just courageously split an, infinitive&mdash;this question.  I think that a great many public-spirited citizens, not simply those who feel that they have a personal grievance but many others as well, would be pleased and grateful if he would remove this anomaly.  That is a special matter and naturally I feel very strongly on it.  To return to the general provisions of the Bill: it is quite clearly a welcome step <Col N="1693" /> forward.  But of course it is only a very small step compared with the opportunities in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain.  If one looks into the comparative figures there, it is very small indeed.  And it is the beginning, I hope, of a more generous policy in finding these opportunities for our brilliant boys and girls and our very good boys and girls who may save this country in 20 or 30 years' time.  They are the people we look to, not just the plodders but the few with a creative brilliance. That is what we really want&mdash; creative brilliance&mdash;and it may be that this scheme properly administered will make that saving difference in the coming generation.  I earnestly hope it will.</P>

      <P>In common with the earlier speakers, of course I welcome this Bill.  It is a step in the right direction but it is a very small step. We hope that it will be followed by others in the future.  I agree with everything that has been said by both the previous speakers.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Hayes that there is a great deal to be said for having university scholarship schemes on a national rather than a local basis to bring about uniformity of administration and of standing.  I also agree with him strongly about the undesirability of means tests, especially as at present applied.  This Bill provides extra scholarships for secondary education and also for university education, and it is only in relation to the latter that I have any special knowledge.  Therefore, any remarks I make on this Bill will be in relation to university scholarships.  I shall not speak about secondary scholarships because I have no special knowledge on that subject.</P>

    <P>I am very pleased that some of the scholarships to universities to be provided in the future will not contain a means test.  The means test has in fact excluded a good many young people from university education who should not be excluded.  There are marginal cases&mdash;white collar workers, families with a large number of children and so on&mdash;who are excluded by the present means test but in fact are not able to pay for their children's education as well as many people who, as Senator Hayes said, may be able to put up a <Col N="1694" /> better facade regarding their need for money.  Therefore, it is generally agreed in progressive countries today that the less means tests the better for higher education.  I am also glad that the residential qualification is made rather less rigid, as a national scheme, of course, is better than a local scheme.  The fewer restrictions on a residential basis the better.</P>
    <P>Another good point about the Bill is that most of the scholarships will be increased in value, apart from the increase in the number of scholarships. As Senator Hayes said, there has not been a correct upward adjustment in this matter in recent years.  The cost of education is growing very rapidly.  The cost of living in university towns is also growing.  It is very desirable indeed from the university point of view that whatever scholarships are given should be sufficient to enable students to live comfortably during their student years.  In that, I entirely agree with Senator Stanford.  I think scholarships should be sufficiently generous to dispense with the necessity for students to do vacation work. A great deal of this vacation work undermines a student's capacity to study.  I am speaking from long experience of this subject.  Many of our students in University College have to go off to England during the long vacation to do quite menial tasks in order to keep themselves alive at a period when they should be, at best, studying for their examination or perhaps, at second best, resting.  I think that any scholarships that are given should be sufficiently high.</P>

    <Title>Local Authorities (Education Scholarships) (Amendment) Bill, 1961&mdash; Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making is that I agree with Senator Stanford that scholarships should be <Col N="1696" /> adequate to enable students to live in comfort and that their attention should not be distracted by having to earn supplemental incomes during that period when they should be studying or possibly resting.  I shall not delay the House on this Bill for the reason that the whole question of the admission of students to universities, will, I take it, be discussed by the Commission on Higher Education.  This is a very important body which is sitting now and it will report on every aspect of higher education.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I look on this as a purely interim measure.  I do not see any point in having a long debate on it because the issues which could be raised in that debate are very far-reaching. They would take a great deal of time to discuss but I take it for granted these are issues which will be discussed by the Commission on Higher Education. I shall not do more than raise one or two points of general interest now, in the hope that they might attract the attention of the Commission, and thank the Minister for taking a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>As everybody has stated today on every Bill before the House, this country is faced with a period of growing competition.  The changes taking place in regard to the external situation make it very necessary indeed for all our costs of production in industry and agriculture to be lowered so that we can compete both at home and abroad.  Therefore, everybody is agreed, I think, that the best possible technical, professional and commercial efficiency should be obtained.  Our people must be able to compete with other people.  That requires that they be on a high level technically and scientifically in relation to agriculture, industry and commerce.  This involves education.  Education is regarded by everybody today as the central long period of investment in every country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally recognised, I think, that the basis of international trade is that every country should develop its natural advantages, whatever they may be, and explore the advantages with which Providence has endowed the country.  I do not think it is conceited <Col N="1697" /> of us in this House to say that one of our natural advantages is a great deal of native talent.  I do not think we are really being conceited on congratulating ourselves on being, on the whole, a clever nation.  That is the reputation we have in the world. Whereas we are lacking in natural resources of other kinds, we have been very well endowed with intelligence. It is our duty in the international task of developing our natural resources to develop the intelligence of our people to the highest possible point.</P>
    <P>That requires education.  On that, I would like to add my voice to that of Senator Stanford.  By education I think primarily of the humanities.  I entirely agree with that.  There must be scientific and technical education, but education directed purely into scientific and technical spheres is not the type of education that brings out the best qualities in any nation.  I am entirely in agreement with Senator Stanford, that a classical and mathematical education are the types of education that lay the foundation of other types of education by training the mind.  The people who proceed to those types of education are the people who will be not only the most cultivated citizens but the most useful and the most adaptable to new ideas and processes.</P>
    <P>As has been said already in this debate, the total amount available for education in this country is limited. Our Budget is already high every year. We cannot go on increasing expenditure, unfortunately.  Therefore the amount of money available for education of all types in this country is rather limited.  Therefore it becomes a very important matter indeed to ensure that whatever is spent on education is spent in the best possible way.  The problem really is to try to utilise to the best advantage the talent of this country within the rather narrow financial resources available in the Budget.  We must try to ensure that as much talent as possible is put to good effect or, putting it another way, that as little talent as possible is wasted.</P>
    <P>This raises an extremely difficult problem which I have no intention of <Col N="1698" /> dwelling on this evening.  I am not qualified to do so.  It is one of the most difficult problems I suppose in politics and it is one which I hope will be dealt with satisfactorily by the Commission on Higher Education.  The problem is how is the capacity to benefit by education to be found out. How is it to be spotted?  How is selection to be made?  What is the best way of sorting people who are capable of benefiting from education from the people who are not?  That is an extremely difficult question.</P>
    <P>In this country, the amount for higher education is admittedly inadequate. Taking all groups in the population, taking the population as a whole, the percentage of people getting higher education&mdash;and by that I mean particularly university education&mdash;is a great deal less than the average in Europe today and in other advanced countries.  The proportion of the lower income group is quite abnormally low. I cannot give a figure but I have seen a figure recently prepared for the Commission on Higher Education showing that the percentage of the children from the lower income group in this country receiving university education is very low.  Indeed, it is very much lower than in England, Scotland or Northern Ireland.  That, of course, is not a satisfactory state of affairs.  The percentage of the population as a whole getting education is low and the percentage of the lower income group is abnormally low.</P>
    <P>We are now getting into some of the most debatable and difficult questions in politics.  One could discuss at great length, if one had the knowledge and the time, the very difficult question as to whether ability is evenly spread among the different income groups. What reason have we to believe that the percentage of able children is the same in the lower income group as in the higher income group?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if that is relevant to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not pursue the matter any further.  Whatever is the answer to that debatable question, I think we will all agree that in the lower income group in this country <Col N="1699" /> there is a great deal of potential ability which is now going to waste. There must be many children in the lower income group who could benefit by higher education if they could get it.  The problem is to choose the children who will benefit most from our scarce educational resources.  From my long experience in the educational world, I would say that the mere capacity to pass examinations at an early age is not in itself a conclusive test. Many children mature late.  I am quite certain that a large number of talented children are excluded from university education.  From my experience in University College Dublin, I would say that some of the very best students mature late.  If their entrance to a university depended upon their ability to pass examinations as children, they would never have got to the university and the country would have lost a lot as a result.</P>
      <P>There is another question which bears directly on this problem of allocating our scarce educational resources among the largest possible number of people.  Should all the children who can afford to pay and who pass a simple test such as matriculation be entitled to have university education? It is always taken for granted that they should.  If the amount of ability in the country is very large in relation to the amount of money available for higher education, is it right that children, by the mere accident of having rich parents, should be able to occupy what might be scarce places in universities which could be more advantageously occupied by the children from other families who come up by way of scholarships?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the issues that the Minister has raised in this problem are really very much bigger than the mere content of the Bill.  What should be the basis of higher education &mdash; the capacity to pay, the capacity to benefit or, as one speaker said, the capacity to benefit the country?  It does not always follow that the person who benefits himself more by university education is the person who benefits the country most.  That, again, raises the whole question of the emigration of educated people&mdash;that vast question <Col N="1700" /> which will also be discussed by the Commission on Higher Education.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which is quite small in itself, opens up an enormous field of discussion on the highest possible level which we are saved from discussing this evening as these are matters which will come before the Commission on Higher Education.  I hope that the Commission will go into the matter thoroughly.  It is, perhaps, the most important question in this or any other country to-day.  That brings me back to the Bill.  We are all agreed that scholarships, however selected, should be numerous.  We are all agreed that they should not be too much limited either by means or residential tests.  We are all agreed that they should be adequate in amount.  These are three things upon which we are all agreed.  This Bill accepts these three principles.  For that reason I welcome it.  At the same time I want to make it clear that in my opinion, although it is a step in the right direction, it is a very small step, but the Minister deserves our congratulations.</P>

      <P>Is mór an ní an Bille seo agus na téarmaí atá ann a bheith ar fáil ar deireadh. Molaim an tAire gurb é a chúram an rud seo a chur le chéile agus an Bille a thabhairt os comhair an Tí.</P>
      <P>Tá i gcoitinne bunoideachas coiteann laistigh de chumas gach athar agus máthar in Éirinn.  Is oideachas thairis an bunoideachas atá i gceist sa Bhille seo.  Tá beagán eagla orm, ón méid cainte atá cloiste againn ó thriúr a raibh baint acu le hollúnacht ollscoile, gur ar oideachas ollscoile a dhíríodar a gcuid spéise agus a gcuid cainte ar fad ach tá grád eile oideachais atá díreach chomh maith leis agus é i bhfad níos riachtanaí don phobal i gcoitinne ná an t-oideachas ollscoile, dá fheabhas é.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá mé ag smaoineamh anois ar chlann daoine ar fud na tíre nach bhfuil ar a gcumas a gclann a chur go dtí an mheánscoil nó ina dhiaidh sin go dtí on ollscoil.  Is chun an bearna sin a líonadh atá an Bille seo againn.  Anois deirtear nach leor an Bille seo chun an bearna sin a líonadh go sásúil agus cothrom a thabhairt do <Col N="1701" /> gach éinne in Éirinn.  Is mó an rud cuid de rud.  Tá cuid fhónta sa Bhille seo.  Molaim an Bille dá chionn sin ach is eagal liom ón gcaint atá cloiste againn go dtí seo go bhfuil luí ar fad beagnach ar oideachas ollscoile.  Ach tá spéis an-mhór agamsa in oideachas an ghnáth-phobail, go bhfaighidís oideachas níos fearr, níos airde, ná bunoideachas, agus níl aon chéim chuige san ach meánoideachas.  Chun é sin a chur ar fáil níos coitianta, ba cheart níos mó spéise a chur i leathnú caíonna ar fud na tíre go bhfaigheadh i bhfad níos mó daoine buntáistí an mheánoideachais.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist nó dhó eile agam im aigne: an oideachas ollscoile amháin atá i gceist?  Tá nithe ann, coláistí ann agus oiriúnachas ann chun talmhaíochta, cun eolas a fháil ar úsáid a bhaint as an talamh in Éirinn agus slí bheatha a bhaint as ar bhealach níos tuisceanaí, níos fearr agus níos saibhre ná mar a dhéantar faoi láthair. Tá coláistí talmhaíochta ann agus an mbeidh baint ag na scoláireachtaí le daoine a chur go dtí coláistí den sórt sin?  Tá coláistí againn chun teagasc tís agus a leithéid sin a thabhairt.  An dtiocfaidh an saghas sin oideachais laistigh de théarmaí an Bhille?  Tá seirbhís mhór eile a mbíonn oiliúint trí nó ceithre bliana ann: banaltracht. Tá cóireanna ann chun daoine a oiliúint san ealaín san.  An mbeidh na scoláireachtaí le fáil chun buntáistí a fháil as na coláistí banaltrachta?</P>
    <P>Tá ceardoideachas i gcoitinne ar fud na tíre á leathnú.  Tá a lán daoine ag dul chuig na scoileanna sin agus is céim níos airde an ceardoideachas ná an bunoideachas.  An mbeidh baint ag na scoláireachtaí leo sin?  Tá na ceisteanna san im aigne agus b'áil liom go dtabharfadh na scoláireachtaí caoi do na daoine i gcoitinne buntáiste a bhaint as na coláistí ina múintear na ceirdeanna agus na healaíona atá luaite agam.</P>
    <P>Arís, adeirim, tá bunoideachas nó meánoideachas tábhachtach.  Do níos mó den phobal tá sé chomh tábhachtach díreach is atá oideachas ollscoile don bheagán a n-éiríonn leo dul ann, mar ní théann níos mó ná cúig nó ocht fén gcéad den phobal ar an ollscoil <Col N="1702" /> agus ba cheart go mbeadh meánoideachas le fáil ag 25 fén gcéad nó 40 fén gcéad den ghnáth-phobal chun daoine níos tuisceanaí, níos éifeachtaí, níos cumasaí a thabhairt dúinn, níos mó daoine agus muinín acu astu féin agus as a gcuid eolais i measc an ghnáth-phobail ná mar atá anois.  Dá mb'fhéidir meánoideachas a leathnú don ghnáth-phobal bheadh tairbhe mór sa treo sin.</P>
    <P>Tá, ar ndóigh, éileamh ag an phobal air.  Tá meánoideachas ag leathnú ar fud na tíre.  Tá sé le fáil ag scoláirí lae anois in áiteacha nach raibh sé le fáil iontu deich mbliain ó shin agus nach raibh cuimhne air fiche bliain ó shin.  Theastódh scoileanna dá leithéid sin ó dhaoine nach mbeadh an gustal acu féin agus a dteastódh uathu a gclann a oiliúint chomh maith le clann na gcomharsan a mbeadh gustal acu chun díol as.</P>
    <P>Bhí trácht againn ar ollscoil agus tábhacht thar barr na hollscoile, ach caithfimid a chinntiú inár n-aigne gur chun leas an phobail, leas na tíre, a rachaidh pé cabhair a thabharfaidh an pobal trí na chánacha don saghas sin oideachais.  Ba cheart dúinn scarúint leis an smaoineamh gur ar son an duine ataimíd.  Is ar mhaithe leis an bpobal ataimid, leis an tír, le heolas, le hoilteacht, le doimhne agus muinín an phobail, íseal nó uasal, bocht nó saibhir, astu féin chun gur féidir cumas carachtar daingean a fhás iontu.</P>
    <P>Ní maith liom tagairt a dhéanamh don ghearán a bhí ag mo chara, an Seanadóir laistiar díom, ach tá leigheas ag Coláiste na Tríonóide ar an rud atá ina chúis ghearáin acu.  Níl le déanamh acu ach dearmad a dhéanamh ar na cuspóirí lenar cuireadh an coláiste sin ar bun agus beidh an scéal leigheasta gan aon mhoill.</P>

      <P>A somewhat similar sum.  These are the only figures I can see but I should like to have them related to the number of scholarships which it is anticipated that sum of £300,000 will provide in four years' time.  How many scholarships for universities and for post-primary education will that sum of £300,000 represent in four years' time and how will that match up with the number of children leaving primary and secondary schools and technical schools and going to the university?  Unless we have some figures along those lines, it is quite impossible to make an assessment of what impact this Bill will have on the educational life of this country.  One thing is clear, that if the figures were impressive, we would have had them.  I do not say that it is any fault of the Minister, that he cannot bring in impressive figures.  Evidently, he has been limited in the amount of money his Department can make available.  It seems to me to be tinkering with education to patch on to a Scholarship Act of 1944 and an old University Act of 1908 a scheme designed to meet the needs of 1961 and the European Economic Community and all the rest for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This does not seem to indicate any concern on the part of the Government <Col N="1705" /> for the education of our youth. It is an extraordinary thing that we can provide £400,000, and presumably will provide more, for the running expenses of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  We can provide millions of pounds for aeroplanes and millions of pounds for turf development and millions of pounds for the Electricity Supply Board. These, we are told, are all capital projects, but the only capital which the poor child has is his brains and we are not going to provide anything for the vast majority of these children who have a form of capital which they cannot exploit.  The sum of £300,000 represents a few barley loaves and fishes amongst the great multitude of needy children.</P>
    <P>This Bill does nothing and will not have a significant impact on the number of children who will be able to get secondary, technical or university education.  When this scheme is in full operation, it will make a very small difference and we are given no figures to indicate what its effect will be.  A fundamental defect in the Bill is that when the Minister was about the business of giving State aid for scholarships, he did not start off with a completely new scheme.  It is no defence of the Bill to say that the old scheme has worked well because the hypothesis is incorrect.  The old scheme was a rickety scheme that worked badly, unjustly and ineffectively to help the poorer sections. However bad the machinery under the Local Authorities (Educational Scholarships) Acts of 1944 may be, there can be no question that the Minister and his Department bear full responsibility for the type of scheme evolved by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Apparently in this Bill it is not proposed to make any change in the machinery for devising schemes or ensuring any kind of uniformity.  Since 1944, the Minister for Education has had available to him, under the Local Authorities (Educational Scholarships) Act, all the machinery and power necessary to make any change he considered proper in the scholarship schemes submitted by local authorities. Under Section 2 of the Act, he can <Col N="1706" /> approve of a scheme, modify or alter any scheme submitted to him in such manner as he thinks proper, or approve of the scheme modified or amended, or refuse to approve of any scheme.  The Minister for Education, and previous Ministers for Education, have been shoving the blame over to local authorities when the ultimate and final responsibility for the form that scheme takes rests squarely upon the shoulders of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department will not be unaware of the representations which have been made by a large section of the community about the unsatisfactory way in which scholarship schemes have been devised and administered over the past ten or 15 years.  The Minister will be aware of the representations made to his Department by the Irish Conference of Professional and Services Associations who are the people representing the classes among the poorest in the community who have always been on the fringe and outside scholarship schemes devised by local authorities because of the means test and sometimes because of the residence qualification, which is being somewhat improved in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The means test as operated by some local authorities has had the effect&mdash;I know it was the case when I was going to school&mdash;that children whose parents might not have had more that £400 a year, although there might have been ten children in the family, could not get a scholarship.  On the other hand, the children of a publican with a £10 or £15 valuation, perhaps in receipt of £1,000, or £1,200 or maybe £1,300, could get scholarships.  That is what I regard as being grossly unfair.  When applying the means test, it should be modified in order to provide that not alone will the income of the parents be taken into account, but an allowance will be made for every child in the family of a father of a scholarship applicant, say, over the third child, on the same lines as allowed for income tax purposes.  Whether that has been changed since then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whether that has been changed since my time at school, I do not know, but it is certainly within the capacity of the Minister to make such a change under the powers given to him by the 1944 Act.  I do not intend to refer to the inadequacy of the scholarships.  It is perfectly clear from the sums provided that the Minister and some of the officials in his Department do not appear to appreciate the needs of people attending a university.  One would imagine that in the Department of Education, they ought to know something about the demands on students attending universities, but evidently some people have forgotten them or blinded themselves to them when it comes to approving of these schemes submitted by local authorities.</P>
      <P>A point has been raised by Senator Stanford in relation to the attitude of some local authorities towards the granting of scholarships to Trinity College.  Senator Stanford is right to raise that point, for this is a problem which ought to be faced up to.  Making Irish compulsory in the matriculation examination for entrance to Trinity College would not solve the problem, because there are still local authorities, perhaps relying on what they have always done, who would continue to do it and would not depart from precedent.  It seems to me that there ought to be some <i>via media</i> by which children whose Faith will permit them and whose ecclesiastical authorities will not prohibit them from attending Trinity College should, if they are able to win scholarships, be entitled to enter Trinity College.</P>

      <P>I agree that the problem in relation to Trinity College is a great deal easier of solution than appears at first sight, but it does seem to me that it ought to be clearly stated for the benefit of the children of parents who wish to have their children attend Trinity College that there is no prohibition of any kind on their doing so.  I count it a remarkable thing that in this day and generation Trinity College should labour under the grievance so eloquently and indeed passionately put by Senator Stanford this evening.  I hope that perhaps some discussion in public upon this matter will make it less thorny, and that the Trinity College authorities and those who want to send their children to Trinity College will in the very near future have no cause for complaint in relation to the scholarships offered by public authorities.</P>
      <P>Senator Carter interjected something about the socialisation of scholarships.  The plain fact is that we provide free primary education from State funds and are bound to do so under the Constitution, and the State is committed to endeavouring as far as possible to supplement and give reasonable aid to providing greater educational initiative, also under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>To supplement&mdash;that is far from socialisation.  Certainly this is a big step in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>If you talk about this being a big step, I can only say <Col N="1709" /> it is a coiscéim choiligh, if you call it a step at all, in the right direction. The plain fact is that the fears expressed by the Minister for Education in the Dáil that the public were not prepared or were rather reluctant, while wanting to improve educational facilities, to provide finances for them, are quite unfounded.  I have never yet heard any complaint that we were spending too much money on education or providing too many scholarships or other facilities for the education of our children in the primary, secondary, or technical spheres or even in regard to university education. On the contrary, we do appreciate the value of education, and while we may not be able by means of money to make this an island of saints, we can by this means make it an island of scholars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words particularly on that part of the Bill dealing with the provision of scholarships not to a university.  I wonder is it to be the policy of the Department to increase the number receiving secondary education by this method only.  It seems a rather slow and not very hopeful method of doing so. Latterly, there has been in local authorities a tremendous increase in the drive for education and educational facilities of every sort.  We have in County Cavan technical schools which ten years ago, or even less, were half empty and now are over-flowing, so that extra rooms have to be added here, there and everywhere.  The same demand is there for secondary education. These few extra scholarships this Bill will give to the poorer classes of boys and girls have to be divided up by the local authority.  We in my county would divide them up between boys and girls, and then we have to consider also the problem of one- or two-teacher schools and larger schools, because we have found that the one- or two-teacher schools cannot compete for scholarships with larger schools where they have more advantages and perhaps are better taught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have a division between no means test and a means test.  In that respect, I should like to assure Senator O'Quigley that his ideas on means <Col N="1710" /> tests when he was at school are out of date and that things have completely changed.  In most counties, everything is taken into account&mdash;the valuation of land, plus income, if there are both, in the case of parents.</P>
    <P>We divide these few scholarships amongst those different classes, and the number available to the boys and girls in a county seems to be pitifully small. It is sometimes very hard when one is striking the rate in a county to induce the county council to add a few pence more to the rates, but if a greater lead were given by the central authority and if it had been supplying four times what the local authority was asked to pay, such a lead would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>I would, perhaps, have given these scholarships not on the results of a purely scholarship examination.  The Minister should move towards having a general county examination for students in the primary schools and he should give the scholarships on the results of the examination.  I think you will have a more uniform result all over the country and that when the students arrive at the secondary schools they will be of the same standard.</P>
    <P>I find from masters of secondary schools that pupils arrive from different areas or different counties with quite different standards of education and that it takes them some considerable time to bring one pupil up or hold one pupil back until they get them evened up a bit.  Our aim in giving as much general education as we can should not be the complete equivalent of the much-discussed 11-plus examination that they have elsewhere. I feel we might have a general examination at the age of say 13&mdash;I think 13 is the age the secondary schools like to have these children coming to them&mdash;and give a great number of scholarships on the results of that.</P>
    <P>Another point is that possibly scholarships should be given to schools.  Take schools with the capacity or schools anxious to increase their capacity for students.  Possibly scholarships could be given to them to fill up their schools.  We could perhaps agree to keep the basis of the <Col N="1711" /> scholarship to the means test and to the actual subjects, if you like, the same as they are at present.  I feel it would be another way of inducing schools to keep their capacity and schools with small numbers in them would have room for pupils without any extra expense at all.  Some time or other the Minister might be able to give scholarships to schools to let them conduct the examination and bring the pupils into them.</P>
    <P>Have any of these county council schemes or local authority schemes ever envisaged that these students could take up scholarships at a technical school?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>We may have advanced technical schools in Dublin but we have not got them in the country. Would these primary school pupils be permitted, if they win a scholarship, to take it in Dublin?  Would they be allowed to come and stay in Dublin, maybe with friends, and go to the technical school in Dublin instead of going to a secondary school somewhere else in the country?  Schools approved under the parent Act include technical schools and agricultural colleges.  I hope these scholarships are tenable at these places.</P>
      <P>A matter that has come up in my county&mdash;it would need a slight amendment of the Universities Act&mdash;is that university scholarship winners should be allowed to go to other educational establishments for higher education.  In other words, if the winner of one of these scholarships wishes to obtain some technical training&mdash;for instance, a manufacturing process&mdash;inside or outside the country would he be allowed to take the scholarship there instead of at the university?  We had one instance of that.  The winner of a scholarship was anxious to enter a factory.  The factory were actually willing, I think in this case, to give some assistance towards his training but were not prepared to give it all.  I think he was not permitted by the Department to take up that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With more factories, and so on, becoming <Col N="1712" /> available in this country and providing opportunities for men who are highly skilled, perhaps we could allow scholarships to highly advanced technical schools in England or elsewhere which would have classes dealing solely with these subjects?  If we allow those who win scholarships to go there on the hope and the promise&mdash;it could not be anything more&mdash;that they would come back and take up a position in our factories, and bring back the skill and the higher education they would have gained there, it would be to the benefit of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might make two points for consideration by the Minister between now and the Committee Stage which I understand the Minister is anxious to have tomorrow. I shall carry on tomorrow with the usual Second Reading speech. I want to mention the subdivision of the money, Section 3 (b), one-third. The Bill says it shall not exceed this amount.  In other words, the Minister is putting an upper ceiling on the amount of money the county councils may give for university scholarships. There is no lower ceiling.  Some county councils may quite justifiably decide that there is need to give more than indicated by the Minister to post-primary education.  That is allowed.  I would ask the Minister to liberalise this fraction up to one-half and to leave more discretion to the county council. Make it £ for £&mdash;that they could go up to a maximum of £ for £ to the university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a big difference between the cost involved in attending the university in a university city and coming from a county like Tipperary or Limerick.  On the other hand, practically all centres are within reach of post-primary education.  In other words it is comparable to the university city. A ratio that would be suitable for a university city like Cork, where it would be quite reasonable that two-thirds should go to post-primary education and one-third to university education, would not be suitable to county Tipperary, for instance, where post-primary education is on the doorstep and university education has to be taken away from home.  I intend to <Col N="1713" /> move an amendment on this tomorrow. I would ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of the means test.  Might I ask if the Minister could incorporate some relief in respect of the number of children in the family similar to what is incorporated in both the income tax code and latterly in the surtax code?  That was a departure from practice when it was introduced into the surtax code two years ago.  I would suggest to the Minister that there is a big difference between a man earning £1,000 a year with one child and a man with the same salary having seven, eight or ten <Col N="1714" /> children.  The man with one child could afford to send that child to the university and he certainly should be able to put him through post-primary education, but the other man is in a very different position.  It should not be beyond our ability to devise an amendment to deal with that matter.</P>
