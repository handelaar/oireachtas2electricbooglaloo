    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1961    (Certified Money Bill) &mdash;  Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is designed to raise the statutory limit for issues from the Local Loans Fund and to simplify the procedure for making issues.  Issues from the Fund from the 1st May, 1935, when it was established, up to the 31st March, 1961, amounted to close on £120 million.  The great bulk of the issues related to housing.  Slum clearance and other rehousing schemes of urban local authorities under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts accounted for £33 million, while the corresponding schemes of rural local authorities under the Labourers Acts accounted for £30½ million.  This gives a total of £63½ million for the provision of houses by urban and rural <Col N="9" /> authorities.  These authorities have provided some 60,000 dwellings for tenant occupation since 1947.</P>
      <P>In the private housing sector, issues totalled £31¾ million.  Most of these issues&mdash;£27 million in all&mdash;related to loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts, the moneys being issued to local authorities for relending to persons purchasing their houses.  Of the balance, £4½ million represented loans to local authorities to enable them to make supplementary grants to persons in the lower income groups acquiring new houses or improving existing houses.</P>
      <P>Issues for the various housing services aggregated over £95 million.  This represents a very substantial contribution of loan capital from public funds towards the cost of providing better housing for our people.  Exchequer grants for new houses and for the improvement of existing houses are additional to the loan issues.  The grants amounted to some £35 million in the period from 1935 to the 31st March last.  They are estimated to cost £2½ million this year, which gives a cumulative total of £37½ million up to the 31st March, 1962.</P>
      <P>Of the remaining issues from the Fund, totalling about £24 million, county homes, hospitals and dispensaries took almost £5½ million.  Sanitary and other health services absorbed £14½ million, a large part of which went to meet expenditure on water supply and sewerage schemes.  The balance of £4 million or so was spent on vocational schools and miscellaneous services, vocational schools taking over £2 million.</P>
      <P>In addition to the issues actually made, the Fund also has substantial outstanding commitments in respect of loans sanctioned for projects in progress or to be started.  Additional commitments of this kind brought the total liabilities of the Fund as at the 30th September last to £133 million, that is only £2 million less than the present statutory limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total demand for loans is currently running at an annual rate of around £8 million and there are indications that it may increase.  As was <Col N="10" /> expected, requirements for local authority building have declined from the very high level of some years ago following the completion or near completion of the main re-housing programmes in many areas.  Nevertheless, housing still accounts for by far the greater part of current issues.  Rising costs have added to requirements and the revival which has taken place in private building has created a continuing demand for loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts. Total requirements for housing are now at an annual level of some £6 million, while requirements for water supply and sewerage schemes are running at about £1½ million.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, to raise the statutory limit for issues from the Local Loans Fund from £135 million, as fixed by the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1957, to £170 million.  The Bill provides accordingly. This should suffice to cover commitments for a period of about four years.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions aimed at simplifying the procedure for making loans from the Fund.  Under the existing arrangements it is necessary to execute a separate mortgage deed for each loan to a local authority to secure the repayment of the loan and payment of the interest.  The procedure is rather slow and unwieldy, and I feel that it could be shortened and simplified by statutory provisions as included in Section 3 of the Bill. These provisions envisage what will, in effect, be a statutory mortgage securing the loans on the rates or other appropriate revenues or funds of the local authorities and binding the authorities to repay the principal and to pay the interest in accordance with conditions which they have accepted beforehand.  It will be possible to dispense with separate mortgage deeds in most cases, thereby saving time and expense for the local authorities and for the Commissioners of Public Works by whom the loans are issued on behalf of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the new system should apply to loans to town commissioners, health authorities and vocational education committees as well as to county councils, county <Col N="11" /> borough councils, borough councils and urban district councils.  No change of principle is involved as regards the charging or repayment of loans.  Both borrower and lender will continue to have the same rights and obligations as at present, and borrowing powers reserved to the councils or committees of local bodies will continue to be reserved. I commend the provisions of this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been following the Minister's speech from the Dáil Reports for the 29th of November, 1961, and the content of both speeches is substantially the same.  As the matter was comprehensively and adequately dealt with in Dáil Éireann in the first place, and in the second place, as we are approaching the season of goodwill, I do not propose to go into the merits or demerits of the proposal before the House.  I might add that I am literally overawed by the gentlemanly atmosphere of this Chamber and I hope by time and usage I shall develop along the same lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a permissive piece of legislation to provide money and it does not say where the money is to come from, at what rate it is to be borrowed, or at what rate it is to be lent.  The question of how the money is to be used was fairly well debated in the Dáil and I do not want to go over the same ground again.  There are, however, just two matters upon which I should like to touch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first instance, I should like to express a rather personal opinion that, in housing undertaken by local authorities, we have tended to set too low a standard.  I grant that the Minister is not responsible for this but appreciate that the Minister for Finance can influence many things and certainly he can influence how the money is being spent.  For example, we have the situation throughout the country in which you find villages which obviously, with an increase in population, could do with new houses.  You see children playing about the place but you do not see many such new houses. Maybe a mile or three quarters of a <Col N="12" /> mile away, you find labourers' cottages built by the local authority.  It may be convenient that the occupants of those cottages should be near their employer's farm, but I think we forget about the inconvenience to the wife and to the children in being a distance from the shopping centre, the schools and the church.</P>
    <P>For the life of me, I could never understand this policy of building labourers' cottages throughout the country, instead of trying to build up the local communities where there is already a centre with shopping facilities, church and schools.  I could never understand why the building could not be done there instead of a mile or a mile and a half away.  That policy could well be changed to the benefit of the rural community, the occupants of such houses and indeed for the general betterment.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is in regard to the supplementary grant.  Here I will shift to the cities and express my concern at the limitations which are put upon supplementary grants by some local authorities. They impose a residence qualification.  This is unfair to certain people who, because of their occupation, are transferred around the country.  For example, people who are transferred to Dublin in the course of their employment find they cannot get the supplementary grant the same as people who have the residence qualification.  Of course, they come to pay for those grants by way of taxes and rates the same as any other occupants going into a neighbouring house.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is a good policy. It seems to discriminate against a class of people who, because of the nature of their employment, are liable to be transferred around the country.  I would ask the Minister if he would use his influence to stop that, because it is something which I regard as an objectionable practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one question in connection with this Bill.  If the answer is in the negative, I shall have nothing more to say; if it is in the affirmative, I shall have something more to say. <Col N="13" /> Will any of the money which is being granted under this Bill be available for university scholarships?  The Minister has told us that some of it will be for vocational schools, but will any of it be available for university scholarships granted by the county councils?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I confine myself to welcoming the Bill and I hope the money will be well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the observations made by Senator Lindsay make me dread the day I should have to seek admission to this House, but I hope that with a little experience Senator Lindsay will not feel too tongue-tied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy thinks it is a mistake that local authorities should build cottages with an eye to the people being near their employers rather than near churches, schools, and shops.  I am afraid I have no influence in that matter, nor have I many views on it, either.  Being reared in the country, I found that people like living away from the village rather than near it, and perhaps they will continue to have that view.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford asked me about scholarships.  I do not think any of this money could be used for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know could an organisation such as the Cork Savings Bank, which has considerable assets, lend money to the local authorities at a cheaper rate of interest than the commercial banks, if they are willing to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As matters stand, a savings bank is not permitted to use money for such a purpose, but we have been making slight changes in that respect and that may develop.  In the case of the last loan, we did issue £2,000,000 for ways and means advances under that head.  The intention was to issue some of that money to savings banks so that, if we pursued that policy, they could have funds for <Col N="14" /> any purpose they might think well of. However, there is only an indication of that policy at the moment.  There is no provision under which they could lend money to the local authority at the moment.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill, 1961: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, 1933, as amended and extended by subsequent Acts, were intended to ensure as far as possible that flour consumed in this country should be milled at Irish mills from wheat grown by Irish farmers.  Provision was, therefore, made in these Acts to prohibit the importation of flour from abroad except under authority of a licence granted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  As our flour millers are obliged under the Cereals Acts to use a high proportion of high priced home-grown wheat in their grists it would be obviously unfair that they should be required to compete with imports of flour manufactured outside the State.  Such imported flour is milled from foreign wheat which is available <Col N="15" /> abroad at a much cheaper price and greater variety than our home-grown wheat.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to repeal Section 8 of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act of 1956, so as to abolish a statutory concession which has been much abused in recent years, under which quantities of flour or wheatenmeal up to 300 lbs.  in weight could, in certain circumstances, be imported without a licence.</P>
      <P>In 1947, when flour was scarce, it became a common practice for people in the United States of America to send or bring gifts of flour to their friends in this country.  To facilitate the entry of such gifts, an Emergency Powers Order was made permitting the importation of flour in quantities of up to 300 lbs. provided it was (a) carried as private effects in passengers' baggage or (b) shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been sent by a person who was not a trader dealing in flour or wheatenmeal as a gift to a person in the State.  This import concession was continued in permanent legislation in Section 8 of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act, 1956.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to the effect that the concession has been abused and should be withdrawn, as it is causing serious loss of trade to flour millers and retailers in this country, particularly in the County Donegal area.</P>
      <P>To determine the justification for these complaints special surveys were carried out by the Revenue Commissioners. These indicate that unlicensed imports of flour from the Six County area increased from 1¾ tons per month in September, 1958 to 6 tons per month in March, 1959; 17 tons per month in March, 1960 and 27 tons per month in March, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the increasing extent to which this concession is being used for importation of cheap flour from the Six Counties and the adverse effects which such imports will have on the flour milling industry in the State and especially in County Donegal, the Government consider that this concession <Col N="16" /> should be withdrawn, by the repeal of Section 8 of the Act of 1956.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, add that the differentiation in price between a sack of flour of 280 lbs. in the Six Counties and in this country is about 25/-</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, and what the Minister has said in relation to it, are an example of how deceptive a title can be.  The Bill is a Department of Industry and Commerce Bill, not concerned with the Department of Agriculture.  It is in respect of revenue rather than any other part of the Government services.  It withdraws a concession which, I think, the Minister's figures clearly prove has been abused.  If imports have increased from 1¾ tons a month in 1958 to 27 tons a month in 1961, plainly, given all the circumstances, the concession ought to be withdrawn.  We are therefore in agreement with the Bill, which is a very simple measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the trade unions are concerned with the effect on employment of some of their members in Donegal because of this concession. They have been pressing for some time for Ministerial action in the matter and for that reason I welcome the measure.  I am glad to see that the Minister has taken action to see that a practice which was threatening employment is discontinued.  I only regret that in passing this legislation we are not protecting a nationally-owned flour milling industry instead of a milling industry which is run by a foreign dominated combine.</P>

      <P>I do not think any comments are called for from me.  The only thing I can say in respect to Senator Murphy's remarks&mdash;not the last point he made but that in reference to the trade unions&mdash;is that I was hoping some other measure would come along before this in which a section could have been incorporated. Unfortunately, or fortunately, such a measure was not available and therefore this Bill had to be introduced specially.</P>

      <P>Under the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 (Continuance) Act, 1958, the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, which was due to expire on 9th February, 1959 was continued in force until 31st March, 1962.  The purpose of this Bill is to continue the 1956 Act in force until 31st March, 1965.</P>
      <P>The Act empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prohibit by Order the exportation of industrial goods save under a licence issued by him.  At present a number of goods are subject to export control under the Control of Exports Order, 1961, the Control of Exports (No.  2) Order, 1961, and the Control of Exports (No. 3) Order, 1961, which were made under the powers conferred by the Act.  Orders made under the Act have a life of twelve months, and are required to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made, and if a resolution annulling any Order is passed by either House at any time during the currency of the Order, the Order is annulled accordingly.</P>
      <P>I consider that the time has not yet come when the export controls may be dispensed with.  Accordingly it will be necessary to continue these powers for some further time, and to enact legislation to that end.  The need is threefold;</P>
      <P>(a)  to conserve, for the benefit of home industry, raw materials continuing or likely to continue in short supply; examples of such commodities which are the subject of current orders are iron and steel scrap and aluminium, lead and zinc scrap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  to ensure that strategic materials <Col N="18" /> are not exported from this country to Iron Curtain Countries or that this country is not used as a base through which such materials may be sent to the Iron Curtain Countries from other countries, and,</P>
    <P>(c)  to have immediately available a means of dealing with the situation in the event of an international emergency developing in which the country could be drained of essential materials before corrective legislation could be enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>For the reasons mentioned, I commend this Bill to the favourable consideration of the Seanad.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power has asked me to take the Second Stage of this Bill on his behalf.  The main object of the Bill is to provide an extra £5,000,000 capital for Bord na Móna.  Under the Turf Development Acts, 1946 to 1959, Bord na Móna may borrow up to £19,000,000 for the performance of their functions, exclusive of the housing of their servants.  The Board may obtain capital up to this amount by way of advances from the Minister for Finance or by the creation of stock or other forms of security.  In the exercise of these powers the Board have to-date borrowed a total of £18,991,472 of which £750,000 was obtained from Messrs.  Arthur Guinness and £52,000 from the Board's own Superannuation Funds, the balance being provided by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna have already repaid to the Central Fund a sum of £554,000 in respect of assets taken over from the Turf Development Board Ltd. Repayment with interest of advances, <Col N="19" /> amounting to £9,637,557 will be completed on 1st April, 1985 and repayment of the remaining advances will commence when the bogs on which the capital is being invested, come into production.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Government that all bogs which are economically usable for electricity generation shall be developed and the main output of Bord na Móna is determined by the requirements of peat for this purpose. Development of a bog to the production stage requires a period of five years, more or less.  Already five peat-fired electricity stations with an aggregate capacity of 185 megawatts have been commissioned.  There are also four 5 megawatt stations using hand-won turf.  The future programme of the Electricity Supply Board provides for the commissioning of additional peat-fired plant to a total capacity of 242.5 megawatts by 1968/69. On the completion of this programme a total of 447.5 megawatts of generating plant will be peat-fired.</P>
    <P>At the 31st March, 1961, peat-fired stations represented 205 megawatts of the total generating capacity of 723.5 megawatts, that is to say about 28%. In the year ended 31st March, 1961, 80% of electricity generated came from native resources and just over 40% of this native production came from peat-fired stations.</P>
    <P>The programme of peat-fired generating plant which I have outlined extends to 1968/69 and represents the maximum foreseeable bog development for electricity generation.  Thereafter peat-fired generation capacity will represent a gradually diminishing proportion of total capacity.</P>
    <P>To meet the requirements of the electricity generating plant construction programme up to 1968/69, Bord na Móna are developing or will develop additional areas of bog in the Boora, Derrygreenagh, Bangor-Erris, Garryduff and Longford groups.  The Blackwater bog, which has been reserved for the nitrogenous fertiliser project, is now available to provide the milled peat for a 40 megawatt station planned for Shannonbridge in 1964/65. <Col N="20" /> The bog development programme provides, ultimately, for an annual production for electricity generation of 580,000 tons of sod peat and 2,500,000 tons of milled peat.  In addition to their output for electricity generation Bord na Móna also produced some 320,000 tons of sod peat for general consumption.  Other aspects of their activities are the production of peat briquettes for domestic and industrial consumption and peat moss.  Capacity for briquettes is 250,000 tons per annum requiring 750,000 tons of milled peat.  The annual production of peat moss is at present about 250,000 bales, mostly for export.  The number of persons employed by the Board, in all grades, amounts to about 7,000 at peak.</P>
    <P>The present statutory limit of £19,000,000 on the total amount which the Board may borrow for the performance of their functions (exclusive of the housing of their workers) was intended to cover the requirements of the Board up to 1960/61 and the need for further provision in 1961/62 was foreseen when the limit of £19,000,000 was fixed by the Turf Development Act, 1959.  It is estimated that the completion of the development programme will necessitate additional expenditure amounting to about £8,000,000 bringing the total up to about £27,000,000. The present Bill proposes an increase in the statutory limit of £5,000,000 bringing it up to £24,000,000.  This increase should enable the Board to meet their requirements until about 1964/65 and at that time the House will have a further opportunity to consider the position.</P>
    <P>The opportunity of this Bill is being taken to effect the amendment in the law relating to the tenancy of the houses built by Bord na Móna under the power conferred on them by Section 5 of the Turf Development Act, 1950.  That Section permits the Board to let these houses only to their servants. Houses become temporarily vacant when a tenant leaves the employment of the Board.  Suitable tenants from among the Board's workers may not immediately apply for the tenancies and houses may therefore be vacant for long periods.  This is clearly undesirable <Col N="21" /> and accordingly it is proposed by Section 3 (2) of this Bill to give the Board power to let vacant houses to persons who would not ordinarily qualify for tenancies.  To give the Board a wider field from which to obtain suitable occupiers it is proposed to relax the restrictions confining tenancies to servants of the Board.  The Board of course will only make such lettings in cases where they are satisfied that the houses would otherwise remain vacant for extended periods. The Bill also provides that the Board may sell houses which may eventually be found to be permanently surplus to their requirements.  Any such houses would be sold by public tender.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.  Bord na Móna, management and workers, are to be congratulated on their successful progress in carrying out the novel task assigned to them by the Oireachtas and the Bill will facilitate further development on approved lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fair measure of agreement with regard to the desirability of developing our peat resources and even about the methods adopted to develop them.  This Bill, naturally, would not be opposed in the ordinary way but at a different season of the year, it could give rise to a discussion on the operations of Bord na Móna generally.  I hasten to assure the House and the Minister that I have no intention of initiating any such discussion.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave a number of figures.  I am not very good about them.  I have been so interested for some time past in the quota of panels for the Seanad that I am afraid I am not yet, in this particular year, able to discuss any other kind of figure. Therefore, the Minister, having been astonished at the progress made so far, may meet with still further astonishment in the progress of this Bill as far as I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The season of the year, and the fact that Senators are recovering from the campaign, and so on, makes everybody so nice to everybody else and <Col N="22" /> enables Bills to pass with rapidity. The Minister knows that on occasions the Seanad itself can be most contraptious and rather delaying.  However, for the moment, I think this Bill is one to which nobody could take exception, either in regard to the increase in capital for Bord na Móna or to the provision that in particular circumstances they should be able to let the houses in the way which it seems fit to them to do so.  I am, therefore, in complete agreement with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Senator Hayes had much worry about decimals when it came to the count in the Seanad election.  People like us had more trouble about decimals.</P>
      <P>One very welcome aspect of this Bill is the right given to the Board to sell or let under Section 3 (1) (2). That was long overdue.  We had and still have cases in our part of the country of fifty houses vacant and no workers to go into them.  It is well that the Minister has incorporated that section in the Bill.  In future, he should not allow large groups of houses to be built in rural areas.  One hundred houses in one place such as Rochfort Bridge was altogether too much.  They should have been scattered into surrounding villages, some in Rhode, some in Miltownpass and some in Rochfort Bridge.  There is the difficulty of sites, and so on, but if that had been done, the houses would have been occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ordinary rural worker does not like to go where there are large groups of houses.  That is why so many of the houses are unoccupied.  This move to allow the Board to let these houses is good.  It could solve a problem for the local authority, too, and save quite an amount of money by allowing people in need of houses to take these houses, if they are not required by the Board. I welcome that section of the Bill.  It is also to be welcomed from the point of view that if a worker does not want to work with the Board any longer, or if he is dismissed for one reason or another, he can remain in his house and get alternative employment.  That was not the case up to now.  Despite <Col N="23" /> the fact that fifty houses were idle, there were people who had to leave their houses because they were not in the employment of the Board.  I welcome the Bill if only from that point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all join in welcoming this Bill, expanding, as it does, the capital available to Bord na Móna.  It is a pity we are not availing of this opportunity to have a full-scale debate on the various aspects of Bord na Móna activities.  However, I shall not precipitate that now.  In any case, we get a great deal of very useful information on the activities of Bord na Móna in their excellent report, the last one of which was issued two or three months ago.</P>
      <P>What is really striking about the activities of Bord na Móna is the great success we can claim to have made of this unique form of energy development. In the development of turf, we hold a very high place in the world. We have developed techniques, and so on, that have been copied in other countries.  A great deal of the credit for that must go to the Irish engineering staff who pioneered this work under very difficult field circumstances.  We can take courage from their success and look with confidence to tackling many even bigger projects in what we hope will be the context of the Common Market in the coming years.</P>
      <P>As the Minister indicated in the figures he gave, we are rapidly running out of native sources of energy.  We are still in the fortunate position that 80 per cent. of our energy requirements are met from native sources and, of these, turf provides almost 40 per cent. That percentage will hold probably to the end of this decade.  The proposals before us call for little more than doubling the present output from turf, an increase from 200 megawatts to 447 megawatts.  After that, we shall have reached the stage when we must look much further afield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless we are exceptionally successful in striking oil in our explorations, we shall be forced very rapidly into the nuclear energy field.  We should <Col N="24" /> devote great study to that matter in the coming few years so as to get into it as early as possible and, above all, to explore the possibilities of linking up with the Continent of Europe in the production of electricity from nuclear sources.  It is quite feasible now to transmit electricity over the intervening gaps and to connect fully with the European network.  I know from very prominent engineers in England and on the Continent that this country is considered an ideal site for some of the huge nuclear power stations that will be necessary in the future, stations on such a vast scale that we could not possibly contemplate using all the energy they would produce. Neither could we face the enormous capital cost required to set up such stations.  However, in union with other countries, especially in the Common Market development, we should be able to utilise this, another of our untapped national resources, namely, space and suitable circumstances for siting nuclear power stations in some of our less populated areas.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Bord na Móna and their engineers and administrators in general on their great success and on the headline they have set for developing to the full a native resource.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielJMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moloney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with Senators who have welcomed this measure and, as one with some personal experience of the administration of Bord na Móna, I should like to avail of this opportunity also to convey to the Board through the Minister my appreciation of the courtesy and understanding extended to me at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an easy task for any Minister to introduce a Bill of this kind to increase the financial accommodation for a Government organisation when the record of that organisation is that it has always repaid fully any advances made to it.  What is not generally realised in this country is that Bord na Móna is the one organisation&mdash; perhaps, one of the few, if not the only one&mdash;that has repaid every penny of the advances made to it for development purposes ever since turf development was sponsored by the Government some 25 years ago.  The <Col N="25" /> organisation is one of the most solvent in the State and appears to be able to make any scheme entirely successful.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister is present, there is one observation I should like to make in connection with the manufacture of briquettes for which there is a growing demand.  Up to this, Bord na Móna seems to have confined its briquette manufacturing activities to the midlands.  That means that consumers, in southern counties particularly, because of the distances involved, have to pay a price for those briquettes which is considered a bit high.  With such an improving demand for this type of fuel and with the possibility that this demand will continue to increase, I feel the Board might reasonably site some of the future briquette manufacturing development in the southern area.  I appeal to the Minister to convey my views in this connection to the Board in the hope that they will give this aspect of the matter very early consideration.</P>
    <P>Not only would such a move save transport costs, but I think the necessity for the Board to decentralise its activities in all fields is apparent.  They have done so in the case of milled peat, and more particularly in the case of sod peat and it is desirable, in view of the success of the new type of fuel, that it should be done in regard to briquettes also.  I understand from people competent to give an opinion that there are suitable bogs in Munster particularly, and in the western area also.  Those bogs should be developed and there should be at least one manufacturing unit for briquettes in every province.  I should like the Minister to convey those views to the Board, now that he is giving the Board increased accommodation to enable them to proceed with their development plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise one small difficulty on this Bill.  The difficulty is this, and I think it counts: in smallish suburban houses, or houses with narrow chimney flues, the deposit from turf is such as to cause very dangerous chimney fires. As the Minister well knows&mdash;and I imagine most of us know&mdash;a kind of tarry deposit coats the chimney and <Col N="26" /> gradually becomes thicker.  Ordinary sweeping will not remove it.  I have personally suffered from three rather serious chimney fires on that account. I am rather afraid that my insurance company will take action if I have another and so I have been compelled, very much against my will, to burn coal at the present time.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister has research been done on this, I think, very considerable problem and, if research has not been done, would he instigate research along these lines? To my mind, our native turf is the pleasantest and most economic fuel one could buy in this country for most of the winter.  In the colder days I think many of us need coal, wood or something of that kind.  Personally I regret that I cannot&mdash;dare not&mdash;use turf in my fire for fear of another conflagration of that kind.  I urge the Minister to look into this matter.</P>
      <P>I am quite certain that thousands more tons of turf would be sold in the cities if we could be sure of some way of getting rid of this very dangerous tarry deposit which causes these frightfully dangerous fires.  They are not like ordinary soot fires; I have had the whole chimney wall opening up as a result of the tremendous heat engendered.  I hope the Minister will either suggest something here or see that someone else suggests means of dealing with this handicap to our native fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to Section 3 of the Bill which gives the Board power to sell or let houses.  The necessity for this section seems to suggest to me that too many houses have been built.  That may be inevitable&mdash;I do not know.  There may be a surplus of houses due to the fact that workers have moved or have been transferred from one bog to another.  But it is about the future that I am concerned now.  If it is inevitable that houses become vacant in certain areas from time to time and those houses will have to be let or sold, I think more consideration should be given to the siting of these houses when they are being built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, as the previous speaker said, <Col N="27" /> they are built in groups of 100 or more houses together I fear that when these houses are put up for sale it will be extremely hard to find purchasers for them at anything like a price which bears a proper relation to the cost of building the houses or to find tenants for them at economic rents.  There is a lot to be said against building these houses in groups of 100 or more if that is being done&mdash;I do not know; I do not come from a Bord na Móna area. I would strongly favour or suggest to the Board that they should consider building houses in small groups in adjoining villages as has been previously suggested.  Then, if it is necessary to sell them it will be much easier to find a purchaser at a reasonable price or a tenant at a reasonable rent.</P>
    <P>An alternative&mdash;I do not know whether it is feasible; some of the architects, engineers or people in the building trade would be in a better position to say&mdash;is for the Board to consider building temporary houses, houses that could be dismantled and moved about.  That may not be possible but I suggest it is worth considering.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>One small point occurs to me in connection with the letting of houses.  I take it that Bord na Móna would take adequate precautions to ensure that a temporary tenant would not impede in any way the incoming of a genuine Bord na Móna employee at a later date.  With regard to the point made by Senator McAuliffe, if a person occupied one of these houses at an advantageous rent as an employee of Bord na Móna and left that employment for a more highly paid job somewhere adjacent, would it then be possible for him to stay on in the Bord na Móna house, enjoying a higher income from some other employment together with this advantageous rent fixed when he went into the house as an employee of Bord na Móna?  These are matters to which attention should be paid.  They arise really on the administrative side of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the <Col N="28" /> section on housing first.  As I understand, it is not the intention of Bord na Móna to build any new houses at the moment.  With regard to the point raised by Senator Lindsay, the Senator will know that one of the few ways in which a landlord can procure possession of his house is where a landlord requires the house from a tenant who is not in his employment for a tenant who is in his employment.  I do not know whether that would apply in the case cited by the Senator.  I think it probably would.  In any event, the Senator's point will be brought to the attention of Bord na Móna.  I understand that houses will not be let to non-employees unless Bord na Móna are satisfied that the houses will not be required for the use of its employees.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Moloney's suggestion that the next briquette station, if and when established, should be located somewhere in the south, first of all the establishment of any new factory will depend on the present sales promotion operation of the Board essential to establish whether or not a new briquette factory would be justified.  The location of the factory must depend on the suitability of the bog.  Generally speaking it has been found that bogs of the type suitable for economic briquette production are not easily available in the south.  The big bogs in the midlands are the most suitable for turf production for briquette manufacture.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Senator Stanford, I think his chimney fire must have occurred several years ago.  The complaint to which he refers was probably a feature of the burning of turf during the emergency years when some of the turf&mdash;too much of the turf&mdash;was wet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe what the Senator complains about was a feature of that period but, since the briquette stations were set up, it has been found that sooting inside chimneys has not been a feature of turf burning.  I understand Bord na Móna have not received any <Col N="29" /> complaints.  I have used turf briquettes and I have no complaints from the person I employ to sweep my chimneys.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Senator Quinlan's point as to the possibility of our having to find another form of energy for power purposes in the future, the Department has carried out a study and it might be of interest to the House if I give the results of that study briefly to the House.</P>
      <P>In a nuclear power station, the capital costs are very high and for economic production of electricity, and other technical reasons, they must operate on base load.  This means that once a nuclear station is commissioned, it must be possible to keep it on high load continuously day and night.  In this country hydro power, when adequate water is available, must get first priority on night running; second priority must be given to peat fired stations, if this is necessary to use the full quantity of peat produced.  On this basis, a nuclear power station would, therefore, not be commissioned in this country until the load grows to a point where a nuclear station of the minimum economic size could be given continuous night running of reasonable magnitude together with full load day operation.  Even when that stage is reached, the choice of a nuclear station as against a conventional thermal station would still depend on the relative economics of the two types of station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, conventional thermal stations can produce electricity at a lower cost than nuclear stations.  The economics of electricity generating stations improve as the size of the generating units increases.  Nuclear stations with a capacity of 500 megawatts and over are now being planned and present forecasts are that with continuous operation of these larger units the costs of production would come level with existing costs for conventional thermal stations.  Corresponding increases in the size of generating units of conventional thermal stations <Col N="30" /> may, however, alter this forecast in favour of these stations.  In the absence, however, of very marked improvement in design, and with lower capital and operating costs of smaller nuclear stations of, say, the order of 100 megawatts, it is not at present foreseen that these stations can come lower than conventional thermal stations of the same size in the cost per unit produced.</P>
    <P>It can be expected that it will be well on in the 1970s before the load in this country will have increased to a point where an additional 100 megawatts of 24-hour base load could be accommodated within the framework of the present policy in relation to hydro and peat production.</P>
    <P>I must confess the full implications of that study are not obvious to me, but they may be to Senator Quinlan.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I clarify the point I made?  There is a fairly widespread belief that if one burns turf in a firegrate which has a narrow chimney flue, the flue gradually becomes clogged with a tarry deposit which eventually catches fire.  That fire burns at a very high heat.  I know from personal experience that the heat generated is capable of splitting the wall on both the ground floor and the floor above.  I want to help Bord na Móna to sell turf but I know that there is this widespread belief that there is a danger of one's chimney catching fire.  I suggest to the Minister that it might be worth Bord na Móna while to consider this complaint, conduct experiments, and give us a scientific statement on the results. The Minister for Industry and Commerce suggested this complaint was not well founded and that it was true only of the emergency period when turf was damp and not so well harvested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> I can only repeat that there are still a good many people who are very eager to burn turf in their fires but who are afraid to do so on this account.  I can assure the Minister that it is quite an alarming thing when one's chimney goes on fire.  The roar is frightening.  I have stood out on the road wringing my hands waiting for the fire brigade to come and it is not a pleasant experience.  I do not want a repetition of it; I am not prepared to take the risk of a repetition of it.  I would ask the Minister to request the Board to look into the matter and give us an answer.  If the answer is favourable, I guarantee to burn turf for most of the winter during the rest of my life.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator Stanford in this.  At the moment I am waiting to have my chimney rebuilt.  I burn briquettes all the year round.  As Senator Stanford said, the chimney goes up in flames most unexpectedly.  It really is a shocking experience to listen to the roar of the fire.  The heat is terrific and one has to take down the pictures and mirrors; otherwise they would be absolutely destroyed.  This is my second experience of turf having caused the chimney to go on fire.</P>
      <P>There is a real danger for people who might have an ever-burning grate. They might be out when the chimney went on fire.  Anything can happen to the rest of the house and there is always the danger that the insurance company may not be so pleasant about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Board should be asked to get their scientific people to look into the matter and see if there is anything that can be put into the briquettes or which can be used with the turf to reduce the ferocity of the fire that occurs.  The previous speaker said his chimney went on fire.  He did not have any complaint from his chimney cleaner, but I did.  I should like to support Senator Stanford in this.  There is a great danger to the rest of the premises when the chimney goes on fire.  At the moment you could put your finger into the crack which occurred in my own <Col N="32" /> home.  It is the second occasion on which this has happened.</P>

      <P>First of all, I owe an apology to you, Sir, and to the House. I should explain that I was given the usual Ministerial forecasts in regard to the rate at which business progresses. I was told that there would be preliminary proceedings and bearing in mind the discussion that took place on one of the Bills which came before my Bill in the Dáil, I was assured that I would be absolutely safe in not coming to this House before a quarter to five.  I offer the House my most humble apologies.  It is the first time in the history of the Oireachtas this has happened to me.  I am very sorry, particularly in connection with this Bill which is so important to the nation.  I am very glad that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was well aware of turf development and able to take my place.</P>
      <P>In regard to the chimney trouble, I can say, first of all, that the sales of briquettes are mounting and mounting every year.  Last year, they were utterly unable to supply the demand.  This year they are going to produce 250,000 tons.  A lively demand is there.  In the eastern counties of Ireland, they found that 41 per cent.  of all the households were using turf briquettes in one form or another sometime or other in the year for wholly turf-fired purposes.</P>
      <P>They also found in the course of their inquiries that it was the woman of the house who largely chose the domestic fuel.  It is true that there is still some trouble with turf fires but all the information I have had over the past two years goes to show that the complaints are diminishing.  The quality of the briquettes in particular has improved.  The various types of stove which have been specially manufactured to use briquettes and turf or which can be adapted for the better usage of turf and briquettes, have apparently in their effects caused a form of ignition resulting in the burning of turf in a satisfactory way so that the number of fires have markedly diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="33" /> Research on that matter is continuing. It is part of the work of the Bord na Móna research board.  There again I must say that the complaints have very greatly diminished.  The sales of briquettes multiply each year. When the question of hand-won turf and fires caused by the burning of hand-won turf arises, that does not come under this Bill.  I have no knowledge of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to urge the Minister to suggest to the Board that they bring out a leaflet on this.  I am very grateful that the sales of briquettes are growing rapidly.  I should like to be certain that I could buy them myself under the new conditions. It is a little striking that out of 60 members of this House, two in fairly recent years experienced fires on account of the burning of turf.  I should like a statement from the Board explaining the scientific cause of the fires and why we have this particular kind of deposit in the chimney.</P>

      <P>As one who has used turf since 1932, I cannot see that there is any force in the argument which the Senator puts up.  If you keep a chimney cleaned, it will not take fire.  It is at the base of the chimney that the ignition takes place.  If you have soot in the chimney, you will have a fire, no matter what you burn. So far as cities are concerned, fires have taken place long before they used any turf and we had not these complaints. If chimneys are not kept clean, you will have a fire.  Fire will occur through the accumulation of soot, whether from turf or coal.  It occurs at the base of the chimney.  Otherwise, you will not have a fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> If one looks up the chimney in a country house where various things are burned, especially wood, you will see the glutinous tarry surface coming down.  There will be some of that in every chimney, but it is so far up that unless you burn a whole lot of furze or papers, the chimney will not catch fire.  I seriously suggest that the Senator is making too much out of this.  We have had fires long before turf was burned.  It is easy enough for a chimney sweep to say &ldquo;turf&rdquo;.  You have a lot of that sort of thing in relation to Irish boots and blaming our own.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the reply of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to my query on this section in relation to the utilisation of nuclear power in the future. The main objection in the document was the difficulty of getting the base load.  The base load is largely supplied by means of water power. Things will change rapidly in future. If we could get a link up in the European network, it would mean that we would be selling the base load to Europe or, alternatively, the question of pump storage is being actively explored at the moment and that may be another solution.  I suggest that the economics of conventional power production and nuclear power production are likely to change rapidly within the next decade.  Consequently, the Minister will want to keep a sharp look out to see that we do not go on building conventional power stations for longer than economics demand.</P>

      <P>This short Bill to amend the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, is the outcome of agreement reached in August of last year when I visited Belfast for a discussion with Lord Glentoran, then Minister of Commerce.  We reviewed the general policy and operations of the Foyle Fisheries Commission since its establishment in 1952 and noted the need for strengthening the existing legislation in certain respects, in particular as regards the severity of penalties for the poisoning of fish.</P>
      <P>The main provisions are contained in Sections 3, 5 and 7 of the Bill which are complete in themselves and which I shall deal with fully in a few moments.  Sections 4, 6, 8 and 9 consist of insertions and substitutions, the effect of which has been indicated in the notes circulated for the information of Senators.  These notes also show in regard to Section 10 of the Bill the side titles of the provisions of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, which are to apply in the Moville Area instead of the corresponding provisions which already apply there in their pre-1959 from; in this connection the Moville Area is the part of the Foyle Area within the State.</P>
      <P>I think Senators have got the same explanatory memorandum that was circulated when the Bill was before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The first section has the effect of writing in these amendments into the Principal Act of 1952.  All the definitions contained in Section 2, other than that substituting the Minister for Lands for the Minister for Agriculture in consequence of transfer of functions which took place in 1957, relate to the provisions in Section 3 concerning the use or possession of deleterious matter. There was no definition of &ldquo;deleterious matter&rdquo; in the 1952 Act and the new definition is somewhat more comprehensive than that in the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 will be seen to provide for a single Section in substitution for Sections <Col N="36" /> 41 and 42 of the 1952 Act, relating to the use or possession of explosives and of deleterious matter for the capture, destruction or injury of fish.  The existing maximum fines are £100 under Section 41 and £50 under Section 42, in place of which we now propose&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £100 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both such fine and such imprisonment;</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment, a fine not exceeding £500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>The application of the Probation of Offenders Act is also to be excluded in relation to offences under the new Section.</P>
    <P>Section 5 makes it an offence to use a boat or vehicle as an aid to the commission of any other fishery offence and provides for penalties on the same scale as in Section 3.  In addition to the monetary and prison penalties, provision is also made in subsection (3) of the inserted Section 52A for forfeiture by Court Order of a vehicle used in the commission of an offence where the conviction is obtained on indictment.</P>
    <P>This is an appropriate place to refer to Section 8, the effect of which is to render a boat used in the commission of a fishery offence automatically for-feit as a statutory consequence of conviction. To conclude this group of Sections, Section 7 provides for a redrafting of Section 65 of the Principal Act so as to include boats along with other articles which have been abandoned by their owners and which since no charge is likely to be brought in connection with their use have to be the subject of an application to the District Court for an Order for disposal.</P>
    <P>Before passing on from this group of sections, I should, perhaps, say that the provision for the taking of proceedings by way of indictment&mdash;now introduced for the first time in the fisheries code&mdash;is intended to signify <Col N="37" /> the extremely grave view which the Government take of the use of poison or explosives to capture fish and of the use of boats or vehicles as an aid to illegal fishing which, in such cases, often forms part of a well laid plan by a gang of poachers.  Where the circumstances warrant the taking of proceedings by way of indictment the usual procedure of the criminal justice code would be followed, namely, the taking of the proceedings would require the flat of the Attorney General and should the offender, at the District Court hearing for the purpose of taking depositions, elect to plead guilty, it would be competent for that Court to deal with the case summarily subject to the consent of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the remaining sections dealt with in the explanatory notes circulated with the Bill, the first is Section 4 which adds the use of a tailer or snare to the poaching methods which are prohibited by Section 43 of the Principal Act.  Although the tailer is, of course, in effect, a snare with a handle attached, it has a legitimate use as an aid to lawful angling and the necessary provision is made to safeguard such use.</P>
    <P>Section 6 comprises a number of amendments of subsection (1) of Section 64 of the 1952 Act which authorises inspection, examination and detention for the enforcement of the Act.</P>
    <P>The first amendment extends the existing powers of entry and search to hotels, guest houses and the like.  It is known that purchases of salmon for hotels and other catering premises often represent a convenient outlet for the poachers' catch&mdash;not indeed particularly in the Foyle Area but in the country as a whole.  It has been open to doubt whether the existing wording enabled an authorised officer to enter such premises and carry out a search and this matter is now being put beyond doubt by adding the new category.</P>
    <P>The next amendment to be made by Section 6 relates to the seizure of fish which in its existing form extends only to offences or suspected offences under the 1952 Act itself.  By inserting &ldquo;the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959&rdquo;<Col N="38" /> in this context, a possible defect in the powers of seizure is removed.</P>
    <P>The final amendment to be made by Section 6 is consequential on the creation by Section 5 of the offence of using a boat or vehicle as an aid to the commission of a fishery offence; it authorises the seizure of such a boat or vehicle.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill comprises a group of amendments relating to the Third Schedule to the Act of 1952 which relates to the powers of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  The first of these amendments makes good an important omission by enabling the Commission to take legal proceedings for the enforcement within the Foyle Area of any law relating to fisheries&mdash; and not merely the law under the 1952 Act.</P>
    <P>The next amendment to be made by Section 9 relates to the Secretary of the Commission.  At present the statutory duties of Secretary fall to be discharged by the junior members of the Commission in rotation.  Paragraph (b) of this section proposes that the Commission should be empowered to appoint a whole-time Secretary subject to Ministerial approval.  The former provision is, however, left standing and if the post of Secretary filled under the new power is at any time vacated the Secretaryship will, for the time being, revert to the appropriate junior member of the Commission.</P>
    <P>Finally paragraph (c) of Section 9 enables the Commission to set up a Pensions Scheme for its officers and servants.  The provisions proposed to be inserted follow, in the main, the conventional pattern of enabling clauses for a superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>As shown in the explanatory notes, the Table to Section 10 lists the provisions of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, which are to apply to the Moville Area.  This clear statement as to the application of the Fishery law outside the Foyle Fisheries Acts will serve two useful purposes.  In the first place it will clear up the uncertainty which has existed due to the extensive statue law revision which has taken place in recent years as to the extent to which the Fisheries Acts generally <Col N="39" /> apply in the Moville Area&mdash;which, as already mentioned, is the part of the Foyle Area within the State.  Secondly, since the Consolidation Act as a whole does not apply in the Moville Area the partial application to the extent shown in the Table will simplify the carrying through to the Moville Area of future amendments of that Act so that County Donegal will be kept in step with the rest of the State.</P>
    <P>Finally, Section 11 which contains the usual provisions as to short title and collective citation also provides for commencement of the Act by Order so that when this Bill and the parallel Bill now under consideration in Belfast become law, they can, by arrangement, be brought into operation simultaneously for the entire Foyle Area.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that while some of the powers proposed to be conferred on the Foyle Fisheries Commission by this Bill must appear rather drastic, I am fully satisfied that they are amply justified in the light of experience.  Indeed, in a general Amendment Bill which is nearly ready and which I expect to introduce next Session corresponding provision will be included as regards penalties for poisoning and for closing the market for the poacher by inspection of hotels.</P>
    <P>For the present, I should like the House to understand that in bringing in this Bill, I am expressing my complete confidence in the Foyle Fisheries Commission in carrying out its allotted task of preserving the highly valuable fisheries in its area.  I am happy to be able to say that the Commission continues to do its work in close cooperation with the statutory Advisory Council which is representative of all fishing interests in the Foyle Area.  The Commission and Council do not, of course, always see quite eye-to-eye with each other but I am satisfied that the consultation which takes places serves a very useful purpose and I hope that the new Advisory Council which has just been elected will continue to show the same constructive interest in the administration of the fisheries and continue to give the benefit of its advice and experience to the Commission and to the Ministers which is so essential <Col N="40" /> to the good management of this valuable fishery.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House for consideration.  I might mention that a similar Bill is now before the Senate of Northern Ireland and it would be desirable, if the House is agreeable, to pass all stages of this Bill this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesLindsay" hpid="Mr. Lindsay Mr. Lindsay">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lindsay</NameTxt>
      <P>The concluding words of the Minister, that some of the proposals contained in this Bill are drastic, almost amount to an under-statement. In spite of the drastic nature of the proposals, I am satisfied that they appear to be necessary, having regard to the fact that is an agreed measure between the Minister of the Government of the Republic of Ireland and the counterpart Minister in Northern Ireland. Broadly speaking, any such agreement reached and legislation sprining from such agreement must be welcomed as steps in the proper and desired direction.</P>
      <P>There are two matters about which I must express an opinion.  One is in connection with Section 3, whereby a boat is to be added as an article for forfeiture to the words &ldquo;fishing engine&rdquo; in the principal Act.  I have not got with me at the moment the principal Act and I do not know what will constitute a good defence.  Supposing, as is quite often the case, and is not outside the knowledge of people in the House, a boat would be stolen, would it then be the situation that a boat stolen from an innocent owner and used for poaching purposes and captured while so used, would be subject to forfeiture?  Unless there is some provision that saves the innocent owner, the provision should be reviewed.  It may well be that there is such a provision but I have not had an opportunity of looking at the principal Act in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter on which I wish to express an opinion deals with the power of inspection.  Great emphasis is laid upon the fact that hotels appear to be the great and universal receivers of poached fish.  I have not had any brief or instructions from any hoteliers but, on behalf of the greatest percentage of hoteliers, I say that the implication <Col N="41" /> in a universal way is something that must be resented.  I know there are hotels which, while I would not go so far as to say they specialise in the purchase of poached fish, nevertheless do purchase such fish.  I can say that there are two hotels in the west of Ireland where poached fish will not be bought under any circumstances, as a fixed rule of the house.  A servant who is generally empowered to buy, is strictly enjoined to go to the top for directions when somebody comes with fish.  To label hotels generally as the purchasers of poached fish is unfair.  It may be more unfortunate than unfair.  I consider it necessary that something should be said on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Subject to the protest I have made on behalf of those hotels that I know specifically object to the purchase of poached fish and subject further to being satisfied about the question of the boat to which I have referred, I have no objection to the Minister having all stages of this Bill this evening. I know that it has happened on a few occasions that a boat which was used for poaching belonged to a per-fectly innocent party.  I do not want a situation to arise wherein a boat can be stolen from somebody who has it properly moored and is used for poaching and, when the authorised officers come along and the poachers run away and are not caught, both the fishing engine and the boat may be subject to forfeiture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>First, taking the reference made by Senator Lindsay to hotels, let me say immediately, as I have said in the Dáil, that, of course, the vast majority of hoteliers do not engage in the purchase of poached fish or illegal fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say also that it is an offence at the moment for any hotelier to purchase poached fish or illegal fish, and the power to prosecute hotels or fine hotels for any such offence is already there under the law.  What is provided here is designed to clear up doubts, particularly on the inspection of hotels.  The Garda and the officers of the Commission already considered that they had power to enter, under <Col N="42" /> the law as it is, but some doubts were expressed elsewhere and therefore it was felt desirable to clarify the law on the power of inspection of hotels for the detection of fishery offences.</P>
    <P>There is no other way of en-deavouring to close the door to this avenue for the disposal of poached fish to hotels and restaurants, unless hotels as a whole are dealt with under the law.  I am satisfied that just as at many times it has been said if there were no receivers, there would be a lot less larceny, if there were no purchasers of poached fish, there would be a lot less poaching.  I am advised, and I feel it is essential, to try to close the market for the proceeds of poaching that does exist and we consider this is the best method of doing it.</P>
    <P>I should also make it clear in mentioning hotels that there is no specific reference to hotels in the Foyle area. This Bill is largely designed to deal with a new form of poaching where people travel long distances from cities, such as Belfast, in organised gangs and make what I would call commercial raids on this valuable fishery and dispose of their catches in most cases long distances from the Foyle area.  The fact that this Bill refers to the Foyle area is not to be taken in any sense as being a specific reflection on the hotel owners and guest-house owners in that area that they are in the habit of purchasing poached fish.</P>
    <P>As far as the point made about boats under Section 3 is concerned, this also is more for clarification purposes. Under Section 76 of the Principal Act, the reference was that &ldquo;where a person is convicted of an offence against this Act, any fish illegally taken by him or in his possession at the time of the offence and also any fishing engine or thing by means or in respect of which the offence is committed shall, as a statutory consequence of conviction, stand forfeited.&rdquo;  Under &ldquo;fishing, engine or thing&rdquo; boats have been already seized and forfeited and some doubts were expressed in some quarters as to whether the wording of the section did in fact cover boats, although the proposition as far as I am aware was not challenged legally in any court of competent <Col N="43" /> jurisdiction.  At all events, for the purpose of clarifying the law, it was felt well to take this opportunity specifically to mention boats as they are mentioned here under Section 3.  There is, of course, just as with the tailer, power in the court to release the boat or the vehicle, if it were seized in such circumstances as Senator Lindsay suggests. This power of seizing boats is not new to our law.  Indeed, in other branches of the law, particularly in relation to offences under the illicit distillation code, the power is also there to seize boats that are used to assist in the commission of an offence or in aiding or abetting any such offence.</P>
    <P>It is true, as I have said, that the penalties under this Bill are serve and substantial and that policy has been agreed upon both by myself and my opposite number in Northern Ireland. We are convinced that the time has come when the penalties in connection with poaching offences must be made fit the crime.  Senators are no doubt aware, particularly in connection with salmon poaching, of the amount of money that can now be obtained by poachers and the price that salmon commands on the market.  I am satisfied that, in general, fines are not adequate to check the new tendency towards commercial poaching that has emerged, particularly since the War.</P>
    <P>This form of intensive poaching on a commercial scale started, I understand, in Scotland and spread to the north of Ireland and has unfortunately drifted in some cases to us on this side of the Border.  Senators will appreciate that with the methods used by these people, explosives and poisons, where they are in a position to capture 50 or 100 salmon in a raid, the amount of money they can command in such circumstances, considering the price of salmon, is a big temptation to them and any question of a fine is not going to have very much of a preventive effect on people of that kind.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we decided that the time had come not alone for providing monetary penalties but giving the court discretion to impose substantial terms of imprisonment and providing <Col N="44" /> that poaching offences can be brought by way of indictment and convicted offenders made liable to two years' imprisonment in severe cases.  The question of what form of procedure will be invoked under this Act will be a matter for the Commission, but we are quite satisfied, as are our advisers, that in these days and for the reasons I have mentioned, it is essential to let the public know, and particularly to let the organised poachers know, that poaching will not pay if the offences are detected.  I should also say in regard to the amendment in connection with the use of tailers that people using them legitimately for lawful salmon angling will not be liable to prosecution.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other matter to which I need refer.  I want to thank the House for the speedy passage they have given this Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
    <P>Bill considered in Committee.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="Mr. Yeats Mr. Yeats">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yeats</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he could give us an explanation of the change being made under Section 3 as compared with Sections 41 and 42 of the Principal Act. Under this Bill, &ldquo;if any person being on the bank of or near any waters has in his possession or under his control any deleterious matter he shall be guilty of an offence against this Act.&rdquo; In the following subsection, it says that it is open to him to prove his innocence by stating that he had these substances for an innocent purpose.  Under the former sections the position was rather different.  They stated that any person being on a bank or near any waters, who had these substances under his control with intent to employ them for the purpose of catching or destroying fish, was guilty of an offence.  In other words until now it was for the State to prove the offence, but now we are <Col N="45" /> putting in the provision that it is for the accused to prove his innocence.  We are doing this for the Foyle area only, because the old provisions under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, still remain in force in the rest of the country, under which the State must prove intent to employ these substances for destructive purposes.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the general principle of legislation of this kind is undesirable. However, we all know there are cases where it is essential to have legislation of this kind because of difficulties of proof in court.  But I feel that we should never let a provision like this into a Bill without, first, being quite clear what we are doing and, secondly, being quite clear why we are doing it. For that reason I would be glad if the Minister would give us an explanation as to why this change has been necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is quite correct to state that this question of onus is new.  For instance, subsection (1) Section 35 of the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, states:</P>
      <P>If any person buys, sells, exposes for sale or has in his possession any salmon or trout unlawfully captured such person shall be guilty of an offence...</P>
      <P>and he shall be subject to such and such a penalty.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of the same section provides:</P>
      <P>In any proceedings under this section, the onus of proving that the salmon or trout, the subject of the proceedings, was lawfully captured shall lie on the defendant.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in the existing code under the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, the onus was on the defendant if he were apprehended in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this section, I would point out that the definition of deleterious matter has been widened and extended, particularly to deal with poisons and explosives.  In addition, the penalties have been drastically increased.  It was felt that the statutory defence should be available to a defendant who is able to prove that the poison <Col N="46" /> or the explosive he had in his possession was for a lawful purpose.  The Senator can visualise that some rivers adjoin roads, in many cases public roads.  The fact that people may be going to their own lands by the banks of the river and have some of the forbidden material for a lawful purpose must be contemplated.  Under this section the onus will be on the defendant to show that what he had in his possession was for an innocent purpose.</P>
    <P>In view of what might arise and in view of the severity of the penalties I am now asking the House to approve, it was felt that this specific statutory protection should be there for innocent people who might be charged with such an offence.  We felt it was a safeguard, and that is the reason this escape clause was put there.</P>

      <P>I do not quite understand this section.  It appears under Section 52 (a), subsection (1)&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash;that a person who commits an offence outside the State against the legislation of Northern Ireland can be prosecuted in the district court inside the State.  It may not mean that, but could the Minister state whether it does or not?</P>

      <P>I agree it is difficult to follow this with the cross references to the other statutes involved.  It has been provided under the Principal Act, and in fact this wording follows some sections of the Principal Act, that people for an offence in Northern Ireland can be apprehended here by a Garda or a member of the Commission and handed back to the police force in Northern Ireland to stand their trial there.  In the same way people who commit offences here and are resident in Northern Ireland, if they are apprehended on the Northern side of the Border, can be handed over to stand their trial here for the offences committed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> There is a similar provision in the 1952 Act.  I am aware, however, that the wording in connection with the current law of Northern Ireland has been taken from the Principal Act.  The Senator will appreciate that in the Foyle area it is not unusual for people from north of the Border to come down and poach on the part of the fishery within our jurisdiction, and in some cases people from our jurisdiction go over to the other side to do their poaching.  The position now is that they can be prosecuted on either side.</P>
    <P>Section 62 of the Principal Act states:</P>
    <P>(1)  If, within the Foyle Area, any person (in this Section referred to as the offender) is found offending against the provisions of the Fisheries Acts or this Act or the corresponding law of Northern Ireland, the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an authorised person may required the offender to do either or both of the following things&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  desist from such offence;</P>
    <P>(ii)  give his name and address;</P>
    <P>(b)  if the offender, after being so required, wilfully continues such offence or fails or refuses to give his name and address, the authorised person, and any persons acting under his directions may apprehend the offender;</P>
    <P>(c)  where the offender is apprehended under this section by an authorised person who is not a member of the Garda Síochána, that person shall, subject to subsection (2) of this section forthwith deliver the offender into the custody of a member of the Garda Síochána to be dealt with according to law.</P>
    <P>(2)  If the authorised person who apprehended the offender or a <Col N="48" /> member of the Garda Síochána into whose custody he had been delivered has reason to believe that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the offender is resident in Northern Ireland and,</P>
    <P>(b)  the offence is an offence under the said corresponding law of Northern Ireland he may forthwith deliver the offender into the custody of a member of the police forces of Northern Ireland to be dealt with according to that law.</P>
    <P>I should say that the Bill now before the Senate of Northern Ireland contains similar provision for handing people over to the Garda here.</P>

      <P>It does seem that we have more care for the salmon of Northern Ireland than for its people. There is provision here in respect of people who poach Northern Ireland salmon.  I suppose that could not be done without an extradition treaty, or are we to suppose that is not necessary?</P>

      <P>This provision is nothing new.  This is the law in connection with poaching in the Foyle area since 1952.  I feel sure the Senator is familiar with the Foyle Fisheries.  Here is a measure agreed between the two Governments.  It is the only statutory provision I know of in which there are reciprocal powers of this kind.</P>

      <P>Section 62 of the Principal Act does not, I feel, cover the point.  This section appears, on the face of it, to be somewhat ambiguous. The only sense I can read into it is that an offender may start off in a boat in our territoral waters and end up in Northern Ireland.</P>
