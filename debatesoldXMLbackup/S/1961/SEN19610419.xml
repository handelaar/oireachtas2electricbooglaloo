    <Title>Poisons Bill, 1960&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to replace by a modern code, which will be comprehensive and adaptable to changing circumstances, a number of old laws for the control of the sale of poisons which date back to the middle of the 19th century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the main, the present law on the matter is contained in the Arsenic Act, 1851, and the Poisons (Ireland) Act, 1870, with subsidiary provisions in the Pharmacy (Ireland) Act of 1875, and an amending Act of 1908.  The 1851 Act required sales of arsenic to be recorded, permitting them only where the purchaser was known to the seller or where the sale was witnessed by a mutual acquaintance.  The 1870 Act applies to a number of poisons and <Col N="3" /> those to which it applied initially are listed in a schedule to it.  This schedule is divided into two parts; and when any of the preparations listed in either part of it are offered for sale, the word &ldquo;poison&rdquo; and the name and address of the seller must be distinctly set out on the container.  The familiar more venomous poisons such as arsenic, prussic acid and strychnine are included in Part I of the Schedule; and in relation to all preparations in this Part, the Act imposes similar conditions as to records and sales as the 1851 Act applies to sales of arsenic.</P>
    <P>The 1875 Act was concerned, in the first place, with establishing the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and provides consequentially for the registration of pharmaceutical chemists.  It affected the subject with which we are now dealing only to the extent that Section 30 of the Act restricted to pharmaceutical chemists and other qualified persons the right to keep open shop, as it was termed, for the sale of poisons.  This restriction, however, was subsequently modified by Section 2 of the Poisons and Pharmacy Act, 1908, so as to provide that other persons may be licensed for the sale of poisons for agricultural and veterinary purposes. The licences in question are issued by local authorities and the licensees are, in the main, hardware merchants and seed merchants.</P>
    <P>A grave defect in the present law is that, while under the 1870 Act a procedure exists for the addition of poisons to the schedule, there is no provision for deleting any preparation from it, or for bringing the nomenclature up to date.  Neither can a poison, once it has been included in one part of the schedule, be transferred to the other, so that the controls decided upon when a substance is added to the schedule cannot subsequently be varied.</P>
    <P>For instance, no power is given to the appropriate authority to make a regulation to the effect that a particularly virulent or dangerous substance shall not be made available to the public, otherwise than on the prescription of a qualified practitioner.  Again, <Col N="4" /> except in the case of a few substances, there is no provision relating to labelling, beyond the simple requirement that the word &ldquo;Poison&rdquo; be printed on the label and the name and address of the seller given.  In modern conditions, it is desirable to be able to prescribe more distinctive and specific warnings than these.  For example, carbon tetrachloride, which is often a constituent of preparations for removing stains from clothes, is a highly volatile substance and may give off fumes which are highly dangerous if it is used in a confined space.  The container of any preparation of this type should bear on its face a warning to this effect.</P>
    <P>Under the 1870 Act, a substance may be added to the Poisons Schedule only when the College of Physicians declare it to be appropriate for this purpose and the Government, in endorsement of the recommendation of the College, make an Order accordingly. While this rather limited function has been satisfactorily discharged by the College, I feel that with the development of numerous new synthetic poisons for use not only in medicine, but in industry and agriculture, a more broadly based advisory body is desirable.</P>
    <P>The need for flexibility; for more rapid action when called for; for larger powers to regulate&mdash;for the greater safety of the public&mdash;the sale, use and distribution of deadly substances; and for a wider range of advisers have been the considerations which have shaped the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>These needs are met by Sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, which provide, respectively, for the establishment, functions and constitution of a consultative council, Comhairle na Nimheanna, and for the appointment of its chairman and members; by Section 14 which empowers the Minister for Health&mdash;be it noted after consultation with or on the recommendation of the Council&mdash;to make regulations declaring substances to be poisonous and regulating their storage, distribution, supply and sale; and by Section 15 which similarly empowers the Minister <Col N="5" /> for Agriculture, again after consultation with the Council or on the recommendation of the Council, to regulate the use of poisonous substances for agricultural or veterinary purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that every regulation made shall be laid as soon as may be before each House of the Oireachtas and that any such regulation may be annulled by resolution of either House passed in due time.  It may happen, as a matter of urgency, that the Minister concerned may be obliged to make a regulation without prior consultation with the Council and this is provided for under Section 16.  If, however, the Minister should have to make a regulation under that section, the regulation, when laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, must be accompanied by a statement in writing indicating that it has been made without prior consultation.</P>
    <P>In relation to all its provisions, I want to stress that the sole purpose of the measure is to safeguard the people, their lives and their health, against the misuse of the highly dangerous substances which, for one beneficial or useful purpose or another, are now being produced in continuously increasing numbers.  The rapidity with which the new poisonous substances are being evolved and offered to the public, makes it quite impracticable to control their distribution and use by <i>ad hoc</i> legislation as they emerge. There is no alternative but to deal with them by ministerial regulation and administrative action and this is what the Bill proposes, but under certain conditions which I have mentioned. The first of these, may I recall, is that, except in case of emergency, the appropriate Minister must, before making a regulation, consult with the Council which is to be established under the Bill; and the second is that any regulation which the Minister may make must be laid before the Oireachtas, either House of which will have power to annul it.  Thus the possibility of the unnecessary or arbitrary exercise of his powers by a Minister is provided against.</P>
    <P>I trust the House will not have any difficulty, in the circumstances I have <Col N="6" /> outlined, in giving a Second Reading to the Bill.  In the other House, there was no objection to it in principle and the only points on which there was any discussion had reference to the composition of the proposed advisory council, Comhairle na Nimheanna, and the related matter of the control of agricultural and veterinary use of poisons.  All these are matters which may I think, be more suitably debated on Committee Stage; and I would suggest, therefore, that any discussion on them or on other details of the Bill might be reserved until then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The remarks I wish to address to you, Sir, and to the Minister, on this Bill have relation largely to the provision with regard to the sale of poisons to farmers.  The use of weedicides and fungicides causes the need for this type of legislation.  As we move towards a more regulated existence and a more complex method of doing things, bringing in new medicines, and new chemical preparations from which we benefit, legislation with regard to the use of these preparations must be a matter to which this House and the other House can properly address themselves.</P>
      <P>This Bill is of great importance to farmers.  At the outset, I should like to say that it may not be fully appreciated that the use of poisons in various forms by farmers over the past ten years has increased and multiplied itself many times over.  It now covers a much wider range than did the original fungicides.  The ordinary sprays used to control the fungus which caused blight in potatoes have extended themselves to cover all sorts of new weedicides&mdash;contact weed killers, hormone weed killers, vaccines used by injection into animals, young lambs, and so on, and all sorts of medicines which were unknown until the end of the war.  In that context, it is most important that the use of these be regulated, but it is also most important that the farmers who enjoyed the free use of these articles at low charge, which were supplied to them at a low rate of profit, should continue to enjoy them at such low rate of profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must examine the present situation. <Col N="7" /> Over the past number of years, there has been a certain conflict between the chemists and the veterinary profession as to whether or not farmers should be supplied with these drugs. In the case of medicine, that conflict was evident.  To date, the farmers have largely won that battle.  They have been supplied with these drugs from wholesale pharmaceutical merchants, from seed merchants, grain growers, in the case of fungicides and weedicides, and from various sorts of people.  There have been situations where extraordinarily low rates of profit were taken. The ordinary spraying was at all times regarded as, if not a wholesale, then certainly a retail commodity.  The farmer got his sprays and so on, at wholesale or retail shop prices.</P>
    <P>It may well be that our regulations may find us in the hands of people who have a valid argument as to why such low rates of profit should not continue or in the case of veterinary surgeons why such poisons should not be supplied to the ordinary layman.  The farmers are wisely and safely using these poisons.  There have been very few cases of misuse.  I know of one contact weed killer which, when you are overcome by the fumes, has an antidote known to us all as whiskey which some people enjoy and they are not dismayed at being overcome by the fumes.  These dangers are known to farmers and the sprays, fungicides and weedicides are used with care.</P>
    <P>In Section 14, the Minister takes power to regulate to whom these things will be sold and how they will be stored.  I should have no objection to the large wholesaler of these commodities being regulated, but there is not much hope in the case of the man I referred to, the spraying contractor, the small farmer who tries to make extra money by keeping a sprayer for contract or perhaps the large farmer who has a sprayer for his own use and goes on contract to spray his neighbours' crops.  He will find it difficult to keep a store, to keep a record and to keep the regulations.  If that type of man is constrained by the Minister for Health to do these things, he may find himself in court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> My impression would be that, in relation to agricultural fungicides weedicides and medicines, this Poisons Bill could be administered in a lax fashion rather than in accordance with the letter of the law.  I mean no disservice to the chemists or veterinary surgeons in what I have said.  There is no case whatever, for instance, for the Minister&mdash;if he were so unwise as to do so&mdash;to make a regulation that pulpy kidney vaccine which is a poison should be sold only to veterinary surgeons or chemists when the practice at the moment is for every farmer's son to buy his pulpy kidney vaccine from wholesale pharmaceutical merchants and to inject every lamb born on the farm with it.</P>
    <P>That is no case at all for the insistence that the contact weed killer I mentioned should be sold only through chemists or through persons who keep records or keep a store of sprayers. Spraying contractors have up to the moment been enjoying the supply of these goods at perhaps a profit to those who supply them of 10 per cent. whereas the lowest profit all those sprays and weedicides takes into account is 10 per cent. plus another 33? per cent.  So the Minister, in the application of this Bill and in its passage through this House would want to be extremely careful that those things that are enjoyed should be preserved.</P>
    <P>We may look forward to further issues of new fungicides, weedicides and medicines.  I could imagine a situation on the Council whereby the representatives of the medical practitioners could take a line that these new preparations should be sold only to them. Of course, even though the Minister has met the request of the National Farmers' Association in bringing up the number of farmers' representatives to two, those representatives would find themselves in a minority and the Minister might find himself with a recommendation from the Council that certain new medicines, fungicides and weedicides should not be supplied direct to farmers from wholesale houses.  In that regard, it is necessary that the Minister should be careful. <Col N="9" /> While saying all that, I think we on this side of the House should welcome the Bill as it is a natural consequence of the change in the times.</P>

      <P>This is a very simple Bill and one which is to be supervised by the Minister for Health to safeguard the human subject.  I deprecate the attacks which have been made in the other House and the criticism of the present system by the National Farmers' Association.  Senator Donegan has introduced the same note here.</P>

      <P>I hope it will not develop.  While any new medicine that is not in use at present or medicines that are in use at present and are not a danger to the human subject will not in any way be restricted by this new legislation, the atmosphere was created that something new was being brought in requiring much consideration where the farmers are concerned. As such, I think the attitude was all wrong.  The discussion in the Dáil which lasted over several days was entirely out of order, to my mind.</P>

      <P>Senator Ó Donnabháin, on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Seán Ó Donnabháin Seán Ó Donnabháin">
      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>I started off by saying that the Bill is a simple one to safeguard the human subject by regulations by the Minister for Health. If we discuss the Bill from that point of view, I do not think discussions on non-poisonous substances in use at present for the treatment of animals should be mentioned at all.  If I am wrong in referring to things said in the other House, I can say at any rate that people have said that a farmer is entitled to do what he wishes with his own beast and kill it with poison, if he wishes.  I do not think that was an appropriate way to discuss things relevant to this Bill.</P>
      <P>Criticism was made about the victimisation of farmers by veterinary surgeons.  That is all wrong because the veterinary surgeon, the veterinary practitioner, is the greatest friend the farmer has and is of the greatest assistance to the farmer and works in co-operation with him.  Another matter which was brought into the discussion dealt with vaccines and the treatment which at present is given by a farmer to his lands and livestock.  That was entirely extraneous to the discussion.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that in the west of Ireland where lambs have to be vaccinated, the farmer's son or the farmer does it, with the co-operation and assistance or under the direction of a veterinary surgeon.  A veterinary surgeon could not possibly be available at the birth of all the lambs born in the sheep rearing districts to vaccinate them.  I hope the discussion here does not develop on the lines on which it developed elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the question of sprays. There are hormone sprays and other chemical sprays which I do not think have yet come to be regarded as a danger to the human subject, Some could come on the market which could be a danger and it is only from that point of view that the body to be set up by the Minister would deal with the matter.  If they are dangerous in their application by inhalation by or contact with the member of the community dispersing such weed killers by mechanical <Col N="11" /> means, through his own efforts, or by machinery, it is very reasonable to ensure that the human subject is not endangered by these things.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the treatment of animals with dangerous drugs. These come within the ambit of the Bill only if they are a danger to the human administering them.  They might be a danger to the veterinary surgeon himself, but to say that a farmer is debarred from using these substances because he is treating his own animals is surely wrong.  That is all I have to say on the Bill except I welcome it as being necessary.  It is a simple Bill designed to safeguard the human subject in the administration of any of these poisonous drugs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I listened with interest to what the Minister said when introducing the Second Reading.  He said the main purpose of the Bill is to safeguard the people, their lives and their health.  To assist him to do that work, he is setting up what he terms a broadly-based advisory body and the Bill goes into a lot of detail setting up and providing for representation of various interests on this advisory body.  There are some 17 altogether.  I am looking at it from the rather narrow point of view, it might be thought, that is, from the point of view of the people who are engaged in the use and in the distribution and transport of these dangerous goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred, for example, to some liquid used in cleaning which he says is highly volatile and can be dangerous, if used in a confined space. There are other chemicals being used now in agriculture, horticulture and various other spheres, which can be dangerous to the worker and it is to the workers' interests that I want to refer.  I should imagine that it would be reasonable to represent to the Minister that if he is setting up what he terms a broadly-based advisory body, he should have regard not only to the people engaged in the sale and purchase, the people who are engaged in prescribing these goods, but also to the people who come in contact with <Col N="12" /> these drugs and dangerous liquids or powders, in their use.  I should imagine that it would be proper that the advisory body should provide for representation for the workers who have an interest in this matter, the people engaged in the use of these commodities.  I should like to hear the Minister's view on that before we come to the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support a great deal of what Senator Donegan said in regard to hoping that the Minister will not make too stringent regulations in respect of certain of these drugs or sprays which both large and small farmers use.  Some of them have small contracting businesses and use these sprays which possibly are dangerous for human consumption.  At the same time, to make stringent regulations would leave these farmers in a very difficult position.  Considering the amount of these sprays and drugs used and the very small number of accidents we have heard about since they came into use, it is unnecessary to make any very stringent regulations.  In the last ten years, since these preparations became common, perhaps most of us have heard of more accidents from such things as copper sulphate or paraffin oil than we have about children or grown-ups drinking any of these new sprays.  The fact that usually they are not kept in a dwelling house also obviates risk.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should not handicap farmers too much by regulations under these sections. Originally, I would have thought that the Minister would have had better councils.  I would suggest a council of medical men who would deal with the drugs or poisons in relation to humans and have a separate council for the others.  The medical men, as mentioned in Section 4, might not have a great deal of interest or knowledge of some of the things used for purely agricultural or veterinary purposes.  I think the Minister would have a much more workable system if he had a separate council for both sections&mdash; two separate councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 4, I should like to see <Col N="13" /> the Minister allowing some of these bodies, the Pharmaceutical Society, the dentists and so on, to nominate two members and the Minister also nominating two.  I think these bodies have grown up sufficiently now, if I may put it that way, to find among their own members men who would take an interest in that side of the work.  I quite agree that the Minister would like to have his own nominees also.  I feel these bodies should be allowed to nominate men who they know have that interest at heart and are prepared to do this work.  Apart from those points, I think the Bill is, perhaps, necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what has been said by most of the Senators.  I think it is quite obvious that this is a very carefully drafted Bill and one which is necessary for the protection of the community and protection of the farmers using the poisons to which the Bill refers.</P>
      <P>I also think that the Minister should be complimented for the manner in which in the other House he met certain objections voiced by the National Farmers' Association, among others, to certain aspects of the Bill.  If we study the amendments accepted or put down by the Minister, we will see that he has gone quite a long way to meet many of their objections.  There are just two points I should like to make, nevertheless.</P>
      <P>One is that it would be possible under Section 15 to restrict, perhaps unnecessarily, the channels through which these poisonous substances can be sold.  I am not in favour of the too widespread channelling of such substances. Nevertheless, I think there is some merit in the comment of the National Farmers' Association that where there is diversity of distributing mechanism, there is also diversity which leads to price competition.  I should like to hear the Minister's comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious that if the source of supply of these poisonous substances, weed killers, to farmers is too narrowly restricted, it might turn into something like a distribution monopoly. The House will remember that <Col N="14" /> the pharmaceutical trade was, in fact, the subject of a long inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission and the Commission, in the light of certain restrictive practices which they saw, recommended the making of certain Orders by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce decided not to do that. I would feel that if the source of supply were to be restricted too narrowly, particularly to a trade where there is no regulation of the price mechanism except by those engaged in the trade, possibly the farmer would suffer from the disappearance of price competition consequent upon the disappearance of the diversity of the source of supply.</P>
    <P>The other point I should like to make is also mentioned by the National Farmers' Association.  They make the point, which seems legitimate to me, that a great number of the medicines and drugs, penicillin, sulpha drugs, vitamin injections and so on, have come more and more to be used on the farm by the farmer himself, without the necessity on his part of calling in an outside expert.  I think it would be a pity&mdash;I imagine the Minister would agree&mdash;if Section 15 were to be so interpreted as to admit of regulations being made which would prevent farmers from administering or applying certain common remedies on the farm themselves.</P>
    <P>The point was made by other Senators. I feel that Section 15 ought not to be capable of that interpretation. The widespread administration of such drugs is the common practice now.  I feel sure that the Minister has, in fact, no intention of interfering with that. Otherwise, I have no other comment except to welcome the Bill and the manner in which it has been drafted and amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is agreed by all that the rules and regulations governing the control and sale of poison are completely out of date and that a more modern code is necessary. We have been told that the regulations governing the sale of such poisons date back as far as 1851.  I welcome the sections of the Bill which deal with the sale of tranquillisers or &ldquo;pep&rdquo;<Col N="15" /> pills.  We all know the bad effect they can have on people, especially young people.  Unfortunately, they are being freely sold in this country at the present time.  I think the Minister himself displayed his own anxiety in the Dáil on 23rd November, 1960, volume 185, column 70 when he stated:</P>
      <P>I mentioned here before, it is my intention, if the Bill becomes law, at an early date to refer certain drugs which are supposed to have a tranquillising effect to the Comhairle for advice.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister will have the full backing of this House in any action he takes in that direction to help save at least some of our young people from moral degradation.  Unfortunately, some of our young people are following and aping what is taking place in London and other cities across the water.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the provisions of the Bill which make up-to-date regulations as regards poisonous sprays, weed killers and so on which are now freely used by farmers and other people.  I think everyone of us will welcome this Bill in so far as it provides a safeguard for our people.  No matter what Senator Ó Donnabháin says, I still have my doubts about the section which deals with the sale and use by farmers of veterinary remedies which can be termed poisons under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should be very grateful if the Minister could give us the same assurance as Senator Ó Donnabháin has given.  I think the people in this House are free to criticise this Bill or any other Bill that is introduced.  This is the place to point out any danger which we may see in this or any other Bill that may be introduced by this Government or any other Government. Many farmers and many farmers' organisations fear that, when this Bill becomes law, the Minister may, by regulation, impose restrictions on the sale by chemists to farmers of many veterinary drugs and treatments which are now freely available to our farmers or farmers' sons.  Such a move on the part of the Government would constitute one of the most retrograde <Col N="16" /> steps ever taken in relation to animal husbandry.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister consider that the modern farmer, who has adapted himself to operating most complicated machinery, is incapable of injecting the commonplace animal vaccines and drugs with a simple syringe?  Subsection (2) (a) of Section 15 prohibits:</P>
    <P>the application or administration of poisons or particular poisons for agricultural or veterinary purposes or particular agricultural or veterinary purposes otherwise than by methods or processes specified in the regulations and subject to safeguards and precautions specified in the regulations and may prohibit specified methods or processes of application or administration of poisons,</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that under that section the Minister has far-reaching power.  He can prohibit the sale of drugs or poisons to farmers, and he can also specify who is to administer them.  It could be specified that no one can administer certain drugs except a veterinary surgeon.  That is a serious matter so far as the farmers are concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides:</P>
    <P>A person who contravenes a regulation under this Act shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding ten pounds for each day on which the offence is continued, or, at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or to both such fine or fines and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Henceforward, a farmer who does not comply with the regulations which may be made by the Minister can be brought to court and fined a sum not exceeding £100, or at the discretion of the court, sentenced to a term not exceeding six months in jail.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was questioned in Dáil Éireann on 21st March, 1961, he did not deny that.  At column 944, <Col N="17" /> volume 187 of the <i>Official Report</i> he said:</P>
    <P>I doubt if any district justice would impose that for a breach of such a regulation.</P>
    <P>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins: Would he have the power to do so?</P>
    <P>Mr. MacEntee: Yes, but the whole virtue of responsibility rests in the fact that it will be reasonably discharged. I assume our district justices are not going to act unreasonably or if they do, we might have them examined under the Mental Treatment Act and consign them to a place where they may be cured.</P>
    <P>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins: And their answer is that the Minister for Health gave them the authority.</P>
    <P>The authority is there to give them six months in Mountjoy, but the Minister points out that the responsibility rests with the district justice: he need not do it, and if he does, he should be examined as a mental patient.  If the Minister thinks that, why include the rules and regulations in the Bill?</P>
    <P>We are prepared to agree with the regulations which control the use of poisonous materials for agricultural purposes, because we all know there are poisonous sprays which, unless used with special care and special precautions, may cause damage to human life and to beasts.  They may also cause damage to crops and we know they may cause damage to wild fowl.  They may be blown across hedges on a wild or breezy day and cause damage to the health of neighbours whose cows may have come in contact with the crops, or have eaten the crops after the wind had blown these poisonous substances across the hedges.  I entirely agree that there should be rules and regulations pointing out the dangers and controlling them as far as possible.</P>
    <P>We agree that the Minister for Agriculture, who is responsible for the general care and welfare of agriculture, should have power to control the use of dangerous and poisonous sprays which, as I said, can do so much harm, but we do not believe the Minister should have the power that is vested in him under Section 15.  Poisons <Col N="18" /> used for veterinany purposes can be considered under two heads.  They are used for the routine preventive dosing of cattle, sheep or pigs or they are used to cure the animals.  We all know that it is now a routine practice of modern animal husbandry to employ a very wide range of preventive injections and doses.  They are essential for the control of liver fluke, braxy, lamb dysentery, black leg, warbles in cattle, etc.  They are used in the case of contagious abortion and other diseases every day, I think, and a number of them are administered by the farmers themselves.</P>

      <P>I said the present Minister may not be Minister then. <Col N="19" /> There may be some other person.  We may perhaps have a veterinary surgeon Minister for Health at some time.  The power is there and so long as the power is there, the danger is there.  I fail to see why a restriction on the use of poisons for veterinary purposes should be specifically set out in this Bill, including power to make regulations prohibiting, restricting and controlling the use of these poisons.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil on 21st March last the Minister refused to agree to an amendment proposed by Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.  The proposal was in Section 15 (1) (b) lines 34 and 35 to delete &ldquo;and veterinary&rdquo; and in lines 37 and 38 to delete &ldquo;or veterinary&rdquo;. That was refused.  A vote was taken and the amendment was defeated.  The apprehension rightly entertained by the agricultural community so long as those words are there is that gradually we will be faced with regulations which will in effect put an obligation on the farmer to consult or to hire a veterinary surgeon in all cases in which he wishes to use one of these medicines.  The cost of doing that would be simply prohibitive.  The only result would be that many farmers would perhaps let their cattle or sheep or pigs die without having them properly attended to.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly satisfied that, with modern livestock husbandry practices, nothing should be done to restrict the right of the modern farmer to treat his livestock with any of those drugs. They are doing it for a long time and I think they have been doing it very successfully.  If the Minister and the Government had agreed in the Dáil to delete the word &ldquo;veterinary,&rdquo; a great deal of the legitimate apprehension of the agricultural community would have been removed.  But the Minister refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the House to the Official Report of Dáil Éireann, Volume 187, Column 936, of 21st March, 1961, where the Minister is reported as saying: &ldquo;If you are going to do that in relation to those substances utilised in agriculture,&rdquo; that is, in regard to sprays, fungicides, and so on &ldquo;how can you say it is unreasonable <Col N="20" /> to try to regulate the use of these new drugs for veterinary purposes?&rdquo; Therefore, no matter what Senator Ó Donnabháin has stated, I think it is his intention to regulate the sale and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What object can I have in publicising that?  I have no object in publicising it.  The danger is there and so long as it is there, I am entitled to speak on it and will.  It is obvious that should certain veterinary medicines be confined to the veterinary surgeons alone, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington pointed out, the actual cost of the medicine itself will be increased.  As well as that, the farmer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Competition is the life of trade.  If they are confined to a few people to sell or if only veterinary surgeons are allowed to purchase them, then, in the treatment of cattle, the cost will be much more to the farmer. If he has to go to the veterinary surgeon, a diagnosis will cost him 10/- or 15/-.  Then, if the veterinary surgeon must go out to administer the drug, that will cost the farmer another £2 or two guineas.  In many cases, the farmer can do that himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A distinguished member of the veterinary profession has estimated that the loss of livestock in Ireland from <Col N="21" /> treatment by &ldquo;do-it-yourselves&rdquo; farmers, as they have been referred to recently by veterinary surgeons, represents about £1½ million.  Recently in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> the veterinary surgeons said nobody should be allowed to use any of those drugs but veterinary surgeons; that the chemist should not be allowed to sell those drugs to farmers; that the veterinary surgeons should have the exclusive use of them. If there is a loss of £1½ million per annum through farmers treating the cattle themselves, it seems an enormous figure but, even if it is correct, let us look at it from the farmers' side.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 400,000 farmers in Ireland.  Should their routine veterinary supplies be withdrawn from their medicine chest, a farmer would be more than lucky if he had not to call on the veterinary surgeon at least five or six times in the year.  Let us take that figure, for the moment.  That would cost the farmer £10.  This would leave the farming community to foot an unnecessary veterinary surgeons bill of £4 million which I would consider a minimum figure to prevent a theoretical loss of roughly £1½ million as we are told by the veterinary surgeons themselves.</P>
    <P>Some Senators may say that the chemists are not trained to diagnose animal diseases and that this is the sphere of the veterinary surgeon.  That has been stated by some of our veterinary surgeons in letters to the papers since this Bill was first mooted.  The average farmer is very well versed and very &ldquo;well up&rdquo; as regards the majority of diseases.  The majority of chemists are competent to discuss the various drugs for animal ailments.  The farmer can diagnose a complaint and treat it with medicines purchased from the chemist.  That is happening to-day and is proving very successful.</P>
    <P>Well over 90 per cent of our farmers now find they can successfully inject cattle and sheep against all the different diseases I mentioned before such as blackleg, pulpy kidney and so on. They can treat many diseases with antibiotics and the modern drugs at a great saving in expense.  I remember some years ago before penicillin and other <Col N="22" /> drugs first came on the market.  If a farmer had trouble with a cow calving or a ewe lambing, he had to get the veterinary surgeon.  When injecting a vaccine the veterinary surgeon would keep his hand on the label of the bottle and that visit would cost the farmer £2 or two guineas.  Now that we have penicillin and the ordinary drugs, the farmer can do that job himself at a cost of no more than 2/- or 2/6 a dose.</P>
    <P>The average farmer does not begrudge paying the veterinary surgeon for what he does but he strongly objects to paying money for unnecessary services.  The majority of farmers are enraged at the new Poison Bill, lest it should prevent them purchasing drugs or restrict them in any way in their use of them.  It must be agreed that the farmer is a man who has grown up in the world of livestock and must get credit for knowing a good deal about animals from a lifetime of association with them.  I believe that the present arrangement whereby the farmer can procure from chemists the treatment for straightforward cases and preventive injections and whereby in cases which are beyond him, he can call in his veterinary surgeon, would still seem to be the most reasonable one.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that these powers will not be used in any way to interfere with the existing marketing or supply channels of veterinary medicines to the farmers.</P>

      <P>I thought this Bill would have a rather quiet Second Reading and that the general principles would be discussed and possibly if fears were to be allayed&mdash;genuine fears&mdash;Section 16 could be analysed and parsed on Committee Stage. Apparently, that is not to be the case. Senator L'Estrange started off by talking about tranquillisers and pointing out the necessity for taking action to protect the public from themselves. He continued with that type of speech and I felt that I needed a tranquilliser.</P>

      <P>We have to be logical in this matter.  Either a Minister has <Col N="23" /> the right, the duty and responsibility of protecting the public from themselves or he has not.  We have got to be serious about this matter.  Is there a need for a Bill like this, or is there not?  In the opinion of the Government and the Minister for Health there is a need to make better provision for the control, sale, and distribution of substances that are poisonous and are in common use.  That is all the Bill proposes to do.  It is suggested that under Section 15 the Minister proposes to crucify the public and the farming community and the only advocate left for them is Senator L'Estrange.  That is the picture the Senator has painted but he has been so inconsistent that he appealed to the Minister to take power to deal with something which is not a deadly poison, something called a tranquilliser. Is the Senator logical in advocating the use of power in one matter and taking no power in another?</P>

The implication seems to be that certain poisonous substances, certain hormone weed killers, are going to be affected by regulations which will seriously affect the farming community. After suggesting that this is going to happen, Senator L'Estrange asks the Minister for an assurance that it will not happen.  To me, that is a political stunt.  I say there is no intention of doing that.  All the Minister proposes to do is to make better provision to safeguard the public in respect of the distribution and sale of these commodities. Senators realise that, but apparently think that it is fashionable <Col N="24" /> to raise the wind on an issue like this when there is nothing else.  Apparently the 1951 Budget is not cutting ice any more so they have got to think of something else.</P>

      <P>I claim that those who purport to speak for the farming community have not got the right. The majority of the farmers know that there is no intention of prejudicing their interests under this or any other Bill.  It is not proposed to hold them up to ransom either by chemists or veterinary surgeons.  It is untrue to suggest that the veterinary surgeon is not the friend of the farmer.  I say he is.  It is not true to say that he charges too much for drugs.  He does not. Any farmer can attempt to cure animals as long as he knows what is wrong with them.  The veterinary surgeon is the skilled man in deciding what is wrong with an animal.  It has been my experience, and the experience of many other farmers that when a farmer goes to a vet for a medicine, say, of the sulpha drug group, for injection, subcutaneously, the veterinary surgeon gives the medicine at a very low cost.  It is quite wrong to suggest, simply in the hope of creating a storm, that groups like chemists and veterinary surgeons are in a combine to mulct the farming community.  Because of the nature of trading in this country, we have many poisons being sold through chemists, seed-merchants and hardware stores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question remains: has the Minister for Health a right, responsibility or duty because of the multiplicity of such substances and the annual increase in such substances, to make better provision for the control, distribution, sale and use of these substances in the interests of the individual? This is the point which has been completely and deliberately ignored. If I can be contradicted by Senator Donegan or Senator L'Estrange, I shall be glad to hear them.  I am afraid this point has been deliberately ignored&mdash;the fundamental point that this Bill is framed with regard to responsibility for the health of the individual <Col N="25" /> person and not for the animal. That is why it is introduced by the Minister but this fundamental point has been, in my view, deliberately ignored in this debate.</P>
    <P>Since it is framed from that point, the Minister for Health has the responsibility and the duty.  Because he is making rather tame proposals and is taking as much power as will allow him to make better provision for the sale, distribution and use in the interests of the people, I think it is reasonable.  If he has not the right to do it in regard to poisonous substances, he should not have it in regard to those things referred to as tranquillisers.</P>

I am prepared to state there is no such intention at all either under Section 15 or under any other section of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Poisonous substances, their sale and distribution, should certainly be dealt with in a Bill such as this.  However, I say that the sale of drugs commonly used by the farming community should not be restricted by any Bill.  We have at the present time a number of poisons in every farm household and farmyard. There are weedkillers and fungicides, <Col N="26" /> gallons of which are lying around everywhere.  Sometimes if the weather is not favourable for putting them out, they are kept; and sometimes also you have to wait over until the following year.</P>
      <P>There are medicines and drugs used by the farmers in their everyday work. Of late years, a large number of farmers are able to inject their cattle and sheep with the various drugs.  They do that not once or twice but even three times a day.  At the moment the veterinary profession are very busily engaged on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Accordingly, they are not available at all times when the farmers need them.  Sometimes they might not be available for hours or even days. The position of the farmer in those circumstances can easily be appreciated. I would ask the Minister to be as lenient as possible and ensure that the farming community will be able to get the drugs they need from the sources from which they have got them all the time.  I have not heard any serious complaints about the use of those drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I like to be sympathetic with the point of view expressed by Senator O'Sullivan, that is to say, that no restriction should be imposed on the sale or distribution of any poisonous substance which might be used by a farmer&mdash;I do not think I am misrepresenting the Senator.  But think what that means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred in my opening speech to the Arsenic Act, 1851.  Arsenic is used by farmers, I think, to quite a considerable extent.  It is subject, however, to restrictions upon its sale, restrictions which were at one time regarded as fairly drastic.  Am I to repeal the Act of 1851 and abolish all restriction upon the sales of arsenic? The Act of 1851, as is well-known was not passed until it had been demonstrated that there was good ground for controlling the sale and distribution of that particular poisonous substance.  The new synthetic substances are much more virulent and much more venomous poisons are coming on the market almost daily. <Col N="27" /> Are we to say&mdash;whether they are tranquillisers or otherwise&mdash;that they are to be freely bought and sold, without any control or restriction whatever?  I think from the point of view of the protection and safeguading of human life&mdash;and surely we are going to put human beings above all the animals&mdash;it is essential, in the interests of the protection of the ordinary good citizen, that the sale and distribution of these substances should be controlled under the aegis of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>A very terrifying picture was painted by Senator L'Estrange as to what was to be the fate of the farmers under Section 15.  The Senator quoted liberally from a speech which I made elsewhere. I hope he will forgive me if I quote from the Bill now before the House and which he is supposed to have read.  There is not one word in Section 15 empowering the Minister for Agriculture, who is the Minister concerned, to prohibit or control the sale of poisons or particular poisons where they are used for agricultural or veterinary purposes.  There is not one word to that effect.  On the contrary, in paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of that section, there is an express prohibition against the making of any order or any regulation under that section to control the sale of poisons. Paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of section 15 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Provide for matters ancillary to the foregoing matters other than the prohibition or control of the sale of poison or particular poisons.</P>
    <P>The whole case which Senator L'Estrange has been making was based on the contrary assumption that under Section 15 power was given to control or prohibit the sale of poisons. There is not, as I have pointed out, one word to justify that assumption.</P>
    <P>Let us get back to the question of the regulation, control and use of poisons.  As Senator O'Donnabháin reminded the House, the purpose of this Bill is to safeguard the health of the people.  It is for the protection of the good citizen against the misuse of these poisonous substances.  It is not to <Col N="28" /> restrict their lawful use but to make certain that, if they are used, they will be used under conditions that will ensure there is no danger to the user, and that they are not used to the deteriment of the life or health of any individual including, of course, the person using them.</P>
    <P>Senator L'Estrange said that every drug may be a danger to human beings, if not properly handled.  I will not assent to such a sweeping statement as that.  I will say that in the case of drugs which might be a source of danger to the life of any person handling them, and that includes farmers, the regulations to be made under the Bill will lay down the safe method for using them and will ensure that they can be used without, as I said, detriment or danger to the person using them or to his neighbour, his neighbour's children, or even his neighbour's stock.  Is there anything unreasonable in saying that if the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;because it is the Minister for Agriculture who will be concerned in a matter of this sort&mdash; wants to do that, he should be given power and authority under the law to make the necessary regulations?</P>
    <P>In what I have said, I think I have dealt with the points raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington who feared that, under Section 15, there might be a possibility of restricting the sale of these substances to a too narrow channel.  Let me repeat that there is nothing in Section 15 empowering the Minister to make regulations prohibiting the sale of any poisonous substances.  I hope that any misunderstandings in relation to that matter have been dispelled.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan said that he trusted the Bill would be administered with consideration and not too rigorously. This is not an administrative Bill.  It is a Bill empowering the Minister to make regulations.  Naturally, he will have to decide for himself, first of all, whether the substance is at any stage of such a poisonous nature that its use and general distribution throughout society should be controlled.  That is the first thing he has to determine. The next thing is, of course, that if he comes to that decision, he may by <Col N="29" /> regulation declare it to be such.  The regulation is then subject to certain scrutiny.  Naturally, if he decides that the substance is poisonous and has to be regulated and controlled, he will by regulation prescribe the manner in which that control is to be exercised. Once he has done that, he has then to submit that draft regulation to the Council to be established under this Bill, a Council in which he must have confidence.</P>
    <P>This Council is not an elected body representative of any vested interest. That is the first thing about which I want the Seanad to be quite clear.  This body is not set up in order to give representation to any vested interest. It is set up to place at the disposal of the Minister the advice of people who are supposed to be particularly skilled &mdash;experts, so to speak&mdash;in the various aspects of the use, sale and distribution of these poisonous substances.  Nothing at that Council will be decided by vote. What the Council has to do is to bring its common wisdom to bear on the problems presented to it when the Minister submits the draft regulation. The Council must consider the draft regulation to see whether it requires to be amended in any way, and if the regulation would seem to make it unreasonably difficult to utilise that substance in industry, or in agriculture, or for medicinal purposes, a common agreement will be reached, having regard to all the difficulties, as to what is the best way to ensure that the substance, if used, will be used with the greatest degree of safety for all those who are likely to come in contact with it or require it.</P>
    <P>That is what the Council will do. Because there are so many representatives of the medical profession on it and so many representatives of the pharmaceutical society on it, that does not mean that they will be appointed to be members of that Council by the Minister in order to load the Council or give it a bias in any particular way. As we all know, in pharmacy, there are many special lines.  There is the pharmaceutical chemist who is engaged in the manufacture of drugs, and there is the pharmaceutical chemist who is engaged in the teaching of pharmacy, rather than in an active pursuit of <Col N="30" /> pharmacy as a method of earning his living.  The same applies to other types of persons who will be on the Council. The Council is being selected in order that these people may bring their particular degree of skill and knowledge and experience to the common service, so to speak, of the Comhairle as a whole, for the purpose of giving the Minister balanced criticism and balanced judgment upon any proposal he may submit to it.</P>
    <P>Moreover, if the Minister makes a regulation, that is not the last word. Every regulation to be made, whether under Section 14 or Section 15, must be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If any person thinks that a regulation which is proposed to be made under Section 15, for instance, is likely to be harsh and oppressive on those farmers who have to use the substance with which the regulation is concerned, then it is open to him, or to Senator L'Estrange, for instance, or to any person who feels called upon to protest on behalf of the farmers in relation to that regulation, to move in the Seanad or the Dáil, as the case may be, that the regulation be annulled.</P>
    <P>When a motion of that sort is made before either House, the Minister concerned must make the case for the regulation.  Now I submit that it is unlikely that the Minister for Agriculture would make any regulation in relation to any poison which would be harsh or oppressive, so far as the agricultural users of the substance are concerned.  Ministers for Agriculture always place the interests of the farmers first.  The Minister will have no concern with, no regard for, and no interest in any drug firm or any branch of the pharmaceutical or other profession engaged in the handling, or sale, or development of drugs. His concern will be the well-being of the farming community.</P>
    <P>My concern will be the well-being of human beings.  The concern of the Minister for Health will be the welfare and protection of the human beings who constitute our society.  The Minister for Health, whoever he may be, may feel called upon to make a regulation which, indirectly or at some distance removed, might hinder or hamper or inconvenience the farmers <Col N="31" /> in the pursuit of their avocation. That aspect of the proposed regulation, of course, will be discussed by the Council.  Again, those who have knowledge of farming&mdash;and they are not confined to those who derive their livelihood directly or principally from agriculture; there are many others who will be as concerned about the farmers' point of view as the farmers themselves&mdash;will be able to amend the regulation in such a way as to minimise to the utmost extent possible any inconvenience or hardship which may be imposed upon the farmer by any draft regulation.</P>
    <P>That is how I visualise this Council working.  As I say, the last word in the case of any regulation does not lie with the Minister.  It lies with both Houses who will have the right to examine and criticise any regulation which has been made and, if necessary, if their case is a sound one, they will undoubtedly be able to influence the Minister to amend it.  That is what the Bill proposes to do.  I think the fears which have been expressed by Senator L'Estrange, Senator Donegan and Senator O'Sullivan will, in fact, be found to be baseless.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy said we had many representatives upon this proposed council.  He said there would be representatives of various occupations and various skills but that no representation had been given to labour, <i>per se.</i> I do not think it is necessary.  There is not anything which particularly distinguishes a person who is a trade unionist from a person who happens to be in a position of doctor or farmer in a matter of this sort.  The purpose of these regulations is to protect every section and every element in the community, irrespective of their stated profession or occupation.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that the medical element on the Council, and with them everybody else on it, will be as concerned to ensure that wage earners, whether engaged in the drug trade or not, will not be put at undue risk by the use or employment of any poisonous substance.  It can be taken that among those who may be nominated as <Col N="32" /> coming within the last category, that is, of persons who do not possess the special knowledge and skills which are prescribed to be possessed by any of those coming within the more specific other categories will include&mdash;it may be taken as almost axiomatic&mdash;a person who will be engaged in the handling of these drugs in the course of his ordinary occupation.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole asked why I do not allow the Pharmaceutical Society or the College of Physicians to make their own nominations.  I do not do so for the reason I have mentioned.  This is not a body which will be representative of any vested interest.  It is a body set up to advise the Minister.  The Minister must be free to select his own advisers, provided they fulfil certain qualifications.</P>

      <P>Orders made by the Government under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, must be confirmed by the Oireachtas in the calendar year following that in which they are made.  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm thirteen Orders made under the Act during the year 1960.</P>
      <P>Six of the Orders afforded new protection. Five others amended existing duties where experience had shown that these duties were not adequate because of increasingly severe competition from imports.  Two further Orders were made because the existing duties were being evaded.</P>
      <P>An explanatory memorandum on the Bill has been circulated to Senators.  I shall, of course, be willing to give any further information or answer any questions which Senators wish to ask about the Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very common type of Bill.  It is a Bill which, of its very nature, has to be passed.  It is the confirming, as the Minister explained very clearly, of certain Orders relating to tariffs made within the past 12 months.  It contains a confirmation of a variety of tariffs of a heterogeneous character from toy balloons and structural iron down to certain types of socks.  I do not propose to say anything on the details but I want to refer to one general point.</P>
      <P>We seem to be on the verge of very serious changes in the economic organisation of Western Europe, including these islands.  Those changes will certainly involve free trade, or conditions approaching to free trade, in industrial products over the whole area now comprising the countries of the &ldquo;Inner Six&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Outer Seven.&rdquo; We are in the process of adding, constantly and steadily, to our duties.  Six of the Orders made in this Bill afford new protection to articles of manufacture which were never protected before. Five others increase the duties.</P>
      <P>In the state of affairs where it would appear that free trade will be the order of the day, whether we like it or not, it seems extraordinary that we should do that.  The present Minister and several of his predecessors and the members of the present Government have been urging industrialists to prepare for conditions of more severe competition.  While that is our general principle, we have in detail and in particular, been adding to individual tariffs.  That does not seem to be a method which would appear to make people happy about the competitive efficiency of our factories or their future in the conditions which seem to be in store for us.  How is it we combine this kind of Bill with an expectation of conditions such as the Minister himself, as well as others, has constantly placed before us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say I find this Bill extremely disappointing for reasons that have been adumbrated by Senator Hayes. I find it very disappointing that there is not a single one of these Orders we are now asked to confirm that reduces <Col N="34" /> a duty or that abolishes a duty.  Every single one of them, as the Minister has been at pains to explain, results in increasing or tightening-up the protective mechanism which these duties represent.</P>
      <P>On many occasions we have heard the Taoiseach speaking in the Dáil and outside.  I remember at least two occasions during the lifetime of the present Government when he was extremely outspoken in warning the industrialists of the country that they must make themselves more efficient, that they must cease to be so dependent upon protection.  He warned them that unless they increased their efficiency and, by dint of their own efforts, made themselves at least more independent of protective measures these would be withdrawn.  That kind of speech whether made at a chamber of commerce lunch or at a Fianna Fáil meeting or in the Dáil gets column after column of publicity.</P>
      <P>People then feel that there is a wind of change.  They feel that the new Government mean business.  They feel that the inefficient industrialists who have been oversheltered and overprotected up to now will at last understand that the Government mean business.  You wait until the next imposition of duties comes in and you expect to find that the duties on certain long established industries have been either reduced or abolished.  In fact, of course, what we find is that, so far as we can judge from this Bill, and from the action of the Government since it has been in power, the Government has no intention at all of implementing the threats or promises of the Taoiseach on such occasions.</P>
      <P>I can recall complaining, in the lifetime of the previous Government, that in a Bill of this kind only three or four of the orders referred to reductions or abolitions of duties.  Now I find that none at all refer to abolitions or reductions and that the trend is all the other way.  I cannot help underlining the fact that there is the sharpest possible contrast between the practice of the Government in this regard and the public statements, which apparently are for the purpose of tranquillising public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> Senator Hayes has expressed surprise that these duties should apparently go up at the very time when we also hear publicly that we may very soon be asked to join the European Common Market or the Free Trade Area.  He puts the question with his customary innocence as to how that may be, that we are increasing tariffs and protection at the very time when we may be asked to go into the Common Market or the Free Trade Area. Of course part of the reason should be obvious.  When a large retail trader intends to hold what he calls a record-breaking sale, slashing all the prices, cutting them down, he takes the preliminary precaution first of putting prices up, so that he will be able then apparenty to slash them and to take off 20 per cent. here and 30 per cent. there.  Not all retailers do that, but, shall we say, it is not unknown for it to happen.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is the type of fraud we are now practising on a national scale, in order to be able to say when we join the Free Trade Area or the European Common Market &ldquo;Very well, we are prepared for the first ten years&rdquo;&mdash;or whatever the period is &mdash;&ldquo;to reduce our tariff wall by ten per cent. or 20 per cent.&rdquo;  Over a long period of years we will be gradually reducing the wall which we are now building higher and higher, in order that when we take a few stones off the top we will be able apparently to fulfil any commitments while really maintaining the precise degree of protection which our industries have been enjoying for many years.  I am afraid I regard that as, and I use the word advisedly, dishonest in practice, because I feel that at the moment when we feel that very soon we will be asked to reduce our tariff walls, preliminary to that we should not be raising them higher and higher, up to 75 per cent. in many cases.</P>
    <P>I said before, and it has been said by other Senators and by Deputies, that in a country like Ireland I can see real justification for protective tariffs to enable industries to get going. There is no doubt about it that it would be unfair to expect industries in a small country like this to produce <Col N="36" /> competitively at once in the face of world competition.  Consequently a degree of protection for certain selected and justified industries is warranted. What I cannot see is why the same degree of protection considered necessary in the launching years should continue to be necessary for the rest of the lifetime of the industries, if it is true, as I think it is true, that the initial years are the most difficult ones for industries launched in a country like this.  The first five or ten years are the years during which the exploration of markets is necessary, the opening of new fields, the acquiring of extra skill in production, distribution, and so on.  During all that period the cost of production will be at least marginally higher than it will be when that industry has increased efficiency as it must do, if it is worth its salt, in the first five or ten years.  That being so it seems monstrous and indefensible that the same industry having all that experience, and the chance to be so protected, should take or be given precisely the same percentage protection year after year, five years after they have started, ten years after they have started, or 15 years after they have started, with no indication by the Minister&mdash;who is here today to give us his point of view on that&mdash;in terms of the present Bill that he has the slightest intention in regard to any one of these industries to reduce the protective barrier by as much as half of one per cent.</P>
    <P>I read an interesting article the other day in that lively magazine <i>Development.</i> It was an interview with Mr. J.J. Quinn who is outstanding in the field of distribution in the grocery trade in Ireland and in Dublin in particular. He is the head of H.W. Williams, the self-service grocers, an extremely competent businessman with intiative and enterprise, and who is not content with the old humdrum methods.  He is a man who has built up an immensely thriving concern on new methods. He is quoted as saying in <i>Development</i> that we in this country are in danger owing to the present policy&mdash;the policy I have been criticising&mdash;of overprotecting our industrialists, and in danger of &ldquo;being protected from the <Col N="37" /> need to be efficient.&rdquo;  Protected from the need to be efficient&mdash;that is the basis of the charge I would level against the Government on the head of this Bill.  This Bill continues the old process, in direct contradiction of oft-stated Government policy, of overprotecting industries and protecting them from the need to be efficient. Mr. Quinn knows what he is talking about.  He himself has in the past had experience of restrictive practices in the grocery trade.  I can remember when the Irish Housewives' Association interviewed him in regard to his self-service grocery.  The organisation of RGDATA was then insisting that he sell at the restricted resale price maintenance level.  He has had experience, in other words, of being over &ldquo;protected,&rdquo; over protected in this case from within the trade, so he knows what he is talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the point has been established and I do not intend to press it further.  Mr. Quinn was speaking, as I say, with experience, and what he says is surely true.  I do not think anybody here is in favour of giving that immense measure of protection to our industries, however much we may favour the industries themselves, because they are in danger of being protected against the need to be efficient, which means being protected into a state of inefficiency extremely detrimental to the country when the time comes for the Government to <Col N="38" /> decide that these duties, in accordance with international agreements, must be reduced.</P>
      <P>That is why I find this Bill particularly disappointing.  After three or four years of office by the present Government, and after the very menacing speeches made by the Taoiseach and others in relation to this whole matter of protective tariffs and so on, I would have expected that at least one tariff would be at least marginally reduced. Yet the Minister says that six of them are new, five are to amend, that means to increase tariffs, and two of them are to tighten up and meet evasion.  I find that profoundly disappointing.  I take it that we shall have to wait until next year&mdash;I hope not beyond that&mdash; to find an Imposition of Duties Bill being brought in which will do what the Government have been loudly proclaiming they are going to do, reduce the protective tariff wall.</P>
      <P>It should be quite possible for all of these industries which have got going to keep going with at least a smaller percentage than was necessary when they started out.</P>
      <P>I should now like to look at the items themselves.  I do not want to weary the Seanad by running down the whole thirteen items but I should like to look at one or two of them.  I should like to take, first of all, a minor point and compare the Imposition of Duties (No. 87) Order with No. 97.</P>
      <P>The Imposition of Duties (No. 87) Order is the wool wadding order.  It came into operation on the 11th March, 1960.  It extended the scope of the customs duty of 50 per cent. full, and 33 1/3 per cent. preferential, on wadding made wholly or partly of cotton wool or imitation cotton wool to include wadding made wholly or partly of wool.  It also brought within the scope of the duty certain articles made wholly or mainly of such wadding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find that the Imposition of Duties (No. 97) (Wadding) Order came into operation on the 6th September, 1960. It amends the conditions that are related apparently to Order No. 87, because it introduces in relation to the <Col N="39" /> customs duty previously mentioned of 50 per cent. full, and 33 1/3 per cent. preferential on wadding made wholly or partly of wool a minimum rate of 9d. full, and 6d. preferential.</P>
    <P>I feel that within 6 months it ought not be necessary to make this kind of amending Order.  It looks to me as if the first Order was drafted without sufficient attention to the conditions obtaining.  I do not think it should be necessary within the same year to fiddle with these Orders, piling one on top of the other and amending one order and introducing another both of them having to be confirmed on the same day by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I turn now to Order No. 88 which is an Order that extends the scope of the customs duty of 75 per cent., full, and 50 per cent. for the United Kingdom and Canada on certain electrical accessories to include certain switches, sockets and plugs.  I make the point here that this is a very high duty, 75 per cent. full and 50 per cent.  United Kingdom and Canada, on items of everyday use, domestic and otherwise.  I feel that this is an example of an order where the duty is too high.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in regard to the following Order, No. 90, which amends the customs duty of 75 per cent., full, and 50 per cent.  United Kingdom and Canada in order to provide for a minimum rate of duty, this is on certain hats and caps for wear by women or girls, of 15/-, full, and 10/-, United Kingdom and Canada.  What I am criticising here is the level of protective duty considered necessary and which is far too high.  I beg leave to doubt whether the trade requires such a high measure of protection.</P>
    <P>I should also like to advert to Order No. 98 which refers to structural iron and steel manufactures and extends the scope of the customs duty of 50 per cent. full and 33? per cent. United Kingdom and Canada on certain articles of fabricated structural iron or steel to certain additional articles including assemblies.</P>
    <P>I would suggest&mdash;I am open to correction on the matter&mdash;that this is a <Col N="40" /> duty and an extended scope which affect very much the agricultural community. I would suggest that in relation to a great deal of agricultural buildings and sheds, this is almost a punitive duty, a protective duty which raises the price of production for the whole agricultural community.  I should like to hear from Senators representing agriculture some kind of protest against this measure of protection which seems to be unwarranted.</P>
    <P>The last Order, which is No. 99, relates to socks and similar articles of man-made fibres.  It amended the customs duty of 75 per cent., full, which was not apparently enough, and 50 per cent.  United Kingdom and Canada and provides for a minimum rate of 50/-, full, and 33s. 4d.  United Kingdom and Canada per dozen pairs of these articles.  Again it makes sure that where the imported article, whether it be from the United Kingdom or further afield, is cheap we shall ensure that the retail price here is kept sufficiently high to over-protect our home industries, and hit our consumers.</P>
    <P>I will conclude, therefore, by stressing again the point that if a new Irish industry is unable to do with less protection after 5 years than was necessary for it in the launching years, then either it has made no progress at all in efficiency or else excessive profits to the firm are being subsidised by the consuming public, who are prevented by such protective duties as are enshrined in this Bill from buying competitively elsewhere.  For these reasons I find this Bill profoundly disappointing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me deal first with what Senator Hayes suggested, that it was rather strange in times of free trade we should now be introducing new tariffs.  I should like to point out to the Senator that, as announced in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> the policy in relation to tariffs is, and henceforth will be, that tariffs will be imposed only where it is reasonably anticipated that the industries they are designed to protect will survive after a reasonable period without protection. That is an over-riding principle in the <Col N="41" /> imposition of tariffs at the present time and will continue to be so.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington in his able way has given only half the story. I am sure he knows as well as I do the other half.  He is a man who reads much about Government administration and he must know that there is at the present time a selection of tariff reviews in progress which are provided for in the Trade Agreement with Britain.  Three lists of commodities have been selected comprising five or six in each list which are under active review by the Industrial Development Authority, which is the reviewing body. In future, the British Government, the Board of Trade and the manufacturers they represent will be entitled to submit periodically such lists which the I.D.A. will have to review, having taken all the circumstances into account.  I might also mention that in the context of this Free Trade Area talk, it is accepted that countries such as ours which are considered to be in the course of industrial development will be given, in any organisation they will join, either the Free Trade Area or any other economic organisation, a period longer than the developed countries to reduce and ultimately eliminate tariffs.  I should mention also that even these countries that are in these organisations, the Common Market and the Free Trade Association, have tariffs and protective tariffs, some of which are higher than those operating here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reject completely the implication and indeed the stated opinion of Senator Sheehy Skeffington that this is being done deliberately to build a sufficiently high wall to give us a longer time to dismantle these tariffs. That is the kind of economic sniping that I abhor.  I want to tell Senator Sheehy Skeffington that our reputation internationally, whether in political or in economic organisations, stands so high that on any occasion on which Ireland or Irish representatives give undertakings in these organisations, they were honoured to the extent that there is wide acceptance of any such undertakings or commitments given by Irish representatives in <Col N="42" /> all these organisations and no amount of sniping or these allegations of fraud and dishonesty will break that reputation. I can assure Senator Sheehy Skeffington of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The half facts given by the Senator half speak for the type of argument he is trying to make.  If the Senator with his usual assiduity looks through the list quoted from, he will see that there is a reduction in the duty on watches from 60 to 30 per cent.  The Senator comes in making an argument which is against the facts as I have just demonstrated here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, too, that in respect of some of these tariffs imposed, and I have to refer in particular to socks, the imports which that tariff was designed against were imports from the Far East from which vast quantities of cheap socks were being imported at prices which were even lower than the manufactured price in this country.  There was also a case in which hats and caps were concerned in which the tariff was imposed designed specifically against the dumping of surplus stocks from other countries into this country.</P>
      <P>If the Senator took care to examine more carefully rather than to examine for the purpose of criticising and making allegations of fraudulence and dishonesty, and took sufficient care to present the facts in a truer light, the lash of his tongue would not have been so violent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there are any other items in particular or in general to refer to, except to say that although there are 13 items on this list, two of them refer to the same commodity.  The duty on wadding was originally imposed on wool wadding, and ultimately it was seen that all kinds of inferior stuff were being passed off as wool wadding and imported here, and the order, to be effective, required amendment.  That list of 13 is much smaller than the list <Col N="43" /> last year, and is one of the smallest ever presented to the House.</P>
    <P>I should like also to remind the Seanad that only those applications in respect of which orders were made are before the House.  No reference is made to the many applications that come before my Department and are rejected by my Department without presentation to the Government or are rejected by the Government.  To suggest or imply that these tariffs are being imposed only to protect inefficient operation is completely unfounded.  Now that the Minister for Finance has perhaps finished his Budget speech, I may be permitted to quote very shortly from it in reference to that part of his speech which dealt with the increase in our exports, industrial exports in particular. He said:</P>
    <P>A number of the new industries established in recent years helped in this expansion.  The major part, however, was played by older firms, built up initially with the help of protection on the home market and in many cases using domestic raw materials.  Those manufacturers who have shown enterprise and initiative in developing an export trade deserve every commendation.  We look forward to more of our industrialists following their example.</P>
    <P>It is because I anticipate that industrialists who apply for these tariffs will follow that example that I make this proposition now to the House to give a Second Reading to the Bill which proposes the list of tariffs set out in the explanatory memorandum.</P>

      <P>This is the section which aims to confirm these orders.  I should like to ask the Minister, <Col N="44" /> who has just told us in his reply that the Government are convinced that a large majority of these industries, &ldquo;after a reasonable period,&rdquo; will be capable of &ldquo;surviving without protection,&rdquo; how soon does he think any one of them will be capable of surviving with a reduced tariff?  I made a mistake and I apologise for it in relation to one out of the 13.  There is in the case of watch parts a reduction in the tariff, but I feel that the burden of my case remains unanswered, and although the Minister tells us he is confident that, after a reasonable period, it will be possible for them to survive without tariffs, he does not in fact implement his belief by reducing more than one of them.  All those which we are asked to confirm, with one exception, are increases or tightening up.</P>
      <P>I should also like to ask the Minister how soon he thinks that we will have practical results from the review which he says many of these tariffs are undergoing.  He seems to consider that the Seanad should be quite happy to give confirming orders increasing tariffs because they should be happy in the belief that certain tariffs are &ldquo;under active review&rdquo;.  It is said that when a civil servant tells you: &ldquo;We are considering your letter,&rdquo; it means &ldquo;We are looking for your letter,&rdquo; and that when he says: &ldquo;Your letter is under active consideration,&rdquo; it means &ldquo;We have found your letter.&rdquo;  I feel that the Minister ought to add more grounds than just to tell us that these tariffs are under active review, because I remember the Minister before him, and the Minister himself, I believe, last year, telling us precisely the same thing. However, the record will show the facts.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied simply to pass this subsection confirming all these Orders holus-bolus, and to be told everything is all right because some of these tariffs are under review.  I should like to ask the Minister: how soon does he think practical results will derive from such reviewing?</P>

      <P>Reviews in respect of tariffs normally take some months&mdash; possibly six months&mdash;because application <Col N="45" /> is made through the Board of Trade to the Department of Industry and Commerce and passed on to the Industrial Development Authority.  The I.D.A. have to consult the trade interests in Britain who seek the review, as well as the trade interests in Ireland who might be affected by the review.</P>
      <P>The first list has been under consideration for something short of six months.  I expect the results will be published very shortly.  I cannot say exactly when, because there are many factors which have to be taken into account, such as the necessity for giving an opportunity to all affected parties, whether prospective importers or protected industrialists, to make their case.  As I say, the result of the first review will be announced and published shortly and, in the meantime, the second list of commodities is being processed.  A third list is already being prepared and the necessary notices requiring submissions to be made to the I.D.A. if not already sent out, will be sent out shortly.</P>
      <P>In the case of any of the 13 Orders now proposed, I cannot say exactly when the industries concerned will be in a position to reduce protection or proceed without any protection, but I can assure the Seanad that through the machinery which is now for the first time in active operation, the system of review by the I.D.A., and the necessity in any event for these industries to make themselves competitive if they are to survive in the climate of a free trade area, or whatever form of trade association we may find ourselves in, in their own interests they will have to reduce the necessity for tariffs which means, in effect, making themselves more efficient or else cease existing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes remarked that the Taoiseach and I and other Ministers have been exhorting industrialists generally and producers of all descriptions to improve their methods.  We shall continue to do so and not only to exhort them verbally but through technical assistance grants and otherwise in order that they will bring themselves to the point of increased <Col N="46" /> efficiency and, therefore, to the point of no longer requiring protection.</P>
    <P>The specific answer I can give to Senator Sheehy Skeffington is, as I have said, that reviews are actively taking place and will continue to take place. The first results will be published in a short time.  So far as the 13 Orders now before us are concerned, I cannot say exactly when they will be reviewed. I am satisfied that there is a prospect in a reasonable time of their not requiring protection.  In some cases, by reason of the type of business with which they have to contend, the protective tariffs are necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister has answered me satisfactorily on the question of how soon one can expect results from the first list.  I am disappointed that it is only in the last six months reviews have taken place.  I seem to remember that four years ago the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Norton, said that many industries were already under review.  However, I am prepared to accept that there are two lists and a third coming. I accept the Minister's promise that early action may be anticipated.</P>
      <P>I also accept that the Minister is serious when he says that many industries should be able to survive after a reasonable period without any protection, but I should like to ask him has he considered the possibility of a progressive reduction in the percentage duty applied.  After all, if a duty of 75 per cent. is necessary in the early stages, it should not be too much to expect that it should be somewhat reduced, and that some day we will be able to abolish it altogether.</P>
      <P>It does not seem to be an entirely satisfactory answer to this question: after years of practice, after years of learning and efficiency, why do you not progressively reduce the tariffs? If these industries will be able, some day, to do without protection altogether, they should be able to survive now with reduced tariff protection.  I should like, therefore, to ask the Minister has he thought at all of progressively reducing these protective duties.</P>

      <P>At the moment there is no suggestion that these duties will be progressively reduced.  They will have to be progressively reduced, if and when we become a member of a trade group which will require such reduction.  In the meantime, any reduction that will take place, will take place as a result of the I.D.A. reviews and not as a result of an examination of each particular case, not so much to secure a mathematical reduction as to secure a reduction commensurate with the amount of protection such an industry ought to receive, and the amount of reasonable competition that must be afforded to the British concerns in particular under the trade agreement.</P>
      <P>At this stage, I must say there is no question of a progressive reduction, unless and until such time as we will be required to do so in the context of a trade agreement.  In the meantime, each reduction will be an <i>ad hoc</i> one and will be sufficient to allow competition from the other side and, at the same time, give reasonable protection to the industry affected.  Under any trade agreement we join, of course, the ultimate aim would be to eliminate altogether any tariffs that exist at the time of our accession to any of these trade blocs.</P>

      <P>At this stage may I correct something which I said in error a few minutes ago.  I said that the reviews now taking place under the I.D.A. were the first reviews to be conducted. I have been told since I said that, that reviews were held some years ago by the Prices Advisory Body which was the reviewing body before the establishment of the I.D.A..  Those reviews were carried out without a specific request from the British.  They are now <Col N="48" /> carried out as a result of requests by the British, which was provided for under the recent trade agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has a twofold object.  Firstly, it proposes to continue in existence the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland (called the Board) and to consolidate and amend the statutory provisions, dating back over one hundred years, that govern their powers and functions. Secondly, the Bill proposes to make certain substantial amendments in the general law of charities.</P>
      <P>The present Board owe their origin to the Charitable Donations and Bequests (Ireland) Act, 1844.  They are the successors of an old Board who were established by an Act passed in the final year of the old Irish Parliament. Prior to the Union, a Committee, assisted by two judges, had been appointed by the Irish House of Lords in 1764 to sue for the recovery of charitable bequests and donations &lsquo;withheld, embezzled and concealed.&rsquo; This Committee was discontinued by the establishment of the first Board of Commissioners in 1800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main functions of the Charity Commissioners are of an administrative character.  They have power to dispense with the publication of charitable bequests, power to advise charity trustees, power to institute legal proceedings and to certify cases to the Attorney General with a view to his instituting such proceedings, power to frame <i>cy-près</i> schemes, and power to accept gifts for charitable purposes. The Commissioners have had a long and distinguished history, and a record of devotion to public duty of which they may well be proud.  They are an unpaid body and devote a considerable portion of their time to the important and responsible duties imposed on them by statute.  They are a Board with invaluable experience and of outstanding ability.  They have over the <Col N="49" /> years set a fine example of the way in which Irishmen of different religious persuasions can work together for the public good.  Their tasks are often, in the scheme of things, of a delicate nature, but this has never prevented them from serving the community in a way that leaves us very much in their debt.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill sets out the constitution and jurisdiction of the Board. As at present, there will be eleven Commissioners, but they will be appointed without regard to religious belief.  The Board will select their own Chairman; and at a meeting of the Board, where the Chairman is absent, the senior member, or such other member as the Board may decide on at the meeting, will preside.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Bill will replace the Charitable Donations and Bequests (Amendment) Act, 1955, and give the Board <i>cy-près</i> powers for any gift up to £5,000 in value.  The Board will be able to revoke an existing <i>cy-près</i> scheme, whether made by themselves or by the court, and substitute a new <i>cy-près</i> scheme in its place.  I shall examine the <i>cy-près</i> doctrine more fully later on.  For the moment, I propose to confine myself to giving a simple example of circumstances in which a <i>cyprès</i> scheme is necessary.  Suppose a person leaves by will money to build a church in a particular district and it is found on his death that a church has already been built.  The money will be applied <i>cy-près</i> for the repair and upkeep of that church.  The term <i>cy-près</i> comes from the French, and, though there is some doubt as to its precise original meaning, by professional usage it now means &ldquo;as near as possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;as near to it as possible.&rdquo;  In other words, the gift is applied as closely as possible to the intentions of the donor or testator, where those intentions cannot otherwise be carried out.  The idea is to prevent the charitable purpose of the donor or testator being frustrated.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill contains three important provisions dealing with the powers of the Commissioners that will be new to the law.  They are section 30, providing for educational endowment <Col N="50" /> schemes, section 32, providing for the investment of charity funds, and section 43, providing for the appointment of new trustees.</P>
    <P>There is serious doubt in regard to the extent of the Board's powers to amend schemes under the Educational Endowments (Ireland) Act, 1885.  The schemes concerned are schemes for the future management of educational endowments, of which there are a fair number in the country.  An example of the type of alteration needed in a scheme would be the following.  The governors of a school might, owing to lack of pupils, wish to dispose of the school premises and apply the moneys towards the grant of scholarships to other schools.  It is proposed in section 30 to make it clear that the Charity Commissioners will be able to make any alterations in a scheme, framed under the 1885 Act, provided the alterations are in furtherance of education and not contrary to anything contained in the 1885 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 32 will allow the Board to invest charity funds held by them in such manner as they think proper; and they will also be able to permit ordinary charity trustees to do likewise. Subsection (3) of section 32 lists the investments in which such funds may be invested.  They are (1) investments authorised by the trust instrument or by the Trustees (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, (2) investments in Irish industrial securities, and (3) investments in the purchase of freehold or leasehold land in the State. The Board or a Court may not authorise the investment of charity funds outside these three categories. Section 32 deals with every kind of charitable trust including trusts set up under statute or charter.  This means that it will in future be unnecessary for any trust, such as the Iveagh Trust, to go to the expense of promoting a Private Bill in order to change its powers of investment.  A simple application to the Board will suffice.</P>
    <P>Section 43 proposes to authorise the Board to appoint new trustees of a charity wherever such appointment is necessary.  It will be possible to appoint such trustees either to fill up <Col N="51" /> the original number, or to replace an existing trustee or trustees, or to deal with the case where there are no trustees or they cannot be found.  The section will also cure a defect in the Trustee Act, 1893, by allowing for the replacement of two or more trustees by a body corporate so as to discharge all the existing trustees.  Where charity funds are vested in two or more trustees, it is often better from the point of view of the charity to allow the trustees to be discharged in order that a body corporate may act.  There are at the moment a number of cases where charity trustees want to be relieved so that they can hand over to bodies corporate.  The House will note that, under subsection (1) of section 43, the Board may act on the application of the trustee or trustees of the charity, or, if there are no trustees, on the application of an interested person. They may also, in any case, act of their own motion; but it is envisaged that normally they will act on an application. It is to draw specific attention to this that the subsection has been drafted in its present form.</P>
    <P>So much for the constitution and jurisdiction of the Board.  I now come to the final part of the Bill, namely, Part III, which proposes certain very important amendments in the law of charities.</P>
    <P>Section 45 is designed to avoid difficulties that can and do arise in regard to what are known as Foundation Masses, namely, Masses to be celebrated in perpetuity or over long periods.  Recently the Canon Law on the subject has been altered.  In order to avoid risk and uncertainty in the fulfilling of perpetual obligations, it has been decreed that future Foundations of Masses are to be so understood that the Masses will be celebrated for fifty years from the date of the Foundation unless the founder has determined a shorter period.  At the end of fifty years the capital and income still remaining are to be applied for the celebration of Manual Masses for the founder's intentions.  Since the celebrated decision of the old Irish Court of Appeal in <i>O'Hanlon v. Logue</i> (1906) gifts for Masses are charitable, <Col N="52" /> so that the rule against perpetuities does not apply.  Under the section, gifts for Masses in perpetuity or for a period of more than fifty years will be construed and have effect as if the gift provided for the celebration of the Masses for a period of fifty years, and thereafter for the celebration of Masses during such period and on such conditions as shall be determined by the person to whom the gift is given, or his successor in title.  Where the gift is administered by the Board, the remaining capital and income at the end of the fifty years will become vested in the Archbishop or Bishop of the diocese or in the major superior of the religious order as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Section 45 will prevent the frustration of the intentions of donors and testators as gifts for Foundation Masses are not acceptable except in accordance with Canon Law.  In effect what is proposed is the application of the <i>cy-près</i> principle to the gifts in question.  If there is a gift or bequest for Foundation Masses, the direction of the donor or testator will be given effect to in the manner that is practicable and possible.  That is what <i>cy-près</i> means.  For section 45 to apply, the gift must take effect after the commencement of the Act.  It will not apply retrospectively.</P>
    <P>Section 46 is concerned with gifts for the advancement of religion.  The section proposes that, in the case of such gifts, public benefit is to be conclusively presumed.  The idea is that it will in future be no longer necessary to prove that gifts that are for the advancement of religion are valid both at common law and because they contain the element of public benefit. Validity at common law will suffice, as the late Judge Gavan Duffy held it does in <i>Maguire's Case</i>, reported in the 1943 Irish Reports.  This case was followed by the late Judge Dixon in <i>In re Sheridan</i>, reported in 1957.  Apart from these two cases, there is the excellent article, <i>Public Benefit and Religious Trusts</i>, in the July, 1946, issue of the Law Quarterly Review. The author, Professor Newark of the Queen's University of Belfast, shows <Col N="53" /> how the insistence on the requirement of public benefit in religious trusts is unsound historically.  Moreover, such insistence in the past has, the Professor points out, led the Courts to search for and to pretend to find a public benefit in the form of spiritual advantages which are not properly cognisable in a court of law.  The section will ensure that the Irish Statute of Pious Uses, 1634, to which the trouble in this country in regard to public benefit traces its origin, will be placed in its proper historical perspective.  That Act, as Judge Gavan Duffy stressed, neither codified the law nor superseded the common law of pious uses.  Though the 1634 Act was repealed in full as long ago as 1879 it has, like its English counterpart of 1601, been too often regarded as the <i>fons et origo</i> of charity law, which it is not.</P>
    <P>Section 47 will allow for the pooling of investments of charity funds.  The High Court or the Board will, on the application of any two or more charities, be able to make schemes to establish common investment funds. Where a trust fund is small, it is not practical business for the trustees to obtain a wide spread of investment for the simple reason that the amount of work and expense involved are out of proportion to any increase in income that would result.  However, if trust funds could be combined for investment purposes, a better range would be available; and each individual trust would fare better.  The intention is to have a number of common investment funds established by schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 48 will codify the existing law as to the <i>cy-près</i> application of charity funds, and also amend that law. <i>Cy-près</i> schemes are made by the High Court or the Board where there is a general charitable intention and it is found unlawful, impracticable or impossible to carry out the direction of the donor.  I have earlier given the example of money left for the building of a church that has already been built. The existing law is defective in certain respects and these defects will be remedied by Section 48.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) sets out the circumstances <Col N="54" /> in which the original purposes of a charitable gift may be altered to allow for <i>cy-près</i> application.  Paragraphs (a) and (b) codify the existing law.  Paragraph (c) relaxes the old rule requiring impossibility or impractibility and will allow conjunction of funds not only where that is the only possible or practical method of proceeding, but also where it is a more effective method of proceeding, though continuation in isolation be possible.  Under existing law, there is no jurisdiction to direct a <i>cy-près</i> scheme where the mode of application specified by the testator is inexpedient or even harmful.  If the charity can be administered according to the directions of the founder, it must be so administered.  Paragraph <i>(d)</i> is designed to cover the case where the charitable purposes of a gift apply in respect of an area that has ceased to be a unit for some other purposes. For instance, the gift might be for the poor of a particular local government area that has been abolished and replaced by another area.  The paragraph will also allow for <i>cy-près</i> application where the gift is for an area or class of persons that has ceased to be suitable or practicable.  Thus, &ldquo;unsuitability&rdquo; is being substituted as the test instead of &ldquo;impossibility&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph <i>(e)</i> will permit <i>cy-près</i> application where there is adequate alternative provision, where the gift is for what has become an illegal or useless object, or where the original purposes have, in any other way, ceased to be a suitable or effective method of using the property.  It is only in the case of an illegal or useless charity that the existing law allows <i>cy-près</i> application.</P>
    <P>The object of subsection (2) is to make it clear that, before there is a <i>cy-près</i> application, the requisite condition (apart from failure of purposes) of general charitable intent must be fulfilled.  Subsection (3) reproduces the existing law by providing that original purposes shall include alterations by scheme.  <i>Cy-près</i> schemes are inherently subject to future schemes, and a <i>cyprès</i> scheme can fail, in the same way as the settlor's original scheme can fail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> Subsection (4) will impose on charity trustees a duty to keep their trusts effective by having the property applied <i>cy-près</i>.  Trustees are legally bound to carry out their trust, and it is only reasonable that this obligation should include the duty of making a <i>cy-près</i> application, where that is necessary to give effect to the general charitable intention of the settlor.</P>
    <P>So much for Section 48, which will apply to property given for charitable purposes, notwithstanding that it was given before the commencement of the proposed Act.  Section 49 proposes to make property, that would not be applicable <i>cy-près</i> in the ordinary way, so applicable where the property would be the subject of a resulting trust in favour of the donors.  The section will apply both to property given for specific charitable purposes and also to property given for specific non-charitable purposes.  The necessity for the section arises because of difficulties which arise where anonymous and untraceable donations are given for a charitable or non-charitable purpose that fails.  A usual type of case is that where money is subscribed through the medium of the collection box.  Perhaps I should make it clear that Section 49 covers <i>cy-près</i> schemes where Section 48 does not apply.  The latter section applies only where there is a general charitable intent or an out-and-out gift, and it is, of course, confined to charitable gifts.  Where property is given for specific charitable purposes and does not exceed £1,000 in value, the Charity Commissioners will have jurisdiction to frame a scheme under Section 49. Their jurisdiction in regard to ordinary <i>cy-près</i> schemes under Section 48 extends to property up to £5,000 in value. This is by reason of Section 29.  I might mention that, prior to 1844, the predecessors of the present Commissioners had unlimited <i>cy-près</i> powers.</P>
    <P>Section 50 will provide for mixed trusts.  Where a gift includes both charitable and non-charitable objects, it will be so construed and given effect to as to exclude the non-charitable objects.  Accordingly, the property will <Col N="56" /> be applied to the charitable objects alone.  The Section is designed to apply to two types of case.  First of all, it will apply to an imperfect trust provision that causes the gift to fail completely. The common example is a gift for &ldquo;charitable or benevolent&rdquo; purposes. Where a trustee has an absolute power of selection between the purposes, the gift fails.  In the English case of Diplock in 1944, a testator left the residue of his estate &ldquo;for such charitable or benevolent object or objects&rdquo; as his trustees or executors should in their absolute discretion select.  It was held, following a number of previous decisions, that the gift was void for uncertainty.  Such a gift will in future be a valid charitable gift because of the provisions of Section 50.  Secondly, the Section will apply to a gift that fails as a charitable gift but not as an ordinary gift. For instance, a gift to the College of Surgeons was in 1918 held to be a valid ordinary gift but not a valid charitable gift.  The reason was that the College had two main objects, one charitable and the other non-charitable. Similarly, in a High Court case in 1945 a gift to the Carmelite Order was held to be invalid as a charitable gift (but valid as a non-charitable gift) on the ground that the purposes of the Order are not exclusively charitable. A charitable gift is not liable to legacy or succession duty and, where it involves a perpetual endowment, it is not void as offending the rule against perpetuities. Moreover, uncertainty cannot arise in the case of a charitable gift.  A general charitable intention will be carried out by means of a scheme.</P>
    <P>Where a donor or testator wishes to have his property applied to both the charitable and non-charitable objects of a particular body, there will be nothing in Section 50 to prevent his framing his gift accordingly.  Subsection (2) specifically excludes from the ambit of subsection (1) those gifts in which an apportionment is made or provided for between the charitable and the non-charitable objects.  From specific enquiries I made, I was quite satisfied that what I may call mixed charities would prefer to receive gifts <Col N="57" /> free of legacy and succession duty, so that they would have to apply them to their charitable objects exclusively, rather than to receive them, less duty, when they could apply them generally. However, if a settlor intends that his bounty is to be applied to both the charitable and non-charitable objects of a mixed charity, he will, as I have indicated, be perfectly free so to frame his gift as to have his intention carried out.</P>
    <P>Section 51 will make charitable a gift for a grave or memorial provided it does not exceed, in the case of a gift of income only, £60 a year, and, in any other case, £1,000 in amount or value. Under existing law, gifts for the upkeep of a grave, tomb or memorial inside a church are charitable as being connected with the fabric of the church, and thus as being for the advancement of religion.  There is no valid reason for distinguishing between a gift to provide or maintain a grave in a church and a similar gift in respect of a grave in the ground around a church or in a graveyard elsewhere. The section will, we hope, give practical effect to an old and deep human feeling that one's last resting place should be decently marked and suitably maintained.</P>
    <P>Section 57 has been framed with the object of validating certain appointments that have been made of bodies corporate in place of two or more trustees.  Section 10 (2) (c) of the Trustee Act, 1893, provides that &ldquo;except where only one trustee was originally appointed, a trustee shall not be discharged under this section unless there will be at least two trustees to perform the trust.&rdquo;  I have already referred to this matter in discussing Section 43.  In future, the Board may, under that section, appoint a body corporate in place of two or more trustees.  However, it is desirable to provide for the proper discharge of the original trustees where bodies corporate have in fact already been appointed. This is the object of Section 57.</P>
    <P>I now come to the Schedule to the Bill.  The repeals are in the main consequential.  I should like, however, to refer in particular to one provision <Col N="58" /> in the 1844 Act that is being repealed.  The section is Section 16 of that Act, which provides that a gift of land for charitable purposes is ineffective if made within three months of the donor's death.  The provision is peculiar to Ireland and has led to an amount of difficulty in its interpretation. We are well aware that there are good reasons for restricting the disposal of his property by a testator at the expense of his dependants, and this, whether or not the disposal is made in fear of death. However, we see no reason for a law which allows a person, where assets consist of stocks and shares, to give all to charity at any time before death, but which prevents him giving land or the proceeds thereof to charity if the gift, donation, devise or bequest is made within the arbitrary period of three months prior to his death.</P>
    <P>This Bill had its origin in a Bill prepared by a Committee established in 1952 by the then Minister for Justice.  The Committee consisted of the late Mr. W.E. Glover, former Chairman of the Board, the late Mr. Gerald F. McCarthy, former Director of the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office, Mr. P.P. O'Donoghue, former Principal Legal Assistant in the Department of the Attorney General, and Mr. J.S. Martin, Secretary to the Commissioners. That Committee did outstanding work and we owe them a debt of gratitude.  The Commissioners themselves have always been unstinting in their assistance and advice and I should like once again to express thanks to them and to their indefatigable Secretary, Mr. Martin, for the help they have given in connection with the Bill.  Finally, I wish to thank Professor Newark and Dr. Delany of the Queen's University of Belfast, who are both authorities in the often difficult and complex field of charity law and whose knowledge and views were always readily available to us.</P>
    <P>The Bill before you is in many respects highly technical, and I trust that I have, in some measure, at least, been successful in my attempt at elucidation. <Col N="59" /> If there are aspects of the Bill that are not clear from what I have said or from the explanatory sidenotes in the text, I shall do my best to explain them more fully at a later stage.</P>

      <P>This Bill should be welcome to all kinds of people.  We should also welcome the exhaustive, informative and very clear statement which the Parliamentary Secretary has just given us on a matter which is difficult and complex and, indeed, ancient. The Bill, as the Parliamentary Secretary indicated at the very end of his speech, has its origin in a law reform movement which started some time ago, I think, under Deputy Costello's Goverment, he naturally being interested in that kind of thing.  The Bill now before us will be helpful not only to lawyers but also to trustees and the public.  I should like, having complimented the Parliamentary Secretary on the information he has given us, to join with him in paying tribute to the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  I happened in a small way to be a trustee for certain funds and I know the satisfactory service which they are able to give.  The Bill makes the law more flexible and brings it up to date.</P>
      <P>There is a normal criticism here that we do not like legislation by reference. This Bill has a great many references in the marginal notes, but the marginal notes, instead of sending you to other legislation to find out what the position is, merely tell you what has been amended and if you are interested in an historical manner in going through the other Acts, you can do that but you can see in the Bill what the law is and that is an enormous improvement.  A great improvement also in this type of Bill is the insertion of the word &ldquo;new&rdquo; in the margin to indicate sections which are new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very complex subject.  I was talking to a lawyer the other day who told me he would make me a present of the statement that he did not know anything about it but that he had an idea where you could find information about it.  One of the things about <Col N="60" /> charity is that there is no definition of charity to be found in our law now. The definition which is to be found goes back very far, indeed, I think, to the early 17th century.  It would be difficult to make a definition now.  As has been indicated in the speech we have just heard, there have been enormous changes.  The word &ldquo;educational,&rdquo; for instance, is now a word which is very different from what it was in the 17th century, or the 19th century, or indeed before the last war. One would wonder whether to create a research fund for nuclear physics would be regarded as educational or charitable, or whether investigation into space, for example, would be regarded as charitable nowadays.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill itself goes a long distance to codify, clarify and simplify the matter for trustees, the Commissioners themselves and for the public who have to deal with all these people. Therefore, we should welcome it. There may be matters which will need to be discussed in Committee, and I hope we will be able to have a fortnight before the Committee Stage comes before us.  I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>I should like to pay a brief tribute to the work of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests and to the officials in that very small office.  As we all know, the amount of voluntary work in the community appears to have decreased in recent times, that is to say, in the past 20 or 30 years.  It may not, in fact, have decreased.  It may be that the total amount of work by Governments is increasing very greatly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is desirable that a body like the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, which has worked so admirably with all sections of opinion on it&mdash;different religious groups and so on&mdash;should be complimented on this occasion for the way they have carried out their work.  I also think it is right that the very small office concerned should be complimented and the very small expenditure <Col N="61" /> which is involved by comparison with the amount of money which has come under their care should also be commented upon here.</P>
    <P>Moreover, I should like to compliment the Minister upon the form of this Bill and the manner in which it is set out.  It is made so easy to construe in comparison with some of the other legislation we had here. Therefore, I welcome the Bill.</P>

In particular, I should like to thank Senator Hayes for his kind remarks about myself and the Bill generally. Let me join with Senator Hayes and Senator O'Donovan in the tributes they have paid to the Charity Commissioners. The Bill is built around the Commissioners, and it is the work they do that is really important in connection with this Bill.  As both Senators have pointed out, that work has been done in an excellent fashion down through the years, and has been done voluntarily by the members of the Board.  As Senator O'Donovan rightly points out, the staff have also merited our gratitude for the manner in which they have performed their duties and functions.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal aim of this Bill is to provide means to remedy certain hardships which can and do arise in connection with jury service in the county boroughs other than Dublin.  For circuit court sittings in these county boroughs, jurors have at present to be drawn from either the county borough or the county according to the <Col N="62" /> area to which the particular case is related, with the result that in a very large county, such as Cork, a considerable journey has to be travelled by jurors from remote parts of the county when required to attend at the county borough.  It also happens in Cork that the volume of county borough cases is so great in relation to the number of jurors at present available that the turn of each juror to render service arises about once every year and a quarter as compared with a frequency of about once in every 10 to 15 years in the adjoining county areas.</P>
      <P>This is not the position in counties which do not contain a county borough because there the existing law provides that, for the purpose of calling jurors to a circuit court sittings, the county may be divided into districts and a district from which to call jurors to a particular sittings may be prescribed so as to avoid jurors having to travel excessive distances.  In prescribing such a district regard would be had, of course, to its being, at the same time, large enough to provide a sufficient number of jurors.</P>
      <P>In Dublin, too, the position is different and more satisfactory.  There is no distinction between county borough and county case and mixed panels of jurors from both areas are called to try all cases.  This is the system which the Bill now extends to the other county boroughs, with the addition that the Minister for Justice will be enabled to limit the distance from which to call jurors from the county areas by prescribing a district for this purpose convenient to the county borough.</P>
      <P>In this way, it will be possible in the case of Cork to prescribe an area surrounding the city, from which county jurors will be called to form mixed panels with the county borough jurors. Those outside this district would no longer be called to county borough courts while those within would be of sufficient number, when combined with the county borough jurors, to have an average frequency of service of about once in four years, which is not excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> It will be noticed that the Bill contains a number of minor provisions in relation to commissions <i>de lunatico inquirendo</i>.  I would like to explain, that the purpose of these provisions is to make clear that a court of this particular type is, for all jury purposes, in the same position as the other better-known courts.</P>
    <P>As Senators will have observed, the Bill is very restricted in its objectives. It will, however, in its present form, bring worth-while relief to persons on whom the obligation of jury service at present constitutes a particularly heavy burden; and I am satisfied that this limited improvement should be implemented as soon as possible, without considering, at least at this juncture, more general issues which are raised sometimes in relation to jury service. The Bill makes no change in the longstanding arrangements which apply to liability for jury service and to the compilation of Jurors' Books.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right that this House should express its appreciation of this effort by the Minister and his Department to improve the machinery in relation to juries in certain respects.  I take it from the Minister's concluding remarks that he was appealing to us not to be too hard on him for not producing a bigger apple or something of that sort. The Bill is in no way open to objection, except that on Committee Stage we might have some discussion about the necessity for Section 5; but, as I say, that is a matter for the next Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two questions in relation to juries which might be mentioned. There is, first of all, the smallness of the remuneration which they have been getting and there is, secondly the possibility that the use of juries in certain types of action&mdash;for example, in road accident cases&mdash;might cease as it has ceased in Britain.  We might not find a great deal of difference but the very excessive awards which are sometimes made by juries in road traffic accident cases might not arise if these cases were left to a member of the courts of whatever rank, <Col N="64" /> whether district justice, circuit court judge, or high court judge, acting with assessors.</P>
    <P>However, in view of the Minister's request, these matters can be left over for some other occasion.  As I said at the beginning, the Minister is to be complimented, and indeed his Department over the past decade have brought many improvements in administration, without a great increase in the administrative staff in the Department. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill as I understand it, as the Minister has put it before us, is to deal with a situation in which a particularly heavy burden, in his own words, falls upon certain people who are not exempt from jury service. Despite what the Minister says about not tackling other problems of jury service, I feel he has missed one opportunity which would just about double the people available for jury service, that is, by admitting women to jury service; by amending the Act and ceasing to allow exemption for women.</P>
      <P>That opens a wider question.  I, personally, would not base my plea for admitting women to jury service simply on the fact that there is a shortage of men for jury service, though that fact seems to have been enough in the case of the admission of married women to the teaching profession.  The shortage of teachers has meant that married women who were more or less excluded are now being admitted again.  My plea would not be on those grounds.  It would not be based upon the ground that women have a right to serve on juries which is not my burden of contention at all, but upon the much more basic right of men, women and young people to be tried by a jury of both men and women. That appears to me to be a far more natural body of opinion than a purely all male jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of whether women would be more lenient or less lenient with particular types of crimes or offenders.  That is not the point. The point is that you would get a far more balanced consensus of opinion from a body of men and women, than <Col N="65" /> you would get from simply a body of women or men.  It is far closer in fact to the atmosphere in a family where most judgments and decisions are referred both to the man and to the woman.</P>
    <P>I feel that both men and women and also young people have the right to be tried by a mixed jury.  It might be the cause of serious disability&mdash; and I think frequently has been&mdash;for particular offenders, be they men or women, to be tried solely before a jury of men.  I do not want to specify and I do not think that it would always follow that women offenders would be either better or worse treated by a jury of women or by a jury of men, but you would have a more balanced judgment from a jury composed of both men and women.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me that in all equity the accused person&mdash;and that is what I regard as a more basic thing than anything else&mdash;should have the right to have what I contend to be a more balanced jury.  The fact that it would also help to solve the problem to which the Minister referred of the particularly heavy burden on men at present called for service would be an additional advantage.</P>
    <P>In the Juries Act of 1927 which is being amended in certain of its provisions by this Bill, I find that the qualification for liability for jury service is described as follows in Section 3, subsection (1):</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this section, every citizen of the age of twenty-one years or upwards and under the age of sixty-five years who, either in his own name or in a trade name and whether alone or jointly with any other person or persons or as a member of a form or co-partnership, is rated for the relief of the poor in respect of land in a jury district shall, if the total rateable value of all the land in respect of which he is so rated in such jury district equals or exceeds the minimum rating qualifications for such jury district, be qualified and liable to serve as a juror for trial of all or any issues which are for the time being triable with a <Col N="66" /> jury drawn wholly or partly from such jury district, unless he is for the time being disqualified for or exempt from serving as a juror.</P>
    <P>That is the first provision: one has to be between 21 and 65 and a ratepayer of a certain minimum rateable holding.</P>
    <P>The second subsection, I feel, reads rather oddly:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this section, every male citizen of the age of twenty-one years or upwards and under the age of sixty-five years who is not qualified and liable to serve as a juror by virtue of the foregoing subsection and whose wife is rated for the relief of the poor in respect of land in a jury district shall, if the total rateable value of all the land in respect of which his wife is so rated in such jury district equals or exceeds the minimum rating qualification for such jury district, be qualified and liable to serve as a juror for the trial.</P>
    <P>So a man, if he is a ratepayer of a certain category or husband of a ratepayer of a certain category, is liable for jury service, but the wife whose rated holding gives him the right to be called on a jury is not so liable.  I find that very odd indeed and I link that with the fact that in Section 2 subsection (1):</P>
    <P>The Minister shall by order prescribe for every jury district the rateable value of land which is to be the minimum rating qualification for jurors in that jury district and may by any such order prescribe different rateable values in respect of different classes of land.</P>
    <P>I make the double point there: first, in certain circumstances, a man becomes liable for jury service simply by the property qualification of his wife who is not so liable, a very anomalous position which should be removed by such an amending Bill as this; secondly, you have for jury service a property qualification and I would like to question whether that is a wise provision or whether it is based upon sound principles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> The person, apart from the exemptions I mentioned, who is liable for jury service is a male citizen and a ratepayer or the husband of a ratepayer. There is, in other words, a property test to select the owner of certain landed property, of real estate, and I should like to ask the House why does the ownership of property confer upon one the capacity to judge of the credibility of a witness, for instance, or of the authenticity of a fact? Why should we be bound by this concept that if you own property, you are in some way a more satisfactory judge of fact, of character or of credibility than if you do not own property?</P>
    <P>It is contended, of course, that if you own property, you become by that fact a more responsible person, a person with a stake in the country and so on, but I regard that as entirely irrelevant to the duties of a member of a jury whose duties are, as I see them, to judge on matters of fact, not of matters of interest.  Obviously, a property owner has a certain vested interest in the continuance of certain observances but it is not the function of a jury to act in accordance with this enlightened self-interest but to make decisions as to facts.</P>
    <P>I would suggest consequently that jury service should in fact apply, with certain exemptions, to all electors, all those on the electoral roll, men and women over 21 and under 70.  I find the age limit of 65 rather odd because for the purposes of the old age pensions, we do not consider a person to have retired from active life until he is 70, but he is not eligible for jury service beyond 65.  However, apart from age, which is an unimportant point, it seems to me that all responsible electors&mdash;obviously, there would be some exemptions such as those mentioned in the two Schedules of the 1927 Act like idiots, illiterates, and men of certain professions whose absence from those professions might disorganise things&mdash;all responsible citizens, all adult citizens who have the right to vote should have, not the right to serve on juries, but the duty.  I regard that as a necessary preliminary for the fair trying of every case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> Persons absolutely exempt are referred to in Part I of the First Schedule and Part II refers to people exempt but who are entitled to serve on application and in that category come all women, so that the onus is placed upon the individual woman, if she is a ratepayer, to make application to serve on a jury.  Some women have been public-spirited enough to do that and they all have the necessary ratepaying qualifications.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that to put an obligation upon women to make this application is doubly unfair.  It is unfair to the person who is being tried and unfair to the individual woman. If she is in employment, it could be extremely awkward for her, if she were called for jury service, to have to explain to her employer that she had applied to be put on the jury panel, although she did not have to.  That applies to men in the exempted category, teachers, doctors, and so on.  If they are employed and have applied to be on the panel, it could be very awkward for them <i>vis-à-vis</i> their employer. Therefore, I regard it as doubly unfair to exclude women not from the right but from the duty to serve on juries.</P>
    <P>I believe one of the provisions of the Bill should be a revision of those portions of the 1927 Act which exempt all women merely by reason of the fact that they are women.  I feel particularly ashamed of that provision in this country.  I am sure the Minister will, in memory, support me here.  The very birth of this State was due so very much to the sacrifice of so very many women, who sacrificed without a thought of reward or prominence in position, and so on, and who played an absolutely full and equal part in the whole Republican movement which brought about the existence of this Oireachtas, that I feel ashamed that, not merely in 1927, we did not recognise there is a right to a woman and a man to be tried by a mixed jury, that the woman is a full citizen in the fullest sense of the word, but also that, in 1961, when we are amending the principal Act, we have not yet evolved to the point where we recognise that <Col N="69" /> the accused person, in equity, has the right to be tried by a jury of men and women and we are failing in our duty unless we remove from the principal Act the absurd exemption applied to women simply because they are women.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemption in the old Act and in this Bill whereby a woman can opt out, and that seems to me the easiest way of terming it, is a good one.  If a woman feels her duty to the State and her fellow-citizens is to be on a jury, and she is qualified on the ordinary conditions, then she can be a juror and should be a juror.  However, I can think of many women who, by reason of their mental and physical make-up, of their kindly disposition, of their maternal instincts, would not be people who should be faced with days on end during which they would be asked to try, perhaps, a brutal person who had been guilty of robbery with violence in the case of an old person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These jury cases have had very bad effect on jurors' health at times.  I know a case where a young man was convinced that a criminal on emerging from jail would, because he happened to live reasonably close to him, try to get his own back on him because he had been one of the twelve who judged him guilty.  I could imagine women who could fulfil everything that the State could ask of them in life and who could be the most excellent citizens&mdash; much better than men who could try a man without a thought&mdash;who could possibly go to the verge of a nervous break-down or beyond because of having <Col N="70" /> to decide whether or not a man had been guilty of a brutal crime and whether or not he should receive the most severe punishment.</P>
    <P>It could well be that a justice could excuse a woman from such a trial by jury but there have been cases where solicitors, from the one hundred jurors who are called, have made many objections, so that, in fact, of those who were not objected to, there were hardly the twelve necessary.  In such a situation, I could imagine a woman, if she were forced to be on a jury as a man can be forced to be on a jury, in an unenviable position.  I feel the existing provisions in the old Act and now in the Bill before us are wise and are in keeping with the reverence and respect with which we would wish to regard our womenfolk.  I think their position should not be interfered with.</P>

      <P>I admit that.  I say that while they may not be contained in the Bill, Senators are entitled to raise them.  Otherwise, I am pretty certain the Cathaoirleach would deal with the Senators.  I have to presume that although the matters to which they have referred are not contained in the Bill, they may be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the Seanad that this Bill is the answer to urgent representations of the Deputies of Cork city. They made it clear to me on a number of occasions, both by questions in the House and by interviews, that the position of the Cork city jurors is pretty desperate, especially when compared with the service jurors in other areas have to give.  For instance, in Cork city, a juror has to give service every 16 months, whereas in other districts they do not have to give that service except in a period of between <Col N="71" /> 10 and 15 years.  In other words, jurors in other districts were exempted for that particularly long period.</P>
    <P>I had to regard it as a very serious aspect of a citizen's service to the State that in one city jurors were called on to give this excessive service as against long exemption in other parts of the State.  The result was that I decided that rather than wait to bring in a more comprehensive Bill, a Bill that might touch on some of the points Senator Sheehy Skeffington has referred to, and what Senator Donegan referred to, this was an urgent relief which was required and, in my opinion, urgently required.  I was actually hoping that as a result of our discussion, the Seanad would think it desirable to give me not only the Second Stage but the remaining Stages now so that the Bill might become operative in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Senator Sheehy Skeffington is aware that at the birth of this State women had compulsorily to give service on juries and it was a complete failure.  The women just did not give the service and it went on for some few years until eventually, when the Bill was being amended&mdash;I am not sure of the actual date; it might have been 1927 or earlier&mdash;the Legislature thought it desirable then to take women off the panel.</P>
    <P>I am not sure but I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington is aware of the fact that women can give voluntary service and very few women do opt to come in.  If they wish, they can volunteer to give service and they will be put on the jury book.  To date, the number of women who have volunteered for that type of service has been very small.  I do not want to exaggerate; I was going to say the number could be counted on the fingers of two hands, but that might be an exaggeration. The number who have volunteered is very small.  At all times I have supported feminist organisations because I believe in the right to equality between the sexes.  I have always believed in that and there <Col N="72" /> would not be any desire on my part to keep women from giving that service, if I thought it desirable.</P>
    <P>However, when I consider examining the question of whether women should give compulsory service, I begin to think in terms of the housewife who has to look after a family of young children, and who has to provide the meals for her husband. Then I begin to ask myself if this woman were compelled to attend the courts in order to be heard as to whether she was prepared to give jury service, or whether she would be challenged against giving service, or whether she might be called to give service, it might be possible that she would be called to give that service for two or three days, and I shudder to think of the results of that on the organisation of that little family.</P>

Matters of this kind were discussed in the other House, the question of pay and things of that kind, which were completely outside the Bill.  I had to make this appeal that these things may or may not be desired but I do not know what the view of another Minister for Justice might be on these matters.  I do not know what the view of the Government would be on them because I have not attempted to entangle myself with any views other than the measure which I was bringing before the House, and therefore I cannot say what the views would be.</P>
      <P>I did say, however, in the other House, and I repeat it here, that all these things could be examined with a view to being brought into an amending Bill which could be brought to the Legislature and if the Legislature thought they were desirable or suitable, and if the Government were prepared to stand over them, then it is in that comprehensive Bill that matters of this kind could be decided.  But this Bill is a very restricted Bill.  As I said at the beginning, it is a Bill designed to bring relief to a hard-pressed set of jurors and it does not attempt to deal with anything else.  For that reason, I did not think that bringing me back on Committee Stage would add anything to the Bill because, as I say, it is a restricted type of Bill and I will not be prepared to accept recommendations of the type that have been discussed here this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann would welcome fostering action on the part of the Minister for Education in order to encourage the Managers of National Schools to establish parent-teacher groups in connection with the schools under their management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for coming along this evening and I am grateful also to the Leader of the House for giving me the opportunity to-night to propose this motion which I feel to be one that could, if it were accepted and acted upon, be very fruitful in relation to the education provided in our national schools.  I draw particular attention, in starting, to the fact that what I am asking the Seanad to do is not to urge, direct or tell the Minister to do anything but simply to state that we, as a House, would &ldquo;welcome,&rdquo; not a direction on his part, not a command, but &ldquo;fostering action.&rdquo;  I chose the phrase deliberately, because I realise that among the 4,000 national schools in the country, there are very widely differing circumstances and conditions. It would be quite absurd for the Minister to command that, starting from a certain date, parent-teacher groups should spring up all over the country. What I am asking is that he shall foster or encourage.  I shall mention later <Col N="76" /> the methods by which I think he might do that.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the Seanad to the fact that the motion is couched in these terms for the purpose of recognising widely different circumtances in different parts of the country, and that it simply urges the Minister to see what action might be taken on his part not to command, direct or even request, but to foster the formation of such groups.</P>
    <P>The background against which I propose this motion and seek to encourage the establishment of such parent-teacher groups in relation to national schools is that I feel&mdash;and I say this advisedly&mdash;that in Ireland today in many schools, there is not either enough comprehension or enough co-operation between parents and teachers and between parents and school managers.  I stress the two words &ldquo;comprehension&rdquo; and &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Comprehension is basic.  Unless there is an understanding as between parents and teachers, there can be no co-operation. Unless there is understanding between parents and school managers, there can be no effective co-operation. I am not suggesting that on either side there is a lack of goodwill. I am suggesting that not infrequently there is a quite clear lack of understanding. It sometimes appears to those who know what the conditions are that there appears to be, on the part of the parents, a rather silly lack of comprehension of all the very real problems of the teachers.</P>
    <P>Whether that lack of comprehension on the part of parents is silly or not, I think few can deny that it exists rather more than it should.  When there is awkwardness, trouble, failure or near-failure, or conditions which are regarded as not entirely satisfactory, there is a tendency on one part or the other to &ldquo;pass the buck,&rdquo; to pass the blame, and say: &ldquo;It is the fault of the teachers.  The teachers should be doing more.&rdquo;  There is similarly a tendency on the part of the teachers to say: &ldquo;It is the fault of the parents.  They should be doing more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In both contentions, there may well be a large element of truth.  In other words, there is very little doubt that, <Col N="77" /> where things are not functioning properly, blame is probably legitimately attributable to both sides. Nevertheless, this atmosphere of &ldquo;passing the buck&rdquo; or of mutual suspicion, which, as I suggest, is often based upon ignorance of the problems and difficulties involved on one side or the other, is something against which we should strive.  There is sometimes&mdash;I am not suggesting this is generally the case&mdash;an atmosphere of uneasiness, even of distrust, and sometimes of feeling disgruntled.</P>
    <P>We read of parents' strikes.  I think everybody will agree that, when the parents of a particular school call a school strike and remove their children from the school, it is a thing to be regretted, and yet we should not try to say straight away whose fault it is.  We should deplore the fact in itself that this can occur.  I am not suggesting that every school in the country suffers from this kind of thing, but it does occur.  I feel that even where it does not go to that extreme, which is rare, there is a sense of uneasiness, sometimes even of distrust, which need not even be there at all, if there were more comprehension.</P>
    <P>The individual parent of children at national schools has only one normal channel of expression, as it were, of giving vent, I will not say to grievances, but to questions, or for the raising of points or the asking of questions. That normal channel is that of going to the school manager or the individual principal.  Mothers or fathers hesitate to do that simply because they do not like &ldquo;making a nuisance of themselves,&rdquo; as they call it.  Most parents are imaginative people, and realise that the school manager and the principal teacher have each a great deal to do, and they hesitate to go and make an occasion of putting a question, raising a point, or making a minor complaint, and they put it off, indefinitely, because there is no other channel for them to express that, other than to go and do what they might term making a nuisance of themselves.</P>
    <P>They recognise, too, that the manager is a busy parish priest, a busy reverend mother, a busy parson or a busy rabbi as the case may be, extremely <Col N="78" /> busy in relation to the school and outside, and consequently many parents hesitate to raise what they might legitimately regard as minor points, yet which they would like to raise or discuss, since they do not want to &ldquo;make nuisances of themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Consequently, since this is really the only way at present in which they can express a view on the way in which their children are being taught in the school, there is no organised channel, as it were.  All too often if we look for organisations among the parents, what we see is the organisation of a strike committee.  If we were to see what were the present organisations of parents in relation to national schools, we should find it hard to go very much outside the confines of the small numbers of schools where the parents have organised themselves into strike committees to protest against conditions in particular schools.  That is deplorable, that the only organisation of parents which one can see should be one springing from conditions which are extreme and exceptional.</P>
    <P>That situation, which parents in fact in this country have to be driven very hard to reach, is a situation which all of us regret.  Parents, as a rule, even the mildest of them, feel, in so far as they think about the national schools, not infrequently rather pushed aside. A lot of public speeches are made about &ldquo;the rights of the parents&rdquo;, but, in practice, there is no way of consulting their views, no way in which their views can be put in a balanced and co-ordinated way.  It is quite obvious that if you have, in relation to a particular school, where there may be hundreds of children, two or three parents strong and vocal enough to make their protests, it is possible that they are unrepresentative, and that their protests are ill-founded. Therefore, I would suggest that, in practice, it would be a good thing for the schools were there to be an organisation or informal group officially set up for the purpose of discussing things with the parents, submitting points to them, answering questions and so on.</P>
    <P>Sometimes parents feel that in relation to the school, their views are not <Col N="79" /> wanted, and that in fact they are hardly ever approached in relation to the schools, except when it is a question of raising money.  Yet, even from the point of view of raising money for the school&mdash;and it is a good thing for parents to be brought in in that way&mdash; I suggest that too becomes easier if there has been active and continuous co-operation with the parents throughout the year in relation to the school.</P>
    <P>The value of a parent-teacher association in relation to a particular school is that the parents&mdash;and I say this in all seriousness, though it might sound surprising at first hearing&mdash;will find value in knowing the premises, because I assume that the association would meet normally in one or two rooms in the school.  I suggest that there is value in the parents being brought into the school, by the mere fact of their going in the door in the evenings for a meeting.  I do not mean that they should meet every week or month, but there is value in the parents meeting and discussing inside the school premises.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is a psychological value for the child, and particularly for the young child, and I say this with all the emphasis at my command, in knowing that his daddy and his mammy were in the schoolroom the evening before, perhaps sitting at his desk, perhaps seeing the same picture on the wall as he sees, and perhaps noticing certain things in the schoolroom that are usually there, that he knows about and which he has difficulty in communicating to his parents in any adequate way.  There is also pleasure and psychological value in the feeling that the parents have been interested enough to come along to the school and concern themselves to meet the teachers and so on.  That is the first value: the actual value of the parents knowing the premises.</P>
    <P>It may well be that in the premises of some of our schools there might be a feeling that it would be as well if the parents did not see the premises. I am not suggesting that all schools are bad.  Some of them, for reasons of poverty, are not as good as they should <Col N="80" /> be, but I think the Minister would certainly not feel that there is any reason because of poor conditions in the schools for preventing the parents from seeing the inside.  That would be ignoble, unjust and unjustified.  It is quite obvious that very good schooling can go on in very simple surroundings, and in fact in the majority of schools while as regards the actual class rooms and so on the parents might say that things are pretty simple, that fact might in itself urge them to a better local effort to improve those very conditions.</P>
    <P>The second value I would see in such formal or informal meetings is that the parents would get to know the teachers.  In any community, some of the parents will know the teachers anyway, but in quite a lot of communities, the parents who know the teachers on a social plane and meet them informally will be a minority.  That might be the case more in towns than in the country, but whatever the position, I feel that it is a good thing for the parents to get to know the teachers, (a) formally, that is to say, to see them and hear them and what they have to say about their subjects and the children, their methods of teaching and so on, and (b) perhaps even more precious, informally.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that some parents will prove to be to the teachers a bit of a bore.  You will get a mother or father who will insist on buttonholing the teacher and telling him all about little Willie or little Patricia.  That is one of the legitimate hazards of the craft of the teacher.  Nevertheless, a parent who gets that opportunity of seeing some of the things done in the school, or putting some questions he or she has long wanted to put, is getting a valuable opportunity psychologically, which makes for far better relations and more ready comprehension and co-operation, because&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;the parents will be getting to know the problems of the teacher.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that many parents, even with the best will in the world and with intelligence and education, find it very hard to grasp <Col N="81" /> just what are the problems of the teacher.  Parents who have large families will have some notion.  I myself have three children, and sometimes at a meal time I think to myself that if I were dealing with 57 children in one room, as many teachers have to do, I should find it would drive me crackers.  For most parents then, to be brought in touch with the teachers would be excellent, and educational for the parents, because there is no question but that the teachers carry one of the heaviest burdens in the country, and the parents must be got to realise that.</P>
    <P>I remember a friend of mine who was, for a time, a roadworker.  He was a very intelligent boy and, by saving money and winning scholarships and so on, he succeeded in putting himself through the university, and became a teacher.  He told me that often after a day's teaching, he was far more tired than he ever had been after a day mending the roads.  I am sure that is absolutely true and I do not think it is realised as fully as it should be.  There are many people who tend&mdash;and perhaps that tendency is as prevalent in the country as in the city&mdash;to regard teachers as having a grand life.</P>
    <P>In &ldquo;School around the Corner&rdquo; on the radio the other evening, a child was asked what she would like to be, and she said she would like to be a teacher. She was asked why, and she replied: &ldquo;Because they have a grand life&rdquo;. They have &ldquo;a grand life&rdquo;!  It is true that they have a rewarding life in many ways; but they also have an extremely hard life in other ways.  They give of themselves all the time.  As I say, I feel that to know the problems of the teacher is a most valuable thing for the parents, to know the conditions in which they have to work, to know the class rooms, and also to get a chance to have their own parental problems and difficulties made known to the teachers and examined sympathetically.</P>
    <P>All of that, I suggest, could not but be valuable to the kind of education given in our schools.  I have experience of two such groups, one in a secondary <Col N="82" /> school and one in a kindergarten and junior school.  There is always very strong parental solidarity and goodwill in favour of the teachers, when the parents know them and know the sort of work they are doing. You get strong solidarity between the parents and between the teachers, and between the parents and teachers, and they support what is good and valuable in the schools.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting, therefore, is that by fairly regular meetings&mdash;perhaps once or twice a term would be quite sufficient&mdash;the parents can learn a lot and the teachers can learn a lot&mdash; the parents about the teachers' problems and the teachers about the parents' problems.</P>
    <P>I said that I have experience of two such groups.  I have experience in relation to one secondary school in Dublin of a parent-teacher group, and also of a kindergarten and junior school run by the Society of Friends in which one of Ireland's outstanding educationists, Miss Isobel Douglas, who has recently retired from the Headmistressship, used to run what seemed to me a wholly admirable parent-teacher group.  I attended it as a parent and there is no question but that every one of us benefited immensely both from the contact with the teachers and also from listening to the other parents, and to Miss Douglas whose experience and imaginative ideas were freely made available to us.  Teachers and parents both benefit immensely from such encounters.</P>
    <P>I believe, also, that the managers of the schools, if they could attend these groups and meet both sections, would find that it would help them also in relation to the schools by reason of the goodwill engendered and the ideas expressed.</P>
    <P>I may be permitted perhaps to quote from a very interesting and informative article by Mr. Raftery which appears in the current issue of <i>Studies</i> in which he considers the situation of education in America.  He had a very extensive tour there and he gives us, in an article entitled &ldquo;Some Impressions of Education in the U.S.A.,&rdquo; a very comprehensive view of education <Col N="83" /> at every level.  He refers to the fact that there are these parent teacher groups and he notes that they are useful both from the cultural point of view and from the point of view of helping all aspects of school life.  At page 58, he says:</P>
    <P>Certainly the country is prolific in useful educational and cultural bodies.  Of these, the parent-teacher associations, which operate at local and national levels and in which the parents (usually mothers) appear to predominate, are an outstanding example. As far as an onlooker may judge, their concern is not so much the rights of particular parents as such&mdash;those rights are rarely challenged, in theory at any rate&mdash;but rather improved provision for schooling and other educational matters of public interest.</P>
    <P>I have no experience of such groups in America or Britain, although I have read about them, but I am certain that they do, as here suggested, contribute very largely towards the betterment of conditions, understanding and co-operation. As I say, in that way, and by such means, we could combat a certain lack of knowledge on the part of the parents of what goes on in our Irish schools, where it goes on&mdash;the actual premises&mdash;and why it goes on.</P>
    <P>Those Senators who are parents themselves will be familiar, furthermore, with the extraordinary incommunicativeness of the human child. You ask him: &ldquo;What did you do at school to-day?&rdquo;  No cross-examining counsel will drag more than a few admissions from the child, and, of course, in fact, it is not a very good thing to do.  The child is incommunicative partly because he is not really capable of framing the words which would communicate the school as it appears to him.  Therefore, for this reason too I believe it is a good thing for the parent to know by other means what it is like in the school.  If you even ask any child in any school&mdash;a young child from a national school&mdash;&ldquo;How many of you are there in your class?&rdquo;  you will find it very hard to get an answer. <Col N="84" /> Even if you ask an older child: &ldquo;How many of you are there?&rdquo; the child counts on his fingers and omits a few, and usually he will be wrong.</P>
    <P>There may be objection to what I am about to say now: some parents do not care about the school or do not care about what schooling their children get.  They are &ldquo;not interested&rdquo;, or as is more likely, they feel it is the job of the school and the teachers and not their job.  I would say in relation to such parents that they should be encouraged to care.  Both fathers and mothers should be encouraged to attend parent-teacher meetings.  I am afraid it is the tendency in this country for the father to put off such responsibility on to the mother.  The mother is expected to deal with &ldquo;that side.&rdquo; That in itself is bad.  I think Irish fathers should be encouraged to take an active interest in what their children are doing at school, and encouraged to go along with the mothers to meet the teachers at such groups. Both fathers and mothers should be encouraged to attend, to listen and to talk.</P>
    <P>I have said that there is a certain ignorance among parents about the schools, but it is also true to say that not all teachers realise just precisely what it is that worries the parents. Usually parents have some worries in connection with their children, and if they have worries, the teacher does not always realise just precisely what it is the parents are worried about.  Good teachers&mdash;and we have a large number of them in our national schools&mdash;know the children in their classes well, if the classes are not too enormous.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will forgive me if I say in that connection that I hope that very active steps are being taken to reduce the size of the classes. If the classes are not too enormous then, the teachers know their charges, their pupils, well.  They will also know them in a different way from the way in which the parents know them.  It is a wise parent that knows his own child.  Quite frequently the parent, if he or she is receptive, can learn a lot about his or her own child, because the teacher sees the child with more detached eyes and a less emotionally <Col N="85" /> involved attitude.  It is also good, as I have already suggested, for the child to realise that there is this joint concern on the part of both parents and teachers for himself or herself in school.  Furthermore, at such groups and meetings, general principles of education and parental, magisterial and managerial responsibility can be discussed, ideas ventilated, principles defined, and so on, in a way that could not but be useful.</P>
    <P>How would this work out in practice? What kind of group should there be?  What is the kind of group which I would like to see encouraged? In my opinion the function of such a parent-teacher group would not be in any sense managerial.  It would not be a case of setting up such a group as a committee to undertake the running of some part of the school.  It should not even be formally advisory or consultative.  It would not be a parent-teacher group to which one would submit proposals.  It would consist simply of informal meetings and discussions between parents and teachers.  In a small school, all the parents would be invited to attend, say, twice a term in the school, and in a large school, you might divide the parents according to the ages of their children and their grades and invite two or three groups at different times.</P>
    <P>They might, occasionally, I think, hear a talk, possibly from one of the teachers, possibly from someone outside, on an educational topic.  A teacher or parent might informally direct the discussion, take the chair, if you like.  As far as possible, all the teachers would be present, and would be introduced to the parents&mdash;introduced formally at first in order that they might be approached informally later.  There should be, after the talk &mdash;and this, I think, is absolutely essential&mdash;a break for a cup of tea in which the parents would converge on the teachers and ask them all the questions they had been burning to ask for a long time, the teachers circulating and having a certain amount of private talk with the parents, and finally a general discussion once more.</P>
    <P>This would vary from school to <Col N="86" /> school.  In some schools, it might work out better than in others, but even in schools where it might not work out all that smoothly at first, through timidity, lack of knowledge, shyness or something else, there would be very great imponderable results, in better feeling based on better understanding; and I feel that it is absolutely essential for parents to understand teachers' problems and for teachers to understand parents' problems.</P>
    <P>It is certainly true that there are such people as unreasonable parents.  It is also true that there are such people as unreasonable teachers.  Now, both of these are in the minority.  When the unreasonable parent comes along to interview the principal teacher or manager and by sheer force of personality, perhaps, remains arguing away for a very long and unreasonable time, the manager or principal teacher may find it extremely difficult to get rid of such unreasonable parents who, however much they may be in a minority, may nevertheless occupy a lot of time.  It is my experience, however&mdash; and that is the point I now want to make&mdash;that there is a world of difference between the unreasonable parent nattering away in private about a particular point to a headmaster or a principal teacher and that same unreasonable parent making the same protests or voicing the same grievance in public in the presence of the other parents.</P>
    <P>Again and again in my own experience, I have seen such a parent shot down verbally by the other parents, by another parent getting up and saying that such a point is all nonsense, or that it is quite unreasonable to expect such and such an action or an attitude.  I suggest that the weight of parental public opinion in support of a teacher is a far more effective way of dealing with the exceptional unreasonable parent than a private interview can be.  There is a far healthier atmosphere if the unreasonable parent is made to feel that public opinion is not with him or her.</P>
    <P>As well as the unreasonable complaint, of course, there may occur the unreasonable answer, and both the <Col N="87" /> unreasonable complaint and the unreasonable answer made before a joint gathering of parents and teachers are shown up by joint public opinion as being unreasonable.  I cannot feel that this would have anything but a good effect upon the atmosphere in a school.  It will be in fact more salutary&mdash;clear the air&mdash;and make complaining parents realise the exaggeration of certain claims, and in the case of an unsatisfactory answer by a teacher, the teacher may realise that the question has not been answered as fully or as reasonably as it might have been.</P>
    <P>The grousing parent who is grousing unreasonably is answered, not by managers or teachers but by fellow parents, and not necessarily by speeches.  It does not necessarily mean that another parent must get up and answer, but simply that the crowd reaction to the parent who is being unreasonable has a salutary effect and spares the principal, the manager or the teacher from devoting a private hour which appears quite fruitless to trying to answer the unreasonable parent. It is far better that such a parent should be answered by commonsensical parental opinion than by teachers. I have taken time to describe one particular type of incident, but it is representative of the process of educating parental opinion and also teachers' opinion.</P>
    <P>What do I mean by asking the Minister to take &ldquo;fostering action&rdquo;?  I have asked him, and asked the House to pass a motion asking him to take &ldquo;fostering action&rdquo;.  I do not suggest that he should interfere in any particular school, but I do suggest that he makes it clear to the managers of schools and indeed later to the public by circulars and by suggestions that the starting of such groups in schools where conditions permit it would be welcomed by him as an experiment.  In the Regulations for National Schools issued by his Department you find again and again&mdash;I do not want to dwell on this as I have talked for more time than I meant to&mdash;regulations setting out ways in which schools can be <Col N="88" /> used.  On page 9, there is reference to the fact that a schoolhouse may be used by a returning officer in election time&mdash;paragraph 18 goes on to say that the Minister would welcome certain action: &ldquo;The Minister desires to urge upon Managers the desirability of (a), (b) and (c)&rdquo; and so on.  By a similar phrase in Para. 19 &ldquo;managers are encouraged as occasion offers to invite or procure the assistance of persons who are qualified to give interesting lectures or talks of an educationally useful character to the pupils and thus to diversify the intellectual life of the school.&rdquo;  I am asking for something in line with what is already practised in the Department in issuing that kind of suggestion and encouragement to the schools and to the managers.</P>
    <P>I should like your leave to quote the Report of the Council of Education &mdash;Paragraph 333:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Closely linked with the parochial ownership of the schools is the managerial system.  The responsibilities of school managers are many and serious, inasmuch as they have obligations to the parents, the teachers and the State.  Their duties are not confined to building schools, appointing teachers and acting as correspondents to the Department on behalf of their schools, though these alone involve heavy and pressing work.  The maintenance of schools, the frequent visitation of individual schools, the supervision of religious instruction, the admonishment of parents and pupils in regard to attendance, and the guidance of teachers require their constant attention, which is often given at the cost of great sacrifice to themselves.  The manager is the counsellor and administrator of the school, the very pillar on which the school rests.  The enthusiasm and efficiency of the school depend largely on the influence of a manager, whose energy and interest are directed not to one aspect of school administration or to one subject of the curriculum, but to every phase of school life and activity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Paragraph 333 in its entirety. <Col N="89" /> The object is to show the immense burden thrown by our system upon the school managers.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph, Paragraph 334, gives an indication of how he could reach perhaps greater co-operation, even locally:</P>
    <P>Local or parochial control of schools requires that each locality should bear its due share of the cost of building and maintaining its primary schools.  Every form of local co-operation designed to further this end should receive active encouragement from all interested in local welfare. Such co-operation would produce in turn greater interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I emphasise that.</P>
    <P>&mdash;and pride in the schools and, accordingly, ensure better school buildings, improved attendance, and a keener standard of education.</P>
    <P>&mdash;which is precisely what I would see deriving from such groups.</P>
    <P>Equally, it would result in a higher standard of citizenship on the part of the child and on the part of his parents.  Local committees working under the direction of school managers could contribute much to the improvement of schools and school building, not only by procuring funds locally&mdash;</P>
    <P>I stress that also.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to set against State aid for building and maintenance, heating and cleaning, but also by improving and beautifying school grounds, providing playing pitches, promoting athletics and games, concerts, plays and other school activities, &mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;in which I would certainly see included the meeting of parent-teacher groups.</P>
    <P>&mdash;presenting prizes, and securing through their own initiative or from individual members of the community pictures and paintings of educational value to embellish the walls of the school-room, and books to add to the school library.  There is in fact &mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this is the last sentence I want to quote from this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" />&mdash;no limit to the ways in which the locality could assist its own schools, thereby fostering a spirit of initiative, independence and service, and giving force and vitality to the influence of the school.</P>
    <P>I believe that it would be in the spirit of such recommendations that the Minister should, by circular, encourage, where circumstances permitted, the setting-up of parent-teacher groups or, if you like, simply the calling together of an occasional meeting, if the notion of a regularly-organised group of parents and teachers was not readily acceptable.  I suggest a supplementary circular, therefore, to be sent to school managers by the Minister, mentioning the advantages of such parent-teacher associations as they are seen in other countries&mdash;in America, in Britain&mdash;and saying that he would view with approval the setting-up of such groups, wherever possible, in our national schools.  I believe that such a supplementary circular would produce most useful results, and produce more response in the early years than even the Minister might expect.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is a reservoir of goodwill there, which can thus be tapped, between teacher and parent. The more they come together and understand each other and co-operate together the better.  These groups could start very simply.  The idea could be fostered, and the practice could be engaged in in a few schools to begin with; and a great deal could be learned from them.</P>
    <P>Nothing but good could accrue from encouraging such mutual understanding and respect, and a responsible and co-operative attitude in the face of the problems of primary education, which are, after all, the common concern of teachers, parents, managers and the Department of Education.  For these reasons I propose this motion, and I venture to express the hope that it may be accepted by the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I should like to congratulate Senator Sheehy Skeffington on his statement which was very fine, thoughtful and constructive.  It is obvious that he <Col N="91" /> believes whole-heartedly in what he said.  We must all agree that he has given us a very fine exposition and I agree with it completely.</P>
      <P>I notice in rural areas a very great demand and interest in education generally.  There has been a far greater demand for it and interest in it by parents in the country generally in the past five years than heretofore.  I see that the vocational schools in my county are packed out.  They cannot hold all those who desire to be admitted. There is a greater demand for scholarships.  There is a greater effort by parents to send their children to secondary schools.  Because I see that awakening of a desire for further education and a further understanding of the principles and difficulties of education, I feel the motion should be supported and should have the support of the Minister.</P>
      <P>If it is understood from the start that the parent-teacher groups will not interfere in any way with the work of the teacher, then the work of the teacher which the Department has given him to do should be made easier.  If that is understood by both the parent and the teacher, I think such a group idea can be and ought to be encouraged At the start of such a group, one might come across the troublesome types of parents, to whom Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred, who might think they could interfere with the work of the Department.  The position should be understood by both parties from the outset.  The wiser and more sensible parents, who constitute the majority, would see that it was observed from the start.  Assuming that to be the position, such groups could be a very great help to the teacher, to the school and to the parish.  The Minister could see to it that the position would clearly be understood by both groups from the start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from what might be done by the two groups, a great deal depends on the pupil.  The parent would meet the teacher and they could pool their knowledge.  Every child is an individual. It is very important that it <Col N="92" /> should be understood by the teacher and sometimes by the parent as well. I know of an instance where an extraordinarily shy child&mdash;shy to the point of its being nearly a great drawback to the child&mdash;was brought on by a teacher to whom this had been explained beforehand.  That sort of outlook should be encouraged in any school.  Such groups, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington says, may not always be encouraged by the teacher or by the manager, but if they had a general blessing, as it were, from the Minister and the Department such groups could spread.  Not alone could they be of advantage to the pupil but they could be a terrific advantage to the school and to the amenities of the school, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington has read from the report on education, and to the activities outside the school.</P>
    <P>That is a part of the national school education which is very sadly lacking in rural areas.  I wonder in how many national schools in the country are the pupils brought together for any educational or semi-educational tours or lectures, or such gatherings, after school hours.  The number must be very small, even of cases of senior classes being brought to the Spring Show.  Latterly, some small moves have been made in that direction but they have been very minor.  It should be part of our educational system to bring children on tours to see large farms, agricultural colleges or shows. That is a very important part of education and should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>It is the sort of thing that parent-teacher groups could encourage and arrange with the teachers' consent and approval.  It is very difficult for teachers to organise when they do not know the parents or the conditions of their pupils' homes.  We would hope that such groups could arrange tours of that nature so that the pupils will not merely be sent home after school hours and forgotten until 9 o'clock or 10 o'clock next morning.  If such groups had been in existence in the past, a great many of our country schools would not have got into the condition in which they are.  Local groups would have taken an interest in seeing that their schools did not deteriorate physically to the extent to <Col N="93" /> which sometimes they are allowed to deteriorate.  When they are allowed to deteriorate, we turn to the Department and say we want a new school.  The school could be the centre of the parish, the centre for everyone, where the parents could go to discuss the school and it would be an encouragement to the pupils to be better citizens and perhaps the parents also, in that they would take an interest in the education of their own parish and the country generally.  I heartily support Senator Sheehy Skeffington's motion.</P>

      <P>Very well, to the manager.  Although we have heard a very interesting statement from Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I think he left us more or less in the dark with regard to the real functions of these committees. I was disappointed with his speech.  I thought he would throw a lot of light on the wonderful things these parent-teacher groups were going to accomplish, but so far as I could make out, the principal activity turned out to be a form of jamboree in the schoolhouse at which there would be an informal meeting once or twice for a discussion between parents and teachers: there would be a talk on some educational topic and then a break for tea and after tea, there would be a general discussion again.  What the topics were to be, or what were the grave problems which Senator Sheehy Skeffington visualises a parent-teacher committee dealing effectively with, was not made clear, but I have a feeling based on the old proverbs that too many cooks spoil the broth and that what is everybody's business is nobody's business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the feeling that parent-teacher <Col N="94" /> committees would turn out to be the thin end of the wedge which would play hell with our system of education as it is organised in the primary schools and as it is run today.  It would be no harm if, just for the record and to avoid confusion of thought in regard to this matter, we remembered that under the present system, we have great freedom in educational matters in the primary schools.  We must remember that the school is vested in the manager&mdash;the State only pays the salaries of the teachers&mdash;but the Minister has one particular individual in the parish running that school with whom he can do business.  He has not got eight or ten, nor has the teacher eight or ten different bosses as would undoubtedly result eventually&mdash;I am not saying immediately, but eventually &mdash;from one of these parent-teacher committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Senator Sheehy Skeffington's view.  I have long experience of what might be described as infiltration and we know exactly what use could be made of that to wreck the whole system of education. The State's job in regard to schools, in regard to managers, in regard to teachers, through the inspectors and through the Department officials, is to see that the programme of instruction is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to these parent-teacher groups in the United States of America and gave a quotation which was interesting in itself, but I should like to insist that the system which we have evolved here of managerial control of the schools and the operation of managerial supervision is a unique system.  It is an Irish system; it is of native growth and is not precisely the same in any part of the world.  Before we consider setting up any of these parent-teacher groups, it would be well to remember that long before the National Board &mdash;in the days of the British occupation&mdash;was established, there were almost 12,000 parish schools supported by the people, organised by the <Col N="95" /> people and run by the people.  There were 30 convent schools and 11 State schools, all maintained by the people, with the objective of giving general instruction and religious knowledge to the children.</P>
    <P>This was done often in the face of great difficulties and it was only when the National Board met the requirements of the people and of the clergy that the people accepted the new national school system.  That national school system, with all due respect to its critics, has worked very well indeed here.  So far as I can judge from my contacts throughout the country&mdash; and I have many&mdash;there does not appear to me to be any great demand for anything like either a revolutionary or a small change such as is proposed in Senator Sheehy Skeffington's motion.  I have not found any outcry on the part of the people, nor on the part of the teachers, for any such innovation as these parent-teacher committees. As I said, the system has served the people well in the past.  It is serving them well to-day and I personally cannot see what useful functions these committees can perform, but I do see what they could lead to.</P>
    <P>I see they could eventually become the dictators of the parish.  They could become a menace.  It could happen that the members of these committees would feel they had a right to extend or curtail the time devoted to any subject being taught in the parish school.  The members of these committees might decide how the teacher should address his school, how he should spend his spare time, what games the pupils should go to and what places he should frequent.  They might even insist on having a veto on his teaching and question his methods. Once they got going on that, you have the thin edge of the wedge which opens the floodgates and torpedoes the whole system of education as we have it in this country to-day.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied anyhow that the present system, without these teacher-parent committees, is working very well and that there is really no need whatever for them.  In relation to our <Col N="96" /> people's insistence upon education for their children, it might be remembered that at the time when there was little or no education in Europe, our people got education for their children and they value it.  Even at the dawn of liberty, equality and fraternity, I should like to remind Senators that the great Voltaire taught that one pen was enough for 200 or 300 hands while his contemporary, Rousseau, thought at the same time that the poor had no need of education.</P>
    <P>Our people never took that attitude and the system which we have evolved here, the system of managerial control of schools without interference, provides that every denomination rules its own school, that the managers are the pastors of whatever religious group the school is intended for.  That system has resulted in the elimination of any discrimination in regard to education here.  All managers are not angels.  Undoubtedly, quite a number of things that could be done possibly in regard to the maintenance of schools might be better done, but there is no doubt whatever in my mind that if a group such as is visualised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington were to assume authority to hold meetings in schools, to question the curriculum and to make, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington says, suggestions, they would not stop at suggestions.  There is no doubt in my mind that would be dangerous and I am totally opposed to the idea.  Whether the Minister finds it possible to do so or not, I personally would be very much opposed to it.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington seemed to have the idea that we need these parent-teacher committees so that parents could get a proper understanding and comprehension of what is happening in the schools.  Parents do not need that.  I do not know whether he is speaking for Dublin or the country.  Down the country, parents do not need that sort of mumbo-jumbo. They know the teacher and the teacher knows them.  They go into the schools.  They can also do that in the city.  Any citizen can go into any school and he does not need to <Col N="97" /> be a parent.  He can go into any classroom and just stand there and so long as he or she does not interfere with the teachers in the exercise of their duties, nobody can stop him.  There is nothing secretive about the national schools or the conditions of the national schools.  There is no need for committees because parents have the right to visit the national schools and can visit them whenever they like.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington seems to think that there was an atmosphere of unease and distrust and that parents were grumbling.  I do not know how he got that idea.  He quoted the school strikes and the removal by parents of their children because of bad conditions. There is no doubt in the world that there are bad schools in the country.  There is no doubt that hundreds of schools are still in need of a large amount of repairs.  We need hundreds of brand new schools.  The British left us a legacy in the form of a shortage of schools which we have not overtaken yet, but the idea that parent-teacher committees are the solution to all our problems is nonsense.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amenities of which the Senator spoke, there are in every part of this country branches of Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe, Muintir na Tire and guilds of this kind and that.  In every parish, you have young farmers' organisations and all the rest of it.  They have as much interest in seeing that the school buildings are well kept and that the school surroundings are well kept as anybody else.  I have no doubt that where these are active they will attend to the needs of the schools in their districts, as they attend to needs in other respects.</P>
    <P>Many parents, according to Senator Sheehy Skeffington, hesitate to go to the manager to make a complaint.  I am afraid he does not know the country very well because the manager is the parish priest or the rector and in all cases the parents know the manager very well indeed and the manager knows them.  He knows practically every child that goes to the school.  He visits the school.  I do not <Col N="98" /> see that there is any possibility that anything could be slipped across without the knowledge of the manager or the parents.  The parents, according to Senator Sheehy Skeffington in relation to national schools, feel rather pushed aside and there is no way of consulting their views.  Their views on what?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a curriculum laid down by the State, by the Department of Education.  That curriculum must be followed by the teachers in every school.  What need is there for parent-teacher meetings to discuss one aspect or another of that curriculum that cannot be done through correspondence with those responsible for it or cannot be done by way of a public meeting or by a discussion group in the various societies which exist in the parish?</P>
      <P>I do not see in what way this parent-teacher group could have any effective role in regard to the curriculum.  I do not see that a teacher could tolerate the intrusion into the school of a group of these self-appointed committee-men who would insist, for instance, on deciding that, perhaps, two or three of the pupils did not look so well and should be sent home early.  If there is to be divided control in the schools, if the teacher is not to be responsible for the class and if he is to be subjected to interference outside the educational sphere, then certainly the primary schools of this country will fall into chaotic conditions. There will be no education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that we should not tamper with the system as it exists.  It is a good system.  There is no reason in the world why any parent should have a grievance that cannot be attended to and brought to the notice of the manager, and certainly the teachers are not so far distant from the parents, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington ought to know, that there need be any hesitation on the part of the parents or of any citizen in consulting the teacher or the manager.  We have not got any sort of hierarchy here that is so far above the common people in education that they are unapproachable. <Col N="99" /> Teachers and managers are human beings, and if the parents can approach them, I do not see that the problem arises at all and that there is any need whatever for the proposition put forward by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.</P>
    <P>All over the world today there is unrest.  There is trouble about education in many countries.  In this country, we have a system which works well.  It puts the heads of education in the position that they know whom to negotiate with, whom they can hold responsible in any parish for any school.  The teacher has one boss.  The teacher knows that provided he carries out his duties and sticks to the curriculum, that is all he has to do to ensure that there will be no discomfort in his job.  Introduction of this parent committee business would lead to the other position which I pointed out at the start, not immediately but eventually, and the present system of management of our schools would eventually be upset and we would have then, in effect, what would be Soviet committees in every parish.  I am very much against this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to this discussion and, like Senator Ó Maoláin, I find it rather difficult to pin down what exactly these committees are to do.  Parent-teacher organisation is a rather nice idea, in theory, but unfortunately it does not very often work out that way.  I have seen it in action in the United States, and I certainly do not wish to see any such development here or that any innocuous type of organisation should develop here that might ultimately degenerate into the type of pressure group to be found in the United States in these parent-teacher organisations. I have seen these organisations and the way they act.  I do not think Senator Ó Maoláin was too strong when he spoke of acting as the Gestapo over the teachers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry&mdash; Soviet-style committee was the phrase <Col N="100" /> used by the Senator.  I have seen those committees and the terror in which the teachers live by reason of their existence, in that they are liable to be fired by the influence of those committees on the school board, because these committees play a leading part in electing the school board, and the primary purpose, if you wish to sum it up, is really to get control of the schools system.  That is what it is working out at in the United States.  You have some good areas, but you have areas where the most crackpot ideas get abroad and usually the school superintendent is fired to mark the inauguration of the new idea and the new committee that steps into office as a result of the activities of the local parent-teacher organisation.  I have seen them.</P>
      <P>Perhaps Senator Sheehy Skeffington may not have read about the celebrated Pasadena case.  I was there when it happened and I kept in touch with the gyrations in that district for a couple of years afterwards.  I do not think we should lend our support here to the inauguration of any general system that would have even the remotest possibility of developing into such a pressure group here.</P>
      <P>What can such a system do here? It seems that one of the high points raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington was that there were minor points that they may like to raise or discuss. Surely if they are minor points they are points for discussion between individuals, not points in respect of which you need the elaborate mechanism of a committee and all the power of a committee decision behind you to get any justice or any amelioration. Knowing rural conditions pretty well, and also knowing conditions in Cork city quite well, I know that the teachers are not in any way remote from the parents.  They are all known to one another in the same organisations in the parish and elsewhere.  They meet quite often in all forms of activities, and parents are not slow to go and talk to the teachers and ask how the pupils are getting on and, in general, deal with any of these minor points likely to arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any necessity for that; and, incidentally, in the United States, in those parent-teacher organisations which are set as a headline for us, all their work is a matter of the individual teacher meeting individual parent and discussing how the child is getting on.  Most of the teachers find that they have to spend far too much time trying to persuade a parent that his son has about 20 points I.Q. better than he actually has.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point made is that they might be of some use in exercising their influence on the curriculum.  In fact, they make the curriculum through the school board in the United States.  Here, as pointed out by Senator Ó Maoláin, they have no possibility whatever of doing that.  The courses are laid down solely by the Department of Education. If I were to quarrel with the present system, I would quarrel with it on some of those grounds, that it is far too centralised in that respect, that there is too little local autonomy and too much time spent framing a uniform system for the young lad going out to earn his living on the farm or the lad going to school in the city who will ultimately become a medical specialist in the city.  I do not, however, see that the parent-teacher organisations would have anything to contribute to that matter.</P>
      <P>Another point made was regarding discipline.  Discipline, again, is something that is really tied up with the emotional and other problems of the child, and is a matter for private serious consultation between the teacher and the parent concerned, not to be explored and solemnly pronounced upon by a committee drawn from the whole parish before which one would try one's child.  Again, I do not see that it has any use whatever in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point made was that these <Col N="102" /> committees would contribute to the amenities of the school.  Certainly many of our schools require a great deal more amenities than they have. In many cases, there is a lack of finance.  If a parish has amenities and if it is developing, so will the school. Consequently, any development of that type is work for parish organisations as a whole, particularly an organisation like Muintir na Tíre which has done so much with regard to the raising of amenities.  Having raised the general parish amenities, they will turn their efforts to the schools.  It all goes hand in hand and step by step, and thank God that is the way rural Ireland has been progressing over past years.</P>
    <P>I believe we can feel confidence in our system as it is, and we can feel a high confidence in the spirit of selfhelp and independence which is showing itself in our parishes.  We can feel confident also that the growing spirit of education, and the growing realisation of the necessity for education beyond the national school level will show themselves in high standards for pupils and teachers, better facilities for our teachers, smaller classes, and so on, all of which we hope we will be able to provide as our economy develops.</P>
    <P>I think there is little to be gained from the creation of a parent-teacher organisation of the type envisaged. Above all, such an organisation would be fraught with grave dangers, an organisation whose secret purpose could be nothing less than the ultimate control of our school system and the disruption of the managerial system as it now stands.  I should like to echo the feelings of most Senators with regard to the deep debt we owe to our unpaid managers.  I deplore the avidity with which little incidents here and there are seized upon as a stick to try to beat or discredit our managerial system.  There must be failures; there must be occasional faults in any system; but our system, as a whole, has withstood the test of time, and, given adequate finance and a little more local control and local voice in shaping the curricula to some extent, <Col N="103" /> I have no doubt that it can play its full part in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom focal nó dhó a rá mar gheall ar an dtairiscint seo.  Táim le tamall anuas ag éisteacht leis na hóráideacha a rinne Seanadóirí ag moladh an Aire. Tháinig an tAire go dtí an Seanad uaidh féin.  Maidir le ceist na gcoistí seo, tá gléas ann cheana atá dhá oibriú go sásúil.  Gléas is ea é atá fé stiúradh na mbainisteoirí agus na Roinne Oideachais.</P>
      <P>Do thug an Seanadóir Sheehy Skeffington pictiúir dúinn agus ba thaitneamhach é dá mbeadh sé ar siúl leis an dea-mhéinn, leis an dea-chroí agus leis an éirim maitheasa a bhí ina smaointe sin.  Ach is dóigh liomsa&mdash; táim cinnte dhe&mdash;nár mhaith an rud in aon pharóiste sa tír agus i bparóistí uile na tíre coiste a bhunú go mbeadh aon chuid den smaoineamh acu go raibh stiúradh ná comhairle ná riar oideachais na bun-scoile acu.  Ní fhanfadh sé mar sin.  Sé nádúr an duine go mbíonn sé ag iarraidh i gcómhnaí a chrobhanna a shíneadh amach chun níos mó ná a bhí aige cheana a ghreamú dó féin.  Sin é a thárlódh i leith coiste dá léithéid sin. Do thuigfidís go mbeadh údarás acu rudaí a dhéanamh atá dhá riaradh go héifeachtúil cheana ag an dá dhreamh atá ann.  Ní chomhairleoinn don Aire an cúram sin a ghlacadh air féin.  De réir mar tá sé fé láthair is féidir le haon bhainisteoir coiste paróiste a chur ar bun ar mhaithe le cóiriú na scoile, maisiú na scoile, deisiú rudaí agus airgead a sholathár chun neithe a chur ar fáil don scoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is féidir le bainisteoir ar bith é sin a dhéanamh agus déarfainn go mbeadh bainisteoirí sásta go leor é a dhéanamh in a lán áiteanna.  Ní dóigh liom gur gnó é gur cheart don Aire a cheann <Col N="104" /> a sháthadh isteach ann go hoifigiúil mar do bhainfí na cluasa dhe dá gceapfadh na daoine go raibh sé ag cur isteach ar rud éigin.  Bíodh gur bhreágh liom dá mbeadh coiste paróiste ann ar mhaithe leis an scoil agus chun cabhrú leis an scoil, níor mhaith an scéal é go mbeadh údarás acu san cur isteach ar riar oideachais na scoile, ar obair na múinteoirí, ar údarás an bhainisteora ná ar údarás na Roinne Oideachais&mdash;rud a dhéanfaidís dá gceapfaidís go mbeadh an t-údarás acu.</P>
    <P>Gheobhfá ina lán coistí daoine a thuigfeadh go raibh an t-údarás sin acu nó gur ceart go mbeadh an t-údarás sin acu agus a bheadh dhá gcur féin in iúl agus is gearr go mbeadh ceist an oideachais ina cúrsa achrainn poiblí.  Dob fhearr an cheist a fhágáil mar atá sé agus dícheall a dhéanamh chun an obair a stiúradh tríd an ngléas atá ann chun an scéal a fheabhsú san áit ina bhfuil se gan feabhsú nó é a dhéanamh níos fearr san áit ina bhfuil sé go maith.  Tá gléas bunscoilaíochta againn chomh maith le gléas ar bith eile dá shamhail in áit ar bith ar fuaid an domhain. Ní haon mhaitheas bheith ag caint ar nithe i Meiriceá.  Tá sé tugtha fé ndeara, tá sé ar eolas, ag daoine a bhfuil baint acu leis an dá rud, gur fearr bunoideachas anseo ná mar atá sé i Meiriceá, dá fheabhas an chaint.</P>
