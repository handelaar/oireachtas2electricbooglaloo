      <P>Business will be taken as follows: Nos.  1, 2, 3, 4, and 12.  It is proposed to take No. 12 with No. 3.  It is proposed to take No. 4 at 7 o'clock, after tea, and in view of its urgency, to finish all Stages to-night, if the House agrees.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is at all appropriate to lump No.  12 &mdash;Senator Quinlan's motion on the Common Market&mdash;in with the Appropriation Bill.  I heard this morning that they were to be taken together. As has been said previously, the House does not meet so often and this extremely important matter should be divorced from the Appropriation Bill.  We have heard a great deal in this country about the Department of Finance arrogating to itself the right to dictate what should happen here and there but it is the limit when a motion relating to the Common Market is added on to the Appropriation Bill.  It is carrying the thing altogether too far, in my opinion. Moreover, except for the purpose of lumping them together for discussion, there is no connection whatsoever between the two matters.</P>

      <P>I should like to take the opportunity of thanking the Minister for undertaking to investigate the quality of Irish petrol. I hope that his investigations will include performance tests as well as analyses of the octane ratio and so on.  The fact is that a good deal gets past these chemical analyses and what matters to the common people of Ireland is that they should get as good mileage as the people of Britain and that their engines should do as well on Irish petrol as on British petrol.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that, in my opinion, this Finance Bill is, from the social point of view, one of the most reactionary Finance Bills ever introduced in this country.  In essence, what is in the Bill? The Minister is to give a concession to income tax payers of a couple of million of pounds per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is news anyway, that a reduction in income tax is reactionary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Senator has read the Bill or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator will let me finish my argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he will then perhaps see what I mean by the reactionary nature of it.  The other end of the Bill means, in essence, an increase in the duty on tobacco <Col N="1332" /> which will bring in, I think, £1.2 million per year.  The purpose of that in theory&mdash;and of course it is a completely reactionary theory&mdash;is that some part of it will be given in the form of social welfare benefits.  I would object to it even if the entire amount it yielded were given in the form of social welfare benefits because it is a wrong approach in state finances, completely wrong in its essence, but it is doubly objectionable when in fact all the Minister is giving to the social welfare beneficiaries is half the amount he will collect from the tax and is giving the other half somewhere else.</P>
      <P>The pretence is that this concession on all sides to the income tax payers is to develop the economy and that it is offset, on the other hand, by these miserable concessions to the social welfare recipients, concessions which do not even compensate them for the increase in the cost of living over the past 12 months.  That is what makes it an extremely reactionary Bill.  If the Minister should find himself back in office after the next election, it would not surprise me in the least to find him coming back to the House in November in the same way as another Chancellor had to go back to Parliament yesterday across the water.</P>
      <P>It is very well and fine to talk about this increase in social welfare benefits but the fact is that the persons who have to make social welfare contributions&mdash;I am talking about the workers &mdash;have had their contributions increased already this year from 2/9d. to 4/9d.  And for what?  In fact, to make payments to people, payments to which those old people had not contributed at all, the so-called contributory pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it is. There is reference to social welfare contributions in this Finance Bill in Section 10&mdash;contributions and benefits under the Social Welfare Acts&mdash;and I am putting those matters together.  Do not forget that those paying these increased social welfare contributions <Col N="1333" /> each week will not get anything back out of it for 30 or 40 years, the great bulk of them.  If the Minister had given these miserable increases in social welfare benefits without putting this penny on tobacco and without putting part of the yield of it somewhere else, I would have said: &ldquo;Well, this is some concession to the people who are paying large increases for which they will get nothing for many years to come, the great bulk of them, unless they happen to become ill or unemployed.&rdquo; In a normal community like this, many people go right through until they draw their old age pensions without becoming ill for any lengthy period and without being unemployed.</P>
      <P>Take another example.  Take the stamp duties in Part IV, Section 29&mdash; Termination of Stamp Duty on Receipts. We all know that there was evasion of an objectionable kind with this small stamp duty.  We also all know it was a bit of a nuisance.  The ordinary person in the community who has to pay an extra 1d. on his cheque will make a much bigger contribution to this than the great semi-State organisations.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, the E.S.B. which will benefit enormously out of it.  It will not have to stamp any receipts for payment of electricity bills from now on.  It would issue infinitely more receipts than make payments.  Therefore, it will gain very substantially. In other words, small though it may be, it is a reactionary transfer of taxation.  It is regressive and an example of the Tory mind.  Why did the Minister simply not abolish the blooming duty and leave it at that? I suppose he will say he could not afford to lose the £100,000, or something like that.  Then we hear that there is not 1d. for anything or that there is too much money: you go from one extreme to another within a period of a few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal of discussion about stamp duty on cheques and its abolition on receipts.  For a very long time, there was no stamp duty at all on cheques in many countries. It was not until just before the recent war that a small stamp duty was imposed in the United States.  A penny <Col N="1334" /> would be sufficient, if one thinks of it.  As somebody has pointed out, this rate of stamp duty on cheques is the highest rate in the world.  That being so, I take it that our cheques are by no means the largest in the world. In the western world today, the ordinary cheques passing in this country must be the lowest except in the United States where the habit grew up, when they were free of duty, of writing cheques for as low as a dollar in big numbers.  This has a double effect.  It is the highest rate in the world.  With the exception of the United States, we use cheques for smaller sums than other countries.  This adds up to an extremely reactionary Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I raised the question of certain amendments to the section dealing with death duties, that is, that a widow with children entitled to refunds under the Income Tax Acts, that is, children under 16 years of age or children undergoing a full-time course of instruction, should be regarded as different from other people, that it would be simple to make the widow not liable for the first £3,000 and each child not liable for £2,000 and £1,000.  Has the Minister given any consideration to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator Stanford, I made some inquiries&mdash;I cannot say they were exhaustive.  I was not able to verify what Senator Stanford said that the quality of petrol here is lower than that of petrol in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.  We have not got the highest grade of petrol but the first grade here is the same grade as is sold across the Border and in England. My information is that it is much the same; I am told it is the very same.  I do not mean to drop the inquiry at that stage; I intend to go a little further.  The Senator also said it is dearer here but that does not hold any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator O'Donovan, I think what I said about the tobacco tax was that half of it was devoted to relief for farmers and the other half to extra benefits for social welfare <Col N="1335" /> classes, which I still believe was well worthwhile.  The purchaser of cigarettes or tobacco can regulate his purchases and buy a little less, if he thinks well of it.  Both the farmers and the social welfare classes needed some help, I considered, at the time of the Budget.  There was an estimated increase in the yield from income tax. Part of that was devoted to concessions on income tax but, even with the concessions, there will be an increase in the yield from income tax during the coming year, I expect.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the Senator's attack on the increase in contributions for social welfare payers in order to give them a contributory old age pension. The Senator's point was that the person who is paying that contribution now may not benefit for 30 to 40 years to come.  He may benefit much sooner. That is a feature of every superannuation scheme.  We cannot very well bring in a superannuation scheme that will become payable, say, six or seven years before the benefit accrues.  It always applies to the people in the particular occupation, whatever it may be, and it is lighter in that way.  It is a feature of every superannuation scheme I know of.</P>
    <P>Removing the stamp duty on receipts and putting an extra 1d on the cheque is leaving the transaction 1d less.  A person signs a cheque.  It costs him 1d more.  He gets a receipt back which costs 2d. less to the person who gets the money.  If the ordinary laws of commerce work, with the costs and so on of the businessman determining the price of the article, there should be a slight gain in the transaction as a result of this change.  I agree with the Senator that there was a great deal of evasion of the law relating to stamped receipts.  It is a good thing, if at all possible, to get rid of these means of evasion.  It is a much better thing to have a system under which the law will be obeyed.  I think it will be obeyed, now that the stamp duty comes on the cheque instead.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes raised a question, which indeed appeared to me to be a case that would excite anybody's interest, of a person leaving an estate, <Col N="1336" /> especially a young person with a wife and family, and felt that there should be some easement of death duties, whether it would be done according to age or whatever way it might be done.  As the law stands, there is a considerable advantage in the case of an estate left to a wife and children. Let us take the ordinary estate duty first.  In the case of ordinary estate duty, let us say, a man dies and leaves his place to his nephew.  Death duty there is paid if the estate is worth more than £5,000.  The nephew who inherits also pays five per cent. legacy duty.</P>
    <P>In the case of a man leaving a wife and family behind and leaving all his estate to them, it is true that he pays the same amount of death duty&mdash;if it is more than £5,000, he has to pay death duty&mdash;but there is no legacy duty payable up to £15,000, if it is all left to the wife and children. Even if the estate is higher, then the legacy duty would not be charged to any particular individual in the family who receives less than £2,000.  So, the payment therefore is considerably less in the case of an estate left to a wife and family.  That is the position as it stands at present.  However, I do intend to consider the matter raised by Senator Hayes.  I may find that it would be very difficult to do anything about it.  As far as I have studied estate law, it is a difficult matter and to make any exception might land us in endless difficulty.  I am not sure it can be done but I should certainly like to investigate it further.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a word on this.  If the Bill passes now, it will be signed on 1st August by the President and that would appear to many Senators to be all right.  The difficulty is that the law on these receipt duties about which we have been talking, comes into operation either on 1st August or when the Act is passed. The point is that the Revenue Commissioners are very anxious to issue a notice as soon as the Bill is signed and provided it comes into operation on 1st August, drawing attention to the fact that this change is being made on 1st August.  It is for that reason only that I asked the Government for this motion that the Seanad agree that the Bill be signed as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Appropriation Bill is a recurrent annual measure and follows stereotyped lines.  The Bill does four things: (a) it authorises the issue from the Central Fund of a balance for 1960/61 which was granted too late to enable it to be covered by the <Col N="1338" /> Central Fund Act, 1961; (b) it authorises the issue from the Central Fund of the balance of the amount granted for Supply Services for 1961/62, that is, the full amount less that already authorised by the Central Fund Act, 1961; (c) it empowers the Minister for Finance to borrow up to the limit of the issues provided for in (a) and (b); and (d) it appropriates to the several Supply Services the sums granted by the Dáil since the Appropriation Act of 1960.</P>
      <P>The explanation of the individual sections and schedules of the Bill is as follows.  Section 1 authorises the issue of £165,540 from the Central Fund to cover six Supplementary Estimates for 1960/61 which were taken too late to enable them to be covered by the Central Fund Act, 1961. The Supplementary Estimates were: Department of the Taoiseach, £680; Office of the Minister for Finance, £850; Primary Education, £50,000; Secondary Education, £86,000; Technical Instruction, £28,000; and Science and Art £10, making a total of £165,540.</P>
      <P>Section 2 authorises the issue of £88,164,660 from the Central Fund for 1961/62, thus supplementing the issue of £43,532,880 already authorised by the Central Fund Act, 1961, and bringing the total of authorised issues for the year to £131,717,540.  This last mentioned amount, representing the cost of the Supply Services in the current financial year, comprises (1) the total of £131,715,520 for the Supply Services shown in the Estimates Volume 1961/62 and (2) three Supplementary Estimates of £2,020.  Section 3 empowers the Minister for Finance to borrow up to £88,350,200, being the total of the amounts authorised by Sections 1 and 2 to be issued out of the Central Fund.  The Minister is already authorised by the Central Fund Act, 1961, to borrow up to the limit of the sum authorised by that Act to be issued from the Central Fund for 1961/62, that is, £49,385,702.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In previous years, this section contained a clause specifically removing the restrictions imposed by an Act of the Irish Parliament in 1781-82 on lending by the Bank of Ireland to the <Col N="1339" /> Government.  This restriction is being abolished by Section 37 of the Finance Bill, 1961, and the bank is being placed permanently in the same position in the matter of lending to the Government as other banks.  It is accordingly no longer necessary to refer in this Bill to the restriction.</P>
    <P>Section 4 appropriates to the specific services set out in Schedule B the sum of £137,735,902, which is the aggregate amount required for the Supply Services for 1961/62 of £131,717,540, the Supplementary and Additional Estimates of 1960/61 of £6,011,425 which have not yet been appropriated because they were introduced after the passage of the Appropriation Act, 1960, and the Excess Vote for External Affairs for 1959/60 of £6,937 agreed by the Dáil on 23rd February, 1961.  The section also authorises the use of certain departmental receipts as appropriations-in-aid of the specific services mentioned in Schedule B.</P>
    <P>Schedule A gives particulars of the issue out of the Central Fund authorised by the Central Fund Act, 1961, and the Bill and Schedule B sets out in detail the specific services to which the sums granted are to be appropriated and so forms the basis of the audit of the Appropriation Accounts carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>With regard to the procedure relative to this Bill, with which it is proposed to take Senator Quinlan's motion, relating to Ireland's membership of the Common Market, only one motion can be before the House at the time and that is No. 3 on the Order Paper&mdash;Appropriation Bill, 1961, Second Stage.  Then No. 12 may be discussed concurrently with the Second Stage of the Bill.  When a decision has been taken on the Second Stage of this measure, the Senator who has tabled the motion may get a decision on his motion, if he so desires.  It will be formally moved as soon as the Second Stage of the Bill has been disposed of and a division will be given, if desired, without further discussion.</P>

      <P>This is the second part of the present financial proceedings in this House and with the Fianna Fáil Party in office, it is by far the most important part.  As I said on the Finance Bill, we have had what, in my opinion, is a most wasteful period of expenditure in the past couple of years.  It has been based fundamentally on the huge increase in stock exchange prices in Britain, the prosperity, in inverted commas, and the you-never-had-it-so-good attitude which terminated yesterday evening.</P>
      <P>I had the pleasure of looking at a television programme last night.  I notice that these people who work in television have the reputation of being a little left wing.  I was amused that when the outside commentator approached a gentleman with a black bowler hat, striped trousers and rolled umbrella, he got a dreadful shock. He asked: &ldquo;What do you think, Sir, of what the Chancellor of the Exchequer did?&rdquo;  The man in the bowler hat and striped trousers replied: &ldquo;Bloody awful.  I have got it here in the paper.  I have not read it all properly yet but I am going to study it when I go home.  I think it is terrible.&rdquo; That was the answer of the best man the commentator could meet up with. They also got Sir Thomas Myles for a comment afterwards.  I must admit that he expressed the same comment as occurred to myself.  He thought it was &ldquo;the mixture as before.&rdquo;  That is exactly what it is.  If there had even been a capital gains tax, nothing would have been lost because from now on there will be no gains at all.  I am not going to delay on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Leader of the House for his good advice!  Let me get back to the Appropriation Bill.  I remember when the Minister for Finance came to this House after his first year in office.  I said he certainly brought in a better Finance Bill than his Fianna Fáil predecessor had brought in in 1952.  He replied that if he did as well as his predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, he would do very well indeed.  He is beginning to rival his predecessor very closely.</P>
      <P>The position is this.  The Appropriation Bill for 1956-57 provided for issues out of the Central Fund of £73,000,000 during that year and this Bill provides for issues out of the Fund of £88 million during the current year. Appropriations for the Supply Services amounted to £115 millions in 1956-57 and this year they amount to £138 millions.</P>
      <P>That increase is close on £40 millions.  You get much the same kind of figure if you approach it in a different way.  One might argue that the national income has gone up from £450 millions to £525 millions.  That is only about 15 per cent.  There is no doubt that both taxation and expenditure have gone up by 20 per cent.  If we take it that the farmers pay on the same basis and receive much the same kind of amount out of this appropriation as they did formerly, we find one fact, that is, that the farming community have had no increase in their incomes and have to bear additions of 20 per cent. in the way of the Government end of things.  The Government have put up charges by 20 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the expenditure. I referred to the amount of <Col N="1342" /> benefit the farmers get and I related that to the amount they must pay out.  They must pay their proportion. If they get a disproportionate amount of benefit, to that extent their position might not be as bad as it obviously is.  A great deal of this expenditure is related to the agricultural community.</P>
      <P>When the Minister came into office, the net expenditure, allowing for the food subsidies, was about £100 million per year, that is to say, on the Supply Services; it is now in round figures £130 million.  What is the position we have?  If we analyse it, it is this. Between 1951 and 1954, again allowing for the food subsidies, the Minister's predecessor put up expenditure by £40 millions.  That figure was accepted by the Minister a couple of years ago. Between 1954 and 1957, an inter-Party Government were in office, that dreadful Government about which Senator Lenihan so often speaks&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was called a safety valve.  Between 1954 and 1957, there was an increase of 14 per cent. in import prices.  Government expenditure went up by £5 million, from £100 million to £105 million again allowing for the food subsidies.  The Minister comes in between 1957 and 1961 and in four years, the expenditure on the Supply Services is up by £30 million.  He is not quite as efficient a waster of money as Deputy MacEntee was when he was Minister for Finance but he is pushing him close.  The longer it goes, the closer the Minister gets to his Fianna Fail predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the decade as a whole, the years 1951 to 1961.  We find that of a total increase of £75 millions per <Col N="1343" /> annum of Government expenditure on the Supply Services, the Fianna Fáil Party are responsible for £70 million. That is a pretty good record.  If you think of the decade as a whole, the Fianna Fáil Party have pushed up Government expenditure by £70 million. I am not interested in the exact value of the pound.  The pounds are not the same pounds all the time.  It is the elastic pound again.  What I am interested in is the proportion for which they are responsible.  They have been in office two-thirds of the period and they are responsible for fourteen-fifteenths of the substantial increase&mdash; the great bulk of it.</P>
    <P>Taking the Government as being one and indivisible in this matter of responsibility, we had the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, in his farewell message to his constituency, saying that the explanation of what happened between 1957 and 1959 is that it took them three years to clean up the mess left behind by the previous government. All I can say is that that is the type of statement which makes the word &ldquo;politician&rdquo; stink in the nostrils of most decent people in this country. That is the kind of statement that is irresponsible, false, and completely contrary to all decency.</P>

      <P>We agreed that expenditure, allowing for the £10 million subsidies abolished in 1952, went up 30 million.  That is £40 million. It went up £30 million.  Add £10 million&mdash;this is an in-and-out transaction&mdash;and that is £40 million.  When the Minister came into office, expenditure was about £109 millions.</P>

When I take about £130 million, I am giving him a little &ldquo;tilly&rdquo;, to use a Dublin phrase, a little tuileadh on it.  I am making him a present of a few million pounds.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go back over where the 40 comes from.  The Minister accepted it on a previous Finance Bill.  He did not query it at all.  Fianna Fáil were responsible for fourteen-fifteenths of Government expenditure over the past decade and, mind you, being in office during the two best periods.  In the period 1951 to 1954, the Korean war was over and imports were declining in price hand over fist.  They were taking a nose dive when Deputy MacEntee came in, yet expenditure went up £40 million.  It is the craziest example of finance I ever saw.</P>
      <P>The Minister was lucky when he came into office.  He was able to do what the Conservatives did in England between 1952 and 1954.  He was able to batten on a period of declining prices, a period when there was an enormous improvement in the balance of payments, brought about by a fall in import prices and the elimination of income tax on profits made from new exports.  Only that taxation was eliminated, our manufacturers, our exporting companies, would have been quite content to sit down on their fannies instead of going out after the extra money, but they did it and I want to give them credit for it.  It showed what you can do if you put something worth working for before people.</P>
      <P>Might I say by way of addendum that the Commission on Taxation reported to the previous Government against making such a concession to exporters but the Government then in office took the decision.  I do not see Fianna Fáil going against the managers.  Judging by the comments I have heard in this and in the other House, no matter what the managers want to do, Fianna Fáil say, &ldquo;go ahead and do it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As a result, of course, of this increase in expenditure, instead of the cost of living having gone down in this country, we have had a major increase in the cost of living over the past 12 months.  Again, you find the statement by the Central Bank that substantial progress in the past 12 months has been achieved with little rise of inflation.  I do not know.

      <P>The year they did everything wrong, according to Senator Lenihan.  When they took £3 million off, one of the daily newspapers issued a diatribe on the subject by way of leading article.  That same newspaper, when the amount on the face of the Supply Services Estimate was increased this year by £8 million, said everything was grand.  Of course, it was grand because dividends were up and business was booming.  If you have control over sufficient resources, you can get out when the unfortunate people are pushed to the wall in advance of the squeeze and then you can get in, and that is what happens in this kind of system.  I would say that every sentence of the comment at Column 1097 of Vol. No. 11 of the Seanad Debates is wrong and will be proved to be wrong in essence in every part of it before 12 months are over.</P>

      <P>What happened yesterday in another country, there is not the slightest doubt, will seriously affect the financial end of our economy. The election will be over but I do not know at what rate the Minister will be able to raise a loan this year. Again, that has never worried the Fianna Fáil Party.  The age of high money arrived in this country in 1952 with another Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance.  If my statements on this matter are looked back on, I thought this difficulty would arise last Autumn; it would have been far better if it had been attended to last Autumn. At least it is something that, unlike the Directors of the Central Bank of Ireland, I did see coming.  I think the Minister said, half jocosely, when concluding the debate on the Finance <Col N="1349" /> Bill this year that I was always forecasting woes.  That is not correct. However, last year I did say that the measures that were being taken would result in the position being reached where there would be an increase of 10 points in the cost of living index. The increase actually came out at 6 points.  It was not so much an exaggeration.  It was an estimate made long before the event.</P>
      <P>This position now will be-arising out of this&mdash;that the Government will have to go to the country and they will not be able to go on the slogan &ldquo;you have never had it so good.&rdquo;  They will be afraid to go on that slogan.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is all part of the spending spree which is what people do in good times.  I notice one can always estimate when an election is looming up because of the number of Ministers' private secretaries who write to the newspapers. <Col N="1350" /> Recently two letters appeared on the same day.  One was from the Private Secretary to the Minister for Lands dealing with the question of certain lands in north Mayo which consisted of sand dunes and which had been bought by some German at a valuation of £18 or 18s. for the 350 acres. The clear inference I drew from it was that it was an attempt to draw a red herring across these purchases of land by the Germans.</P>
      <P>I am not so often down the country, but my information is that, within the past six months, three large farms in south County Meath, in the Enfield area, have been bought by Germans. These three large farms are, all of them, the best agricultural land in the country and the valuation is not pence per acre but somewhere between 30s. and £2 per acre.  These three farms have been bought in that area.  If the attempt of the Minister for Lands is a pretence that the Germans are buying merely sand dunes on the periphery of the country on which they will spend great sums of foreign capital then all I can say is that they have been buying other land in other parts of the country, particularly County Meath.</P>
      <P>In regard to the amounts of money included in this Appropriation Bill, by way of grants to these foreign companies, one of the best known is that operating at Killarney.  Leaving out the question as to whether they have affected the shore of the lake or not, in reply to a Parliamentary Question we learn that they have got £404,000 of money belonging to the people of Ireland.  What amount of their own money they have put in I cannot say, but I do not think it is very much.  I will come back to the question I asked Senator Lenihan in this context in a moment.  They have got the capital from this country, and, being a new company, their exports are free of tax. All their commodities are exported.  I have never been able to understand why cranes should be manufactured in Killarney of all places.  There are obviously other than economic reasons why it happened, even with a grant of £404,00.  It may have something to do with terms of a peace treaty or something of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> There is evidence on Table 20 of the Central Bank report saying that the imports of capital last year, including capital brought back, was only £1.7 million in 1960 compared with £15 million in 1959 and £17.7 million in 1958. These are the estimates of the balance of payments.  I asked Senator Lenihan specially if he would deal with it since he dealt with it in such detail in previous years.  He did not come back to it at all.  I do not think he would be in order in dealing with it on this Bill at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; I will leave it.  Every form of Government expenditure is in order on this Bill. The Government deserve credit for certain of their actions, I think.  Every Government, I take it, do some things in the economic sphere which are good and take some actions in the social sphere which are good.  The Government are to be commended on their attitude towards education, broadly speaking.  I do not think that the provisions regarding scholarships are adequate.  However, that measure will be before the House shortly and they can be discussed then.  I noticed that the Minister in charge of the Bill felt that it was not all he would like and I agree with him.  The fact is that we can judge a Government only by what they do in the circumstances in which they are in office.  The Minister has been in office during a period when import prices dropped very substantially. Despite that, he has put up expenditure by £30,000,000, that is, the ordinary Supply Services expenditure. I do not think that is a reasonable reaction to this position.  The fact is that the average for import prices at the end of the year 1956 and the beginning of 1957 was indexed at 114; the average last year was 106. That is a very substantial gain in relation to a country which at present is importing about £250,000,000 worth of goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> It means all the commodities imported, and which come under this Bill, all the foreign paper, all the variety of materials for the Army, for the Civil Service, coming from abroad, can be bought cheaper or at least the index indicates that they can be bought cheaper, taking a global view.  You can take it the Government imports all kinds of goods.  The Post Office Stores deal with very nearly all items because they buy for all the other Government Departments.  If in such circumstances the Government, owing to their own actions, put up the cost of living, the consumer price index goes up.  In 1956, it was 107 and in 1960, it was up to 117, about ten per cent., in a period, as I say, when import prices are down from 114 to 106, some seven or eight points.  The position is being created rapidly in this country where we will have congestion and there can be a conflict between the increased expenditure, the increased overheads, and the decline in import prices.  In other words, our export prices which have recovered will probably not recover any more beyond a certain point.</P>
    <P>When you reach that situation, you find your overheads are too heavy for the system.  The relevance of the import prices is quite obvious.  We have imports totalling £250,000,000 and the national income is £525,000,000.  The relevance is quite obvious because if you take a very small margin of profit, that absorbs about half the income. You are getting close to half and accordingly it is a sign of very bad housekeeping&mdash;to use a phrase beloved of certain senior politicians&mdash;when you get a huge increase in expenditure at a time when everything you buy has become cheaper.</P>
    <P>This very big load of expenditure has given rise to circumstances where in the more remote parts of the country there has been emigration during the period of the Minister's term of office.  We have disagreed on the exact figure.  The Minister maintains that the emigration took place in 1956 and I maintain it started at the beginning of 1957.  We cannot both be right.  You cannot have a very high figure of unemployment at the beginning of 1957, if there was heavy emigration in 1956.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not be here and away at the same time, unless they were like Boyle Roche's bird.  I gave a figure to the Minister with which he disagreed absolutely. Let us take the census periods and we will soon have the result.  Between 1956 and 1961, a period of five years, the natural increase in population was approximately 140,000.  I will make a forecast that in addition to those 140,000, another 100,000 of the population will have left the country.  That view is vindicated by the figures given in a reply to Parliamentary Questions over the past couple of weeks in relation to the number of electors.</P>
      <P>I would not mind if the people who had gone were not from an economic point of view&mdash;certainly I would mind from the human point of view&mdash;so effective or so productive but we know they are the most productive section of the population.  We have had emigration of about 250,000, somewhere between 200,000 and 250,000.  I believe it was 250,000.  The figures published so far, particularly in relation to last year, certainly give the lie to certain well-known &ldquo;economists,&rdquo; the word being in inverted commas, who talk about emigration having gone down last year.  It was a lot higher than the 40,000 bandied around here and elsewhere, for the greater part of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perhaps appropriate that a member of the Opposition should be able to make this kind of statement at the end of a Government's period of office.  The previous Government ran into a period when import prices were up 14 per cent.  They went to the country to get an opinion from the country and the country gave the same opinion as it will give to the Conservative Party in Britain when they go back to it.  The cost of living went up 14 per cent. inside a few years, despite the efforts of the Government to keep it down.  It went up because import prices were going up following the decline from which the previous Fianna Fáil administration had benefited but had wasted.  Similarly, the <Col N="1354" /> present Fianna Fáil administration, I regret to say, has wasted it in the same way.</P>
    <P>Let me give two examples which are germane.  There was the visit of the ambassadors from abroad by air to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  Why did they not go down by C.I.E. and make some contribution to something instead of occupying seats on one of the Aer Lingus planes which would be better employed in a tourist period doing a more effective job of work?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Those seats were paid for; therefore that was a contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking now about the economy.  Senator Ó Maoláin will understand my point if he will think it over&mdash;that the seats could have been used to bring money into the country.  That was one item that I saw about the Shannon Free Airport Development Company,</P>
      <P>I also saw a reply to a Parliamentary Question that the life of a Boeing jet aircraft is ten years.  On that basis, the cost of them, when you consider amortisation, would be £600,000 a year, and the provision for their first year is to be £400,000.  This is not a new thing because this follows three years of development.  In the first year, £800,000 was lost and in the second year, £650,000 was lost on that transatlantic service, though we were told originally that it would be down to £200,000.  Then the arrangement with Seaboard and Western Airways was concelled.  It was not found suitable at that rate of loss and this other decision was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the view expressed recently in Dáil Éireann that, broadly speaking, there are only two or three of these big State organisations that pay interest on capital and provide for amortisation.  Any man in private enterprise business would be delighted if he got in new machinery for his factory and when he had worn it out, was able to get completely new modern machinery without having to answer for the monies invested in the original machinery. What are those companies to which this applies particularly?  Obviously, <Col N="1355" /> there are some of the transport companies to which it applies more strongly.  A good deal of the criticism of C.I.E. was misconceived because it was the only transport company that was in fact responsible for interest and for amortisation of its capital.  That is what ran it into difficulties.</P>
    <P>Other companies which are receiving so many encomiums, such as Irish Shipping and Aer Lingus or Aer Rianta, would all have been in exactly the same position if they had been in business in the same way as C.I.E., and it is very objectionable that the system of transport used by everybody in the country, and particularly the Dublin end, which pays for itself handsomely, should be constantly criticised. It is a complete misconception of what proper criticism should be. I blame the daily papers a great deal for this because they will not employ people at proper rates of pay who are adequately qualified to make proper comment as is done in other countries. They do not pay their staff properly, and they could very well afford to do so.</P>
    <P>The other company for which I have considerable respect and regard indeed is Bord na Móna.  If it were analysed, it would also be found that although it is now paying adequate interest on some of the monies issued to it, when the five year period is over that it is allowed for capital development&mdash;to which I would have no objection&mdash;I doubt if it is making adequate provision for the depreciation, for the using up, of the bogs.  It is very doubtful if even now it is making any adequate provision for the manner in which bogs are being used up.  Their life is not so very long.  I am not saying that the Minister's arrangements in these two Bills for amortisation are not adequate.  I think they are adequate or more than adequate inside the system in relation to this capital expenditure, but I do not think that the position in relation to many of these companies is at all what it should be.</P>
    <P>That was demonstrated clearly in Dáil Éireann only last week.  That is the other end of the Budget.  I do not <Col N="1356" /> propose to deal with it at any length beyond saying that it is a relatively simple matter, if anybody wanted to do it, to make out in relation to these companies whether they are paying their way to the fullest extent of that term or not.  It appears to be generally agreed that nobody wants to do that, and therefore it is not done, but there would be no technical difficulty about doing it, if it were desired to do it.</P>
    <P>It will be gathered from my remarks that I consider this a grossly excessive bill at this time.  We all know what happens in our economy when the kind of measures taken yesterday are taken in Britain.  They take a few months to seep over here, and if we are to believe what the Minister said recently, so far as he is concerned, the general election will be over here before they have had time to seep over here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to speak to the motion standing in my name relating to Ireland's membership of the Common Market, I hope that the result of much study which I have put into this over the past year or more may pinpoint some of the difficulties and considerations that we should take into account in answering the question whether or not we should join the European Economic Community independently of whether Britain joins or not.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to thank the Leader of the House for making the arrangement to have this motion discussed. It would have been better if we could have had independent time set aside for it, but in view of the crowded Order Paper, I wish to thank him for the present arrangement.</P>
      <P>I take it that all members have read the Government White Paper on this subject and have had an opportunity of going through the extensive Dáil debate ranging over two days.  Consequently, I do not intend to go over the ground that has been gone over.  There are, however, many aspects of it that still require elucidation and thought.  I hope to deal with these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first and obvious question is the question: if we join the Common <Col N="1357" /> Market, whither then?  So far, most of the debate and talk on the Common Market has been on a very materialistic plane.  The suggestion is that we are going to some type of wholesale store where we hope to get rather good bargains.  I should have thought our approach to this would have been far more idealistic and that at the outset we would take far more seriously the very words of the preamble to the Treaty of Rome, which says that those signing the Treaty were &ldquo;determined to establish the foundation of an evercloser union among European peoples&rdquo;. In other words, the union does not end at this Common Market with its common flow of goods and services in the countries joining the Common Market.</P>
    <P>It is, first and primarily, a political union.  You can trace that all through. It is a present-day attempt to do what has been tried many times in European history, to bring Europe together or at least bring Europe together sufficiently to avoid the many clashes and wars that have occurred in the past.  I want at the outset to establish the distinctly political nature of the European Economic Community, as this has to be investigated and examined very closely so as to decide at the outset whether we are in complete ideological agreement with the union we propose to join.  I should hate to think that our nation, within 40 years of securing its independence, would rush headlong into union with any group of nations solely from materialistic considerations. I hope to show that the ideological foundations of this union are such that we should find ourselves very much in agreement with it; but to do this, perhaps we should have a brief look at the events that have happened so rapidly in Western Europe since the last war.</P>
    <P>The Benelux Agreement in January, 1948, was followed in April, 1948, by the setting up of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation which played a major part in distributing the Marshall Aid funds so effectively.  Then in February, 1948, we had the seizure of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union&mdash;an unparalleled act of barbarism and aggression within two years of the conclusion of hostilities in <Col N="1358" /> Europe.  That was further aggravated and the intentions of the Soviet Union further revealed in June, 1948, when the Berlin blockade began.  And so arising out of these, the tempo of European union and co-operation for its own protection against the menace from the East was accelerated.  In the spring of 1949 was born the military arm to defend it&mdash;the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.</P>
    <P>We were fortunate in all that period to have outstanding statesmen in power in Europe.  To single out a few of them, we had Schumann in France and Adenauer in Germany.  Both, especially Adenauer, suffered much persecution in earlier years.  Both had a clear vision that the future of Europe depended primarily on Franco-German co-operation, on the removal of the means of waging war between those countries again and the development of Western Europe into a solid, cohesive unit to resist the Soviet aggression.  The leaders of that period, Schumann, Adenauer and De Gaspari in Italy were outstanding Catholic statesmen, steeped in the best and the highest European and Catholic tradition of the period.  They were all steeped in Catholic social teachings which they had studied extensively. Consequently, they realised that a mere defensive union against the Soviet Union would not achieve lasting success and that for ultimate success, the West would have to build a better system&mdash;a system much more in concert with Christian philosophy and Christian social teaching, so as to show by example and by development the Christian approach in all its splendour.</P>
    <P>The steady rise of the Christian Democrat Party in that period is remarkable, as is also the wonderful co-operation that was realised on a very high plane between all Christians in Europe, between the Catholics and the various Protestant organisations and groups.  In the Parliaments, these cooperated very effectively realising full well that the social teachings expounded in the Papal Encyclicals were universal in their applicability being based, as they are, on the natural law.</P>
    <P>That wonderful co-operation has set Europe on the road to unity&mdash;on the road to a unity inspired by the highest <Col N="1359" /> and the best in Christian social teaching.  The aim of that unity is ultimately to draw these countries closer and closer together.  The European Economic Community is merely the economic aspect of that movement.  The European Economic Community was discussed throughout the summer of 1956 and was finally agreed in the spring of 1957.  About the same time, we had another frightening example of Soviet aggression showing what they could and did do to a defenceless State&mdash;the suppression of the Hungarian rising.</P>
    <P>And so the Community took shape with the Treaty of Rome which became effective on 1st January, 1958, only three years ago.  There were at that period many who doubted whether all the high idealism, all the sacrifices, and all the close co-operation could be realised in practice.  The passage of just three short years has been sufficient to set aside all doubts and to show that this union of the Six is progressing and expanding.  It is probably the most progressive and expanding unit in the world today, having achieved over the past years a six and a half per cent.  increase in its industrial production and also having had some spectacular increases in the standard of living as, for instance, in Italy, where, last year, the national income rose by eight per cent. while the industrial arm expanded at the rate of 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>Though Schumann and De Gaspari are no longer with Europe&mdash;both died in the past six or seven years&mdash;they have been succeeded by equally forceful, idealistic, and acceptable men in the persons of General de Gaulle in France and Signor Fanfani in Italy. And so the tempo of unity increases.</P>
    <P>I hope to show by a few quotations the movement towards union that underlies this whole movement.  I can begin with a few quotations from a conference held in Dublin in July, 1959, just two years ago, when we were very fortunate in having here Professor Halstein, who is the head of the European Economic Community&mdash;the planning body.  In a very excellent address, published in Studies and <Col N="1360" /> subsequently issued as a pamphlet, he said:</P>
    <P>I should begin by pointing out that the reasons for establishing the Common Market are largely political. We are seeking to develop a new strength, a new political factor in the free world, which will, by its very existence, strengthen the camp of freedom.  We want to make our contribution to the cause of the free world in the great struggle, which is dividing East from West.  For our part, we intend to take up a position of our own choice, not merely to stand somewhere between the camps. No responsible person in our Community has ever toyed with the idea of our being a &ldquo;third force&rdquo;.  Our idea is to strengthen the defence of liberty.  We can best help here through the new strength we produce in Europe and by at last creating genuine peace for all time between European States in the Community of the Six.</P>
    <P>The second speaker at that conference, the former French Foreign Secretary, M. Fauré, said:</P>
    <P>Professor Halstein has already stressed the living reality of the European Community.  He emphasised the first steps that have been taken towards achieving a common social policy and a common agricultural policy, as well as a common transport policy.  We are not purely concerned with economic policies; our interests are wider and deeper.</P>
    <P>Thus the Community is not only a living reality as an economic organisation; it is also a psychological and political reality.  Those of us who are concerned with political life in our different countries realise how true this is: we realise that this new driving force, the psychological and political concept of a united Europe, has changed the thinking of our peoples, and has brought them to think in terms of working in the interest of the European community and not purely in the interest of their own nation.</P>
    <P>He went on to describe how Britain at that period had decided not to join the European Economic Community and he quoted from a reply of Mr. Maudling, the President of the Board <Col N="1361" /> of Trade, in the British House of Commons, where Mr. Maudling did not take refuge in speaking about the Commonwealth or difficulties of that nature as the reason why Britain did not then join the E.E.C. Said M. Fauré:</P>
    <P>No, the answer of Mr. Maudling was that, in his opinion the people who signed the Treaty of Rome regarded it as a first step in the political integration of Europe towards a United States of Europe &mdash;I think myself, that that is exactly what it was; and I think, furthermore, that a political will and a political unity is essential.  It is essential if we are going to maintain the position of Europe <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other continents, such as Africa, and it is vitally essential if we are going to do something about the problem of the reunification of Germany.  A united Germany must be brought into the Western community, and in order to do that you have got to have a political will and not just a purely commercial and economic one.</P>
    <P>Indeed, this political will which I talk about surpasses all the limited commercial aims, all the economic aims.  You can well, perhaps, reproach me for being a dreamer; but to my mind it is this political will for unity, for political integration which will not alone bring about the unity of Europe but will also preserve what is left of liberty in the Western world.</P>
    <P>I suggest that members interested would do very well to read the report <i>in extenso</i>; I take it that it is available in the Library.</P>
    <P>That was two years ago and perhaps it may be said that things have changed drastically since then; people have become more economic-minded and the political objectives have receded into the background.  At least, that is the impression one gets from studying the various contributions to the subject in the other House and in the Press, but the political issue has been brought very strongly to the forefront again at the meeting held in Germany of the heads of state of the six countries comprising the O.E.E.C., <Col N="1362" /> Adenauer, Fanfani, de Gaulle and the leaders of Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg, as reported in the London Times on July 19th.  It gives the full text of the <i>communiqué</i> issued after the Bonn meeting.  Even though it is a little extensive, I will, with the permission of the Chair, get it on record so that members can read it and ponder over its significance.</P>
    <P>First of all comes the solemn declaration which starts:</P>
    <P>The heads of state or government of the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, as well as the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, inspired by the desire to confirm the spiritual values and political traditions which form their common heritage, united in the awareness of the great tasks which have been put to Europe within the community of the free peoples in order to preserve freedom and peace in the world in an effort to strengthen the political, economic, social and cultural ties existing between their peoples, especially in the framework of the European communities, and to progress along the road to European unification convinced that only a united Europe (in alliance with the United States of America and other free peoples) is in a position to cope with the dangers threatening the existence of Europe and the entire free world and that it is indispensable to concentrate the energies, capabilities and means of all those for whom freedom is an inalienable possession, determined to develop their political co-operation with the aim of European unification while continuing at the same time the work started with the European communities, and wishing that other European states which are prepared to accept equal responsibility and equal obligations in all spheres may join the European communities, have decided.</P>
    <P>It goes on to give the three resolutions which are:</P>
    <P>1.  To give form and figure to the will for political unification, which is already contained in the treaties <Col N="1363" /> founding the European communities, and for this purpose to organise their co-operation, to provide for its further development and to secure its regularity which will increasingly create prior conditions for a common policy and which will finally make it possible to crown the work already begun by institutions.</P>
    <P>2.  To hold at regular intervals meetings with the aim of comparing their views, harmonising their policies and reaching common conceptions, in order to further the political unification of Europe and thus to strengthen the Atlantic alliance.  The necessary practical steps will be taken to prepare these meetings.  On the other hand the continuation of an active co-operation of the Foreign Ministers will contribute towards the continuity of the common action.  Co-operation of the Six must extend beyond the political field in its narrow sense.  It will particularly be extended to the field of education, culture and research, where it will be guaranteed by periodical meetings of the Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>3.  To order their commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, the EEC</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;to submit to them proposals on means and ways which would make it possible to give a statutory character within the shortest time to the unification of their peoples.</P>
    <P>These are decisions reached in Bonn last week.  They have not received here the prominence they deserve.  However, they bear out everything that was said here at the Dublin Conference by Professor Halstein and others.  This has been further emphasised by a report in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Friday, 21st July, 1961, quoting a statement by the French Foreign Minister, Monsieur de Murville, where he interpreted the results.  He is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>Our attitude was clearly defined at Bonn in a statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>which I have quoted above&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>in which the six heads of state said they desired that other states join the EEC so long as they were ready to assume in every domain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> not merely the economic domain&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>the same responsibilities and the same obligations as the present members.</P>
    <P>It was said, in every domain, and that naturally means in the political sphere as well.  That is a logical consequence of the decisions taken at the Bonn meeting.</P>
    <P>Finally, in yesterday's Irish Press there was given an <i>Irish Press&mdash;Financial Times</i> copyright report.  The heading was &ldquo;European Economic Community Nations to have Pooling of Sovereignty?&rdquo;.  I shall quote a few sentences to show the statement there:</P>
    <P>Membership of the European Common Market is likely to involve some &ldquo;pooling of sovereignty&rdquo; on foreign policy as well as in the economic field.</P>
    <P>That is something personally I should be very thankful to see&mdash;that our lone wolf actions in the United Nations will have to come to an end.  It continues:</P>
    <P>This point has emerged from a meeting in Bonn of the Heads of Government of the six Common Market nations.  The Rome Treaty bringing the Common Market into being included provisions for closer political ties between the member countries.  France's President de Gaulle some time ago proposed that the members should form a loose confederation of sovereign states.</P>
    <P>The recent Bonn meeting, however, disclosed that the Heads of Government now envisage going further than this.  They are thinking in terms of common political institutions which may turn out to be half-way between the &ldquo;Europe of nation-States&rdquo; and complete integration.</P>
    <P>I have put these on record so that nobody can any longer be in any doubt about the ideological basis of the movement and that is pushing on to an ever closer union in Europe; a union which, I think, has rather aptly been described in that last quotation as being a midway between Europe as it is at present and complete integration. The economic considerations must then be set in that political and ideological framework.  We have to <Col N="1365" /> be certain that we are quite happy to take our place in Europe and to contribute our share to the full development of Western Europe in meeting the threat from the East and in resuming its former rôle of greatness in the world.  I think, in this, we can endorse the words of our Taoiseach, as quoted at Column 284 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann of 5th July, 1961.  Summing up, he says:</P>
    <P>We belong to Europe.  We have no desire to remain aloof from Europe in planning for human betterment, believing that we can contribute to it and share in it.</P>
    <P>I welcome that statement.  I take it that it is clear and speaks for itself. This is, I hope, the first stage of giving practical effect to what the Taoiseach said on 1st December, 1960, at the Solicitors' Apprentices Debating Society where he scotched once and for all any talk that we were neutral or uncommitted in the present struggle. He said:</P>
    <P>We do not profess to be indifferent to the outcome of the East-West conflict, nor present ourselves to be neutral in the ideological issues which now divide the world.</P>
    <P>Now is the opportunity and the task to make good those words and to show where we stand.</P>
    <P>We come now to facets of this closer union which are likely to worry some people.  The first and foremost essential task was well put by Deputy Gerald Boland in the Dáil in the recent debate where he advocated taking our place in NATO and doing our bit for the defence of the free world.  This has been opposed by some groups, first of all by the unilateralists who, thank God, are very few amongst us though I think we contributed some small misguided quota to the Aldermaston March.  But these, advocating, as they do, unilateral disarmament, have just not faced up to the logical consequences of their demands. Some are so scared of a nuclear war that they are willing to proceed to unilateral disarmament&mdash;a lovely phrase but one that should be replaced by the more direct phrase&mdash; to make abject surrender to the Communist world.</P>

I take it that it is axiomatic that we are not going to be allowed to share in the economic gains of Europe, if we are not prepared to do whatever little we can do in European defence. In all that has been written or spoken about the Common Market, it has been taken for granted that N.A.T.O. is its defence organisation, so much so that Holland and others have been very jealous in all discussions to ensure that discussions within the Common Market do not in any way impinge on the strategic decisions of N.A.T.O.</P>

      <P>In case people are worried about the awful prospects of nuclear war they might do well to read what is the most authoritative article I have seen on this subject.  It is an article in <i>Philosophical Studies</i>, published by Maynooth College, Volume 10 of 1960.  It is by Professor <Col N="1367" /> James Hogan of U.C.C. who is undoubtedly our leading authority on the philosophical aspects of history.</P>
      <P>In a very brilliant article, ranging over some 40 pages, he discusses this question of the nuclear deterrents and he shows conclusively that the logic of the situation is that this should not lead actually to atomic warfare but rather that it should so immobilise and frighten the main contenders that they would be forced back to local wars fought with conventional weapons or small scale atomic armament in a very carefully controlled war, each side realising what the indiscriminate use of atomic weapons on the scale of the last war would mean.</P>
      <P>Perhaps if I just quote a couple of lines, they will give some consolation. On page 145, he says:</P>
      <P>Great good could be brought of a great evil if the mutually defeating and devastating consequences of total nuclear war should result in bringing to an end the age of total wars, which started with the French revolution and reached its climax in the two world wars of our century, and should compel a return, when wars are unavoidable, to the classical type of warfare fought on a prudential calculus of profit and loss for limited aims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having investigated the ideological basis and political commitments, we will now look at whether it is economically possible for us to join the European Economic Community.  At this stage, the question arises: what does England do?  Will England join or not?  That is a very legitimate question, seeing that 75 per cent. of our exports now go to the British market.  I feel that the Government's approach is an abject one, when they say: &ldquo;We go in, if England goes in; if England does not, we do not.&rdquo;  That is not the voice we would expect to hear from a free Ireland.  If that had been said 30 or 40 years ago, it would have led to serious trouble, perhaps even to Civil War.  Let us be realistic about this and examine the consequences.  I do not think that the issue is nearly as clear-cut as the Government's statement makes it out to be.  I should say <Col N="1368" /> there was a 95 per cent.  certainty that Britain will join.  On the other hand, if England does not go in, I fail to understand the Government's approach in completely ruling out the possibility that we should go in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister correcting me on that.  I took it that the positive statement was that if England would not go in, we would not, and that we would not apply for membership.  I am glad that the Minister has said that because he is really conceding the second part of my motion, that the Government should make application for membership and should not depend on England's attitude.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly the European Economic Community would like to know England's attitude before making final arrangements with us, but we should be well on the way with negotiations before England's attitude is known.  I take it that it is almost 90 per cent. certain that England will go in, but yet let us have a look at the two possibilities. Supposing Britain remains out, then we can take it that Denmark and the other E.F.T.A. partners will remain out.  At present Denmark supplies a considerable portion of the German market with agricultural produce. That is a very expanding market.  Hence, if England and Denmark do not join EEC, is the external tariff going to act then against Denmark, and if we are accepted into the Community is it not obvious that a share of the German market would then be a prize worth getting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be objected that the EEC are almost self-sufficient in agricultural produce and their increasing production suggests that in future they may be self-sufficient.  But then if we are in, I take it that any reading of the Treaty of Rome suggests that once the internal tariffs have been lowered, we will be in free competition with the other agricultural producers in the E.E.C., and consequently we would get our share of the market.  There are means incorporated in the Treaty by <Col N="1369" /> which a fair return is guaranteed since imports coming from non-member countries are regulated or alternatively means are provided for selling the surplus to outside countries and using a stabilising fund to adjust returns.</P>
    <P>One point that seems to have been missed completely in the debate to date is that in the coming decade, will western Europe play its part in the campaign for alleviating world hunger, will it answer the call of His Holiness Pope John in his recent Encyclical, a call that has been re-echoed in all the world capitals, a call that has been advanced again and again by our very progressive National Farmers' Association? Undoubtedly it will, and then there will not be the slightest likelihood of any surplus of agricultural goods in western Europe, because these surpluses will be usefully employed in feeding the weak and the hungry.  If therefore we join the E.E.C., we just have nothing to fear from surpluses in agriculture within the community.</P>
    <P>Let us now consider our trade with England, the hundred million pounds that we export.  I have made the case that we should be able to sell most of these goods in Western Europe under acceptable conditions.  I am fully conscious in saying this of our bad trading record in Western Europe in the past.  The figures speak for themselves, that for every pound they bought from us, we have bought anything between £4 and £10 from them, so that our experience in negotiating and selling has not been happy in the past.  I doubt if our experience will be any happier in the future in dealing with the same group of countries if their sole consideration is merely economic. It is because I believe that this is not so that I believe that our failure in past negotiations in Europe should in no way discourage us in the future, as we will then be negotiating on a higher and nobler ideological basis.  The building up of our economy will then appear as a contribution to the development and strength of Western Europe and will accordingly be as prized by the other nations as it will be by ourselves.</P>
    <P>Even if we still had some agricultural <Col N="1370" /> produce unsold in the E.E.C.&mdash; and that is very hypothetical because it does not seem to fit in with the Treaty of Rome&mdash;if the surplus that had to be exported out of the European Economic Community were ours and we had to export it to England, what then?  The idea has grown up that this Community is going to erect huge customs trade barriers around itself, with very high taxes or levies on imports. That is a complete fallacy.  It was very fully dealt with at the conference in Dublin two years ago.  Perhaps I could just give one or two points from the President of the Commission himself, Professor Halstein, when he said: &ldquo;I am convinced that the European Economic Community will have to tend towards increasing liberalisation of trade&rdquo;&mdash;that is, trade in its widest sense, both external and internal.  And he gave his reasons: &ldquo;It is unthinkable that the training of an economy to free trade within a community should stop short at its frontiers and should have no effect on people's views as to what is the right or wrong way to treat commercially the rest of the world.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, he says that the area is &ldquo;the largest transforming and processing area in the world, and differs from the other great economic areas or units in that we do not have at our disposal resources of raw materials comparable to those of the United States or the Soviet Union.  Therefore we must import in order to be able to process, and we must export in order to pay for our imports.&rdquo;  In other words, high tariff barriers would be detrimental to the development of Western Europe itself.</P>
    <P>Once the barriers have been lowered within, there will be a gradual lowering of barriers to the rest of the world, and that must begin with the areas that are most in harmony with the spirit of the European Economic Community, and I take it that these would include Britain&mdash;in the very unlikely event of her remaining out.  It would not certainly include the United States.  The United States at official Government level have accepted the fact that there may be more discrimination in the immediate future against American products in Europe, <Col N="1371" /> due to the external customs barrier around the E.E.C., and is prepared to accept this, if the discrimination contributes to the development of Western Europe and to its unity.  The United States is not prepared to accept discrimination if the arrangements carry no political advantage leading to the strengthening of the defences of Western Europe.  I do not think there is any necessity to follow this line of reasoning too far, because it is almost certain that Britain will go in.  If Britain goes in, I think we could all agree with the Taoiseach's summing up of the situation when he says that all the advantages would be on the side of agriculture and all the difficulties in industry.  To begin with, it means that if Britain is in, we would have access to the largest consumer market in the world.  At that stage, it would number 220 million people, with an average national income almost double ours. Provided we can get our share of that trade, we should be enthusiastic in joining.</P>
    <P>We find in the Rome Treaty that the provisions for agriculture are very much acceptable to us in their present form because they lay great stress on the fact that agricultural workers should enjoy the comparable remuneration to workers in other industries. More important still, on Page 20 of the White Paper, a paragraph dealing with the proposed agricultural policy states:</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of family farms in European agriculture and the unanimous determination to preserve that family character, every means should be used to strengthen the economic and competitive capacity of family undertakings.</P>
    <P>In other words, the emphasis is back on the family farms.  A phrase that has created a certain amount of difficulty is that referring to the improvement of the agricultural pattern.  Some may be rather worried about this in that it seemed to call for consolidation of holdings leading to larger farms.  It does in some parts of Europe but by European standards, we are a nation of ranchers.  The average sized farm <Col N="1372" /> in Norway is 12 acres; in Belgium, it is 17 acres; in Holland, it is 25 acres; and in Denmark, it is 38 acres.</P>
    <P>In fact, we are second on the list with an average farm size of 44 acres, the highest in the list being England with 69 acres.  Consequently, what appears to be a small farm here, by European standards is capable of being developed into a family farm.  I take it then that in this adjustment as interpreted by us it should not in any way lead to an increase in the size of farms.  Rather will it mean that the comparable labour returns to our farmers will be provided by increasing production on existing farms, since the aim of the Community is the maximum utilisation of resources and as long as our lands are not producing to their maximum our resources are not being used to the full.</P>
    <P>There are historical reasons for our failure to increase agricultural production, coupled with violent fluctuations in market prices.  Often when a farmer thought a line of agricultural production looked like paying, a slight surplus appeared that had a disastrous effect on prices.  The whole machinery of the Treaty of Rome and of its suggested agricultural policy is to prevent that type of price fluctuation.  Accordingly it would appear to be the answer to the farmers' prayer in this country; that they can go ahead and produce as much as possible and still get a reasonable return.</P>
    <P>We applaud the emphasis on family farms, in happy contrast to the very materialistic concept that is frequently bandied around of farming being a business and not a way of life.  It is the farming way of life that gives and has given the character and strength to a rural people.  It is to the credit of those Christian thinkers in Western Europe that they fully recognise this. You cannot go through Western Europe without being aware of the sturdy farm families and communities, even in its most industrialised sections.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the words of Pope Pius XII when addressing the Italian farmers in 1956.  He said:</P>
    <P>Accordingly every care should be taken to preserve for the nation the essential elements of what may be <Col N="1373" /> termed genuine rural civilisation. These are: love of work, simplicity and uprightness of life, respect for authority, especially of parents; love of country and fidelity to traditions that have proved fruitful for good down the centuries;</P>
    <P>So we find ourselves then very much in agreement with the proposed agricultural policy of EEC.  In the developments ahead, the outstanding fact is that, by European standards, we have not got nearly enough workers on our land.  Denmark has almost 50 per cent. more workers per 100 acres than we have.  A comparison with Holland&mdash; she has three or four times as many workers per thousand acres&mdash;is not quite fair because Holland relies so much on horticulture with much of the country under glass.  But any comparison with Denmark shows that for full development we will need many more workers on the land.</P>
    <P>That is something that will be difficult to achieve unless we approach the problem from a new angle in accepting this challenge of the Common Market. The challenge to us is to increase the numbers on the land and provide them with better facilities and, above all, better education and better training so that they can get from the land of Ireland the wealth it holds.</P>
    <P>As a pre-condition, we must remove the stigma that is attached to work on the land.  In Western Europe, we are about the only place where a young man cannot work his way up to become an owner of land unless he was born into the land.  In other words, we have no farming ladder as a path to ownership and that will have to be provided.  We must appeal to the 12, 13 and 14 year olds in our schools to-day and show them the future that awaits them on the land of Ireland, first, as the scientific workers of the new and revived agriculture of our country and later, in their late twenties, as farmers, if they are good enough.</P>
    <P>I believe that can be done and it is one of my greatest disappointments with the work of the Government that the promises made by Deputy Childers, when Minister for Lands, have not been fulfilled.  In Killiney, three years <Col N="1374" /> ago, he addressed a meeting of Macra na Feirme, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Countrywomen's Association and the National Farmers Association, arranged by <i>Tuairim</i>.  The question of farm apprenticeship and the necessity of getting young men back on the land was discussed at length for two days and the Minister was one of the most enthusiastic of those present.  I thought action would surely follow but I regret to say that three years afterwards, still nothing has happened.  I would like the Minister in his reply to give us some hope that the Government will give some help to those who are making efforts to develop a dynamic farm apprenticeship scheme.</P>
    <P>The statistics show that there are something like 15 men per 600 acres in Denmark compared with ten here. In other words, they have 50 per cent. more manpower per acre than we have.  Added to this the figure of 400,000 people on the land of Ireland is a totally inflated figure.  First of all, one-third of the farmers in the country are over 65 and in any normal industry including modern agriculture in Denmark, such people would be in retirement. In any case, the physical contribution they make at this stage is, as one might expect, relatively little, so we might reduce the figure of 400,000 by at least 70,000.</P>
    <P>Again we have many relatives of farmers working on the land who contribute very little and are far from being units of agricultural production. Frequently, in travelling through some of the parishes I know best I look at the farms and say: &ldquo;Three units of agricultural production.&rdquo;  But those three would give the equivalent of one, sometimes, because they have not got the training; other times, because they are not physically capable; and other times because they are just not suited to work in modern agriculture.  We will find that those people, whom we might call home assistance cases, add up to another 30,000 or 40,000.  Hence we have scarcely 300,000 people by European standards working on the land to-day.  If the land were developed to the extent it is developed in Denmark we would require almost double that number.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1375" /> We may have some difficulties in entering the Common Market in some of our industries but I think that these are greatly exaggerated.  Many of our main industries are capable of surviving under any conditions.  As a friend of mine, a manufacturer in Cork, has put it, his factory at the moment in catering for the home market has 60 or 80 different lines and it is simply impossible to do a top-class management job with that diversity of production. He feels, however, if he had an expanding market and could cut down those lines to five, six or seven and concentrate completely on these, part of which he would sell at home and part on the export market, he could do a far more efficient job and his costs of production would go down considerably.</P>
    <P>That applies to many of our industries. In trying to cater for a small home market of three million people, the management job presented is almost insuperable.  We have industries that have built up a large export trade, like Guinness's and I do not see why others cannot do likewise.  It certainly will not be because our Irish people are not prepared to work as hard as their brothers in other countries. I think we should not over-estimate our difficulties.</P>
    <P>Again an increase in agricultural production will necessarily create employment in the processing industries as we hope that a good deal of the increased agricultural production will be processed at home.  It is found in the United States that for every 100 people on the land in primary industry, 140 are required in processing industries. We may not go as high but if in the next 15 or 20 years we succeed in putting an additional 200,000 effective workers on the land thereby raising our numbers from an effective 300,000 to 500,000, those additional 200,000 will create industrial employment for 100,000 to 150,000 in industry. In other words, these additional jobs in agricultural processing should more than absorb any who may be displaced from existing industries.</P>
    <P>We should not over-estimate the difficulties to the extent of being unduly <Col N="1376" /> concerned about the length of the transition period.  What is the difference, after all, between ten years and 15 years?  If the conversion of our economy, from its present state to the contemplated state is to take place, then it would be as well to do it in the minimum time.  You may keep the national effort at boiling point for five or ten years but if you give it 15 years, there may be a feeling that the thing is not urgent.  Above all, we should not seek an extension of the transition period at the expense of concessions in other fields.</P>
    <P>Our capacity for increased production in agriculture has been attested to by all who have examined the question. Three years ago the O.E.E.C. examined the grassland potential of Western Europe, to find out what would be possible under ordinary standards of efficient management.</P>
    <P>The percentage increases, as given in the OEEC report on Pasture and Fodder Production, are: Norway, 12; Denmark, 24; United Kingdom, 27; Ireland, 60; Netherlands, 17; Belgium, 40; France, 50; Western Germany, 30; Austria, 35.  So they have attested to our capacity to increase production.</P>
    <P>We were honoured to have Mr. Cahan, the Deputy Secretary General of OEEC at the previously mentioned conference in Dublin in 1959.  His views are most encouraging:</P>
    <P>It seemed to me that if you set yourselves the task not of increasing production by 1 or 2 per cent. per annum but of increasing it by 6, or 7 or 8 per cent. you could achieve it. I believe that the basic fundamental infra-structure on which a very considerable increase in agricultural production and efficiency could take place exists in Ireland.  All our experts tell me I am right.</P>
    <P>That is, all the experts of OEEC.</P>
    <P>The Six despite their common agricultural policy, are simply not going to be able to feed the Germans and they realise that.  The Germans are going to have to import food in very considerable quantities beyond the borders of the Six.  There is no doubt about this.  Ireland is a natural supplier just as Denmark is. You have nothing to fear but you have to prepare yourselves for it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> What are our goals for the future? Or what do we hope to get from joining EEC?  The first goal is undoubtedly peace.  The threat that hangs over the world today is present to each and every one of us.  It matters little if we increase production, or what wonderful plans we dream, if a world war breaks out.  The situation is brought home to us by the seizure of Czechoslovakia in 1948, and the crushing of Hungary in 1956.  The coming together of Western Europe and the development of its military might in NATO has halted, temporarily at any rate, the Soviet threat to Western Europe.  We have much to be thankful for in the development that has taken place in NATO and it is our only shield against the future.  We hope and expect that the views expressed by Professor Hogan which I have quoted will ensure that the terrible power of weapons that are available today, super atomic weapons, including the hydrogen bomb, will mutually cancel out and remove the danger of world wars on the scale of the last two.  If we achieve that, we shall have progressed a very long way.</P>
    <P>Our second goal should be increased employment for our people.  It is sad to look back over ten years and to find that we have 150,000 persons fewer in employment today than we had in 1950.  It is sad also to realise that our population is dwindling at the rate of 20,000 a year&mdash;comparable to having the population of England dwindling by some 350,000 per annum or the population of the United States dwindling at the rate of 1,000,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>These are the hard facts of our situation.  I do not attribute blame to any of our Governments.  All have endeavoured to do the best possible but their best has not been good enough, as the results attest.  Could anybody fighting in the War of Independence have pictured such dire happenings in Ireland, for which they were prepared to shed their blood, the Ireland that would have full employment and work for all?</P>
    <P>It simply all adds up to the fact that in the modern world it is exceedingly difficult for a small economic <Col N="1378" /> unit to exist, especially a small unit that came so late to its development stage.  Now, a ray of hope appears&mdash; that this small economic unit can work out its future in harmony with others who hold the same ideological and the same Christian view of life; that we can sell our products in a large market and that in union with Western Europe, we can increase our agricultural production to its maximum to relieve a world in hunger. That is our fond hope and in realising it we must ensure that it is compatable with our national sovereignty.</P>
    <P>Again, this is a major challenge.  It is a challenge to us to enrich and develop our national sovereignty and those characteristics which make us a nation.  It is a challenge to us to develop those as passionately as the French, the Germans, the Dutch develop theirs.  We cannot say that we are satisfied with our progress in meeting this challenge in the past 40 years.  We cannot say that today Irish culture, Irish games, Irish music, Irish dancing, the Irish language itself, have made the strides that the patriots of 1916 hoped they would make.  But I believe in accepting the challenge presented by joining Western Europe. We can make another, and more successful, effort to develop our culture and our heritage, this time as an appeal to our national pride, to be worthy to rank as a nation before our European allies.  I hope that the end result will be that we shall have here an expanding population, an expanding employment and above all that we shall hold fast to our Irish Christian heritage.</P>
    <P>There is just one real danger in joining with Western Europe, a major one that I have left to the last.  It is the fact that our area here is double the area of Holland, double the area of Belgium.  Holland has 12,000,000 people where we have 3,000,000 people. We are the only place in Western Europe that has free space and, with Western Europe's population increasing as it is, and with free movement of men and materials, we may find it difficult not to have a considerable immigration of Europeans to here.  It could well happen that at the end of this century our population will have <Col N="1379" /> gone to 6,000,000 or 7,000,000&mdash;and even that would still leave our country sparsely populated by European standards&mdash;of which 3,000,000 would be immigrants from Europe.</P>
    <P>The key to retaining our national identity against such a possible influx is to be found in the advice of Michael Davitt and the Land League: &ldquo;Hold on to your holdings.&rdquo;  In short, we may give many things in uniting with Western Europe, and for the defence of freedom, but we should be very careful not to give the land of Ireland.  But we cannot hold on to it, if it is not being used.  We can only use it by making every endeavour to secure our young men on the land where they can carve careers that will preserve for us a genuine rural Irish civilisation.  If we can do that, we can weather the storm.  If we drift along and do not take adequate steps in regard to farm apprenticeship, and do not act in time to prevent a flow of outsiders on to our land, then I am afraid it may happen that our ancient nation might become submerged in the E.E.C.</P>
    <P>By world standards, we are well off, as far as our standard of living is concerned.  We are in the top 20 per cent. of humanity.  I would much prefer that, in ten years' time, we could record that no appreciable increase had taken place in our standard of living but that we had full employment for everyone who wanted to work and live here.  That would be a far better position be to in at the end of the 1960s.  The only difficulty is that if other countries are increasing their standard of living, there is the urge to follow suit.  My hope is that Western Europe will show its greatness in the coming decade by voluntarily sacrificing all this unnecessary increase in present living standards and contribute it to the welfare of the under-privileged nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main object of this Bill is to obtain legislative authority for the increases in the rates of non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions, unemployment assistance, and the married person's allowance in the scheme of old age (contributory) pensions, announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement on 19th April last, and for the introduction of substantial concessions in regard to the means conditions for the receipt of unemployment assistance, also adverted to by the Minister for Finance.  A number of other necessary or desirable amendments of the law, which with one exception, are referred to in more detail in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill, and which Senators will have seen, are also included.  I shall deal with these in greater detail in a moment and also with a concession in relation to old age pensions which is not mentioned in the memorandum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, I should like to deal briefly with the Budget increases, which, I think, require little explanation.  The Bill provides for an increase of one <Col N="1381" /> shilling and sixpence per week in all non-contributory old age and blind pensions.  According to the means category of the pensioner, therefore, the new rates of these pensions will be 30/-, 25/-, 20/- and 15/- a week.</P>
    <P>The increases provided for in rates of unemployment assistance, mean that recipients themselves will get an increase of 1/6d. a week, plus the same extra amount for an adult dependant. If the recipient has dependent children, he will get an increase of 1/- each for the first and second child and an increase of 1/6d. a week for each subsequent child.  For example, a man who is on unemployment assistance and who has a wife and four dependent children will get an extra 8/- a week as from 1st August next.  In certain cases, as a result of the easing of the means conditions for the unemployment assistance scheme, also proposed, the increases in rates will be further augmented.</P>
    <P>Widows' non-contributory pensions are being increased by 1/6d. on the personal rate, by 1/- for each of the first two qualified children, and by 1/6d. for each subsequent qualified child, so that, to give an example, a non-contributory widow pensioner with four qualified children will receive an increase of 6/6d. weekly in her pension.</P>
    <P>Contributory old age pensioners who are receiving an allowance in respect of a wife or husband will also benefit.  The allowance for a wife or dependent husband which is contained in the old age contributory pension is equal to the maximum rate of non-contributory old age pension, and this allowance normally continues to be payable as a benefit to the surviving partner when a married pensioner dies.  Receipt of the allowance, or of the survivor's benefit, disqualifies the surviving spouse for receiving a non-contributory old age pension.  Because the maximum non-contributory old age pension is being increased from 28/6d. to 30/- it is necessary to increase the contributory dependant's allowance and survivor's benefit correspondingly.  The new rate of contributory old age pension and allowance, for a married couple entitled to the maximum rate, will, therefore, be £3 10s. a week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1382" /> The Bill makes substantial concessions in relation to unemployment assistance and some desirable relaxations so far as certain aspects of non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions are concerned.  As members will, no doubt, be aware, there are two yearly means limits for participation in the unemployment assistance scheme. A limit of £72 16s. applies in rural areas and a limit of £98 16s. applies in urban areas.  The Bill provides for a single yearly means limit of £100 which will, from 1st August next, apply throughout the State.  Applicants for unemployment assistance in urban areas possess little or no means apart from their earnings from employment and since such earnings do not count as means for unemployment assistance purposes, the means limit is of no practical significance.  Many rural applicants, however, are smallholders and have means derived from the occupation of land.  The means problem is, in fact, essentially a rural one.  The introduction of the new means limit will bring into the scheme about 1,200 additional recipients in rural areas&mdash;mainly smallholders with means ranging from £72 16s. to £100&mdash;who will qualify for payment of assistance at rates ranging from 18/6d. a week downwards, plus 2/6d. a week for each dependent child after the second such child.</P>
    <P>The amount of assessed weekly means which is disregarded in determining the weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable in any particular case is also being increased.  The first 1/- of means is so disregarded at present.  The disregarded amount, will, in future, be 2/- in the case of a person without a dependant and 5/- where the person has a dependant.  In easing this condition of the scheme therefore it will be noted that I have made a distinction between persons without dependants and persons with dependants, which, I am sure, will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The concession will enable many recipients&mdash;some 16,000 at peak periods&mdash;to qualify for higher rates of unemployment assistance than heretofore and it will especially benefit those who have families.  The effect will be to increase still further, by 1/- a week for a person without a dependant, and <Col N="1383" /> by 4/- for a person who has a dependant, the rates of unemployment assistance payable where the assessed weekly means exceed 1/- and 4/- respectively. The combined result of this concession and the increase in rates in the case of a man with a wife and four children, with means in excess of 4/-a week, will be that he will receive a total increase of 12/- a week in his unemployment assistance as from 1st August next.</P>
    <P>Concessions in relation to widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions are also provided for in the Bill. Under existing legislation, it sometimes happens that a small increase granted in a pension from, say, another government, can cause a greater decrease in a widow's or orphan's pension payable by my Department, the net result being that the pensioner's total income is reduced. The Bill ensures that such net losses of income will no longer occur. An alteration is made by Section 11 in the residence condition for widow's pension.  A widow is at present disqualified for receipt of non-contributory widow's pension unless she has been resident in the State during the period of two years immediately preceding the date of her claim.  If she has been absent from the country she cannot, therefore, qualify for a pension until two years after her return unless she was in receipt of the pension at the time of her departure.  Two years' residence here, at any time, will be sufficient, under the altered condition proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 19 will allow a considerable concession in assessing the means of a claimant to old age pension who is the older member of a married couple who are living together, where the spouse of the claimant is sixty years of age or over and where the couple are wholly or mainly dependent on each other for their livelihood.  The effect of the provision will be to allow up to £165 of the joint cash income of the couple, for example, the earnings of the husband, to be excluded in the calculation of their means for the purposes of the older partner's claim. If they are already entitled to have a portion of their income ignored in <Col N="1384" /> the calculation of their means, say, for example, the first £52 of any voluntary or gratuitous contributions or up to £80 of a military service pension, any amounts disregarded under these heads will be regarded as forming part of the figure of £165.  Hitherto, a married couple with a cash income of £4 1s. a week approximately would both be debarred from receiving the pension.</P>
    <P>This new provision will enable the older member of a couple, eligible for the concession and with cash income up to £7 4s. a week, to qualify for the minimum rate of pension.  I have no doubt that this concession will be especially beneficial to married couples where the wife, for example, has reached the age of seventy years and her husband is still working, perhaps as an agricultural worker, or road worker, with wages which, though small, would still be sufficient, without this concession, to debar her from receiving the old age pension.  This concession, as I have said already, will enable her to qualify.</P>
    <P>I need refer only briefly to the remaining amendments which will improve and strengthen social welfare legislation generally.  The power of deciding officers, appointed under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, to decide whether a person is or was in insurable employment, and to give decisions in respect of past events, is being clarified by Section 16.  A provision in the Old Age Pensions Act of 1908 for the making of regulations providing for notice to be given by registrars of births and deaths to pension officers or local pension committees, of the deaths of persons over 70 years of age, which has never operated here, is being repealed.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of provisions which will, it is hoped, help to discourage people from making fraudulent claims and giving false information in relation to unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance claims.  Administrative measures against fraud are being reinforced by special provisions in the Bill to help in reducing it to the minimum.  Conviction for fraud in relation to an unemployment benefit claim will now carry with it disqualification for the <Col N="1385" /> receipt of unemployment benefit for six months immediately following the date of the conviction.  Similarly, conviction for fraud in relation to an unemployment assistance claim will involve disqualification for unemployment assistance for six months.  Where the offence relates to a qualification certificate, the offender, if convicted, will be debarred from obtaining or holding such a certificate for a similar period.  The maximum fine which can be imposed by the court for offences in relation to unemployment assistance is being increased from £25 to £50, the limit already in operation in relation to other social welfare services.  The concealment of any material fact for the purpose of obtaining or continuing a pension is being made an offence under Section 58 of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935.  These provisions, which are contained in Sections 10, 13, 14 and 18 of the Bill, will apply only to offences committed on or after the 1st August next.</P>
    <P>Power is being taken to enable current payments of pension to be withheld in recovery of overpayments of old age pension and widows' pension fraudulently received and in respect of which a decree is being sought or has been obtained in court.  The Bill will also permit an overpayment of benefit, pension or assistance, fradulently received, to be recovered by withholding all or part of any benefit, pension or assistance which may subsequently become payable to the claimant.  Where the overpayment is of non-contributory old age pension, the right of recovery will extend to payments to which the spouse, widow or widower, as the case may be, of the claimant becomes entitled by way of pension, benefit or assistance.  The pension, or benefit or assistance to a third party can also, under the Bill, be offset, with his consent, against an overpayment of a non-contributory old age pension due by someone else.  In tightening up the law in these ways I am, of course, aiming only at those claimants who dishonestly get, or attempt to get, public money to which they are not entitled.</P>
    <P>The number of people who will stand to benefit under this Bill is in the region of 220,000&mdash;old people, persons <Col N="1386" /> who are blind, widows and their children, and the unemployed and their wives and children.  The increases in non-contributory pensions and in assistance rates announced in the Budget will cost £768,000 in a full year.  The relaxations in the unemployment assistance means conditions and in relation to widows' pensions will cost an additional £81,500 a year, while the cost of the easing of the old age pension means test for certain married couples will be of the order of £20,000 a year, so that the total yearly cost of the proposed increases and concessions in social assistance comes to the substantial sum of £869,500.  In the current financial year the cost will be £580,500 apart from the £19 million already provided for social assistance requirements. The increase of 1/6d. in the old age (contributory) pension married person's allowance will cost in the region of £49,000 in a full year, or £33,000 in the current financial year and will be met out of the social insurance fund.  I would remind members that this is the third successive year in which non-contributory old age and widows' pensions and unemployment assistance rates have been increased and it constitutes the fourth general increase in the non-contributory assistance schemes since the beginning of 1957.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that members will welcome the increases and concessions provided for in this Bill and it gives me great pleasure to recommend it to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the concessions and increases are concerned, we welcome this piece of legislation, but with the decreasing value of the £, they are the normal increases one would expect.  There are no large increases at all.  The only large increase in social benefits is the increase from 28/6 to £2 in contributory old age pensions.  It is still true that our old and our poor are not as well looked after as we would like them to be.  We find very meagre the increases to which the Minister has drawn attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself is a most conservative man.  In his various Ministries <Col N="1387" /> and various terms of office, that has been quite obvious.  He must be the most popular man in the Fianna Fáil Party with whatever Minister for Finance is in office when he is in other Ministries because of his very small demands on his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  It is in keeping with his character, his approach to things, his ultra-conservative being, that he should tighten up on offences that may be committed by applicants for pensions.</P>
    <P>As a person who in a country area gets a lot of social work to do in the preparation of cases for pensions, I can assure the Minister that many times it is not just a case of black and white.  Many applicants are neither black nor white but in the grey category. In fact, concealment of means or representing means as less than they are in applying for a pension can be regarded as a matter of interpretation rather than a deliberate attempt to defraud.</P>
    <P>The Minister in introducing the new sections said: &ldquo;Leave it to the courts.&rdquo; Take an old age pensioner about whom I have had correspondence with the Minister in the past fortnight.  The woman was receiving money from her sons and daughters towards the housekeeping. It all went into a pool and thence the family expenses were paid. At the same time, the woman had some other small funds of her own.  I contend that the woman is not in receipt for her own purposes of the funds for the housekeeping and that the officers of the Department were incorrect in considering her as being in receipt of the total amounts her sons and daughters gave her for running the house.  Perhaps that lady will be liable to conviction and a fine.</P>
    <P>In going to law, you get a solicitor who employs a barrister and you make the best case you can.  It is all a question of how you shade the evidence and I do not view with equanimity this decision that concealment of funds should be made an offence.  My experience has been that the utmost stringency is applied to unfortunate applicants for all kinds of assistance and it is only after the most energetic <Col N="1388" /> representations by politicians, who should not be brought into this at all, that the decision of the Department's officers goes to the appeals officer who often decides in favour of the applicant. I do not like this trend of stringency.</P>
    <P>Now, if a man makes a wrong statement to obtain unemployment benefit or benefit under the health provisions, he is disqualified for six months. Imagine a man who is sick and there is a difference of opinion, as there often is, as to whether he is in fact sick or not.  He is disqualified automatically from national health benefit for six months because he has made a wrong statement.  Imagine the stringency of that sentence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He is disqualified only if he is convicted of fraud.  That is not just making a wrong statement inadvertently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is not automatic.  A man without the benefits of the education the Minister has and most of us have may make a wrong statement and find himself on the wrong side of the law.  He is convicted of fraud when the Department of Social Welfare sues him in the local court.  Then for six months his wife and children are left to the tender mercies of the assistance officer.  That is a pretty severe sentence but, in my opinion, it is in keeping with the Minister's ultra-conservative view.</P>
      <P>My experience in dealing with these matters has always been that there has been too much stringency and that the heavy hand of the Department of Social Welfare laid itself upon its officers down the country who, willy nilly, had to object to any pension being issued if there was the slightest possibility that a person was getting one while outside the regulations. Therefore, I do not like that sort of approach at all.  I would ask the Minister, in quoting the £869,500 in a full year and £580,000 in the present year, as the cost of these increases, if he has taken into account the extra monies that will be forthcoming from the increased revenue from insurance stamps?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, in fact, it is a net figure.  I do not want the Minister to take it that I am being deliberately antagonistic or anything like that.  I do not want him to feel that we do not welcome the proposal. However, I should have preferred if this had been given with a good heart and if these new stringency measures, such as disqualification for six months and tightening-up as the Minister said of the investigation of claims, and so on and so forth, had been left out of it.</P>
      <P>There had been far too much tightening up, as it was.  That reminds me of a saying in my part of the country: &ldquo;May you or yours never know the coldness of charity.  &ldquo;I do not think the Department of Social Welfare has very often been defrauded.  I do not think there is any evidence that there is general defrauding of the Department of Social Welfare.  The old conservatism as evidenced in those sections of the Bill runs right down to the lowest paid officers of the Department of Social Welfare in the smallest village of the country.</P>
      <P>It would have been better to give these things, which are only increases as a result of the decrease in the value of the £, with a hearty hand and a good wish rather than to bring in these stringency measures at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>The increases given under this Social Welfare Bill are welcome. We are glad the Minister included the aged, the blind, those in receipt of unemployment assistance, non-contributory widows' pensions, and so on, but we still feel we must act as Oliver Twist did and keep on asking for more.  Seeing that P.A.Y.E. has proved such a valuable money getter, the Minister should have given something more to these classes of beneficiaries.  None of us likes to pay our income tax but I think much of the pain of parting with our money would be eased if we felt a good deal of it was being used to aid those who are unlucky enough to be widowed early and to have the task of bringing up their families on non-contributory <Col N="1390" /> widows' pensions, or that we were making life easier for the unemployed, the sick, the blind and the aged.</P>
      <P>In the case of the contributory old age pension, this is something we all welcome.  I know it has brought a great deal of happiness to many persons who were existing on small industrial pensions which were insufficient to maintain them but with the addition of the contributory pension have a new independence that restores their self-respect. I would again, however, say that the amount here also is too small having regard to present-day costs particularly where it is the only money coming to the pensioner.  This contributory pension was a very good innovation. I must not be taken as disparaging it.  I only want to keep the Minister striving to increase the amount.</P>
      <P>On the topic of the contributory pensions, I again want to press the Minister to aim at a lowering of the age limit.  In an age when we talk of better education, culture and travel as a means of broadening our outlook on world affairs, in an age where there is a trend towards a shorter working week and an increase in leisure time, it is strange that our people must wait until they are 70 before they can get their old age pensions.</P>
      <P>Particularly in the case of women, 70 is far too old, as I mentioned on a previous occasion.  It is difficult for a great many women to remain in industry up to 70 years of age simply because, in most of the occupations open to women, employers will not give them employment.  I have in mind hotel work, shop work, machine work, and so on.  It is well known that employers just will not give work to elderly women.  This means that a very large number of women will be debarred from receiving the full contributory pension of £2.  I would ask the Minister to keep in mind the age limit question because, particularly to women, it constitutes a real injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Donegan on the subject of the penalty for fraud which I admit takes place.  I admit there are cases of possibly deliberate fraud.  I feel that in this day and age to deprive a person <Col N="1391" /> and his dependants of unemployment assistance is not the penalty we should inflict.  You might send him to prison or send him there for a longer term but we should not inflict a penalty which in fact would be a penalty on his dependants more than on himself. We may say he can get public assistance or that the dependants can get it.  In rural districts, it takes time before a widow or her children can get in touch with the county council or a county councillor and get some relief. I fear we could have a very severe and savage penalty in these clauses. In this modern age we should resort to some other means to punish those who commit fraud under these sections.</P>
      <P>One does find, as a Senator, that old age pensioners have means which, under the Department's regulations, are means.  In other words, they have money in the bank.  We have had several cases in quite recent years where old age pensioners have money in the bank.  For their own sake, and for the sake of the country&mdash;I do not know if it is beyond the scope of the Minister's Department to do so&mdash;they should be informed that they can get considerable interest on their money if it is invested in our national loans, for example.  Either they are not conversant with investment at all or they do not invest.  They leave their money in the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know one man who had £900 in the bank.  He did not know anything about investing that money.  Nobody had suggested it to him.  Nobody told him of the advantages of investing it. He never read any of the circulars of the Minister of Finance about the new loans, and so on.  The money was of practically no use whatever to him.  A great many pensioners are in the same position.  It would be well worth while, for the sake of the pensioners, if it were pointed out to them that there is 5 per cent. interest on that money waiting for them if it is invested.  That is happening time and time again, particularly throughout the country districts.  They think their money is safe in the bank.  They are getting no value whatsoever for it.  They keep it there.  They do not spend a penny of <Col N="1392" /> it.  They do not invest it and it is wasted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point which I should like to bring to the Minister's attention and which I feel is relevant.  This Bill is a fairly comprehensive measure.  It deals with people in receipt of pensions and on that account, I welcome it.  Like other speakers, I am disappointed that the increase given to the non-contributory widows is not greater.  I feel we should have been a little more generous. Because it was their misfortune that their husbands were not insured workers they should not be victimised for the rest of their lives.  The type of people to whom I should like to draw the Minister's attention, who are only small in numbers, are the mentally deficient and those who, through illness, are unable to provide for their own maintenance.  These people are maintained by their own families. After a very rigid means test, they now receive 22/6 per week.  If those people were sent to institutions, it would cost at least £4 a week to keep them.</P>
      <P>I would earnestly ask the Minister to have these cases looked into.  As I say, the numbers are small, thank God, but in every district, you will find one or two of those people who are unable to provide for themselves.  They are a burden on their parents, or on their families.  In the kindness of our people, the majority of families maintain such people at home.  I feel the burden on the State would be small if the Minister agreed that these people should receive at least £2 a week.  The amount of capital involved would be very small but the benefit to the people would be wonderful.  The type of case I refer to is not included in the Bill but I make that earnest appeal to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An old age pensioner will receive a contributory allowance of £2 a week and where he has a wife, he will receive £3. 10. 0. At 70, that old age pensioner may be able to do some useful work in or around the home.  He may even be able to earn a little money, but the type of person I refer to is not able to provide for himself <Col N="1393" /> in any way.  I hope that the Minister before he leaves office will recommend to the local managers that these people should receive an allowance of at least £2 a week.  I am a person who wants to help those people who are least able to help themselves.  Every member of this House, and the Minister, will agree that the type of person to whom I refer, the invalid, the mentally deficient and the semi-invalid, are the most helpless and the most neglected people in the country.</P>

      <P>There is only one point I want to make, that is, to observe that certain further powers are being vested in the Minister for Social Welfare with regard to the recovery of amounts which the Minister or his officers allege have been wrongfully paid to recipients of assistance, old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, and the like.  I have seen a number of these cases and the Minister should direct some attention to what happens.  As far as I can see, no real opportunity is given to a person who is alleged by the Department of Social Welfare to have been paid money to which he was not entitled, to establish that he was entitled to the money. There is a very elaborate procedure laid down in the Social Welfare Act, 1952, with regard to these matters and it may come as a surprise to some people to find that the official referred to in the Act as the deciding officer is a very minor civil servant, of no higher rank than the first clerical rung in the Civil Service ladder.  The most junior type of official is a deciding officer. Whatever he decides determines the livelihood of widows and orphans and old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an appeal provided for in the Act to an appeals officer.  The appeals officer under the regulations is a distant official who sits in the <Col N="1394" /> Department's building in Store Street and to whom the appellant has no access whatever, except of course, through representations on a piece of paper which is supplied as a form.  I do not think that that system enables justice to be done between a person who contends he has not been paid an amount to which he was not entitled and the Department of Social Welfare official.  I want to emphasise this point, that in spite of the fact that&mdash;of course this is a point which will not appeal to the Minister&mdash;the Supreme Court decided that the appeals officer was to exercise judicial functions in a judicial way, I am aware of cases in which the appeals officer has not exercised his functions in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>No opportunity is being given at present to people who are accused of having been paid amounts in excess of the amount to which they were entitled to make a proper case.  Far from making new penalties in Section 7 and Section 20 and providing new means of recovering amounts alleged to have been wrongfully paid, the Minister should be directing his attention to reorganising the whole system of deciding claims and the system of appeals from the decision of the appeals officer. I cannot at all welcome these sections in the Bill.  They smack very much of the ruthless bureaucratic system under which the State must always be right, first, last and all the time.  Unfortunate widows and old age pensioners may, by the stroke of a pen of a deciding officer or an appeals officer in Dublin, be deprived of their whole livelihood and may be compelled under Section 20 to accept deductions from the pensions to which they are entitled for debts due by their husbands or by deceased spouses.  I do not think that fits in with ordinary conceptions of a liberal welfare code decently and fairly operated as between the community and the supposed recipients.</P>

      <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to the case of very old persons who have reached the age of 80 or so.  In any future legislation, it would be well if they could be provided with extra pensions.  A person who has reached 80 is in a much <Col N="1395" /> weaker condition and requires more care than a person of 70 and lower. It would cost the Exchequer very little to provide a little extra which would make his remaining years happier. Again, at the age of 70 an old age pensioner is often quite lively and able to work, but under existing legislation he is afraid almost to go outside the door for fear that he may be penalised. If things were not so strict, persons in country districts especially could have some employment and it would be a great help in old age if they were able to earn something.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter in any future legislation.</P>

We have heard a great deal about these unfortunate individuals who are going to lose their entitlement to unemployment benefit, for a period of six months.  Senator O'Quigley would lead one to believe that this penalty, which is severe and is intended to be severe in order that it may be an effective deterrent, is a punishment which will fall upon them at the stroke of a pen of an appeals officer.  Of course that is not the case.  I refer the Senator to Section 10 of the Bill, paragraph (b) of which reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the insertion of the following subsection, namely, a person convicted of an offence under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Whatever else an appeals officer may do, he cannot convict a person of an offence, and it means that if a person has been found by a court to be guilty of fraud on evidence submitted to the court and accepted by the court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall hear about his wife and children later.  The Senator appears to be very indignant, but it is a pity that his indignation arises rather from ignorance than from knowledge.  If he will just listen, I shall tell him of the sort of cases we are out to get, or at least prevent occurring.  In Section 14, paragraph (b) provides for the insertion &ldquo;of the following subsection, namely, a person convicted of an offence under this Section.&rdquo;  Section 18 similarly provides for a person convicted of an offence. There is no question here of victimising any person who has not attempted to victimise others, or of punishing any person who has not attempted to do wrong to others.  On the other hand, I was surprised, as I said, at the number of responsible Senators who were prepared apparently to condone fraud on their fellow citizens, on the community as a whole.  The community is not an impersonal thing.  It consists of honest and hard-working people who would not defraud their <Col N="1397" /> neighbours, and all our tears and our sympathy should be for the honest folk who are prepared to work and maintain themselves, and not for those &ldquo;fly boys&rdquo;, slick customers, who are out whenever they can to do their neighbours.  The Senator was quite wrong when he assumed that these penalties apply to persons who have been in receipt of disability benefit, that it is a benefit which is payable in respect of illness.  The sections to which I have referred relate only to those who have secured unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance by fraud.  I think I made that quite clear in what I said.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that, as Senator Carton reminded me, a copy of my statement was not available for members of the House.  I apologise, and I understand and readily appreciate the difficulties under which they have been criticising this Bill because of that.</P>
      <P>The only people who are affected at this stage are mainly people who have received unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance by making fraudulent and untrue statements. Persons who are in the habit of doing that are very seldom people who are in truth unemployed.  Most of them are in reasonably constant employment, but can make an arrangement with or without the actual connivance of their employers whereby they are able to turn up at the labour exchange on the appointed day and sign on and then go off and draw remuneration for work which they are able to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see these cases.  They come before me because I have to sign the certificates necessary for prosecution. Recently I had before me the case of a person who is engaged in constant employment in a large firm.  His conditions of service provide that, when he works five days, he is paid for the sixth as well. He is off the sixth day but he gets payment for it.  He discovered it was possible to go down and sign on that day and he did.  He alleged that he was unemployed and he claimed and received a certain sum. He is being prosecuted.  He may be fined £1 or something like that by the judge.  He will probably not repeat the <Col N="1398" /> offence but in any event I want to make it quite clear that if he does repeat the offence, he is off unemployment benefit for at least six months. That will make him pause the next time the bright idea enters his head that he can defraud the public with impunity.  That is what is happening and what I want to discourage.</P>
    <P>The same thing occurs in relation to unemployment assistance.  I cannot see why we should feel that we are treating anyone harshly if we are making it quite clear to them that so far as fraudulent recourse to the social assistance code is concerned, the game will not be worth the candle.  We all know what was happening a year or two ago before we embarked on that tightening up of the administration, which is being complained of here.</P>
    <P>We all know the bright story of the farmer's sons living side by side.  It was quite easy by putting 13 stamps on a card to draw unemployment benefit for a six months' period.  This will make sure that that will not happen again.  That is one of the things which we are out to stop.  The difficulty about the position is this.  The social welfare code in our country, with our scattered population, lends itself so readily to fraud by dishonest people that we have to be severe in the measures we are taking to stamp it out.  While we are increasing these benefits, it is necessary at the same time to increase the deterrents against fraud, because every time unemployment benefit goes up and every time unemployment assistance goes up, there is an increased temptation offered to these people to defraud the community.</P>
    <P>I think it quite reasonable to argue that, when we are taxing the community and taxing it heavily, as, no doubt, the people and the Seanad will be told when the Appropriation Bill is discussed here, we are bound, as responsible legislators, to take steps to tighten up the administration in a certain way and make it quite clear that any person who sets out to defraud the community by fraudulently claiming unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or widow's non-contributory pension, and who is convicted <Col N="1399" /> of fraud&mdash;that means convicted in court by a judge, an independent tribunal, on evidence&mdash;will have imposed on him by law this fixed penalty.</P>
    <P>There are certain disadvantages in that.  Perhaps it might be more difficult in certain cases to secure a conviction. It will mean that the district justice, or whoever he may be, will certainly weigh the evidence very carefully before he finds the person guilty. The mere fact that he does weigh the evidence carefully and then finds the person guilty surely justifies the imposition of the disabilities which are proposed in this Bill?</P>
    <P>There is another thing.  Let us not forget that it is not always the really ignorant person who conceals real means when he is claiming a non-contributory old age pension, or she a non-contributory widow's pension. There are some very astute people who do that.  They get away with it until they make a mistake.  When they make a mistake, they are caught.  We probably catch only one in 20, if even as many.  When we do catch them, surely we are entitled at least to recover what they have wrongfully obtained?  If they have passed their property over to some other person and if their relative or spouse should happen to be in receipt of a pension from some other source, surely we are entitled to recover that amount from him since he has enjoyed without any doubt the fruits of the fraud which was being perpetrated on the community?</P>
    <P>I see these cases.  I saw a case a few months ago of a person who had claimed a widow's non-contributory pension.  She made one slip-up which put the investigation officer upon her track.  She was found to have had at least £1,800 in cash.  Will Senator Donegan contend that the Minister for Social Welfare was not justified in recovering from that woman the moneys which she had wrongfully obtained? She was convicted in court and allowed out, if you please, under the Probation Act.</P>

      <P>I was talking about this lady who had £1,800.  Take another example: an old age pensioner died about two and a half years ago with a full non-contributory old age pension but when the estate duty office got the documents, they found that she had property to the value of over £4,000.  Of course, according to Senator Donegan, the poor woman did not know what she was doing when <Col N="1401" /> she filled in her application form and concealed the £4,000.  She forgot all about it.  The difficulty about it was that administration had to be taken out and the facts were disclosed in this particular case.</P>

      <P>We did in that particular case, but there were some cases where we did not, because we found that the administration had been taken out so quickly and the assets distributed so expeditiously that we could not recover.  It is not then just the simple sort of thing Senator Donegan would like to believe.</P>
      <P>On the general question, Senator Cole referred to people having savings which they did not properly invest. That is not the aspect of the question which I wish to touch upon.  But if people have savings, they are expected to maintain themselves out of these savings and not preserve them at the expense of the community.  That is the reason for having a means test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>People who maintain themselves honestly very often cannot build up these nest eggs.  You <Col N="1402" /> can make a facile case that the nest egg should not be touched, but if a person has a substantial sum, say, £1,000, and reaches the age of 70, he can purchase an annuity for himself. We should expect that he would do that but one of the reasons why many of them do not disclose their means is that they wish to hold them to pass on to their children.  That is all very well. It is a laudable ambition, provided it is an ambition which is not fulfilled at my expense or at the expense of the people who are taxed to find the money to pay these old age pensions.</P>
      <P>I am sorry I have spoken at such length but some questions were raised in the discussion which go down to first principles and when we are dealing with these social welfare schemes, we must not, in the discharge of our duty and obligations to the people we represent, allow our hearts to run away with our heads.  We have got to think.  What is behind all social welfare measures is this: we are taxing people who are earning, people who are producing, in order that we may give something to people no longer in a position to produce for themselves. But there is a limit to what is fair and just in these matters and I think we have gone to the limit, having regard to the resources of the community, in the benefits which we do provide for the poor and the needy, the aged and the infirm.</P>
      <P>Senator Donegan said that the benefits in this Bill would compensate only for the rise in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The drop in the value of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is reflected in the rise in the cost of living.  If the Senator wishes to make a point of it, I will say that the rise in the cost of living reflects a great deal more than a mere fall in the value of money.  It does in this country at any rate reflect the rise in the standard of living, the standard which we wish to enjoy. Nobody wants to go back to the conditions which existed in 1948 or before the war but that is not the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what exactly the facts are regarding the fall in the value of <Col N="1403" /> money.  That fall is reflected to some extent in the increase in the cost-of-living index figure.  If we take mid-August 1947 as the datum line, and the base as 100, we find that in mid-May, 1961, the index figure is 150, an increase of 50 per cent. over 1947. But the increase in old age pensions is just double the increase in the cost of living.  In 1947, the actual amount paid in mid-August, including the supplement, was 15/-.  Today we are by this Bill increasing the old age pension to 30/-, so this Bill does a great deal more than merely compensate for the fall in the value of money.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that it is as much as we would like to give, but certainly it is as much as this country can afford.  We must remember that we have a very tough future ahead.  We see a country on the other side of the water where these social welfare benefits were dished out freely and look at the position which the people there are in today.  We do not want to get our economy into that situation. Therefore, despite the temptation to yield to the specious arguments used here and elsewhere, we must say that we will give as much as we can afford to give without doing injury to the whole economy and that is what we have been doing.</P>
    <P>Senator Tunney raised a point regarding the disablement allowances. These are already provided for under the Health Acts and last year I increased the maximum from 20/- to 22/6d.  People may say that is not enough but it has to be considered in relation to the circumstances of this community.  It is already costing us over £800,000 a year and it would be a great deal more if we raised the figure to 40/-.  Again, remember, this disablement allowance is not intended to provide full maintenance for any person in receipt of it.  It is merely intended to assist the members of the recipient's family, particularly the immediate members, to discharge their family responsibility.  They cannot divest themselves of that responsibility and place it altogether on the shoulders of the community.  The community are <Col N="1404" /> doing a great deal to help the people who have to bear the cross of having some member of their family in a position that he cannot maintain himself but beyond that I think we are not entitled to go.</P>

      <P>The section bears a certain resemblance to Sections 18 and 20.  In my view, it interferes with the court.  A person can be prosecuted in law and the decision of the court is binding.

      <P>The position is a normal one.  Under the section in the 1911 Act, any overpayment of pension may be recovered by withholding the pension, under the Acts, to which a person becomes entitled.  Wherever a court judgement has been obtained for the amount of the overpayment, plus the costs, I am advised that the Minister's only claim is under the judgment and there is no other right of recovery of money save the judgment.  The position is anomalous, I suggest.  The Minister would have to continue to pay pension to a person even when the court decided he had been overpaid and should repay.</P>

      <P>I would refer to the point I raised before.  Take a person with an adult dependant and two or more dependent children.  In an urban area, they receive 52/6d., plus, and, in a rural area, 42/6d., plus.  That person is convicted&mdash;rightly so, I agree.  Perhaps <Col N="1406" /> he is sent to prison&mdash;rightly so, I agree.  However, for the next week or two, who are the sufferers in that case?  Are they not his wife and children, more than himself?  It happens.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say they are entitled to assistance but they do not get it for perhaps weeks.  That is an actual fact.  For instance, if the Department decided &mdash; and probably rightly so&mdash;that a man was defrauding they would bring him into the courts. That will take a little time.  They are not paying in the meantime and he is convicted.  He may be let off under the Probation of Offenders Act or perhaps he is sent to prison.  The wife and children decide to look for home assistance.  It takes some little time before that comes through.  There should be some way of providing for them at once.  They have probably spent every penny of the previous week's money: we may take it that they have.  I know cases where that is the position.  The time lag between getting some sort of assistance elsewhere can cause grave hardship.  I find that frequently the small shopkeeper is the person who fills in in the interval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What can I do?  I am in this difficulty.  The person has been convicted.  If he is sent to prison, he cannot draw his unemployment assistance.  If he is not sent to prison, he is convicted, but only because he drew unemployment assistance fraudulently, when he was working, when he was in employment.  Therefore, if he is deprived of unemployment assistance, it does not necessarily follow&mdash; and in most cases will not follow&mdash; that he loses his job as well.  I assume that the people for whom he has been working will be quite prepared to continue him in employment.  The only thing is that he has lost his right to unemployment assistance for six months.  I suppose that will make him a little more anxious to keep his job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the contrary case.  Let us assume he loses his job as well as unemployment assistance.  Then he has just to fall back on home assistance, as many honest people in this country have to do.  We cannot be too considerate. <Col N="1407" /> There is not any justification for being over-considerate in cases where fraud is concerned.  We have to teach people that fraud does not pay. You have to do that by being stern and strict.</P>

      <P>The dependant of every man guilty of a crime generally has to suffer.  It is the hard way of the world.  There is nothing we can do to stop that.  Most home assistance authorities have an arrangement whereby a person can apply for provisional assistance.  They will be given home assistance immediately.  Certainly, in any case where a fellow has been convicted and has gone to prison, or was convicted and lost his job, I do not think there would be any difficulty whatever in providing something immediately for his wife and dependants.  I think very little time would be lost in coming to a decision in that case.</P>

      <P>The Minister obviously has no experience, notwithstanding his long period in politics, of social work.  Take an Assistance Officer who has done ten years' work in the job.  The man at the top has to make the decision whether the person should get home assistance or not.  He has had such an over-surfeit of people making demands upon him&mdash;I should be glad if the Minister would listen to me: it would help&mdash;that he becomes hard in his heart.  I have found that the home assistance officers, the nicest <Col N="1408" /> people you can meet in ordinary life, become so hardened in their hearts that they do not view an empty plate or an empty stomach with the same sympathy as an ordinary person would view it.  So many people of low character try to get home assistance from these people that the unfortunate wife of the man in jail could for the first couple of weeks get short shrift. The position which Senator Cole is worried about is a very unfortunate one indeed.  I do say that there would be a delay and that there would be trouble and hunger.</P>

      <P>Senator Donegan is all wrong in this matter and he can very easily find out the position if he goes to some home assistance officer in his own county.  If an officer fails to provide provisional relief when it is required, he will lose his job immediately.  Any person who requires provisional relief to-night or to-morrow must get it immediately or the home assistance officer is not doing his job.  He may not give the money until he inquires into the position but he must provide the necessaries of life.  It is the law of the land.</P>

I sincerely believe that these sections of this legislation are utterly intolerable.  I am not saying that because I am on this side of the House.

      <P>This is the section which empowers the Minister to deduct from a widow's pension to which she becomes entitled, any sums which she may previously have been paid and to which she was not entitled, in discharge of the debt due to the Minister. I think I am right in saying that that is the purpose of the section.  When a woman becomes entitled, through lack of means, to a widow's pension, then because she owes a debt to the State, because she got a pension at a time when she had some means, she is not to get the pension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very much the same as the section which we dealt with on old age pensions.  This <Col N="1410" /> section provides power for the recovery of certain over-payments, that is, payments already made to widows or orphans in non-contributory pensions, and it is similar to that in Section 7 of the Bill in relation to non-contributory old age pensions.  The same position applies.  Under subsection (2) of Section 57 of the Widows and Orphans Pensions Act of 1935, an amount of pension which a pensioner is held liable to repay may be recovered by withholding the pension until the debt is liquidated, or suitable proceedings may be instituted.  Doubt has arisen as to whether if a decree is obtained, power to recover can still be exercised.  It is not, as the Senator said, a case of trying to recover a debt when a pension has been granted for the first time.  It is the power to recover an over-payment made in respect of a widow's or orphan's non-contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has clarified the matter.  He has the same view as I had.  The position is when a woman was paid, say, a pension of 25/-, she was perhaps entitled to only 15/-.  Therefore, and I want to make this point quite clear, a deciding officer, or perhaps an appeals officer, on appeal, decided she was entitled to only 15/-. Perhaps she then had means which disqualified her from receiving the 25/-She uses up these means and becomes entitled to a pension of 25/-, but now, at a time when she has no assets and becomes entitled to the higher pension, she has to repay the over-payment made to her previously and she is tole: &ldquo;You will have to go without a pension because you were over-paid at a particular time.&rdquo;  The position is that when a woman really requires money, it is deducted from the pension to which she was entitled.  We should consider where we are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Senator Donegan, the Minister made great play on the orders of the court and judicial procedure, and so on.  I want to be quite specific on this.  The House should realise that in a case where it is decided that a widow was over-paid a pension, it is not as a result of any procedure in court.  It is the result of a decision by <Col N="1411" /> a deciding officer or it may be the result of a decision of an appeals officer.  I want to be quite clear on this.  There is no semblance of justice or fair play in many cases in the manner in which decisions of appeals officers or deciding officers are made. The circumstances in which they are made could not conduce to fair play or justice.</P>

      <P>It is not the fault of the deciding officer or the appeals officer.  It is the fault of the machinery under which he gets a bundle of papers by way of reports in a file without having an opportunity of a full and adequate explanation by the person whose income is being affected.  The deciding officer decides that Mrs. XY is no longer to receive a widow's pension of 15/- and she gets nothing. That is the gravamen of the charge, the serious injustice perpetrated on a greater scale under this section by reason of the administrative procedure employed in the Department of Social Welfare, and if the Minister had any conception of justice and fair play, he would not attempt to defend that procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very eloquent statement but it just does not happen to be right.  That is the only difficulty.  Let us remember whom at a long distance the Senator is attacking.  He is attacking the Oireachtas which passed the Act of 1952 under which the appeals officer procedure was instituted in order that justice might be done to the claimants and that there would be no question of political influence being brought to bear upon him so that he might give a decision contrary to justice.  To suggest, as the Senator has done, that there is no justice in this procedure is surely to deny to the servants of the State, the people upon whom this responsibility is imposed, the ordinary sense of fair play and justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> I am not going to believe that an appeals officer does not decide these cases fairly, and decide them, as I have seen so often when I have asked for the record of the proceedings, with a positive bias, if a bias can exist, in favour of the applicant.  No appeals officer wants, if he can avoid it, to refuse an application which is well founded and reasonably established. Why should he?  If he were to do so, then the case could be debated on the Minister's Estimate and, if necessary, a motion could be put down on the subject or a Parliamentary Question, followed of course by supplementaries. No civil servant that I know of wants to find himself the target of Parliamentary proceedings, so, as I have said, if there is bias at all, it is bias in favour of the applicant.  It is not true &mdash;it is very far from being true&mdash;that any appeals officer, most of whom are chosen because they have a sense of responsibility and fair play, would act wilfully and deliberately unjustly in a case like this; but supposing he does, as the matter stands at the moment the applicant can ask for an oral hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter. The time element does not matter very much because if, after hearing, the appeal is decided in favour of the applicant, then of course the payment is retrospective and very often much more welcome for that reason because it comes in a good solid lump sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The Senator cannot get away with that sort of suggestion: that people are destitute because they do not get public money just at call.  Let us consider what the situation is.  We are now in the position that, as matters stand, the Minister, if the oral hearing has gone against the applicant, can proceed to deduct from the pension rightly payable to that widow the amount which she has received as an over-payment in excess of what she was rightly entitled to.  He does not, of course, appropriate the whole of the pension.  He can deduct a certain portion of it.  Therefore <Col N="1413" /> he is in this situation, that if there is any question of a doubt where he might think that it would be in the applicant's interest that he should take court proceedings to recover, he is not going to go into court because he knows that he may find himself in a worse position, even if he wins the proceedings.  What we are doing here is to make it easier for the Minister to go to court, if recovery is warranted.</P>

      <P>I want to be very clear.  The Minister is very adept at distorting what people say.  It may be that he is not on the proper wavelength and that he does not hear things correctly.  I want it to be quite clear that what I had to say was in reference to the circumstances in which injustices and unfairness are done.  I do not say that any officer of the Minister would deliberately do an injustice or be deliberately unfair.  I did not say anything of that kind. What I did say was that the procedure involved within which they have to work in taking a bundle of papers and deciding upon these would not permit them in a great many cases to do justice or give fair play.  That is what I said, and no amount of adapting that to the Minister's purpose can change it.</P>
      <P>The Minister is trying to confuse himself and the courts and thereby to imply that Senator Donegan because he lacks respect for the administrative tribunal also lacks respect for the judicial tribunal.  Of course Senator Donegan has drawn quite a clear distinction between them.  We want to be clear that it is the Minister's administrative tribunals, the deciding and appeals officers, who make the decision that a person was wrongly or unlawfully in receipt of a pension. That is a decision from which there is no effective appeal, and that is what I protest against, for in those circumstances an injustice is done.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that we must be extremely careful just how we frame things as the Minister is going to be quite selective.  He is going to pick us up on anything he can.  A statement was made that the Department officers were never ultra-conservative, never hard on people and were always fair.  I do not think they have always been like that.  In my experience, I have found them ultraconservative <Col N="1416" /> and extremely hard on people.  I will give one instance now of a female officer of the Department of Social Welfare who arrived at Mullacurry Races a few years ago.  She walked round every fence on the racecourse and took a good view of the men standing at the fences.  All they got from the Louth Hunt for standing at the fences was 10/-.  She went down to Ardee employment exchange the following morning and disqualified the lot of them from receiving unemployment assistance.  Is that hard?  Is that unfair?  Is that ultra-conservative? I say it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I charge that female officer of the Department of Social Welfare with being hard, unfair and ultra-conservative.  That is one instance. I will give another one where the same female officer did what, in my view, was a most uncharitable thing.  I should like the officers behing the Minister to look into that matter, see their files and write to me to say whether it is correct.  I am ready to apologise if it is not correct.</P>
      <P>The position is that a person in receipt of unemployment assistance will be automatically disqualified, according to the second last section of the Bill, for six months from the receipt of such unemployment assistance. Earlier in this debate, I referred to the fact that there was such a colour as grey.  It is not always black and it is not always white.  The Minister actually twisted this suggestion of mine.  My suggestion was that a person might be adjudged by a court to be guilty, while at the same time the justice might desire to fine that person a penny.  That is true of any legislation.  It is true of any conviction that takes place in a court. You can find a man technically guilty of a crime but at the same time morally innocent.  There is many a case where an unfortunate person in receipt of unemployment assistance might be found by a court to be guilty but the justice would desire to impose a fine of 1/- or a penny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions, as I understand them, of the social welfare code for <Col N="1417" /> share fishermen are that share fishermen are allowed to fish a certain number of hours per week before they are regarded as employed.  That is my understanding of it but perhaps it has been changed.  A share fisherman on the Boyne and other rivers might, perhaps, fish a few hours in the week owing to the weather.  The scales might be balanced one way or another as to whether he was entitled to apply for unemployment assistance or not. If the Department of Social Welfare, through the activities of an overzealous officer such as the officer who went to the Mullacurry races, brought that person to court and the court found him guilty, that person might be just guilty by a shade.  He might be a person in dire want.  He might be disqualified for six long months and his wife and children would be thrown upon the tender mercies of the home assistance officer because of what was really only an offence in name.</P>
    <P>These are simple things.  On the unemployment benefit section, I am going to cite a worse case where the same officer was involved.  It was a far worse case.  I do not think there is any case for a Minister to take unto himself automatic powers.  The Minister himself or his successor might not desire, looking at all the evidence of a particular case, to disqualify a man for six months.  He might desire to waive that disqualification.  As I understand this legislation, he cannot do it.  I am not absolutely sure whether or not I have described the situation in relation to the share fishermen adequately but there is very little in it.  Perhaps I have given an example which the gentlemen behind the Minister managed to explode.  There are other examples, too.  Had I studied this Bill as well as I should have studied it before it came to the House, I could have produced many such examples. I did not do so.  That is my own fault, I admit.  These sections are absolutely intolerable.</P>

      <P>He has been talking eloquently about fence watchers at Mullacurry races but Camptown races have as much to do with this Bill as Mullacurry because this section does not relate to employees at all.  This section concerns offences by an employer so there you are.  This deals with one who aids, abets, counsels or procures.  I will read the section of the 1938 Act as it is amended:</P>
      <P>Where a person, in this section referred to as the employer aids, abets, counsels or procures a person (in this Section referred to as the employee) employed by him to commit an offence under Section 29 of the principal Act (as amended by Section 14 of the Amending Act) or conspires with the employee for the commission by the employee of an offence under the said section 29 as so amended, the employer shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds or, at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months.</P>

He would not have dragged in the share fishermen because the share fishermen have nothing to do with this.  A share fisherman can go out and fish any day he likes, provided he has a qualification certificate and as long as he has a qualification certificate, he can draw unemployment assistance.</P>

If he goes out fishing every day and secures a good return, his qualification certificate may be called in question, but so long as he holds his qualification certificate, he is not deprived of unemployment assistance, no matter how many days he may go out fishing. There you are.  There is the truth. We heard the Minister attacked.  Sure, of course, the Minister is well able to stand it.  He is accustomed to this.  His skin should be thick after 40 years. It is no longer skin.  It is a carapace. Nevertheless, Senator Donegan would have felt much less foolish at this present moment if only he had read the Bill before beginning to talk.</P>

My remarks were relevant regarding disqualification of a person from unemployment assistance.  If I have digressed, it was up to the Cathaoirleach to say whether I was in order or not and if I was not in order on that <Col N="1420" /> section, I was not in order on Section 10.

There are many young nuns who could have stayed to make tea for them but this old lady who was thrown on the winds of the world was asked by the reverend mother to do this for which she got her lunch and a few shillings a week.

      <P>This is one of the <Col N="1424" /> reasons why it is unsatisfactory to deal with Bills on Committee Stage at such short notice.  There is a clear distinction drawn in our system of jurisprudence between the entity known as a Minister of State and the State.  There is quite a distinction between the Minister for Industry and Commerce, let us say, who somebody might think is representing the State and the other juristic entity known as the State.  I have some doubt as to whether or not the State in this context has any meaning.  It may have: I do not know.

      <P>I do not think there is any satisfactory explanation.  At any rate, there it is in the Bill.  We have enacted more unsatisfactory legislation than this Bill at this time of year on other occasions with perhaps a great deal less justification.  I want to come to the substance of this section.  I observe that it is the intention to enlarge the powers of the Minister for Social Welfare to recover over-payments of old age pension from a widow who is entitled to an old age pension but whose husband before his death received an over-payment.  That is what we are doing in this section. The widow herself had no hand, act or part in perhaps any of the concealment or even in the fraud perpetrated by her husband.</P>
      <P>It is notorious that some husbands do not disclose to their wives their financial affairs or dealings with outsiders. A widow may have had no hand, act or part in the fraud committed by her husband.  Nevertheless, when she becomes entitled to her old age pension, the old age pension which was unlawfully secured by her husband, being a debt due to the State, is deducted from the pension to which the widowed old age pensioner is entitled.  I do not think that that is legislation about which we can be very enthusiastic.  I doubt if any Senators opposite will say that that is a provision which they welcome.  I do not think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall strive to uphold the rights <Col N="1425" /> of the individual and the right of old age pension widows to live notwithstanding the sins of their deceased husbands.  That is what I see objectionable in this &mdash; that the sins of a deceased husband who was an old age pensioner are to be visited on the innocent old age pension widow. I wonder if the Minister fully realises that that is the implication of that section?</P>
    <P>I think I detect some note of perturbation in the Minister whose humanity in matters of this kind is beyond question.  I wonder if we are wise, in the circumstances?  This section is quite different from other sections we have criticised.  I wonder whether it would not be wise to delete this section and to give the matter further consideration on some other Bill?</P>
    <P>Since the Old Age Pensions Act was introduced in 1908, we have soldiered without this provision.  In 1961, in a somewhat more liberal age, when people have different ideas, I do not think we ought to inflict such a dire punishment upon an innocent widow in recipt of or entitled to receive an old age pension.</P>

      <P>Yes.  He has, in this case.  The need for this section was brought home by a case of deliberate fraud on the part of a lady who was granted a pension in 1952 and concealed the means of herself and her husband to the extent that she received an overpayment of £309. Then she died.  The fraud was discovered. In the meantime, her husband became entitled to a contributory old age pension, a pension for which he had not paid one penny.  He was then asked if he would allow the deductions to be made from his contributory pension at the same rate as his wife's pension and his allowance.</P>

      <P>Let us consider another case, the case of a husband who conceals from the pensions officer that he is in receipt of, say, a British Army pension, something that dies with him and something about which the Government have no prior knowledge. He dies and it is found out that he had this British Army pension and that he had defrauded the Department of a large sum of money.  His wife had never enjoyed this pension because he drank it all.  You can get a parallel in any village in the country&mdash;the husband who drinks and the wife who does not.  She becomes liable then for the deduction from her old age pension because of her husband's fraud.  I do not think that is fair or right or proper.</P>

      <P>It might happen. Does the Minister not conceive circumstances in which the widow would be completely innocent of perhaps even a technical breach of the law by her deceased husband, or be entirely innocent of a flagrant breach of the law by her husband?  There are such cases.  The Minister proposes to take power to strip the widow of a pension to which she becomes entitled, the more so because she is a widow and over 70.  I think if the Minister realised the implications of this&mdash;he has given only one example&mdash;we would not have this kind of thing in the Bill.  I would urge the Minister to leave this over to another time.  If there were a provision or any assurance given by the Minister here that <Col N="1427" /> this section would not be operated so as to leave the widow, who has a sense of self-respect and pride, in dire want and having to go, an innocent woman, in her old age to the home assistance people, and that she would be allowed to retain so much as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Having listened to Senator Donegan and Senator O'Quigley, I realised that I never knew there were so many innocent people in the world.  I knew about this innocent widow in my own parish who died worth £2,500 and she had drawn £357 wrongfully from the State. She left that money to relatives in America.  She had drawn a full pension for many years.  The social welfare officers and assistance officers have been assailed here to-night for doing their job, and probably for doing it in a mild way, whereas they could have done it in a harsher way. Senator Donegan and Senator O'Quigley did not tell us about the people who get away; they only tell us about the people who are caught.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;pretends that the unfortunate widow would not have the gumption to get an instalment order in court against her husband.  It is a hypothetical case: it has no basis in reality.  It is made to look apparent, the same, of course, as the Fine Gael programme for the coming election. This is only filibustering to hold up the Bill.  This argument has no basis in fact; it merely rests on fiction.  We all know that we meet cases every day of the week and we are very hard put, when we get cases such as this, to try to put up an argument.  We usually find that we have no basis for our argument when the case is proved.</P>
      <P>There is of course none of the tyranny which the Senator speaks of administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  We all know that.  The Senator's colleagues know it.  For that matter, if the Senator is so liberal about fleecing the taxpayers under the guise of benevolence, he is of course not responsible for administering the Vote. It is easy to get up and put forward a hypothetical case which of course has no basis whatsoever in fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully aware that the Old Age Pensions Acts operate on the basis of the joint income of husband and wife, and therefore I suppose there is something in the argument that the wife did benefit to a certain extent before the death of the husband, but it is no fiction to say that all over this country, in every street, in every village and in every parish, there are husbands who took a few drinks more than they should and there are wives who probably have not had any share in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, and this is not reducing this House to the level of the half-barrel or anything else.  My case is that the unfortunate wife, because the husband did not declare the income during his life, must now suffer after his death, and it is at death that these details become known, for various reasons.  This fraud&mdash;and in many cases it is a very minor fraud&mdash; continues until death, and then this unfortunate woman who has nothing, perhaps, to live on and who had hoped for the full non-contributory old age pension, finds herself with the pension reduced to half.  I say that the interpretation by the Department of Social Welfare officials has always been that it is their duty to pay the minimum according to law, and the minimum is through deduction from the old age pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, well, well! The Senator has not got the opportunity, of course, of reading the other Bills referred to in this measure, but he could have read the section, and this section is a permissive section.  It merely permits the Minister to make a deduction.  It does not say that he shall&mdash;it is not mandatory.  Senator O'Quigley asked me for an assurance which I can give him quite freely that the widow will not, as he said, be stripped.  A modest deduction will be made in order to recover the over-payments of which she may be presumed to have had the benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Minister did not say that.  He showed his hand in the last part of the sentence when he said that they would see to it that the deduction was taken slowly.  This comes back to what I said, that the principle of the interpretation and the carrying out by the Department of Social Welfare will be <Col N="1430" /> preserved, namely, that the full deduction will be made, whether in small or large instalments.  On that basis, I wish still to be recorded as opposing this section.</P>

      <P>I am not given to repetition, as the Chair knows.  The Minister says that this is permissive legislation, but that is not the whole story.  The Minister knows very well that the Social Welfare Fund, and indeed all the other accounts of the Department of Social Welfare, are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who can take out the file relating to Mrs. XY and the Minister's officers may be called on to answer why they did not in this case exercise their power under Section 20 of the Social Welfare Act of 1961.  To say that it is permissive does not mean everything, because hanging&mdash;and very rightly so, for it is a great safeguard of democracy&mdash; behind the head, not over it, of every person in charge of public funds is the knowledge that there may be an audit query from the Comptroller and Auditor General and thus in every case they are impelled to exercise powers which people would prefer not to have to do.</P>
