      <P>On the Order of Business, I should just like to ask what I have asked for the past few sessions of the Seanad, namely, whether any final decision has been taken with regard to the Reporting Staff.  We understood on the last occasion that it was under active consideration and that arbitration had been suggested and accepted by the staff under certain conditions.  I understand that today, as last time, there are only three members of the Reporting Staff available for the Seanad and only four for the Dáil and that, inevitably, in these circumstances, there will be a big backlog of work.  I feel that the matter has been put on the long finger in defiance of the obvious desire of both Houses to have the matter settled.  The Reporting Staff is employed on our behalf and something more than talk about active consideration should be done.  Could I know what has been done?</P>

      <P>The position regarding the Reporting Staff dispute is <Col N="809" /> that they have been asked to avail themselves of the arbitration and conciliation machinery that is normally used to enable these matters to be adjusted.

    <Title>An Bille Toghcháin (Leasú), 1961. - Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Bill, 1961&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to provide machinery which will enable seven Dublin voluntary hospitals to form <Col N="810" /> themselves first into a federation and then permit them in course of time to be integrated as one group, governed by a single body.  The seven hospitals concerned are the Adelaide, the Meath, Mercer's, the National Children's, the Royal City of Dublin, Sir Patrick Dun's and Dr. Steevens' hospitals.</P>
      <P>About two years ago it came to my notice that some seven of the hospitals in Dublin were considering some form of association.  I thereupon contacted the hospitals concerned and asked their representatives to meet me in the Custom House in May, 1959.  Arising out of this meeting a committee was set up under the chairmanship of the Secretary of my Department to consider the matter.  That committee found it possible to evolve a plan for close association between the seven hospitals, which has been accepted fully by all of them and is the basis of the Bill before the House.  I might add here, that this text has also been approved by each of the seven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need hardly tell this House that the contribution of the seven institutions covered by the Bill to the development of hospital medicine in Dublin has been great indeed.  The establishment and development of every one of them has been closely linked with the social history of this city; and a spirit of deep solicitude for the sick poor permeates the Acts and Instruments under which they were founded. Associated with this concern for the sick was the honourable ambition to develop the art of healing and to foster medical teaching so that not alone would they carry on the fight against the sickness and disease which flourished here but, in addition, would, by being generally beneficial to sufferers everywhere, win fame for their city.  The hospitals throughout their history have been amongst the foremost in adopting modern advances in medical science and in fostering nursing skill.  But the spectacular developments in medicine and surgery which have been such a feature of this generation have made it necessary to reorganise their activities so as to secure a more rational allocation of special functions between them.  The reorganisation will require time and <Col N="811" /> patience to accomplish; for between them the seven hospitals have some 1,200 beds, which is more than one-third of the general hospital beds in the city; and their annual expenditure is in the region of £¼ million.  But it is essential that it should be undertaken if the hospitals are to maintain their particular place in our medical life; and the sooner it is effected, the more assured will the future be for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I should now like to explain to the House the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 contains the sundry definitions required for the other provisions of the Bill.  Sections 2, 4, and 5 are related.  They provide for the appointment of a day to be the &ldquo;establishment day&rdquo; and for the bringing together on that day in a rather tight form of federation, the seven hospitals set out in the Long Title to the Bill.  This federation, or hospital group, as it is described in Section 4, is to be known in accordance with that section as the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals. The coming into being of the group of hospitals and of a Central Council to take over from the individual hospital boards certain of their functions will be simultaneous.  The usual powers of a corporate body are provided for the Central Council.  I shall refer more fully to Section 3, in conjunction with Section 19, later.  It provides for the ultimate integration by consent of the hospitals concerned.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 8 of the Bill provide that on the establishment day the existing governing bodies of the hospitals will be reconstituted as statutory hospital boards.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the membership of the proposed Central Council.  It is proposed that each of the hospitals will appoint five members, two, but not more than two, of whom must be members of the hospitals visiting medical staff.  These hospital representatives, together with five members to represent the Dublin Health Authority, will constitute the Council, which will thus have a total membership of 40.  This membership, however, may be increased by the appointment of two <Col N="812" /> additional representatives from each university, college or other institution which enters into an agreement with the Central Council for the clinical instruction of medical students.  The section prescribes the period for which the members appointed respectively by the various participating hospitals and by the Dublin Health Authority hold office.  Briefly it will be three years in the case of members appointed by the hospitals and by teaching institutions, but five years for members appointed by the Dublin Health Authority.  The five years is fixed for the latter because it is the period between local elections.</P>
    <P>Sections 9, 10 and 11 contain provisions relating to the time and place of meetings, the tenure of office of the chairman and vice chairman, which will normally be for three years, and the procedure at meetings of the Council.  There is nothing unusual about them.</P>
    <P>Under Section 12, the Council will be empowered to appoint committees. These committees may consist of Council members only or of Council members and other persons, the latter not, however, making up more than one-fourth of the total membership of any committee.  For practical purposes the Council may decide that certain of its functions would in the normal way be administered by a committee and it is obviously desirable to provide for this.  It is necessary, I submit also, that the the Council should have the power to appoint to a committee persons from outside the Council who because of their special qualifications or experience would be equipped to assist the Council in considering special problems.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the employment by the Council of the necessary staff.  In Section 14, the functions which are to be assigned to the Council are specified in some detail.  They include major administrative functions in relation to finance, staffing, assignment of specialties and professorial units, the apportionment of beds amongst the visiting medical staff, and medical and nursing education.  In the financial field, for a period of four years after the establishment day, the <Col N="813" /> Central Council will examine the estimates of the participating hospitals and may suggest amendments to them. After the expiration of four years, the estimates will be subject to approval by the Central Council.</P>
    <P>It should be noted also that under this section individual hospital boards will cease after the establishment day to appoint visiting medical staff. Instead the Central Council will make such appointments to the group as a whole and assign the appointees to the individual hospitals.  Safeguards are included in the section to protect the position of a hospital of a particular denominational character in relation to assignments of visiting medical staff and also in relation to the education of nurses.  Any rights of the present visiting medical staffs of individual hospitals will be protected by subsection (5) of the section.</P>
    <P>Section 15 inhibits the hospital boards from performing any of the functions assigned to the Council.  Except for these, however, the Boards will continue to perform the functions of the present governing bodies, with one notable restriction which is imposed by sub-section (3).  That sub-section provides that moneys collected by a hospital by public appeal will not be used for capital purposes by the board without the approval of the Council.  The provision will enable the Council to control expenditure on capital projects by members of the group, so as to co-ordinate it with the requirements of the group as a whole.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 17 provide for the amalgamation of two or more hospital boards with their consent and for the dissolution of a hospital board with its consent.  Necessary adjustments in membership of the Central Council would be made on the dissolution of a board.  Section 18 gives the Central Council power to make an agreement for joint action with a hospital outside the participating hospitals.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned Section 19 in association with Section 3.  Section 3 provides for the appointment of the &ldquo;transfer day&rdquo; by the Minister.  The &ldquo;transfer day&rdquo; marks the second and final stage of the development which <Col N="814" /> the Bill provides for.  On that day the complete integration of the seven now separate institutions will have been accomplished, and, under Section 19 they will cease to exist.  They will not, of course, be wiped out summarily.  Certain rights are reserved to the participating hospitals under Section 3, notably the right to dissent from the appointment of the &ldquo;transfer day&rdquo; and the right at this stage to opt out and leave the Federation.  Furthermore an order appointing the transfer day cannot be made without the consent of two-thirds of the hospital boards which exist at the time.</P>
    <P>Under Section 19, the separate hospital boards will be dissolved on the transfer day and their staffs, assets and liabilities transferred to the Central Council.  The provisions of the Second Schedule will govern these transfers to the Central Council.  This Schedule contains provisions to protect persons employed at the time of the transfer day against any disimprovement in their position arising from the change. Where the services of a person are terminated because no suitable position for him exists under the Council, he will be paid such compensation as the Council consider fair and reasonable. The Council's decision on this matter will, however, be subject to an appeal to a person designated by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 20 of the Bill relates to the expenses of the Council before amalgamation and provides that these will be divided on the basis of bed complements. Section 21 will make a change in the procedure for appointments of the hospital members which is a consequence of the abolition of the separate hospital boards on the transfer day.  Obviously, the triennial appointments of these members could not be continued after the boards are dissolved and it was therefore necessary to provide that vacancies after the transfer day in that part of the membership of the Council previously filled by the hospital boards would be filled by co-option.  The hospital board members of the Council in office on the transfer day will continue in office until death or resignation, unless they are disqualified under Section 7 for <Col N="815" /> failure to attend meetings.  Periodic appointments of members by the Dublin Health Authority and any appropriate teaching body will still take place after the transfer.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for the making of any necessary amendments in the Acts and Instruments of Foundation of the hospitals and Section 23 for altering, with the consent of the governing body concerned, the composition of the governing body of a participating hospital (other than the Meath Hospital, which is regulated by the Meath Hospital Act, 1951).  Under Section 24, orders under the Act will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, which will have the usual power of annulment.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides for the confirmation of an agreement a copy of which is contained in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.  This agreement, which was made recently between Trinity College, Dublin, the Royal College of Physicians and Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital, relates to arrangements which exist between the three bodies under the will of Sir Patrick Dun and the provisions of statutes of 1800 and 1867.  The will provided for the vesting of Sir Patrick Dun's estate in the Royal College of Physicians to meet certain payments, including the salaries of four professors of Trinity College known as &ldquo;King's Professors&rdquo; who had the right and duty to teach in Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital.  There are also, at present, arrangements for certain other members of the staff of Trinity College to lecture in Sir Patrick Dun's.</P>
    <P>The agreement now made will put an end to all existing rights and obligations arising from the will of Sir Patrick Dun and the statutes of 1800 and 1867, some of which are inconsistent with the present Bill.  It has been agreed to realise the value of the property and to distribute it equitably amongst the contracting parties.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I would like to say this.  The history of attempts at amalgamation between various Dublin hospitals dates from at least the year 1855.  It has been a most tangled story <Col N="816" /> of difficulties and disappointments.  My own efforts to bring at least one aspect of it to a successful conclusion have been made possible by the zeal, devotion and interest displayed at all times by the representatives of the participating hospitals.  Without the complete co-operation which they have shown, it would not have been possible to proceed with this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am gratified to have reached the present stage in the enactment of this very desirable measure and I confidently recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill will find favour with everybody.  As a Dublinman, I find myself familiar with all these hospitals and I have great sympathy with them in whatever difficulties they may have.  I was never, thanks be to God, a patient of any of them.  They are nearly all on the south side where I was born.  I have been in every single one of them in the capacity of a visitor and once in another capacity altogether.  They have all done, to my knowledge and, indeed, to the knowledge of everybody, very great work for the sick and the poor.  Owing to the situation of some of them, at particular moments of intense troubles, as they have been called, in the city, they were called upon to deal with a few casualties and they did that in a manner with which people were completely satisfied.</P>
      <P>I know and everybody knows that the buildings are manifestly in some cases old and unsuitable.  Some part of the buildings in every case is old and unsuitable.  They are part of the history of Dublin and, indeed, of Ireland. They go back, as the first section of the Bill mentions, to a pre-Union Act of 1729.</P>
      <P>They have now reached the stage when they need, as the Minister says, to be reorganised and, as the phrase goes nowadays, rationalised.  That is very desirable and we are all in favour of it.  We would all join with the Minister in congratulating the people who finally, after considerable difficulty, have got over all the problems that arise in such an amalgamation and reorganisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say this.  I think <Col N="817" /> that such an amalgamation and federation is desirable but for my own part I hope that this federation and amalgamation will not give us one huge hospital; that it will be so worked as to provide that the smaller hospitals will remain each with a character and tradition of its own because each of them has a character and a tradition which are, I think, very desirable.  I think though that I am correct in interpreting the Bill and scheme as being one which will enable each hospital to retain its own character. That would be more desirable than that there should be amalgamation into one huge rather insensitive unit.  I hope that the reorganisation will work out satisfactorily and I join with the Minister in commending the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Senator Hayes has said in welcoming this Bill and to congratulate the Minister on his introductory remarks on it, which have been very full.  He brought the House through it section by section and showed the full implications of the Bill. Senator Hayes said that he has never so far been an inmate of one of these hospitals but I have.  As far back as the year 1937, I found myself a patient in a public ward in Sir Patrick Dun's.  I have had the honour to be on the Board of Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital since 1942 and I cay say that, as a member of the Board, I was greatly helped by having first seen the hospital from the viewpoint of a patient in a bed in a public ward.</P>
      <P>It is a kind of necessary apprenticeship. I can say in all sincerity that what I saw was very good.  I learned I think, a great deal about the working of this type of hospital.  Both the Minister and Senator Hayes have spoken in praise of the work.  It is very difficult, in fact, to exaggerate the amount of work that, as the Minister said, has been done by this type of hospital in Dublin down the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, I have myself been associated with Sir Patrick Dun's as a member of the Board since 1942.  That is nearly 20 years now.  I have seen, therefore, from another angle the way <Col N="818" /> in which the hospital and the medical staff work.  I have seen the way in which the work of the nurses is carried out and supervised and the way in which a number of lay governors have got together and put enormous work into the service which very frequently gets not only no recognition but no thanks at all.</P>
    <P>Personally, I feel that we in this country, whether or not it is a matter for congratulation, are going towards the era of State medical services.  Personally, I think that is a good thing. While saying that, I think one would be lacking in one's duty if one did not recognise the enormous amount of voluntary work done by these voluntary hospitals, by both the staff and the members of the Boards.  I mention no names because it would be invidious&mdash; there are, in fact, very many&mdash;but I can think of several of the senior governors on the Board of Sir Patrick Dun's when I came on as a relatively young man and of their devotion to the hospital. I am conscious of the enormous amount of time they spent doing things for the hospital and, by their active and sympathetic presence, enabling the work to be done in a friendly and humane way without ever getting themselves into the limelight for it but happy in the knowledge that they were achieving most valuable work.  In thinking of those men, I am quite sure they had their counterparts on the Boards of each of the other hospitals which have now agreed, under the provisions of this Bill, to federate.</P>
    <P>I feel that this federation is, as the title of the Bill indicates, avaluable step towards amalgamation and that the time will come when, more and more, the State will find it necessary to assume more and more responsibility in all the services.  I welcome that trend. If we can keep in mind, as the Minister did, the type of work that is being done by voluntary committees I think we will be able, under State medicine, to get the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>I have followed in the background, as a member of the Board of Sir Patrick Dun's, the work carried out for the purpose of reaching the agreement embodied in this Bill.  I realise, and it should be put on record, too, <Col N="819" /> that each hospital, in agreeing to come together with the others, has made a very real sacrifice of sovereignty.  I think that is the phrase one might use. Very big concessions of one kind or another have been made by all of the hospitals in a genuine effort to bring the hospitals closely together in a coordinated first federation and, it is hoped, later amalgamation.</P>
    <P>The process of drafting this Bill, and of reaching this agreement, has been slow.  I am afraid perhaps that the first years under the new Bill may not immediately show a very big dividend in results.  I am quite happy for the movement that will be started under the rights granted by the Bill to be slow provided it is a sure forward march towards more and more coordinated effort on the part of these seven hospitals.</P>
    <P>At this juncture, I think I should say&mdash;because I learned that also, step by step, as we went in the negotiations &mdash;that the Minister deserves the greatest praise for the manner in which he welcomed the suggestions, first of all, and personally intervened for the purpose of smoothing out difficulties which appeared in the path of the negotiators.  I would say he has been more than co-operative.  He has shown an active interest and a most helpful concern&mdash;which we could feel in his speech here today&mdash;to bring this federation into the world of reality. We are grateful to him and to the hospitals concerned for the production of this Bill which is potentially, and I stress the adverb, a very good Bill provided it means a going forward on the basis of its provisions.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes made the point that he would not like to see one gigantic hospital.  I feel he is right in that provided he recognises and we recognise that there is probably an optimum size and that it is possible that some of these hospitals are below that optimum size although it is certain that to go beyond that optimum of perhaps 400 or 500 beds would be a mistake. It may be that under amalgamation one or other of these hospitals will eventually disappear by reason of pressure of these circumstances but <Col N="820" /> Senator Hayes is to be supported in the view that we do not want one gigantic hospital while recognising that the optimum size has not yet been reached by some of the individual hospitals that have agreed to come together in this new federation.</P>
    <P>The work, then, of these hospitals will be carried out under the terms of this Bill&mdash;with permission granted, as it were, by this Bill&mdash;in a far better coordinated manner and the hospitals themselves, as a result, will be better equipped both for the treatment of illness and for the teaching of medical students.  Both of those are extremely important and the co-ordination implicit in this Bill will serve both of those ends admirably.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents, therefore, an effort at rationalisation of the treatment and teaching in these hospitals and also rationalisation of the whole area of specialist treatment in the hospitals. Part of the aim is to enable certain hospitals to specialise perhaps solely in certain aspects of disease and not to have that special service duplicated where duplication is not useful.  Therefore, there will also be on the part of the new council, an effort at rationalising the specialist services and that, too, is a matter to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents an attempt to rationalise all the problems of staffing, equipping and administering these seven Dublin hospitals which have agreed to come together under this new federation and to go forward to what will be the new amalgamation.  In welcoming the Bill, one should stress, as has already been done, the long and honourable record of service of each of these hospitals to Dublin's sick and poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which will find a great deal of favour with all sides of the House.  It should get as speedy a passage as possible.  The Bill represents agreement between the seven hospitals involved.  I join in the tributes which have been paid to the hospitals for surrendering their autonomy.  I rather think it must have caused quite an amount of heart-searching by the people who had built up and fostered these institutions over the years to <Col N="821" /> surrender their autonomy, to federate and ultimately to amalgamate and lose their identity in the interests of the poor and the sick people of this city. The Governors of these hospitals at the present time are deserving of the fullest commendation.</P>
      <P>The speech which has been made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington was a very pleasant revelation.  It disclosed, in spite of all the diehard socialist views that have been expressed by the Senator from time to time and the hopes he harbours that, more and more, State medicine will come to the fore, that he has all the time been working&mdash;I am certain he has worked as hard on the hospital board as he works in this House; I am certain he has worked very hard, indeed&mdash;as a member of a voluntary health institution. That is one of the gratifying things that this Bill has produced for me, personally.  From now on, we must all take a much kinder view of the ideas and opinions which Senator Sheehy Skeffington expresses.  I realise that behind the mask which he puts on there beats a very warm heart that has a tremendous interest in voluntary effort.  He even spoke of having the best of both worlds as a result of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that those who planned this Bill do not intend that it should ultimately lead to a situation in which the amalgamated hospitals would become State institutions.  I expect and I hope that the purpose of this Bill will be that these private institutions will amalgamate into a larger unit which will be able to survive on its own and give greater service to the sick of this city.  It has been interesting to find that the Minister for Health has been the balm poured out where difficulties arose between the various parties to this agreement.  The Minister has been the coagulating force which brought those hospitals together and has been instrumental in bringing about this agreement.  We all hope that this kind of disposition in the Minister will manifest itself in other directions and that before he leaves office&mdash;I expect he is holding office for the last time&mdash;he will have made it up with another great institution which <Col N="822" /> renders help to the sick people of this city and the country generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the purpose of this Bill was to reorganise the activities of these hospitals.  Without awaiting the date on which these institutions will be amalgamated, I hope that the hospitals will attend to one or two small matters which could, in my opinion, do much to make the burden of sickness a good deal lighter, without in any way imposing any great hardship or financial burden on the hospitals themselves.  Like Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I was a patient for many weeks in one of these voluntary hospitals on one occasion.  That was back in the 1940's.  I am well aware of the kindness which I experienced at the hands of the authorities and the nursing staff in those days.</P>
    <P>I am sure that that great tradition of nursing staffs in the various hospitals still persists, but on many occasions I have observed that the arrangements in out-patients' departments are not at all satisfactory.  As I understand the position, most people are told to attend at 10 o'clock in the morning and it is virtually certain that quite a large number of the people who attend at ten o'clock cannot be reached before 12 o'clock, 12.30 or 1 o'clock.  That is a matter of organisation and it seems to me to be an unnecessary burden on people who are not in good health that they should have to wait around in the out-patients' department for unnecessarily long periods when it is certain they cannot be attended to for quite a long while.</P>
    <P>Pending amalgamation and federation, I think hospitals of this kind, and indeed also hospitals which are not covered by this Bill, should give attention to this aspect so that people attending the out-patients' departments will not have to spend unnecessarily prolonged periods awaiting attention.</P>
    <P>I have a recollection also of visiting some of these places and I regret to say, and I am sure it is due to lack of finance, that the places in which people have to wait are far from comfortable and far from being the kind of places where we would like our sick relatives to wait.  I would urge these hospitals <Col N="823" /> and other hospitals that anything that can be done to improve the heating and other amenities of the out-patients' department should be done.</P>
    <P>I noted with particular pleasure that the provisions with regard to compensation of staff whose contracts of service may be disturbed as a result of this amalgamation are fairly adequate and fairly foolproof but subject to those conditions, I notice that it is not indicated whether the appeal to the officer to be designated by the Minister may be an oral appeal or a paper appeal.  If the appeal is to be an oral appeal, I do not think we should trouble about it. I am quite satisfied that appeals to the Minister, or to persons designated by the Minister, which are dealt with on paper, as is done in the case of appeals under the Social Welfare Act, are worthless and do not achieve justice or fair play for either side, but particularly for the appellants.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would like the Minister to indicate that it is the intention that appeals under paragraph 6 of the Second Schedule will involve a full hearing before an arbitrator.  If that is not to be the position, I think we shall have to provide the same conditions for these people as have been provided for the staffs of other bodies which have been interfered with by enactments of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is just one further matter which occurs to me, a matter which the Minister may be able to clarify. As I understand the position, these seven hospitals will federate and eventually amalgamate and lose their identities.  This position will then arise.  It has a relation to the Charities Bill passed by this House recently.  If a bequest is made in a will drafted, say, in 1957, to&mdash;take the first hospital in the list&mdash;the Adelaide Hospital, and the person does not die until 1975 when the Adelaide Hospital has ceased to exist as an entity, is there any provision whereby bequests of that kind will be paid to the amalgamated body or will the bequest lapse?</P>
    <P>The point I want to stress is that <Col N="824" /> if these institutions which are so well known to so many people and which are the object of people's benevolence and charity are to cease to exist, we should make some provision as to what will happen various bequests to be made in the future.  I do not want to have the position where more money will have to be spent in making unnecessary applications to the commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests or to the courts to consider such bequests and to decide whether they should be administered <i>cy-près</i> or what should be done with them.</P>
    <P>There may be some provision in the Bill in that regard which I have not seen but otherwise it seems to me to be appropriate at this stage to make provision for this kind of contingency because there is a certainty that many people will not know of the amalgamation of these institutions as long as they exist in physical form in various places in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We have had strange experiences in recent times in regard to drafting legislation and in view of our recent sad experience in regard to some legislation, I do not think this is a Bill which should be passed through all Stages without a minute examination on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>The favourable reception that has been given to this Bill in this and in the other House will, I think, be reassuring to many.  It is a regrettable fact, but, I think, true, that there are still some members of the minority who are rather reluctant to face legislation in our Parliament.  I have always done what I can to reassure them that was quite unfounded but a certain reluctance or apprehension has prevailed recently. At least what we have heard today and what we read in the debate in the other House can reassure them that wherever citizens are attempting to improve the efficiency of public bodies in this country, they will get the fullest support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty that faced these bodies was, of course, the main difficulty of amalgamation or, in this case federation. <Col N="825" /> Some of us have seen the same type of thing in the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.  At first, there was an idealistic view that a United Nations of Europe would come very quickly but it soon became apparent that it would come only when the constituent nations were prepared to yield some of their sovereignty, some of their power. In other words, one cannot build up a strong and effective federation without giving something away.</P>
    <P>These hospitals, with admirable public spirit, have agreed to give away some of their power for the sake of the higher good.  One can only hope that this spirit of sharing will go further. One hopes particularly that in the teaching departments these hospitals will move towards more and more cooperation. There is every sign that will be so.  I think we should commend it.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which I think should be said.  Both the Minister and Senator Hayes paid generous tribute to the work done by these voluntary hospitals in the past.  Generally nowadays in this country, we hear a good deal of adverse criticism of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy and of past history. Some of that is certainly desirable but I think it is only fair to remember in this House and outside some of the works of lasting benefit for the whole of Ireland for all classes and creeds which that ascendancy produced. Some of the names mentioned in this Bill remind us of it&mdash;Dr. Richard Stephens of Steevens' Hospital; Miss Mary Mercer of Mercer's Hospital and one recalls that the Dean of St. Patrick's&mdash;Jonathan Swift&mdash;in his day founded Swift's Hospital.  The best known, perhaps, to the citizens of Dublin is Bartholomew Mosse who founded the Rotunda Hospital over 200 years ago for the sick and poor of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I think we should keep these things in mind.  We can hardly avoid it.  In fact, if we go to Cork, Limerick or any of the other big cities in Ireland, we can see some of the old buildings constructed and financed by members of the old Anglo-Irish ascendancy, and not only hospitals and charitable <Col N="826" /> institutions but public buildings and organisations.  We speak at the moment in Leinster House built by the Duke of Leinster and then taken over by one of these organisations founded by that ascendancy, the Royal Dublin Society.  For many years, this was its home and now we have taken it as our home.</P>
    <P>This in a sense is not strictly relevant to the hospitals but these names in the Bill give an opportunity of looking at the brighter side of our history to some extent and of recognising&mdash;it is quite clear the House recognises and the country as a whole recognises&mdash; that that often-maligned epoch in our national history had a good side to it. It is good to see the successors of these generous men who founded these hospitals now ready to re-unite for the sake of the common good.</P>
    <P>I have nothing to say by way of criticism or emendation of the Bill.  It seems to be admirably drafted.  I should like to say something in addition to the tributes paid to the Minister already.  We do know of his considerateness and constant helpfulness in preparing the way for this Bill. I can assure him that many people are grateful to him for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill with perhaps a greater personal interest than I think any other Senator.  I have been a patient in one of these hospitals. Members of my family have been patients I think in many of them. I was a medical student in one of these hospitals.  I am a member of the staff now on all of them, except one, and I am a Governor of two of them.  Therefore I have had a very close interest in the development of this federation from the first time it was mooted.  I <Col N="828" /> was interested very closely indeed in the previous Bill for setting up Saint Luke's Hospital and was very disappointed when that never reached the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>The primary intention of this federation, as the Minister said, is to improve the facilities available for the treatment of the sick, of the patients who are there either in beds or attending as out-patients.  This improvement, we hope, will be brought about by the proper and orderly arrangement of specialist activities in these hospitals, the sharing of them and, more important still, of the specialist personnel, the training of these personnel and, in all matters like that, the improvement, as far as possible, of the clinical facilities of these institutions.  That is an object which quite clearly appeals to everyone.  We all understand it.</P>
      <P>There is another objective which had not been mentioned.  It has been mentioned here this afternoon but it had not been discussed so freely when this federation question had been considered.  I refer to the improvement of teaching.  All of these hospitals are teaching hospitals.  Almost 100 per cent. of the students attending these hospitals are from two of the three medical schools in Dublin.  I am a member of the staff of one of these schools and I represent that University in this House.  It is as Dean of that school that I should now like to discuss this measure somewhat further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some misgiving and some likelihood of misunderstanding on the part of the general public as to the business of teaching in the hospital. Many people are suspicious of being used as guinea pigs when they go into a general hospital.  They would rather, if they could afford it, go into some hospital where students were not liable to come along and examine them or where they would not be demonstrated to the students by members of the staff and their illness explained, perhaps sometimes to their embarrassment.  It should be understood that while a teaching hospital does perhaps sometimes submit a patient to situations which the patient might regard with some misgiving &mdash; usually before, <Col N="829" /> though not after, the event&mdash;it is almost certain that the general standard of clinical care in a teaching hospital will be somewhat higher than in a hospital which is not a teaching hospital. That arises from several different reasons.</P>
    <P>The staff have to face inquiring students.  They have to answer the most awkward questions by these students and by the younger members of the staff.  That imposes the duty on the staff always to keep closely in touch with the most recent developments, to make quite sure that nothing has passed their attention, if possible, and to translate the most recent improvements into the day-to-day work of the hospitals.  It imposes the duty on the staff to give the patients the full benefit of anything that is reasonable in recent advances.</P>
    <P>In a medical school you have, in addition to that, a number of teachers in the laboratory and the medical school departments whose opinions, whose know-how, whose reading are freely available to the staffs of the teaching hospitals.  There is constant consultation between the medical school staffs and the clinical staffs and this is greatly to the improvement of the outlook of both sides, particularly to the outlook of the clinical staff.</P>
    <P>Lastly, and by no means to be forgotten, the students and the more recently qualified doctors act as a very valuable pool of semi-skilled or recently skilled labour in these hospitals. In connection with the Commission on Higher Education, which is investigating matters like this, I had to make a calculation of the number of junior posts in hospitals in this country which are filled by recently qualified students.  There must be between 200 and 300 of these posts&mdash;I reckon about 250.  These students are not yet registered.  They cannot go out to practise in public.  They have to get this hospital experience.  The hospitals employ them.  They pay them very well for this grade of labour but not nearly as much as they would have to pay them if they were fully qualified doctors whom they would hire in the open market.  There is a considerable <Col N="830" /> saving in the hospital economy due to this fact.</P>
    <P>For these various reasons, the importance of these teaching hospitals in Dublin and in the country as a whole &mdash;because our graduates go all over the country&mdash;has to be rated very high. A great deal of the reputation Dublin has had for the past 150 years or so in medical centres has come directly from the progress made in medicine in these teaching hospitals, that is, in the Dublin teaching hospitals.</P>
    <P>The contribution made by the seven hospitals we are now proposing to federate has been considerable.  Several other hospitals are outside this federated scheme which have made valuable contributions also but, of the total, I think these seven have made quite a considerable percentage of the full contribution, and that extends over about 150 years.</P>
    <P>This reputation which these hospitals had, which was so widespread, so notable, say, at the end of last century, has in recent times steadily declined by comparison with the progress being made in other centres.  This is due to the fact that less money is available in this country for hospital development. Less money is being spent, shall we say, on the development of these teaching hospitals than is being spent in other centres on the development of corresponding institutions.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Hayes mentioned that many of the buildings are old. They are all the original buildings, to which some new buildings have been added.  A great deal of the work at present being done in these hospitals is being done in buildings put up perhaps 200 years ago.  The equipment is not as plentiful as in similar institutions in other centres.  All these handicaps add up to a disadvantage, a very important disadvantage, from which the Dublin hospitals suffer in comparison with those in other centres.  I agree that the present federation will give an opportunity to the seven hospitals concerned to try to straighten out some of these disadvantages, particularly in regard to equipment.</P>
    <P>There is a second factor which must be remembered, that is, that in other <Col N="831" /> teaching centres there is a very close link between the hospitals and the medical schools.  This has never existed in Dublin.  One of these hospitals was originally built as a medical school for Trinity College.  The personal link between the two is that the Provost of Trinity College is an <i>ex officio</i> member of Sir Patrick Dun's.  That is the only formal link between them.  It is not a very strong one because one person cannot make a great deal of difference, particularly when he is a very busy person like the head of a university, so that it has happened that whether or not the medical school might have wished to improve facilities in these hospitals for the purpose of teaching students, there is no way in which the school could go to the hospital and say: &ldquo;We want better laboratories and we are prepared to help,&rdquo; because they have no ownership and short of giving money away to these institutions, they could not take any active step.</P>
    <P>Before I go any further, there is another point.  This dichotomy in the educational situation has also been evidenced in the appointment of staff, medical staff, clinical staff and surgical staff.  If you want to run any teaching institution on a proper level these days, you must be able to advertise and get the best man for the job and make it apparent that the best man is going to get the job.  If you are appointing a clinician, the person appointed must have authority and the clinical care of a certain number of beds in the Hospital where he is teaching students.  That is an absolute <i>sine qua non.</i></P>
    <P>In Dublin, the practice has always been that the schools have to appoint people to their staff who have already got beds in one of these hospitals.  That restricts their choice.  There is no complaint being made now about the qualities of the people who hold these positions.  We have been very fortunate in the past in that we have had an excellent group to choose from, but it would be better if when a vacancy occurs, the position can be advertised in the knowledge that no matter who applies, if he is the best man, whether from this country or not, when he <Col N="832" /> comes to take up his teaching position, he will have the right to have clinical facilities in one of these hospitals.  I mention these points because they are at the root of the difficulties in running these hospitals at the moment as teaching hospitals.  If we cannot get over these difficulties from the teaching point of view, the standard of these hospitals will be very much lower than it would otherwise be.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes a certain amount of provision for improving the principle of these matters, namely, the link between the school and the hospital.  The federated hospital will have two representatives on its Central Council from any medical school which gets agreement with it in regard to the education of its students.  There is no doubt that the medical school of Trinity College will want to make an agreement about the education of students from the university.  We hope, therefore, that when this agreement is made, we will have the right to have two representatives on the Central Council of this federated hospital, two representatives in a total Council of 40.  Personally, I would have preferred, and my medical school would have preferred, if this proportion were higher, but at any rate it is a great improvement on the present situation.</P>
    <P>A number of practical considerations still remain.  The medical schools will still have to send their students to these hospitals in their present buildings.  No amount of adjustment and no amount of money which could justifiably be spent on these buildings can ever make them modern institutions.  They will always be at a disadvantage as long as they are in this state.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister that as soon as possible after the federation scheme has become law, we should have a move to produce new buildings for this group of hospitals.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with Senator Hayes that a single hospital of 1,200 beds for this group would not only be unwise but would be unwelcome.  On the other hand, when he mentioned that it would be nice if these hospitals continued more or less as they are, I do not think he meant to be taken <Col N="833" /> literally.  While he felt that some degree of identity should be preserved, I am sure he did not want these hospitals to remain in their relatively isolated and ineffective state.  One of these hospitals has 120 beds; another has 100; and the biggest has 250 beds.  No single one of these units is economic.  It is nice if you are in a small hospital to know the name and family connections of nearly every one of your patients and it makes for a helpful, intimate atmosphere, but it is not in the best interests of efficiency, either in administration or in medical treatment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we hope that some degree of amalgamation will be encouraged by the provision at an early date of one or two buildings for a small number of these hospitals, in a convenient place where the population still has to be served.  It must not be forgotten that the primary purpose of hospitals is to serve a local population.  With the transport facilities of the present day, patients can be taken from any part of the country to another in a very short time.  As far as the bed patients in a hospital are concerned, they can come from almost anywhere, even in a state of serious illness.  Therefore, the real urgency of siting a hospital is in relation to its outpatient activities where you have people in an overcrowded area.  These people have probably no means of transport but they ought to be able to get to the hospital conveniently in the case of serious illness.</P>
    <P>All these hospitals are situated strategically from that point of view.  It does not need any great knowledge of Dublin to pick out the places where you have concentrations of poor people who need that kind of attention urgently and who want outpatient facilities.  One could imagine a much smaller number than the present seven hospitals placed amongst this population so that the tradition of service could be preserved. I am sure that what Senator Hayes is thinking about is the preservation of that local service and of having easy access by the poor people to these institutions.</P>
    <P>I am speaking for my colleagues on the lay boards and on the medical boards when I say that we have all <Col N="834" /> been impressed by the helpfulness and consideration given to this measure by the Minister and by the officials in his Department.  I have sat at the table in his Department working out the provisions of this Bill and I have experienced an atmosphere without which this matter would never have reached its present stage.  I should like on behalf of all of us in these hospitals to say that and have it put on record.</P>
    <P>I am not going to say anything now that would be likely to interfere with or delay the passage of this measure. I feel bound to express personally, on behalf of my own school and on behalf of the Royal College of Physicians, some disappointment that there is not a better representation of these schools on the Central Council.  The schools have been interested in this measure from the very beginning.  The Minister mentioned the delicacies of the situation in the Dáil.  It has been continuously before the minds of all of us. It came to his notice because of the extremely delicate character of the negotiations from time to time but the Minister cannot know more than a small fraction of the difficulties we ran into.  The schools&mdash;and certainly my school&mdash;although deeply interested in this measure refrained from pressing this in case the additional complications would endanger the whole issue.</P>
    <P>That did not mean that we were not interested.  Unless the federated hospital can serve the schools properly, it will be stultified in its development and the schools can hardly continue to exist and you may easily be in the position of having a fairly good teaching hospital and no students to teach.  I think that is a very serious situation for us to contemplate.  It is not at all impossible. Some ten years ago, we had a series of visits from America and England.  Our schools were reviewed and were rejected or given a very qualified approval.  This situation cannot persist and if it is allowed to go on much longer it will have a disastrous effect.  The principal difficulty lies with the clinical teaching.  As far as we can control our affairs in our medical schools, we do the best we can.  We have never been really seriously criticised. We have been seriously criticised <Col N="835" /> on many occasions for the untidiness and lack of control in our clinical affairs.  We must have that put right or we cannot persist in our teaching programme.  I very warmly approve of this measure and I thank the Minister for all his trouble.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank very sincerely the Senators who referred to the small part which I have played in producing this measure. I said in opening that this Bill could not have been before the Oireachtas, had it not been for the spirit of co-operation and self-sacrifice in many cases of the members of the hospital boards and, perhaps, particularly the visiting medical staff.  In trying to smooth out these differences and to evolve a workable scheme, I did not do anything more than my duty which I first addressed myself to many years ago when I was Minister for Local Government and Public Health. I then sponsored before the Cabinet a proposal for the establishment of St. Luke's Hospital.  Unfortunately, that first endeavour was abortive.  Due to the dissolution of Dáil Éireann, the project of the new hospital fell by the wayside.  It is, therefore, a source of particular gratification to me to find myself in charge of a proposal which will in due course reach the Statute Book and which I hope will fulfil all the hopes that have been reposed in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is very much I have to say because criticism has been light.  The measure is an agreed measure.  The text of it has been before the representatives of the hospitals concerned.  It has been approved by them and it would be very difficult for us to amend it in substance.  Indeed, I would suggest to the Seanad that it would be very unwise and, perhaps, presumptuous for us to endeavour to do so.  Many hospitals, by sacrificing a substantial part of their autonomy, have contributed to make the measure possible and any amendment in principle which the Seanad might consider desirable would have to be made in agreement with these hospitals.  I think it might, perhaps, have the <Col N="836" /> effect of throwing the whole thing back into the melting pot.  I suggest that is a result we could not contemplate with any equanimity.</P>
    <P>Senator Jessop made the one substantial point in this debate.  He expressed some disappointment about the representation which had been accorded to the medical schools.  Again, such representation was settled by agreement.  It was necessary that the medical schools should be content with the representation which is to be given to them on the Central Council in order that this measure might see the light of day.  I do not think that the Senator need be too despondent.  After all, sub-section (12) of Section 7 does provide that by agreement with all the hospitals on the Central Council, the Minister may make an order revising, perhaps, always upwards, the representation which is to be accorded to any particular interest, so that the battle is not over.  It can be fought out, I think, if necessary, in the proper place, that is, on the Central Council.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes and some other Senators hoped that the passage of this Bill would not lead to the establishment of one huge institution.  What the view of these seven hospitals may be, whether they are going to be amalgamated in one large institution or into a number of other institutions of more moderate size, is a matter for the Central Council.  The future of the component parts, so to speak, of this new federation is in the hands of the federation itself.  How they will develop the various specialties, how they will provide for accommodation, is a matter now for themselves.  They are in that respect, I think, completely autonomous.  I am sure&mdash;speaking for myself, and I think I may speak for my successors&mdash;there is not any of them who would not deprecate the establishment of one very large hospital.</P>
    <P>Most of us feel that, while we must have institutions which are economic to operate and maintain, nevertheless we might pay too dearly for such economies as might be anticipated if, by making the institution large, patients would become merely statistical <Col N="837" /> units within the building and the sort of humane contact between doctor and patient and all those attending to his physical and medical care would become so tenuous as to render him no more than a cipher in a very large system.  I think, therefore, that, having regard to the general tradition of the hospital services in Dublin, we need not anticipate that this Bill will result in the formation of one large institution which will swallow up all the existing seven separate hospitals.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is very much more to be said than that.  I would ask the Seanad, if necessary, to give me the remaining Stages of the Bill today except that a small matter has been brought to my notice which we will, perhaps, have to check up with the Central Council.  Accordingly, on this occasion, I shall have to accede to the viewpoint of Senator O'Quigley&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Some eleven years ago this House had before it a Bill to replace the legislation which at that time existed for the training and registration of nurses and midwives.  This Bill became law as the Nurses Act, 1950.  Under this measure a new body, An Bord Altranais, was set up in June, 1951, to deal with the training and registration of nurses and midwives.  The purpose of the present Bill is to make certain changes in its provisions which experience has indicated are desirable.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill will clear up a doubt as to the law governing the election of nurses to membership of An Bord Altranais.  Under the 1950 Act, ten persons are elected for a five-year term of office to be members of An Bord.  The Act provides that some of those to be elected must be persons with midwifery qualifications, some mental nurses and other nurses with general qualifications.  The procedure for election is governed by rules made by An Bord Altranais with the consent of the Minister for Health.  The rules thus made&mdash;the Nurses Rules, 1953&mdash; provide that the total electorate of nurses will be divided so that those on the general part of the Register will elect the general nurses, those qualified as midwives will elect the midwife members, and those whose names are on the Mental Nurses Division will elect the mental nurses to An Bord. This arrangement seems to have been entirely acceptable to the nursing profession and, for myself, I cannot see any ground for objecting to it.  However, doubts have arisen as to whether there was, in fact, power in the original Act to divide the electorate in this fashion.  The purpose of Section 2 of the Bill is to put it beyond doubt that there was such a power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> Section 3 will make good an oversight in the drafting of the 1950 Act by providing that members of An Bord may be paid travelling and subsistence expenses when they travel on An Bord's business, as for example, in the visitation of hospitals.</P>
    <P>The present arrangements for financing An Bord have for some time been regarded as unsatisfactory by the Minister for Finance and by myself.  Under Section 59 of the 1950 Act there is an obligation on the Minister for Health to meet whatever deficit is incurred in any year by An Bord.  Subsequently, one half of this deficit is recovered by the Minister from local health authorities.  It is mandatory on the Minister to meet the deficit&mdash;whatever it may amount to&mdash;and he cannot curtail the amount which he will recoup in respect of any year.  He has certain powers to control the expenditure of An Bord&mdash; its annual Estimates are subject to his approval, as are the amounts of salaries paid to the staff and fees paid to examiners&mdash;but he has no corresponding powers to ensure that the revenue raised by An Bord will meet any set proportion of their costs.</P>
    <P>There is a further disadvantage&mdash; this time from An Bord's point of view&mdash;in the present procedure in that it receives no grant for any year until the accounts for that year have been audited.  An Bord, therefore, must continuously await payment of the deficit for each preceding year and is thus compelled to work for a considerable part of the time on overdraft, a rather expensive procedure, as most Senators will recognise.</P>
    <P>The new procedure under Section 4 of the Bill, which will replace Section 59 of the 1950 Act, is that the Minister, while still being obliged to pay grants to An Bord, will, in consultation with An Bord and the Minister for Finance, determine in advance what the grant for any year will be and will not be governed, as at present, by a requirement to meet, <i>post factum,</i> the deficit for each year. This provision will be more in consonance with the Minister's responsibilities to the Oireachtas for public moneys than the present system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> Section 5 is a corollary to the new provision for the payment of grants and will require An Bord to fix the amount of fees payable to them so that it will collect each year sufficient money to meet the part of its expenditure which the grant does not defray. The changes to be made under Sections 4 and 5, I would like to emphasise, are not designed to save money for the Exchequer but to establish a more satisfactory principle and procedure in the financing of An Bord.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will repair an omission in the 1950 Act by giving the Minister a statutory power to require An Bord to give him information.  The provision will put the law in this respect in relation to this board into line with the general position of other statutory bodies in this regard.</P>
    <P>At present, under Section 16 of the 1950 Act, the members of An Bord Altranais each year elect one of themselves to act as President for the ensuing year.  Section 7 of the Bill proposes that future Presidents will be appointed by the Minister from the members of An Bord and that their term of office will be five years, which is the term of office of the members of An Bord.  There are, to my mind, sound reasons for these proposals.</P>
    <P>An Bord Altranais is set up under statute, in legislation sponsored by the Minister for Health; the rules which it makes are subject to his approval; and his consent is required to a variety of its activities.  In addition, he supplies it with substantial funds annually and will continue to do so.  In fact it is clear from the provisions of the 1950 Act taken as a whole that in relation to all its functions An Bord acts as the instrument or agent of the Minister for Health, who if he sees fit to do so may appoint another body or even a person to act in its stead.  It is essential, therefore, that harmony and understanding should exist between the body and the Minister and that it should readily co-operate with him in the fulfilment of his statutory obligations under the Act. One of the qualifications which the <Col N="841" /> President of any statutory board must possess is ability to establish such relations with the responsible Minister so that through him an effective and cordial liaison may be maintained between the Minister and the board.  A wide experience indicates that this position is most likely to be attained when the President of the body holds his appointment directly from the Minister to whom he is responsible.</P>
    <P>In so far as the term of office is concerned, it appears to me that the balance of advantage is heavily in favour of the President's period of office being co-incident with the life of a particular board.  Over a five-year period, a President will have time to initiate projects and bring them to fruition in a way which would not be possible for a President whose term of office lasted for only a year.</P>
    <P>Section 8 and the repeal Schedule are consequential on earlier provisions of the Bill and also make a minor change by absolving An Bord from an existing obligation to provide midwives with special badges, while continuing An Bord's power to issue such badges as they consider necessary for midwives and other different categories of nurses.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>This is not a Bill which in any sense can be welcomed by anybody, because it is a niggling, miserable Bill that proceeds from a smallmindedness which is unworthy of a Minister of State, particularly a person who is also An Tánaiste.  The main purpose of this Bill is to pass Section 7 and I shall come back to that later.  That is the section which deals with the appointment of the President of the Board.  The real reason for this Bill is that the Minister wants to have as President of the Board somebody who will do his bidding.  That is the effect of what the Minister said.  If this Bill were one to deal with the remuneration of nurses, or affecting the status and conditions of nurses, it would be a worthwhile activity on the part of the Minister and the Oireachtas. There is no section of the community who are as badly paid, or who have <Col N="842" /> worse working conditions than nurses. I have known nurses to work 12 hours on night work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on the Second Stage.  This is a Bill which deals with nurses and one thing which is of immediate concern to nurses is their remuneration.  All I can say is that the conditions in which nurses work are, in my opinion, an outrage. Although they have a very efficient nurses' organisation they have been unable to make headway against officialdom.  As I stated, I have known nurses to work for 12 hours on night work for six nights of the week for six months, even in hospitals under the control of the Minister for Health, public institutions.  Indeed I have known them to do such work for a longer period than six months.</P>
      <P>That is the kind of thing the Minister would be better employed attending to than coming here and talking about the substantial sums of money which he pays over to this board.  I hope other members of the House will rise to give expression to what the Minister should be doing in relation to nurses covered by this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is nothing else much to be said about this Bill except in relation to Section 7.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to explain Section 2.  I want to call the attention of the House particularly to the fact that it is one of these deeming sections. The Minister says there was a doubt about the interpretation of the rules. It is heart-warming to see that the Minister is concerned to ensure that rules made under a statute passed by Parliament conform with the statute and are not <i>ultra vires</i> the statute. That is the kind of thing he ought to talk to the Minister for Local Government about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health is to be commended for seeing that subsidiary legislation is undoubtedly <i>intra vires</i> a particular Act.  The Minister deserves congratulation on that.  I trust that the Minister for Local <Col N="844" /> Government will, as he mellows, develop the same approach towards constitutionality and the doctrine of <i>ultra vires</i> as has the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>This Bill concerns, indeed, the amount of money which nurses will be able to put in the bank at the end of the year.  Neither the Minister for Health nor the Minister for Finance is satisfied with the present financial arrangements for meeting the excess of expenditure over income of An Bord Altranais.  Now when the Minister for Health is candid enough to admit that neither he nor the Minister for Finance is satisfied about the financial arrangements, one can be certain that what is troubling the Minister is that he does not want to pay as much money to An Bord Altranais as he has been paying up to the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the new arrangements and when in that context he tells us that substantial sums are paid to An Bord Altranais, one would be inclined to think in terms of tens of thousands but we find in the Book of Estimates for this year that the grant to An Bord Altranais under Section 59 is the handsome sum of £2,300.  Last year, it was £1,950.  Presumably, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance are going to save money out of the £2,300.  The money that will be saved will be found by increasing the fees to be paid by nurses who have to be registered with An Bord Altranais.  I think it is a regrettable move on the part of the Minister for Health that when he is taking more power to himself under this Bill, he is not prepared to spend at least the same amount of money, much less a smaller sum, in helping An Bord Altranais to function properly.</P>
    <P>I am in no way convinced that the arrangements which existed up to the present time whereby An Bord Altranais had to get an overdraft in the bank, pending a grant by the Minister, could not be amended.  There would be no difficulty whatever, if the Minister consulted with his advisers, in making an advance estimated upon the deficiency in a previous year. <Col N="845" /> If the advance was less than the audited deficiency turned out to be, adjustments could be made.  That would not require any great thought on the part of the Minister and his advisers.  It would obviate the necessity for having Section 4 and Section 5 in this Bill.  It would also avoid increasing the registration fees of the nurses who are already, in my opinion, underpaid.</P>
    <P>The main section of this Bill is Section 7.  The Minister says it is necessary, in order to have harmony and co-operation, that the person who is President of An Bord Altranais should be appointed by the Minister and should, in fact, be&mdash;that is what the Minister says, in effect&mdash;a mental satellite of the Minister.  The Minister has many powers over the Board.  He can require them to do this and that.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has a great many powers over local authorities.  There is hardly an item of expenditure that county councils incur for which they do not have to seek the sanction of the Minister for Local Government.  There is hardly a scheme of any dimensions they can undertake for which they do not have to get the sanction of the Minister for Local Government.  In fact, the great delays in regard to the administration of local authorities is due to the fact that so many sanctions have to be got from the Department and so many inspections have to be carried out and so on.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister can suspend the local authority in certain circumstances, the Minister has nothing whatever to do with the appointing of the chairman of the local authority.  Indeed, if he had, some of them might not be there as long as they are.  The Minister has all these great powers over local authorities.  Still, it is the authority itself and the persons themselves who are to work with the chairman who select the chairman.  The Minister for Health has not considered that the effective functioning of An Bord Altranais also depends upon co-operation between the chairman and the members of the Board.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the person <Col N="846" /> selected by the Minister will be a person whom a majority of the people on the Board will not want.  Of course, that has not occurred to the Minister for Health.  All he is concerned with is power to put somebody in who will be a mental satellite of his.  The Minister for Health has not indicated in any way how it is a bad thing that the members of a body such as this should be entitled to elect their own chairman.</P>
    <P>We have seen a number of Bills passed here relating to An Bord Bainne and other organisations of that kind.  I had detected, I thought, a new spirit in forming the constitution of these boards; that the members comprising the boards were being elected by representative interests and that thereafter the chairman would be elected by those people who had been elected by the representative interests. The purpose of this Bill is the unworthy purpose of conducting a dispute between the Minister and another organisation to which a former president of An Bord Altranais belonged.  I do not commend legislation of this kind and I do not commend the Minister for wasting the time of the Oireachtas in conducting a feud of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that these necessary changes in the construction and arrangement of An Bord Altranais should be supported in this House.  I am sorry that Senator O'Quigley sees fit to bring in extraneous matter.  On the previous Bill, which was passed with much patting of people on the back, it was suggested that the Minister had had a wonderful change of heart and that he would be very wise in helping these hospitals to federate. Even the smallest child can learn that in any discussion it takes two sets of sensible people to come to a sensible arrangement.  I think this is one of the extraneous matters that have been dragged into this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I have a special privilege in that I am a member of the nursing profession still on the register and entitled to vote in these matters.  I do not pretend to know of any <Col N="847" /> internal discussions or disputes that may have been going on but I am prepared to accept the idea that improvements can and should be made.  Therefore I recommend and am glad the Minister has seen the necessity for making these changes.  Mention was made of terrible wrongs which I consider very exaggerated.  The whole case was over-simplified by Senator O'Quigley.  The exaggeration is so extreme as to make it seem ridiculous. In the first place, there is a nurses' organisation and in the second place there is this power dealing with these matters.  If there is nothing else that calls for change in this organisation I think the exaggerated claims of Senator O'Quigley are indicative of the necessity for change.  I do not want to drag in extraneous matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JaneDowdall" hpid="Mrs. Dowdall Mrs. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to differ with Senator O'Quigley.  I claim he is exaggerating in what he says about the nursing profession in Ireland.  As a Governor of two hospitals I know that if the conditions are as bad as stated by the Senator it is an extraordinary thing that for any vacancies for probationers or staff we invariably have applications from four times the number of people we need.  People who have, like myself, worked on voluntary hospitals as committee members over the years have not, I think, completely wasted our time because step by step and in a very high degree at this stage we have worked for and succeeded in improving the lot of nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot contradict Senator O'Quigley or anybody else if he says nurses are working 12 hours a day six days a week for six months and longer in Dublin.  If that is so, it is very wrong.  I would draw the Senator's attention to the fact that many nurses prefer to stay on night duty and that it is not always obligatory on them to do so.  In <Col N="848" /> one hospital of which I am a Governor, when I discovered that some nurses were longer on night duty than I and other people thought was desirable, enquiries were made in the matter.  Two months is I think the longest they should be.  We found that these nurses did not want to leave night duty but we forced them to do so.  Therefore, I do not think it is right to claim that that is the procedure in hospitals all over Ireland.  Such a claim is quite wrong.</P>
    <P>The conditions of living are also very much improved.  In any of the hospitals, with one exception, that I know, living conditions are as good as the buildings and other conditions will permit.  Every possible thing is being done to improve those conditions. I must say that in the new hospitals being built the nurses are being extremely well treated.  I am a member of that profession and would fight equally hard with anyone else to see that these conditions are improved.  I object to exaggeration and what I consider statements that are not true.</P>
    <P>The increasing of fees to ensure more money for this board, to lessen the amount to be paid perhaps by the Minister, is not, I think, quite fair.  It must be in the Minister's mind, I do not know, but we people of the nursing profession are hoping that our pressure to have nurses promoted to university standard will become a reality in the near future, and, as we all know, fees have to be paid for examinations of that or lesser standard.</P>
    <P>With the improved pay and living conditions that nurses are having, and the hope of creating a university status for them, I hope Senators who have any influence in hospitals where nurses are left too long on night duty, will see that that is remedied.  I repeat sorrowfully that the fact that such exaggerated statements are made is a very serious matter.  I hope this measure will go through.  I feel there must be something in the Minister's mind about improving the working of that organisation so that in time the nurses' conditions, and the improvements Senators wish for nurses, and <Col N="849" /> which we all wish for them, will develop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mrs. Dowdall refers to improved pay and conditions.  As far as I know, there is at the moment confusion between nurses and the various bodies for whom they work about conditions and improved pay conditions have not occurred.  As far as I know there has been an offer from the Dublin local authority to the nurses and that offer has been rejected.  Therefore, it is presupposition to say there are improved pay and improved living conditions.</P>
      <P>I know that nurses' living conditions have been pretty bad indeed in a lot of the local authority hospitals throughout the country and, indeed, in the local authority hospitals in County Louth.  I hope they will be improved and I hope their pay conditions will be improved.  I think the nature of their work will demand for them equality with work in any other profession, equal hours, equal duties. In their profession, which really is not a profession but a dedication, they would need to be paid something better than comparable pay in other modes of life and certainly considerably more than they are being paid at the moment.</P>
      <P>When a Board is being set up it has been the practice to leave it to the Board to elect its own president or chairman or, alternatively, to have the Minister of State in charge of that particular Government board appoint the president or the chairman.  There are arguments on both sides for both modes of appointment but there is no argument for changing an existing mode of appointment, that I know of. The Minister has put forward no specific argument for the change. There is a danger the people concerned will think that there is some ulterior motive in the change. Even from the point of view of the Minister and of future Ministers, it would be a mistake to proceed on the basis that the existing method of appointment of chairman or president should be changed.  The Minister should reconsider that matter.</P>

      <P>This is a Nurses Bill. I do not know whether it would help very much to enter into a long discussion about the rates of pay and conditions of service of nurses generally.  I cannot let pass what has been contended by Senator Mrs. Dowdall even though she is a member of the profession, because from what little I know of the conditions of nurses they are not satisfactory.  It is no answer to say that for every vacancy there are four applicants.  The trade unions are there to protect people and not to allow the law of supply and demand to operate in that way.</P>
      <P>It is a fact that many girls are willing to take up what I regard as the vocation of nursing.  They are charged heavy fees for the privilege of taking up that vocation.  From what they tell me in hospitals I have unfortunately had to be in for a little time, the conditions are really intolerable.  The pay, if it can be termed pay, is more of an allowance after paying fees for the privilege of being trained.  There is an organisation, but all I can say at this stage is that the Minister should allow or should encourage the free play of negotiations so that the organisation representing these people will be enabled to act as a proper trade union to improve the lot of these people who are doing a very good job and devoting their lives to what is a real vocation.</P>

      <P>The spirit of this Bill is one that is to be deplored.  It shows that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.  In 1955, there was a determined effort to bring the new Agricultural Institute under State control and to make it a State-controlled body. That provoked a magnificent reaction throughout the country.  After a fight which lasted a few years, it was brought home to those in charge that State control could not go so far; that we had to have regard to the principle of subsidiary function and allow lesser bodies capable of controlling their own interests have their say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the passage of the Agricultural Institute Bill, the main proponents of State control have been gradually recovering.  Now we have two Bills before us, this one, and one <Col N="851" /> which will shortly have its Committee Stage here, the Industrial Research and Standards Bill, under which the Minister is to nominate the entire body, in flat contrast with what we won in the struggle for the Agricultural Institute. This Bill moves in exactly the same way.  There is only one relevant section in this Bill.  It could be boiled down to Section 7 which says that the Minister wants to nominate the chairman of this nurses board.  A whole amending Bill has been brought in to achieve that.</P>
    <P>Up to this, the Act of 1950 provided that 12 out of 23 members were elected directly by the nursing profession, as they should be in any proper approach to a vocational organisation, or in vocational representation.  Consequently, they had a slight majority and evidently the selections over the past 10 years have not pleased those who would like to see the almighty State running everything.  Now the Minister is taking power to nominate the chairman, without even consulting them.  He already has his nominees amongst the 23 so that we can take it if the advocates of State control have their way, the chairman will be one of those.</P>
    <P>I believe all sides of the House should unite in resisting such further incursions of State control and in opposing this Bill.  Opposed it must be, because we cannot tolerate any further extension of State control.  It may be all right for a little while but State control grows on what it feeds and it wants more and more control.  It must reach down to control every facet of our lives.  We see what has happened over the past 20 to 25 years.  I appeal to all sides to reject this Bill and ensure that the power to nominate the chairman of An Bord Altranais is left rightly where it belongs, with the Council itself.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this Bill.  I am amazed at the extent to which the discussion has roamed on this Bill.  I draw my own conclusions from that, that is, that it was largely due to a desire to have &ldquo;a go&rdquo; at the Minister.  Those people with whom the Minister was dealing were those very <Col N="852" /> reasonable, pious men, who are always prepared to accept everything, provided it suits themselves.  In regard to one point, if I understood the Minister correctly, he said that heretofore the money could not be paid until the fund was audited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady2" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Great play was made with that point.  Of course we all know in regard to various types of expenditure in the country, for instance, in regard to road maintenance, that we cannot get the grants until the county engineer sends up a certificate that this money was spent.  Sometimes that involves a period of six to eight months. In the meantime, in order to keep the public services going, the local authority often has to pay interest on an overdraft.  People should be reasonable in their approach and not try to score a political point on every issue.  Discussion on the Bill centred on nurses and then it moved on to the medical profession.  Senator O'Quigley was even rubbing in the salt when the Minister was absent from the House which I think was not fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I have served on both kinds of bodies which enjoy considerable financial support from the Minister. These bodies have included those in which the council or the board concerned nominated its own chairman and another in which the Chairman is nominated by the Minister for Health. In the second case, the chairman has been successfully nominated by Ministers of both political Parties and I see no difference at all in the harmony we have enjoyed amongst ourselves, on the one hand, and between the Board and the Government Department concerned with the money, on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a body were being set up <i>de novo,</i> I would not find myself worried as to whether the board was to be allowed to appoint its own chairman or the chairman was to be appointed by the Minister.  As was mentioned by a previous Senator, I think it a pity that a change such as this should be made in an Act of the Oireachtas.  I do not understand why it is necessary.  The Minister gave us a number of reasons <Col N="853" /> for which, if they were applied all round in respect of every board, the president would automatically have to be appointed by the Minister.  Many of these boards get on very well as they are.  I do not understand the reason for this.  There must be something rather sinister behind it by way of failure on the part of the people concerned to establish reasonable relations.  I think it is a pity that this has to come about like this.</P>
    <P>The conditions of service of nurses were mentioned.  I am deeply interested in these conditions.  I would agree with Senator Mrs. Dowdall that they have improved immeasurably since I was a medical student.  I know, of course, that historically they have improved very greatly compared with the conditions that obtained long before that but they are far from being the conditions we all desire to see obtain for these girls who do such a tremendous amount of work in this profession.</P>
    <P>I know that, for instance, in Dublin the target of a 96-hour fortnight is still being sought by certain hospitals. Some hospitals have been able to implement that&mdash;in other words, an average of a 48-hour week.  I do not think any trade union would have its members working a 48-hour week.  Yet there are hospitals in Dublin that cannot allow their nurses a 96-hour fortnight because of lack of accommodation for the extra nurses who would have to be employed if they adopted this standard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished&mdash;I cannot conceal it&mdash;at the wide range of this debate.  The Bill now before the House is one &ldquo;to amend and extend the Nurses Act, 1950 and to repeal Section 44 of the Midwives Act, 1944&rdquo;.  I have looked through the copy of the 1950 Act, which I have here, in order to satisfy myself, if I can, that this board has anything whatsoever to do with the terms and conditions of employment of nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part II of the Act contains Sections 7 to 25 and relates entirely to the constitution of An Bord Altranais. Part III of the Act relates to the establishment of a Midwives Committee. Part IV of the Act empowers the <Col N="854" /> Board to employ officers and servants. Part V&mdash;which is an important one&mdash; provides for the register of nurses, registration in the register of nurses, registration of certain persons trained outside the State, rules for grant of certificates of registration, badges and uniforms of nurses, removal from the register of nurses, removal of the name of midwife from the midwives division, restoration to the register of nurses, appeals from the Board or the Commitee, rules for courses of training and examinations for candidates for registration in the register of nurses, rules for courses of training and examination for nurses, holding of examinations, approval by the Board of hospitals and institutions suitable for training purposes, provision of institutional, hostel or other accommodation, scholarships, improper assumption of title of registered nurse or midwife, and profession or calling ancillary to nursing.  The next part deals with financial provisions dealt with in this Bill and which were not referred to. Part VII contains miscellaneous provisions and Part VIII contains transitory provisions.</P>
    <P>There is not any provision in that Act empowering this Board to deal in any way with the terms and the conditions of employment of nurses.  I think that the reason it was dragged in by Senator O'Quigley was in order to find an opportunity of attacking, not the Minister for Health&mdash;the Senator's speech was not directed so much against the Minister for Health&mdash;but a Minister who is not here to answer him, the Minister for Local Government. I cannot describe Senator O'Quigley's performance as an abuse of his position in the Seanad.  It does not fall to me to pass judgment.  I am not passing judgment upon it but I can say&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not permitted to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I am not permitted to do that and I accept my disability.  If the Senator were outside this House, I know what I could say about a gentleman who attacked another person in the absence of that other person, knowing very well that <Col N="855" /> he could not answer.  In so far as Senator O'Quigley's remarks touch my responsibility as Minister for Health, I am not aware of any nurse in any hospital in respect of which I have any functions who is compelled to work six nights a week for 12 hours a night for six months or longer at a stretch.</P>
      <P>That allegation was made by Senator O'Quigley.  If these conditions exist in any hospital, I deplore them. I do not think they ought to exist.  I think we should try to ensure that they will not continue to exist.  As Senator Mrs. Dowdall pointed out, there are some nurses, not by any means all of them, I am sure, who for certain domestic reasons, find it more convenient to work at night and even to work long hours.  They do that of their own volition.  They are not compelled to do it so far as I know by the conditions of employment in any hospital and they are certainly not compelled to do it by any of the regulations made by the Minister for Health.  Senator Jessop referred to this matter in a very reasonable way. He pointed out that one of the difficulties which some voluntary hospitals have in trying to ensure that nurses will work upon a more reasonable rota was the fact that they had not got accommodation for these nurses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I should like to tell of our experiences in Cork.  We have got over the problem of employing nurses and having them live outside.  We have been able to see that our nurses work a 96-hours fortnight maximum and many of them are working much less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of that intervention because it certainly makes it much easier for me to deal with the point made by Senator Jessop.  Here is how we have to look at this matter.  I have a certain amount of money at my disposal. What priority am I going to give? Whom am I going to put first on the list?  Am I going to put the position of patients first or the nurses?  I have <Col N="856" /> to find money to make good the deficiency which exists in the city of Dublin and elsewhere for patient accommodation.  Quite frankly, so long as there is this shortage of patient accommodation, I think the patients are entitled to get priority.  Many hospital authorities, if they set their minds to it, can solve their difficulties in much the same way as the hospitals in Cork with which Senator Mrs. Dowdall is associated succeeded in solving theirs.</P>
      <P>Then I come to Senator Quinlan. I have never heard such a piece of tushery either in the Dáil or in the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as to try to talk about this measure in terms of subsidiary functions.  This Board is set up by statute under the control of the Minister for Health to act as his agent and instrument.  It is responsible to the Minister for Health.  If it does not function properly, in accordance with the judgment of the Minister for Health, he can put it out of existence altogether.  The former President of the Board, to whom Senator O'Quigley referred and whom I think Senator Donegan had in mind, brought that Board, by his utter defiance of his responsibilities under the Nurses Act, to the point at which I had to consider whether or not I would dissolve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, you had an argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true. At one stage he persuaded the Board to refuse to fulfil its responsibilities under Section 23 of this Act.  It was necessary for me to point out to the Board that if a direction given under Section 23 were not complied with I <Col N="857" /> would have to consider dissolving the Board and, under another section, appointing some other persons to carry out these functions.</P>
      <P>When that situation arises, when a person tries to bring extraneous matters, as Senator Donegan has described them, into the proceedings of this Board and carries into the councils of the Board a feud which he has been waging outside with the Minister for Health then it is time for the Minister for Health to make quite certain that that sort of situation would not occur again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that in these matters my immediate predecessor, Deputy T.F. O'Higgins, was wiser than one of my earlier predecessors who was responsible for the Act of 1950 because when he set up any statutory board he reserved to the Minister, and I think quite properly reserved to the Minister, the power of appointment to the chairmanship or presidency of the board.  He did this in relation to the Opticians' Board and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I think, on the whole, that is a much better arrangement <Col N="858" /> than the one which was adopted in the Nurses Act, 1950.</P>
      <P>But it has been alleged that I have tried to reserve to myself personally, during this period when I am for the time being Minister for Health, the power to appoint the President of the Board.  On the contrary I think that I have succeeded in making a very admirable transition from one system to the other.  The present President of the Board has been elected by the Board as a whole. Under Section 7, he will be continued in office until 1963 and it will fall to another Minister, to whomsoever may be my successor, when the present President's term has expired to consider whether or not he will continue him in office for a further period.  I am not trying to ensure that the next person to be appointed will be an instrument of mine.  I am trying to make certain that, by a wrongful choice, my successor will not be faced with the unpleasant dilemma which I had to face and which, quite frankly, I was determined would be resolved.</P>
      <P>I do not think anything else was said in relation to this matter.  There is this talk about subsidiary function.  If we were to carry that to its logical conclusion, we should not have a Government in this country.  We should have anarchy or the country ruled by a bureaucracy without any responsibility whatever to the people.  Whoever is Minister for Health is responsible to Dáil Éireann for the proper discharge of its functions by An Bord Altranais, or indeed by any subsidiary body for which as Minister he may happen to be responsible.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Minister who happens to be responsible for these functions and who has to answer to Dáil Éireann for these boards and for the manner in which they discharge their functions is not trying to give the State abnormal powers.  He is trying to fulfil his duties to the people who, first of all, elect him to the Dáil and by whose suffrage he happens to be a member of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government exists to rule the State in the interests of the people. <Col N="859" /> There is no question that the ordinary, fundamental human rights are being interfered with when a government has the firmness and resolution to govern in the interests of the people.  The people of Ireland have no use for syndicalism or any form of occupational authoritarianism such as would appear to appeal to Senator Quinlan. They elect members to Dáil Éireann and to Seanad Éireann to ensure that the people will be governed by a responsible government, by a government which will enforce its authority whenever the need arises and which is not prepared to farm out its responsibility, its authority or its powers to a subsidiary body.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it necessary to provide that the Institute &ldquo;may arrange with any person or institution&rdquo; because, as I showed in my Second Reading speech, it will be necessary for the Institute to rely on existing institutions, especially the universities, for the carrying out of much of the applied research that is so necessary to be carried out in conjunction with the routine research. I do not think it would be regarded as being quite legal that the Institute should be able to arrange with a person in the university to carry out research.  The arrangement should come more strictly through the <Col N="861" /> institution concerned.  The approval of the institution would have to be got.  Perhaps the Minister could say whether the section, as it stands, can be extended as far as the making of arrangements with institutions are concerned?</P>

      <P>This section is really the kernel of the whole working of the Institute.  The functions are listed in Section 6.  Paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of Section 6 is:</P>
      <P>(a)  to undertake, encourage and foster scientific research and investigation with the object of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  promoting the utilisation of the natural resources of the State,</P>
      <P>I take it that &ldquo;the natural resources&rdquo; includes very much the agricultural resources of the State.  Subsection (4) of Section 6 says:</P>
      <P>The functions of the Institute shall not include any function assigned to an Foras Talúntais by the Agriculture (An Foras Talúntais) Act, 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the functions assigned to An Foras Talúntais are rather general and deal only with agricultural research in the general sense.  We got very lucid explanations from the former Taoiseach, our present President, which showed that the Institute was not concerned very much with marketing but with the other end of research. That was emphasised further in the debate in relation to An Bord Bainne. <Col N="862" /> An Bord Bainne has quite heavy responsibilities as far as marketing is concerned.  There does seem to be a crossing of functions as between this Institute and An Bord Bainne and I should like to know how these can be dovetailed into one another.  The Agricultural Institute has the last word on agricultural research.  I should not think this new Institute would be very much concerned with the type of agricultural research that would be carried out by the Agricultural Institute but it definitely will come very much into the picture with the type of marketing research that will be carried on by An Bord Bainne.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that, in general, the Institute will not overlap the work.  Section 6 (4) makes it clear that the activities assigned to An Foras Talúntais are removed from the scope of the activities of the Institute.  Any border-line cases will have to be settled between the two Institutes.  I do not think there is need for any such legislation in regard to it.</P>
      <P>There might be some research into some element of the natural resources of the land which would be put aside by An Foras Talúntais.  If I remember rightly, the activities of An Foras Talúntais under the legislation cover a very wide range.  I imagine it would have to be left to the good sense of the two Institutes to avoid overlapping.  I do not believe that if An Foras Talúntais said some particular type of work was outside the scope of their work, or that they had no time to do it, there would be any difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>This provides for any clash between An Foras Talúntais and the new body.  My whole point is that there is a far greater likelihood of clash between An Bord Bainne, which we set up a few months ago, and this new Institute.  An Bord Bainne is specifically charged with the marketing of agricultural produce and everything that goes with it.  I could see that there would be a very large realm in which both the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and An Bord Bainne could co-operate very effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is wrong.  It is a cod to say it has nothing to do with anything connected with agricultural marketing.  For instance, if a new process were discovered by which cheese could be made, if a new method were discovered whereby milk could be processed, if a new method were discovered whereby the by-products of cheese, whey, and so on, could be processed, it might fall to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to carry out investigations; that is their function.  The fact that the word &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; is in the title could not possibly exclude matter relating to agriculture.  Is it not true that once the product leaves the farmer's hands, the further processing and further dealing with it could be defined, if one desired to do so, as industrial work? The Minister has gone completely wrong in his statement.  It is not fair to Senator Quinlan to suggest to him that agriculture is being excluded.  I do not believe it is being excluded.</P>

      <P>I believe it is quite foolish on the part of the Minister to say so because this Institute will not undertake marketing research in any shape or form.  It will do work within the terms of the Act, if asked to do so, in relation to an agricultural product such as it has been doing in relation to the quality of Irish flour.  That work has been passed over to An Foras Talúntais and they are now doing it.  It was done before by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  It will not do marketing research.  There need not be any conflict.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinlan's point was that An Bord Bainne is a marketing organisation.  If there were a requirement for standardisation of some new product, <Col N="864" /> surely this Institute, being an Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, could facilitate An Bord Bainne in such investigation to see if such an article is up to standard?</P>

      <P>Senator Quinlan confuses the issue by referring to An Foras Talúntais, a separate organisation which can do research on any kind of agricultural matter, even on marketing.  Now we have a Bill dealing with the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  If any organisation in the country requires standardisation of a product which we want to export, including An Bord Bainne, surely the Institute here, dealing with standards, would facilitate any organisation, set up by the State, to produce that standard?</P>

      <P>The functions of the Institute shall not include any function assigned to An Foras Talúntais by the Agriculture (An Foras Talúntais) Act, 1958.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is in the section.  I need not apologise for bringing it in.  If it is necessary to regulate functions between this new Institute and An Foras Talúntais I would point out that the problem between this new Institute and An Bord Bainne is much more ticklish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just raised the matter to draw attention to it and to express the hope that right from the beginning care will be taken to see that those two bodies work together, and that many of the standardisation processes required for agricultural products will involve this new Institute.  It would have been far <Col N="865" /> more germane if in subsection (4), An Bord Bainne were mentioned, with some overall deciding authority between An Bord Bainne and the new Institute when they overlap or conflict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer back to a matter with which I dealt on the Second Stage.  I am sorry the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not here because he would be interested to hear the results of research which I made. On the Second Stage, I was talking about the quality of shoes manufactured in this country and there was an outcry by members on the Government side that this was sabotaging Irish industry.  I want to make it quite clear that we will never get anywhere in establishing proper standards in Irish industry, if we are not prepared to say that Irish industry in particular ways is falling down on the job.</P>
      <P>Secondly, if members read the journals of the chambers of commerce and a journal like <i>Development</i> and the speeches made by presidents of Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Irish Manufacturers and so on, when they are talking about the Irish position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Common Market there has been hardly one in the past 12 months which has not commented adversely on the laggards in Irish industry who have availed themselves of protective tariffs and quotas and are not in a position to deal with competition which will arise, if and when we enter the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dealing with leather and I was complaining that the main requirement which I felt any person buying shoes should expect to be fulfilled, that they should keep out water, was not regarded by some manufacturers as being reasonable.  They felt it was an unreasonable requirement that shoes should keep out water.  I could not find the particular letter I wanted but I have one which deals with the statement that the shoes were not guaranteed to be waterproof, that was after <Col N="866" /> four days' use in the streets of Dublin and not on a golf course as the Minister was inclined to suggest the other day.  I have some evidence that that is a view held in relation to Irish leather.  Apparently the manufacturers of shoes who avail of our natural resources in the form of cow and calf hides do not think that leather which will keep out water can be produced.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned on the last occasion, I wrote to a manufacturer of a pair of shoes which I had purchased telling him my grievance and that I had to keep an eye to the weather forecasts on Radio Éireann news bulletins before wearing the shoes.  I paid between 60/- and 70/- for these shoes.  I wrote on Seanad Éireann notepaper so that the manufacturer would be aware that he was dealing with somebody who was in a position to deal with him at a later stage. The manufacturer replied on 14th of March and in the interests of the workers in that industry, I shall not disclose the name.  I have no doubt that the people here on the basis of this letter would never buy another pair of shoes from that manufacturer if I did.  Being broadminded, I fitted on some shoes since&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The normal business procedure in dealing with complaints regarding manufactured articles is to return them to the person from whom purchased.</P>
    <P>I had actually bought them 150 miles west of Dublin and I was not going to send them to Castlebar, where I bought them, so that they could be transhipped to a place in the east of Ireland.</P>

      <P>If they consider the complaint justified, they will return the article to the manufacturer.</P>
      <P>The tone of your letter does not encourage us to short circuit this procedure.</P>
      <P>Well, it was not designed for that purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>We suggest you proceed in the normal manner.</P>
      <P>I never had time to reply to this man, but I had intended to send the whole correspondence to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for his information.  The letter concluded:</P>

      <P>Incidentally, you might like to know that the uppers of the shoes are made from French calf, and, no doubt, you are aware that the soles are made from native Irish leather, as required by Dáil and Seanad Éireann laws.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the justification given by this manufacturer was that I could &ldquo;lump it&rdquo; and pay 70/- for the purchase of shoes which let in water after four or five days because I was party to the law which compelled them to use Irish leather.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce wanted to nail my hand to the desk on the last occasion.  I want to make it quite clear that that does not represent the normal behaviour of Irish manufacturers and that is not the normal standard.  Here is a gentleman writing this letter and here is a firm producing goods behind protective tariffs and the Minister for Industry and Commerce should ask the Institute to see to it that they make better use of Irish leather, or if he is not prepared to do that, to see to it that the firm does not derive any benefit from tariffs or quotas.  I think the Irish people are entitled to protection from that kind of inefficiency.  I hope this Institute in the discharge of its functions will ensure that people of this kind will have no excuse for saying that the raw materials provided from the natural resources of the State are inadequate from the point of view of manufacture.

      <P>I want to return to something which will be more at <Col N="869" /> home for some of us.  It is all very well to establish An Bord Bainne, bord this and bord that in an election year but the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, if it is to be of some practical use, ought not, as I pointed out on the last occasion, engage in fixing standards of linseed oil, turpentine and paint dryers. These are not of great concern to the people.  They do not affect the cost of living.  What I want to see this Institute doing is making a first-class effort to ensure that the commodities in everyday use among the vast majority of the population of this country will reach such a standard that there will be no cause for complaint about the quality of the goods manufactured here.  Indeed, likewise, I should like to see some kind of an agency which will see that imported goods are not the dumpings of foreign manufacturers.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to sub-paragraph (g) and the following sub-paragraph of subsection (2) of Section 6.  Can the Minister tell us if the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards will be able to guarantee that a saucepan, a pan or any everyday commodity purchased by the ordinary housewife reaches a certain standard?  In Britain, there is a voluntary body.  It is one of those admirable voluntary bodies which does such good work.

In relation to commodities manufactured in this country, will the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards under sub-paragraph (g) of subsection (2) of Section 6 have power to set its seal on Irish manufactured <Col N="870" /> goods in the same way as the Good Housekeeping Institute sets its seal on particular goods in Britain?</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with the question of footwear.  We could have quite a long debate on the quality of Irish goods, if we wanted to this evening.  We could pursue the matter, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, indefinitely; but since Senator O'Quigley spoke about shoes, I must say that I am worn to a shadow trying to wear out shoes of Irish manufacture. I love to wear a pair of old battered shoes that do not leak, but my wife will not let me.  They are all Irish-made. Having said that, I should point out that the volume of exports of footwear has enormously increased.  That indicates a general improvement in the quality and design of shoes.</P>
      <P>It is quite evident in connection with all manufacture in this country that improvement is possible and that there must be some bad manufacture. That can be equally found in any other country.  The working of the consumers' association in Great Britain reveals that in a country with centuries of industrial tradition, grossly inadequate commodities are sold on the market there.  The same thing will be found in other countries.</P>
      <P>We have our own problems to face as a newer industrial country.  I should like to clear away the Fine Gael mists from this debate in regard to tariffs and quotas.  Fine Gael have a wonderful habit of implying that there is something wrong about tariffs and quotas but they do nothing about removing them when they get into office.  Practically all countries in the world have had very high tariffs.  In Great Britain at present, the average tariff on all imported goods is 25 per cent. and that in a country with a long industrial tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Senator choses to read recent comments on the state of the English economy in <i>The Economist, The Statist, The Sunday Times</i> and <i>The Observer</i> he will find a number of intelligent people recommending to Mr. Selwyn Lloyd that one of the ways of getting England permanently <Col N="871" /> on its feet so that there will be no more economic crises is the lowering of tariffs to drive English industry into the export field and encourage better quality.  I hope we will not need to hear any more in this debate about what appears always to be the public evil of Irish tariffs and quotas.</P>
    <P>The consumers' association has nothing to do with this Bill.  I know it would be a very good thing if we could afford the kind of association that exists in Great Britain.  The object of the Institute under this Bill is to engage in improving the standards of ordinary household commodities. The work has to proceed on a slow basis.  It is impossible to do a great many commodities at once. There are standard marks which can be licensed to firms.  It is not obligatory on a firm to use a particular standard mark except in cases where the safety of the public is involved.</P>

I would remind the Senator that there is sufficient competition in the Republic at the moment to ensure that if these people want to remain in business, they must produce an article of a reasonable standard. <Col N="872" /> Not only that, but if they go on the export market they must, as the Minister said, meet and beat the main competition in Western Europe.

      <P>May I ask the Minister, who expresses great familiarity with the workings of the Institute of Good Housekeeping in England, whether or not this Institute will perform functions analogous to that Institute? He attempted to lead the House into the belief that it will.  From what the Minister said, it is quite clear that it will not.  The Minister speaks about the fixing of standards by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. He says people may apply to the Institute for a licence and that thereafter they may stamp their goods with the stamp showing that they conform with the standard laid down by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. We know to date that where standards have been established by the Institute, in very few cases have these standards been adopted by manufacturers.</P>
      <P>I challenge the Minister to deny that the purchaser of a saucepan or a pan or an electric fire in this country will never see a certificate from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards saying: &ldquo;This article conforms with the standards established by this Institute&rdquo; and, by implication, is a well worth while article to buy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (2) and substitute the following new subsection :</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) The Board shall consist of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  One member appointed alternately by the Science and Engineering Faculties of each of the following institutions:</P>
      <P>University College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>University College, Cork.</P>
      <P>University College, Galway.</P>
      <P>Trinity College, Dublin.</P>
      <P>(ii)  The President of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland, or his nominee.</P>
      <P>(iii)  The President of the Institute of Chemists or his nominee.</P>
      <P>(iv)  Three members appointed by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to appeal to all members here to take seriously this very real threat of State control which is very real.  It is no fault of ours that, coming as late as we did to independence, and having to catch up in the industrial field, we had to do a great deal of work by means of State bodies.  We did not have private enterprise like many others available for many of <Col N="877" /> our national tasks and therefore had to resort to State bodies and their modification, which we call the semi-State body.  They did a lot of good and even though it can be said that we probably have more State controlled activity here than any place in Western Europe, I am not putting that up as a criticism.  We should make every effort to straighten out the position and see that as many of these functions as can be efficiently taken away from the State, will be transferred to and discharged by other bodies.  The Industrial Research and Standards Institute offers such an opportunity.  This is a board of nine and the proposal here is that they should all be appointed by the State.</P>
    <P>We are not always going to have as Ministers the angels we have had in this and previous Governments.  In building up the State, we have always to ensure that it has solid foundations and that those bodies will have a certain degree of independence and autonomy over and above the State. We should take the precaution to see that a certain number of the members are appointed by the Institute which is doing this type of work.  That will strengthen the whole fabric of the State. We might go back and contrast this Institute with the Agricultural Institute into which a great deal more thought went than has gone into this present effort.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute created a great deal of controversy and the bodies concerned awoke to the encroachment on their rights before it was too late and consequently there was that effort to ensure that there was State control. I cannot see that there has been any parallel study made in remodifying or expanding the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to perform the same function for industry.  The hallmarks are there right through the Bill. There is more State control in this than there was in the Agricultural Institute Bill and my amendments are designed to lessen that.  I do not want anybody to get the idea that I am referring to State control in a derogatory sense, but you must have balance.  The State can have too much control as well as too little.  We here will never suffer <Col N="878" /> from the fact that the State has too little.  In fact, it controls almost every facet of our lives.  It appoints various people to boards and the boards which it does not control depend on the State for finance, and financial control is almost as effective as any other control.</P>
    <P>I am moving that six members of the nine be appointed directly by other bodies.  I am proposing that four should come from the universities, through the Faculties of Science and Engineering, one from the President of the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland, which, after all, is the body <i>par excellence</i> qualified to speak, as stated in Section 8, subsection (3), for persons employed in industry.  The whole engineering profession is making a special contribution to the industrial drive.  In the same way, the chemists of Ireland speak for another important group.  I think it is very reasonable that these bodies should make their own appointments because I cannot see that there is in the Department of Industry and Commerce any group competent to assess the qualifications of people to be appointed here for scientific research.</P>
    <P>There is where we fall down always.  Why not let the bodies concerned make their own appointments? I have put in the alternative as between the faculties of Agriculture and Engineering because I should like to see an element of rotation brought into the membership.  Consequently, for one period the appointment would come from the faculty of Science and for another period from the faculty of Engineering, through the President and Governing Body of the University.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Quinlan has made a very strong case for this amendment.  I do not see the remotest chance of its being accepted, I regret to say, but I should like to go on record as saying that I think he is right.  It would be better for the country if the Board were selected in this way.  All of us have great admiration for the Civil Service and their methods; yet there are times when the independence a university <Col N="879" /> can give is desirable.  This is one of the cases where it is desirable.  I would be delighted and astonished if the Minister would accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am unable to accept the amendment.  The Institute intends to co-operate with the universities and other bodies and, if necessary, to ask them to engage in certain types of research on their behalf.  The Minister is very anxious to get people who will have a particular gift for discharging the duties involved.  If the amendment were adopted, you might have the disadvantage of there being too many divergent interests on the Board. There might possibly be clashes as to what sort of co-operation should be asked in regard to the various bodies.</P>
      <P>It is quite evident that there are too many bodies for this particular Board.  For example, Senator Quinlan chose the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institute of Chemists but there are other institutes which deal with scientific matters.  I know the Minister feels that he should have the choice, by a later subsection, to choose members by reason of their attainments in scientific research applied to industry or because they are representative of industry or because they are persons employed in industry or are capable of giving substantial practical assistance in the work of the Institute.  He is bound in the selection of the board to have regard to those qualifications.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that in the case of other State boards, there is not the same direction to the Minister as there is in this case.  I think we can have reliance on the Minister's choice.  He is bound to appoint people who have particularly good qualities in relation to the work of the Institute.  I can hardly imagine a board of this kind without people representing university interests.  Out of the nine members, I think it can be taken as reasonably certain there will be people who will be working in our universities and people who will have a general broad interest in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> It seems to me that the object of Senator Quinlan will be achieved by leaving the Bill at it is and allowing the Minister to choose people who he thinks will be good administrators of the Board.  It is easy to imagine that a person nominated by a particular university college might be excellent at research in a particular field.  He might have some good ideas about research in general but might not have the particular gift of being able to run this Board, which is a different matter.</P>
    <P>The position of a member of the Board is one which requires particular qualities.  For example, the president of a particular institute might be a person who is extremely good at running the affairs of his institute.  He might be good at convening meetings. He might be good at meeting distinguished persons who come to lecture to the institute.  He might be good at preparing the programme for the institute for the year or securing a good attendance and good membership.  He might be good at all these things but he might not at the same time be good as a member of the Board of this Institute.  I think, therefore, the Minister should be allowed the discretion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say at once that the appointment of this Board and a decision as to how the Board ought to be appointed are not simple.  Like Senators Stanford and Quinlan, I favour some amendment of this kind. I am not sure that the amendment, as framed, is quite workable but the Minister's own statement was very interesting.  It is quite clear that the Minister for Industry and Commerce takes what is entirely a too narrow view of the work of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked of the necessity of having people who would not have divergent views.  Could one not make an excellent argument that what you want on the Board are people who have divergent views, people who have not a one-track mind?  What you want are people who have a lively mind, people who have behind them a career of pure research and who are not administrators.  What the Minister talks about&mdash;and I say this without offence &mdash;is the usual Departmental idea that <Col N="881" /> there must be a file and you must run everything in a straight line.  You must not have any of these odd people who might not agree with you and who might not sign the memorandum in the appropriate place, at the appropriate date and on the correct line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>And with two witnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>And with the correct two witnesses.  That is not correct. He thinks there might be clashes. The Minister thinks apparently of a board of administrators but this Board, by its very nature, is a board of industrial research and not a matter of administration. It will have a secretary who would be a civil servant and no doubt will have all the administrative merits that good civil servants possess in abundance.  The whole thing is based on the notion that there are people who are good in blinkers on industrial research to whom you can say: &ldquo;Look; find out something about footwear, for example, the pair of shoes Senator O'Quigley complained about.&rdquo;  There is no such thing.  If a person is good at that, he is good at it because somebody did pure research in a research laboratory at a university or somewhere else.</P>
      <P>There is the notion that you can get a board composed of persons who, in the words of the subsection, have &ldquo;attainments in scientific research applied to industry&rdquo;, a civil servant or a Minister having decided who is good or who is bad.  I submit that there is nobody in the Department of Industry and Commerce capable of deciding that at all.  If the University Colleges were asked to appoint, or if the President of each College, having consulted with the faculty of Science or the faculty of Engineering, were to put somebody on this Board, they might not all be people who would exactly run in harness but I think you would have much more lively thinking and much better results in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether or not the Minister accepts this amendment, I think he should use his influence with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to see that somebody is put on this Board whose interest, above all other interests, is in pure unapplied research.  I took a certain amount of trouble in this connection <Col N="882" /> many years ago when the first Bill was introduced here.  There was considerable discussion in the other House.  A member of the Minister's own Party in the other House fought the present Taoiseach in this matter from the very beginning.  Between what was said in the Dáil and here, I think in the end we convinced the Taoiseach about it.</P>
    <P>This Board will not work satisfactorily unless you put upon it a scientist, not because he is good at the application of science to industry but because he is good at science and has ideas and has a knowledge of what is happening in the world of science as distinct from research applied to certain specific industrial purposes.</P>
    <P>I regret the state of mind of the Minister for Industry and Commerce which the present Minister has revealed to us.  I think the whole idea of the Board is far too narrow.  The kind of board the Minister wants will not have divergent views; it will not have clashes.  They will be good administrators. He will choose all those people.  Who will be competent to say that all the people so chosen will have all these qualities?</P>
    <P>I suggest that if they have these qualities, they are precisely the qualities which will make the Board not a success but a failure.  They would benefit very much by the odd kind of person who is first-class at research.  I know that the people who are first-class at research are not people who work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or to whom you can say: &ldquo;Go in and do so-and-so before tomorrow.&rdquo;  They will not do that for you.  Unless a whiff of fresh air from research in laboratories, which is rather a contradiction in terms, comes here, the Board will not work. The view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is too narrow.  It will not make for efficient working either with the Board as contemplated in the section or the Board as contemplated in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving this amendment, I was not looking for university representation or for anything for the university.  We do not want anything from this.  We are <Col N="883" /> giving the services of our trained men to man this Board.  As both Senators Stanford and Hayes have emphasised, this Board cannot be a success without that personnel.</P>
      <P>There is not within the Department of Industry and Commerce the personnel to judge who are the people competent in research of this kind.  It is going beyond the functions that should be discharged by any body of non-scientists to sit and take to themselves the right to judge what scientists are likely to be desirable.  The major requirement seems to be that they should not cause any difficulties in administration.</P>
      <P>If we take the heads of our departments, the men likely to know, I doubt if the Minister could find more skilled administrators anywhere in the country than the men who head our scientific departments because they are always trying to make £1 do the work of £10. That is administration <i>par excellence.</i> They are living on pittances of allowances for research that are just a laughing-stock in other countries but they are doing that work and it gains international recognition.  Therefore, I am moving this amendment more in sorrow than in anger, in sorrow at the narrow approach to this problem. There is on record nowhere, in relation to this new body to rejuvenate Irish industry just as we take a leap into the Common Market, that a single committee was set up to give us a blueprint for the future.  That is what has got us into most of our difficulties in the past.</P>
      <P>My regret is that the time has been too short.  The Bill has come too quickly.  The bodies concerned have not been aware of what is happening or else an action paralleling the magnificent reaction we had would have taken place and once again a body would be forged that would do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, he is not supposed to be an administrator, and so on.  Surely the judgment of the engineers of Ireland, not necessarily civil engineers but all engineers, in selecting a man to lead them for one year, must be accepted as at least as <Col N="884" /> good as the judgment of any group in any Civil Service Department, without in the slightest way being disrespectful to any Civil Service Department? We have to do our own work.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude on this and perhaps he would indicate it further on Report Stage.</P>

Whether one is a civil servant or just an ordinary lay person, all of us know well who the people are who are doing good scientific research. We do not have to be actually in the university or in the Institution of Engineers to know the people who are doing the work.  Many others, quite outside all these things, read and make ourselves aware of what is going on. If the ordinary laity are doing that, I have no doubt that the Department is doing it very much better.  Even though researchers and professors generally are people who work quietly, I must say that it is not my experience that most of them hide their lights too closely under many bushels.</P>
      <P>It is true to say that the Minister with his advisers, will not keep out all these wonderful researchers and scientists. We all hope that, in their wisdom, they will pick the people to the best advantage of the group being set up and that, even though it is not done as Senator Quinlan wishes it to be done, it will be a good Institute.</P>

      <P>Yes, with your permission, Sir.  Briefly, for the functioning of a research corps, you need a great deal of continuity.  I believe three years is too short a term for appointment on the Board and I suggest the period should be extended to five years.  I think it is wrong that they should change every three years. When you consider how long it takes to do any considerable volume of research or investigation, you can see how undesirable it is that the membership of the Board should be chopped and changed in this way.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister desires an early opportunity of reviewing the members of the Board, particularly in view of the expansion which is taking place in the Institute.  It is true that in the case of a number of other bodies, the term of office is five years.  He would like to have a shorter period in the case of this Institute because, as I said, of its expansion and of the various changes taking place in its administration.  He is very strongly in favour of the three-year period.</P>

      <P>I do not understand all this talk about the almighty Minister in the background.  The Minister selects.  He can select better than any university or any group and he can review better.  How can he review unless he has several members of council there to report specifically on the day-to-day doings of the members? It puzzles me how any outside person could be sufficiently aware of what is happening within a committee to be in a position to review it periodically.  It makes me nervous of the whole thing.</P>

      <P>One could argue that the difference between three and five is one which depends partly on the way the Institute gets going.  The Institute might have difficulty in getting going and in appointing staff, <Col N="886" /> so I will ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to consider, between now and Report Stage, whether he will change it to five.

      <P>Subsection (1) says that &ldquo;Every member of the Board shall hold office on such terms as the Minister may determine.&rdquo;  I should like a little more clarification on this point.  Does this mean that the Minister envisages that the members shall receive regular salaries?  If it does, I believe it would be far better if their services were on a voluntary basis, with expenses, and the money devoted to the development of research in the applied research centres in the country.</P>

      <P>I should like to stress that what is called for is some type of extra-curricular work. Practically all the universities in the United States and in many parts of Europe are now on a nine months basis, that is, they are all primarily universities but there is teaching and general research work during the nine months.  It is recognised that during the summer period the people concerned are free to accept employment elsewhere.  Very often that employment takes the form of research grants given by various agencies such as the Ford Foundation or the Rockefeller Institution and other such bodies.</P>

      <P>I am opposing this section.  Again, this is one of those unnecessary incursions by the State into the workings of the Board. It may be said that the State would never exercise such a right, but as it stands it leaves the way open for such a right to be exercised at any time in the future.  In a body devoted to research, carrying on a continuous effort over the years, even if it does have one troublesome member in nine, he may be the gadfly which stimulates them to better endeavour.  I cannot see how the Minister has the information <Col N="888" /> necessary to remove such a member. Where is his spyline into the councils of this new body which reports that such a member is proving troublesome and not performing his functions?</P>
      <P>In this connection I might refer to the Agricultural Institute Bill which was more reasonable.  In regard to it, the Government, not the Minister, may, at any time, on the advice of the council, remove an ordinary member of the council from office.  It would be quite reasonable if the removal were done on the advice of the council but I cannot see how the Minister, lacking the advice of the council, would be in a position to remove anybody from the Board. Consequently the foundations of this new Institute would be much sounder if this section were dropped altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is customary in legislation governing a great many boards for a Minister to have power to remove members of the board.  It seems to me that for purely commonsense reasons, he must have power to remove a member of a board whose conduct after his appointment becomes quite unsuitable. I need not go into this matter in detail.  People's characters do deteriorate so that they become unfit for duty of this kind.  It is possible for the chairman, if he chooses, to speak to the Minister privately in regard to the conduct of someone who is no longer serving the Institute. There must always be a clause of this kind in a Bill simply for ordinary human reasons of which the Seanad is aware.  I hope nobody will ever be appointed to whom this section will need to be applied.  Nevertheless, it may happen.</P>

      <P>This section would probably fall if the manner of appointment of the Board, as suggested in Senator Quinlan's amendment, were carried out because the desire would be to make it a completely autonomous body.  The desire is not to make it an autonomous body.  As the Minister points out, the fact that the Minister removes one is entirely consequent upon the other. There is something in the suggestion that this matter should be considered <Col N="889" /> before Report Stage and an amendment&mdash;not Senator Quinlan's amendment&mdash;introduced which would mean that some portion of the Board at least would not be appointed by the Minister.  If the whole Board is to be appointed by the Minister, the Minister must have the right to remove the one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would replace this by some section more in line with what is in the Agricultural Institute?  In other words, the Minister should be acting on the advice of the Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I understand it, if the Minister appoints, he must have the right to remove.  In the case of An Foras Talúntais, a number of the members were nominated.  That is not the case here.  All the members are appointed by the Minister.  There could be circumstances in which it would be necessary to remove a person.  For instance, somebody might be appointed by the Minister in very good faith who never attended meetings of the Board.  There is no need for me to enlarge on this any further. It is customary in the case of all Acts governing boards of this kind to give the Minister that power in one form or another.  Certainly, in recent years there has always been some section in an Act giving the Minister this power.</P>

      <P>We get rather weary listening to Ministers saying: &ldquo;It is customary.&rdquo;  Another phrase used is that &ldquo;it is common form&rdquo;.  Things that are customary and common form can turn out, on examination, to be quite unsuitable.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is a mild-mannered gentleman.  I am glad to be able to say that about him in his absence.  I can say it in his presence, too.  He has not got the ruthlessness of his senior colleague, the Minister for Health, who in the Nurses Bill puts in a provision that the board shall furnish to the Minister such information with regard to the performance of their functions as the Minister may require.  That is a good piece of fight on the part of the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have examined this Bill.  There is <Col N="890" /> no authority vested in the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ascertain from the Institute what is going on. Therefore, it is left to a haphazard method.  Indeed, if it is a method at all, it is an illicit method, as Senator Quinlan suggests.  The Minister must go round spying and hearing stories in bars, lounges and corridors.  That is the way the Minister would get his information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite specific about it.  If the Minister has not authority under this Bill, as the Minister for Health has under the Nurses Bill, to get information from the Board, then he must get his information in some way other than by asking the Board from time to time what is going on.  I suggest there are a variety of ways in which he can pick up that information which are not, in my view, the most salutary.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  It is well known that Ministers go into public houses and public bars.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Senator Carter is getting very sensitive indeed.  There is a great deal in the point made by Senator Quinlan that there is not any way, except some kind of underhand way, by which the Minister for Industry and Commerce can acquire information.  I think, therefore, that the section might be deleted completely.  Alternatively, <Col N="891" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce might bring in a section requiring the Board from time to time to give such information as he requires.  That is the standard in many of these Bills.</P>
      <P>It would, therefore, seem unnecessary to have Section 11 in view of the fact that in Section 9 we say: &ldquo;Every member of the Board shall hold office on such terms as the Minister may determine.&rdquo; There is nothing to prevent the Minister for Industry and Commerce from saying: &ldquo;You are appointed for a period of three years.  Your appointment may be determined at any time for reasons which appear to me, on information supplied by the Board, satisfactory.&rdquo;  It would be a much more straightforward way of dealing with the matter.</P>

The Minister is right to retain Section 11. Senator O'Quigley sets himself up as a neo-draftsman in this House.

The level of the half barrel is not so low and the level of debate there is not as low sometimes as in this House which is the second largest public house in the State.  If what Senator O'Quigley pointed out is not a drafting error, it is not necessary. Why do we want Section 11 (1) at all? Senator O'Quigley would make one of the finest draftsmen they ever had in the draftsman's office.  It seems a pity that he can find so many errors of draftsmanship in Bills.

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> I have a number of amendments here which are designed to get away, on the one hand, from the exclusion of members of the Houses of the Oireachtas from being on state boards or being members of those bodies.  It does seem that the low respect in which members of the Houses are held outside at times is due to the feeling abroad that politics or being a member of the Oireachtas is something to be ashamed of.  I do not think any of us feel that way about it.  Consequently, why should we exclude ourselves?</P>
    <P>I have taken a half-way measure here in that I have suggested that the first subsection of Section 13 be deleted, that is, if the member of the board during his term of membership is elected to either House of the Oireachtas.  The subsection reads:</P>
    <P>Where a member of the Board becomes a member of either House of the Oireachtas, he shall, upon his becoming entitled under the Standing Orders of that House to sit therein, cease to be a member of the Board.</P>
    <P>By removing that subsection, we would at least allow him to serve out his term on the board.  Subsection (2) provides that any member who is sitting in either House is not eligible to be a member of the Board.  We may go back here to the Agricultural Institute.  In the Agricultural Institute which, as I pointed out before, was the hardest fought for body we have constituted in this country and the one into which most thought went, we have no such restrictive clause. Likewise the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.  I have been a member of that Board for the past ten years.  There is no such restrictive clause.  Therefore, I move that we delete subsection (1) as a first step.</P>

      <P>As Senator Quinlan mentioned, these two subsections here the first of which this amendment refers to, are common form.  In the introduction of all new boards, just as this one, it seems to be common form to exclude all members of the Oireachtas.  When these things become accepted, it becomes, shall I pun it, common form not to disagree with <Col N="895" /> them.  It is questionable whether it is right or wrong.</P>
      <P>In America, for instance, you have members of both Houses of Parliament on all sorts of committees one reads about, doing valuable work.  It is rather a pity in a way that all members of Parliament should be excluded from boards such as this.  I do not go with Senator Quinlan in his half-way house measure.  I know there is no hope of any amendment being accepted on Report Stage which will allow members of Parliament to be members of the board we are about to set up but I should like to put the question mark in the mind of the Government as to whether or not it is right to exclude all members of Parliament. I think members of the Opposition and of the Government Party could, in the case of various boards, perhaps because of their experience, be the most valuable members. Why should membership of this House or the lower House debar a person from giving to the country, through membership of a board such as this, the contribution he is capable of giving and which the country requires?</P>
      <P>I think it is altogether too narrow a view and while, as I say, I know it is hardly worth while trying to change broad Government policy in this respect, it is no harm to comment upon it.  Indeed, the question is whether it is broad Government policy or broad Civil Service policy, whether heads of Departments over the years have convinced Ministers of State that this was the proper view and that the introduction of members of the Dáil and Seanad into various State-run institutions would interfere with the introduction of larger numbers of civil servants, or in fact bring the sort of view which all politicians bring to bear on those subjects in conflict with what the politicians know as the stereotyped view.</P>

      <P>I put this amendment in not in the hope of getting it through now but in the hope that perhaps in three or four years' time, we may achieve its objective. Neither the Dublin Institute for <Col N="896" /> Advanced Studies nor the Agricultural Institute has this obnoxious clause.  I might say that as far as this Industrial Research and Standards Institute is concerned a potentially valuable member could be Deputy de Valera who knows an immense amount about this and who could make a first-class contribution, but he is excluded.</P>

There might be a desire on the part of members of this House and of Dáil Éireann to become members and if you had a weak Government unable to resist pressure that could be dangerous.  In our desire to appear right rather than to be right&mdash; as in the saying that justice must appear to be done&mdash;we may prevent the valuable services of a few being given, people who would have a very valuable contribution to make.  It would be a pity in the long run that that should happen but if it is to be decided, it is a matter for a motion and not an amendment in this House and Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>The Senator is not quite correct in his view on the laws of the National Farmers Association. The position is that no office above county office can be held by a member of the Oireachtas.  There is a point which I might address to Senator Sheridan, that is, that if one is a member of an association, it is not necessary that one should agree with every &ldquo;t&rdquo; crossed or every &ldquo;i&rdquo; dotted in the rules and regulations of that association.  No one member could possibly agree with everything because that would obviously constitute a slavish approach which is so evident in certain other associations.</P>

      <P>In subsection (3) (a), page 7, lines 4 and 5, to delete &ldquo;stand seconded from such employment&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;obtain the necessary leave of absence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This again is another sacred cow and I do not expect to rout the cow at this stage but it may start the thinking process. It is concerned with the fact that any employee of this Board, if he becomes a member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, must stand seconded from such employment.  What a prospect to offer anybody!  This Board is to have the best talent, presumably, paying salaries in the order of £1,000 or £2,000 and they are to be seconded to take their chances for five years in <Col N="898" /> Dáil Éireann at a salary of £1,000, of which £500 is expenses; or to be seconded to come to Seanad Éireann, at £375 after providing for allowances.  In other words, Dáil and Seanad Éireann are closed to the professional classes, apart from lawyers who are more or less self-employed and can carry on business and still be members of either House.  Teachers to a minor extent can do the same because they can employ substitutes and get the difference in salary between what they pay the substitute and what they get themselves as teachers.  Similarly, a few medical men have scrambled in in the same way.</P>
    <P>It is about time we faced the fact that we are excluding from membership of the Oireachtas a large and responsible section of the people, the professional classes.  In many ways, that may be the reason there is so much, shall we say, derision about, or such a poor opinion of, members of the Dáil and Seanad.  Those classes feel they are excluded and, in turn, treat the institutions that exclude them with contempt.  That is why professional classes are not playing a greater rôle in the life of this country.  Simply because they are debarred, we have a type of political apartheid that excludes the cream of our people from membership.</P>

If there is a difference in salary between what they receive from the central Government and their allowance as members of Parliament, it is made up by the State body or private body for which they work.  In other words, a family should not be penalised solely because the head of the family decides to answer the call and serve in the Parliament of the country.  In the hope of striking a blow then for the emancipation of the segregated professorial classes, I move that the words <Col N="899" />&ldquo;stand seconded from such appointment&rdquo; be replaced by the words &ldquo;obtain the necessary leave of absence.&rdquo;  The other amendments are consequential.</P>

Civil servants cannot engage in politics. Members of local authorities and members of semi-Government boards cannot engage in politics.</P>
      <P>There is, I think, an obvious reason they should not.  It would not be a proper thing for an officer or servant of this Board carrying out the work of the Board itself to become a member of the Oireachtas.  I do not think that in any country in the world you will find permission for public servants, such as civil servants, local authority employees or officers or servants of semi-Government bodies, to engage in politics.  I know that on the face of it that is a fault of our democracy but it is a fault that for obvious reasons must be there.  It is a fault that is to be found in every democratic country all over the world.  I think this amendment would not just be possible.</P>

      <P>Section 13 is someing in the nature of a repeat of a section in a Bill relating to the E.S.B. passed in 1957 or 1958.  It was the first step in the liberalisation of the bans that were imposed on officers and servants of semi-State bodies with regard to their becoming members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Transport and Power and Senator Donegan have certain views on this matter.  It is pleasant to see a coincidence of views on different sides of the House from time to time; it is refreshing to see that happen.  We had Senator O'Reilly agreeing on something this evening as well with Senator Donegan.  Senator Donegan appears to be a most agreeable person by all accounts.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that officers and servants of boards should not be members of the Oireachtas and that that has always been so.  That, he said, was the view of himself, his colleagues and his predecessors.  I can recall a time when a politician was not able to put his foot inside the Department of Finance to advocate any matter on behalf of civil servants.  That was a sacred principle in all Governments.  It held out until 1948.  Then the political representative put his foot inside the Department of Finance and the building did not collapse.  The work of the Department proceeded unhindered. Then they set up a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  When the scheme was operated, democarcy continued to function more effectively and efficiently by reason of the introduction of that form of liberalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, we have this ban upon entry into the Dáil or Seanad of members of semi-State bodies.  The Minister does not hold out any hope of a situation in which there can be any liberalisation of any kind in this regard.  He has great admiration for what goes on in Great Britain.  He <Col N="901" /> spends his time, judging from his announcements, digesting many of the publications issued from Great Britain.  I am quite certain that the Minister must be aware that Great Britain, which commands his unbounded admiration in many respects, has actually gone the distance of enabling certain classes of civil servants to become members of the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>That might appeal to the Minister for Transport and Power.  He may be able to persuade his colleagues that the British Empire, or what is left of it still, is not disturbed because of the presence in the Parliament of people who are seconded civil servants of the British Government.  In this country, you will find that officers and servants of local authorities are members of the Oireachtas.  I think we had even a member of the Dublin Corporation staff a member of this House at one stage.  That did not upset the Dublin Corporation and it did not upset this House.</P>
    <P>The chief medical officers of health in various counties were members of Dáil Éireann and they functioned effectively as such members.  I believe they discharged, when free to do so, the functions of their office as chief medical officer of health.  Dispensary doctors, remunerated out of public funds and also employees of local authorities, were members of the Oireachtas.  It has not caused any great crack in the constitutional structure of this State that such people have been members.  In fact, it is quite a good thing to have a doctor in the house from time to time.</P>
    <P>We have teachers.  There was a time in this country when it was not licit for a national teacher to attend a political meeting in public.  Teachers were dismissed by the Board of Education in the 1900s because they dared to be present at a political gathering.  Eventually, the Secretary of State, or whatever he was called, at the time here, got wise to things and permitted teachers and teachers are now members of Dáil Éireann. However, there was a time when people held the same rigid, obsolete view as the Minister for Transport and Power on this matter.</P>

In face of all that, how can the Minister justify the exclusion, because that is what this section amounts to, of a messenger who attends upon people, say, in the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards from membership of Dáil Éireann?  What is the justification for that?</P>
      <P>Is it not the height of nonsense to insert this lengthy section, consisting of two pages, a provision prohibiting a messenger or a cleaner or a fire lighter who is a servant, obtaining wages from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, from becoming a member of Dáil Éireann, if he is able to?  How would it affect the operations of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards if the fire lighter became a member of the Oireachtas?  Indeed, how would it upset the constitutional position or the work of either House of the Oireachtas if such a person became a member of the Oireachtas?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> In subsection (2) to delete paragraph (a).</P>
    <P>Section 34 deals with the appointments of officers and servants and says they shall be appointed by means of a public competition except in the case of an office for which, in the opinion of the Board, specialised qualifications not commonly held are required.  That clause is absolutely dynamite.  It is interesting to trace the history of this piece of legislation.  It raised its horny head first in the Broadcasting Authority Bill.  Everything was clear and straight in the Agricultural Institute Bill which said:</P>
    <P>Before making an appointment to an office on the research staff of the Institute,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and here we are dealing with research staff</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Council shall appoint a board, composed of persons who, in the opinion of the Council, are suitable and competent for the purpose, to examine the applications, and to recommend a person for appointment to the office and the Council shall consider the recommendation of the board.</P>
    <P>The first breach made in that was in the Broadcasting Authority Bill and we fought it very hard, but the excuse given was: &ldquo;You know those musicians are tempermental and if they were told they must undergo a public competition, they simply would not do it.&rdquo;</P>

It went through by a couple of votes when the whip was cracked.  The idea of people being temperamental is now being applied to scientists.  This almost negatives the idea of advertising or competition.  This is the very thing for which we are being pilloried in the university.  In point of fact, our appointments are done in four stages, in the full glare of the public and every stage is seen and discussed. <Col N="906" /> It is the fairest way and it gets the best results of any appointment system in this country.  I am anxious to see it being changed because it takes too much time to achieve the results, but when a public body is to be blanketed with a statement like this it can do what it likes.</P>
      <P>Why was that not in the Agricultural Institute Bill?  Surely they are making appointments every day of people holding qualifications not commonly held?  Why has it to become necessary to do this in the two years since we passed the Agricultural Institute Bill?  I want to appeal to the Minister to consider this very carefully for Report Stage and to remove this provision.  If university professorships have to be advertised fully and openly, why should not all positions in this new Institute be treated the same way?</P>

      <P>I think Senator Quinlan is right.  I remember the previous instance and I thought he was right then also.  The first subsection of Section 34 lays it down clearly that the Institute shall appoint such and so many persons to be officers and servants of the Institute as the Institute from time to time thinks proper, but, subject to subsection (2), a person shall not be appointed under this section to be an officer of the Institute unless he has been selected by means of a public competition.</P>
      <P>The first subsection contains a principle to which we all subscribe and it is admirable, but subsection (2) contains a paragraph which gives exemption from the provisions of that first subsection in certain circumstances.  It says that &ldquo;the requirement under subsection (1) of this section of being selected by means of a public competition shall not apply in relation to...&rdquo; and then we have this paragraph which Senator Quinlan wants to see deleted, that public competitions shall not apply for offices which, in the opinion of the Board, require specialised qualifications which are not commonly held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that if these qualifications for a particular job are so uncommon that when you advertise the competition and get only one candidate, then in that case there will be no competition anyway and therefore the provisions <Col N="907" /> of this paragraph will be met.  If, on the other hand, when you advertise, there are only two candidates, then a competition in these circumstances is a valuable thing.  Consequently, to remove the necessity for the competition is highly dangerous, particularly when you leave it to the opinion of the Board to decide whether or not qualifications are commonly held.</P>
    <P>I would not see any disadvantage in holding public competitions as well, although the qualifications be rare. Even for the sake of the successful candidate, it is better to say: &ldquo;I applied for this position which was publicly advertised and anybody in the same field was free to apply.  The fact that there was no other candidate is not my fault.&rdquo;  But if you say: &ldquo;This is a specialised position in the opinion of the Board and we are going to appoint anybody without a competition,&rdquo; then you are leaving the Board open to the accusation of jobbery. That does not mean that would be the case but you are leaving the door open for that accusation.  I do not see what harm it can do to insist on public competitions in the terms of subsection (1) even for those positions where the qualifications are not very common. Therefore, I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a strange section and the amendment seems to be well warranted, particularly in view of our experience.  We have in this country a body which bears some resemblance to this Institute.  It is called the Economic Research Institute.  It might be thought that is a public body having no connection with the Oireachtas but I notice it is a body to which we propose in the present Estimates to subscribe £6,500.  I do not know what the charter of the Economic Research Institute is but it is perfectly clear that they did not advertise their positions for public competition in this country, because according to a motion on the Order Paper, we find that, with the sole exception of the director, the rest of the staff have been recruited everywhere except in Ireland.  Obviously, people in the Economic Research Institute are all of this ilk, that they have specialised qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> I do not understand why it is not provided in the Bill that people with all classes of qualifications shall be sought after by public advertisement and from public competition.  There can always be a proviso that if, after advertising&mdash;as has happened in connection with appointments in the Civil Service&mdash;it is not possible to get persons of the requisite standard of qualification, then you can resort to another exceptional method.  It should be resorted to only after a public competition has been unsuccessfully held.</P>
    <P>Section 34 (2) (a) says:</P>
    <P>The requirement under subsection (1) of this section of being selected by means of a public competition shall not apply in relation to&mdash;</P>
    <P>an office for which, in the opinion of the Board, specialised qualifications not commonly held are required.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the justification for that.  The Minister may say that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards has been unable in its 14 years existence to get adequate staffing of the kind it requires.  That is so.  We know from the fourteenth annual report of the Institute that the difficulty in recruiting suitable technical staff still persisted as of 31st March, 1960, but the reason was not any lack of suitable material.  That was not the reason assigned by the Institute in its report but the unattractiveness of the salary rates and prospects offered by the Institute.</P>
    <P>No amount of public competition will bring into the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards people of the required calibre unless proper rates are offered to them.  It is no justification for the Minister to say there will be difficulty and that is the only way of offering people particular appointments who are known to be interested in this kind of work and that that is the way it will be got round.  I believe the best way is by publicly advertising these appointments at suitably attractive rates of salary. Having done that, if it does not succeed, it would be possible to make provision in this section for the making <Col N="909" /> of appointments analogous to appointments in the public interest made by the Government under the Civil Service regulations.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) indicates an attempt to be fair.  Subparagraph (a) undoubtedly specifies that an appointment can be made without public advertisement because of some qualification not commonly held. I do not know what such a qualification could be.  How many people in this country are versed in radioactivity? Perhaps, the Cork Senator could tell us something about what special qualifications are necessary. Apparently, there must be some idea in the mind of the Minister and the draftsmen but subparagraphs (b) and (c) seem to be an attempt to be fair. Subparagraph (b) says the appointment can be made temporarily for two years but subparagraph (c) debars such a person from a permanent appointment. We could criticise the fact that if a person were to be appointed temporarily for two years and would then not be capable of being an applicant for a permanent appointment, we would be paving the way for sharp practices.  The whole of subsection (2) seems to me to be an attempt at being fair, except for the point made by the Senators opposite. There are these specialised qualifications. I am just wondering what the specialised qualifications would be in a case like this.  I assume it would not be there, if it were not necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister inserted subsection (2) (a) with this in view.  First of all, it would hardly ever be taken advantage of by the Board because it is quite clear that the Board will be expected to appoint officers and servants in the ordinary way by public competition but there are cases, known to all of us, which arise from time to time where some expert in possibly some very obscure scientific subject, which is, nevertheless, of vital importance to the Institute, comes suddenly free for one reason or another and where it is desirable to appoint him quickly without holding a public competition.</P>
      <P>There are other people of whom I had experience myself&mdash;I refer to private companies; I admit it is not quite the same thing&mdash;who are absolutely first-class but who for some strange reason, refuse to go up for the competition.  When I discussed this matter with the Minister, he did not feel that subsection (2) (a) should be used as an escape route at all.  When he appoints the members of the Board and when he addresses them at the first meeting, I am quite sure he will make it quite clear.  This is not an escape route for nepotism or for the appointment of people who are friends of the Board.  When they use the term &ldquo;specialised&rdquo;, it means some really specialised qualification.</P>
      <P>For example, it does not mean that because you cannot get an ordinary electrical engineer, of whom there are thousands, because you cannot find one immediately, you will appoint an individual.  He would not be regarded as a person having specialised qualifications, even though electrical engineering is practised only by a tiny minority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have expressed to the House the Minister's feelings about this.  He does not intend it to be used as an escape route; it is to be used only on a rare occasion.  I know friends who had experience of making appointments in <Col N="911" /> public companies which are not State companies but which by virtue of their position in the community and their reputation, have to observe the same rules in regard to their behaviour as State companies observe.  Really big companies whose reputation is very high particularly in the making of appointments have been forced to take action on the lines of this subsection. I think the Minister put the section in with that in view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to convey the feelings of this House to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He may be able to get him to change his mind on this section.  First of all, I found that over the past 20 years in making appointments to professorial posts, we are lucky if we have two or three candidates. I hold that all professorial posts are posts for which specialised qualifications not commonly held are required.  I take it that any educationist or research worker will agree with me on that definition.  We have our experience of the past that where we get at most, two or three applicants we feel we have done very well.  Therefore, I take it the Minister would not look with favour on the university if it suddenly decided to designate all professorships as posts for which specialised qualifications are required and need not be advertised.  I suggest that in any of these bodies, the further he keeps away from the <i>prima donnas</i>, the better.  He will be far better off without them.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to grab experts quickly.  You can make quick appointments. It may take two months by means of a public competition but then, under subparagraph (b) of subsection (2) of Section 34 you have the escape clause which says you can make an appointment for a limited period of two years for any post and a permanent appointment can be made any time within that period.  Therefore, I do not see any reason for that, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is very bad to legislate and then to tell the group: &ldquo;You must not use this.&rdquo;  Maybe the Minister will tell that to the first Board but how about <Col N="912" /> subsequent Boards?  They will not have the benefit of the Minister's interpretation of the statute.  In any case, his interpretation of the statute is not worth the paper it is written on.  Once the statute leaves this House, it is that that counts.</P>
    <P>I would draw attention to paragraph (c) of subsection (2) which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>an appointment consisting of the promotion of a person who is already an officer of the Institute, other than an officer holding an office to which paragraph (b) of this subsection relates.</P>
    <P>It is regarded here as perfectly normal that an appointment dealing with a promotion need not be advertised. In a university, we must regard professorships as promotions for cetrain lectureships.  Consequently, there would be no need to advertise that. The lecturer could automatically be promoted.  Therefore, in regard to public appointments, those in glasshouses should not throw stones at the university.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could end the discussion by saying I shall draw the attention of the Minister to subsection (2) (a).  In view of what has been said, I shall ask him to examine the effect of this section if, for example, it turns out that for people even with relatively specialised knowledge there are so few applying that the Board might get into the habit of avoiding competitions.  In other words, the subsection might be used wrongly simply because of events in relation to the number of persons available for any particular appointment.  These events might show so few were coming along that one might as well appoint them all in that way.  Therefore, it might be safer to reconsider this subsection.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this subsection, a Minister may designate any office in the service of the Institute as an office of special responsibility.  This is one of the few points queried in the other House.  The answer given by the Minister was that this was necessary for a type of loose salary control.  To my mind this seems to be using a sledge-hammer to kill a flea.  Surely the Minister, being responsible for the Vote for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards in the Dáil, receives submissions from the Institute as to its requirements for the following year, its budget, and so on?  If the Institute is paying extravagant salaries, and so on, surely the Minister has his remedy there?  This is merely designating an office and it seems to be a completely roundabout way of achieving that. Again, it could leave itself open to <Col N="914" /> much abuse.  We need not go into that.  There is no point in inserting clauses which have almost no application and which will rarely, if ever, be used to achieve something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel Senator Quinlan's amendment should be supported.  Subsection (3) of Section 34 is quite clearly admirable:</P>
      <P>The Institute shall from time to time determine the numbers, grades, remuneration, tenure of office, and conditions of service of the members of the staff of the Institute.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan is moving to have subsection (4) deleted.  As he pointed out, it enables the Minister, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (3), to say that a certain post shall be one of special responsibility and shall carry whatever salary the Minister likes.</P>
      <P>In educational circles in Britain, in secondary schools, it is often found necessary, in order to hold a teacher of mathematics or science, to appoint him to a rather fictitious post of special responsibility which is really a roundabout way of giving him a bonus of £100 a year.  I do not like to see a subsection in this Bill which might easily be used as a roundabout way of giving a bonus to a special person.  I would accept the Minister's assurances that there is no such intention but I do not feel that is a sufficient justification. for the retention of the subsection.  I am afraid that if the power is given, it may be used.  I do not feel it is a good subsection.  Therefore, I support Senator Quinlan on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the purpose of this subsection is to enable the Minister, when the new Institute commences its administration, to ensure that, say, the two highest officers in the Institute are not paid salaries either higher or lower than those paid for comparable work in other State companies, after making allowances for whatever particularly distinguishes the work in the Institute.  When there are a great number of State companies, it is always desirable, if possible, to have some sort of comparable salary <Col N="915" /> structure at the very highest levels, the others being determined, generally, by negotiations between the associations representing the employees and the directors themselves, but in the case of the higher officers, it is desirable to have some comparable figure to work on.  Obviously, allowances have to be made in relation to the particular company and its objectives.  That is the purpose of this and I think it is a reasonable one.</P>

      <P>I should like to say something about what the Minister has just said and with which I should like to agree.  If the purpose of this section is to enable people with higher qualifications to be attracted to our services, whatever they may be, by paying them proper salaries, it is very commendable and very desirable. Undoubtedly, in many of our organisations, especially academic or cultural organisations, such as museums and galleries, we are not putting up the proper salaries or the proper conditions to attract men of higher qualifications or higher specialised qualifications.  I should like to stand up tonight to say that not only in connection with this Institute but many of our other institutions.  If the section does not achieve that object, I should like to see some section being put into other Bills which will enable Ministers to have salaries and conditions instituted in the future which will attract the people with these qualifications we so badly need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I am not at all convinced by the specious argument made by the Minister in justification of the incorporation of this subsection.  The Minister's argument briefly is that its purpose is to enable the Minister to ensure that certain higher officers in this company will be paid salaries which will not be out of line with salaries of corresponding officers in corresponding employment in other semi-State companies.  That would be all right if we knew what was meant by &ldquo;offices of special responsibility&rdquo;. If the Minister indicates two offices for which it is desired <Col N="916" /> to control the salary, there is no reason why that cannot be set down in black and white, that in regard to the director and whoever else is to be the other officer, the salary shall be fixed from time to time by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It could be left at that.</P>
      <P>This is a much more sweeping subsection to enable the Minister to achieve parity with the salaries of employees in various other State bodies. It says &ldquo;notwithstanding any other provision in this section,&rdquo; and &ldquo;any other provision in this section&rdquo; is a requirement that every person appointed shall have a competent knowledge of Irish.  Why is it that the persons who are to be appointed to the two highest positions will not be required to have a competent knowledge of Irish, whereas every other person to be appointed without exception, whether he has specialised qualifications or not, must have a competent knowledge of Irish?  I should like to know the reason for that.</P>

      <P>Reading through the Dáil Reports, it can be seen that the main puprpose of the section was to ensure that those employed by the Institute were not paid higher salaries than those in other institutions.  I do not think the idea is as Senator McGuire believes, of making the Institute pay proper salaries.  It is to keep them in line and make sure they do not pay too much.  If the Minister wanted to control the top salaries, and that is reasonable enough, it should be possible to draft the section in a certain way, that the salary of the chief officer shall be fixed in consultation with the Minister.  If the chief officer is getting so much, the other salaries will fall into line accordingly. Certainly the Board cannot go very far when it has to come, cap in hand, to the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="917" /> and then to the Minister for Finance to get allowances every year. I appeal to the Minister in the interests of clear drafting to see that this section is deleted altogether.</P>

      <P>Might I point out that the subsection as it is phrased provides for far more power than would be necessary to do the things the Minister said were intended because paragraph (a) says that the Minister may designate any office in the service of the Institute as an office of special responsibility?  &ldquo;Any office&rdquo;&mdash;that could mean the chief bottlewasher, or the head charwoman, and if you link that with paragraph (c), the Minister is given the right to decide the remuneration, tenure of office and conditions of service of persons appointed to offices so designated. That is asking for very sweeping powers, far more sweeping than are necessary for the requirements mentioned by the Minister.  I feel a redrafting of this along much narrower lines would give us a more acceptable subsection and I appeal to the Minister to think about it before Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The first part of subsection (5) provides that all persons appointed to the clerical grade shall possess a competent knowledge of Irish and I agree with that.  Then it says: &ldquo;In making appointments to the other posts preference shall be given to persons possessing a competent knowledge of Irish.&rdquo;  As far as scientific work is concerned, a competent knowledge of French, German <Col N="918" /> or Russian is far more relevant than a competent knowledge of Irish.  I should expect that, in making an appointment, the Board would have a scale of marking and would allow so many bonus marks for a knowledge of French and German.  I have no objection to allowing probably the same number of bonus marks as would be given for French and German to a competent knowledge of Irish.  I am worried whether the section might be used to exclude candidates from competing for the posts.  In other words, is it the intention that there should be a qualifying examination in Irish first and then the competitors will then have to be selected from those who qualified or will certain bonus marks be given?</P>

One is that nobody should be appointed to the clerical staff without a competent knowledge of Irish. The other part says that preference will be given to a person who, in the opinion of the Board, has a competent knowledge of Irish.  There is no section which says that the members of the Board shall have a competent knowledge of Irish.  It is quite possible that not one of them will have a single word of Irish.  Therefore, their opinion as to whether a man has a competent knowledge of Irish or not may be absolutely worthless.</P>

      <P>In my opinion, this whole business is the height of hypocrisy. I do not believe that all these provisions put into Bills will do one thing for the Irish language.  They do nothing for it except to repel the people who might be in the forefront of the drive to restore Irish at least as a second spoken language of this country.  The educated people and people who should be in the forefront of that drive are completely repelled by this compulsory provision for appointments of all kinds.</P>

      <P>It is the height of hypocrisy in view of the fact that we have been debating this Bill all day in English to insist that clerical officers should have a competent knowledge of Irish and that persons in other grades should get the job if their knowledge of Irish is better than that of somebody else.  Everybody who has been to a secondary school knows of the boy or girl who was bright at mathematics and poor at languages. Indeed, that boy or girl could be of great use to the Institute.  He or she could bring this Institute in its research activities to a discovery which might employ many hundreds of people in this country, but they, as always, are to be excluded because they are bad at languages.  It is just a matter of &ldquo;Wrap the Green Flag round me, Boys&rdquo;.  We want people to work and do away with the sort of hypocrisy epitomised in this section.</P>
      <P>I well know the answer I will get from Senators opposite.  They will say I am demeaning the language.  I am not.  I think I have some commonsense. I can stand in this House and say that the Minister himself cannot speak the Irish language.  In putting through a piece of legislation, he is seeing to it that young boys and girls who are bad at languages will not have an opportunity of serving their country as clerical or higher officers in the Institute.</P>

The plain fact of the matter is that we established under the Charities Bill a body to be known as the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  We formed them into a Board and made them a body corporate with power to sue and be sued, and all the other incidentals and attributes of bodies corporate.  Then we provided staff.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice, who is said by the Minister for Justice to be a legal expert, assured this House that although this independent body was being established under the Charities Bill, not answerable to anybody, it was unnecessary to put in provisions relating to superannuation because the Superannuation Acts would apply to it. Can the Minister for Transport and Power give us any good reason for the insertion of this provision here? I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice is correct but if he is correct, why is this provision here, apart from the reason that it is common form?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 45, to delete &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;applied&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is rather a minor amendment but I think it is necessary to enlarge the scope in relation to grants which may <Col N="924" /> be given for the training of persons in applied research.  &ldquo;Industrial research&rdquo; is far too narrow a term here. I think it would be well worth while to broaden it slightly and make it &ldquo;applied research&rdquo;.  It provides more scope to the Council of the Institute to give certain scholarships for the training of young scientists who, one day, will be working in industrial research but whose training is more general at the scholarship stage and who are studying for an advanced degree, M.Sc. or Ph.D.  You could not call that industrial research in any strict sense.</P>
    <P>The Institute would be very well advised to assist such students, just as the Agricultural Institute has set a very admirable headline by giving scholarships to young students to carry out post-graduate studies in fields that seem to be rather remotely connected with agriculture, like statistics and the purer forms of research work.  The idea is that the Institute wishes to have a supply of these people available for staffing the Agricultural Institute later on.  In the same way, this Institute can contribute by scholarships to the general post-graduate training of students who afterwards, we hope, will play a strong role in industrial research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to consider this matter but for the opposite reason to that expressed by Senator Quinlan.  The fact is that it is applied research with which this body will be concerned.  For example, industrial research might include the work being done by An Foras Talúntais, or the Economic Research Institute, or indeed any other body.  The word covers a wide variety of things and I think the Minister should accept this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has made up his mind.  The Long Title states that it is to promote industrial research and the Minister is advised, and I agree with him, that if <Col N="925" /> we use the phrase &ldquo;applied research&rdquo; it would cover, in addition to the industrial sphere, research work of all kinds, agricultural, medical, social and even political research.  I do not think it was ever intended that the Institute should become involved in any research outside the industrial field.  I think it is also true to say that industrial research relating to inventions shall form part of the industrial research and standardisation of commodities.  That can be either applied or pure research. It is quite clear from the rest of the Bill that the Board's power will be fairly wide in regard to engaging in the exploitation of inventions or discovering new processes.  I do not think anybody need be worried by the term &ldquo;industrial research.&rdquo;  It is sufficiently wide to be satisfactory while the term &ldquo;applied research&rdquo; would go beyond industrial research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is really wanted here is research into the scientific problems of industry.  That is the phrase that is wanted.  &ldquo;Industrial research&rdquo; is too indefinite a term in my view, if we really want to be accurate.  The fact that it is in the Long Title is different from its being in the section.  It is a matter of research into the scientific problems of industry and not research into works study or the financial problems of industry or the various other problems arising in industry.  This Bill is concerned with the scientific side of industry. It is no harm to be precise and accurate when these things are being drafted.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to see the grants narrowed unduly because it says here &ldquo;undertaking research of a kind which the Institute is itself authorised to undertake.&rdquo;  The Institute is very much tied down to routine research and the lower realm of applied research.  If that were the case, the Institute could not give research grants or assistance to higher applied research, and without higher applied research, the Institute is doomed to failure.  If that half-sentence could be research, and, without higher applied discretion of the Board, it would be better.  The Board being largely staffed with those who have been appointed because they can make a contribution to industrial research, it can be taken that they will not give away money unnecessarily or to research which will not pay off in the industrial field.  I would ask the Minister to consider widening the scope of this subsection.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;( ) A comprehensive summary report of the work of the Institute shall be prepared every five years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is provision for a customary yearly report.  We get so many of these reports flooding in upon us that we really ignore them.  It is rarely we see a debate taking place in the House based on these reports, apart from the debate on C.I.E. in March last.  It would be well worth while in respect of all statutory bodies like the Institute if we had a five-yearly report which then would be a completed affair.  It would be one which either the Dáil or Seanad, or both, might very properly take some time to debate.  There is such a provision, I believe, in the Institute for Advanced Studies, where they have to prepare a ten-yearly report.  It provides that where ordinary members were not in a position to check up every year, their members would value receiving a five-yearly report.  They would be able to see how the Institute was progressing.</P>

      <P>I think it will be sufficient if the Institute provides an annual report.  It is quite possible to read a succession of annual reports in order to see what progress is being made over a period of two years.  In respect to matters where it is considered desirable, both private companies and statutory companies give statistics relating to some years back in any one annual report.  I have no doubt this Institute <Col N="928" /> will refer back to the report of previous years wherever it is desirable to show some particular progress made. The Senator is going far beyond reason in asking for this as a section in a Bill. There is nothing to prevent the Institute, if it so wishes, to provide an annual report of some kind for the sake of showing the trend in relation to some particular research by issuing a paper about it.  There is nothing to prevent it doing that.</P>

      <P>I have wide experience of writing reports and I can assure the Minister that it is far easier to have a report covering a long period than a short period.  In the year, you will have projects unfinished and you will have other projects which are just finishing from the previous year and so on.  In regard to any research effort, you have really got to look at it from the point of view of a reasonable span of time in order to get some gauge of what has been happening.  A five-yearly report would not just be five annual reports simply taken together.  It would be a comprehensive summary of the really big things that happened in that period.  It is far different from a C.I.E. report, which is a mass of statistics. The amount of statistics we can produce out of a research institute is infinitesimal.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1) For the purpose of promoting the safe use by the public of a commodity intended for sale to the public (or for incorporation in any other commodity intended for such sale) the Minister may, by an order under this section, declare that it shall be unlawful to manufacture, assemble or sell that commodity unless it complies with the standard specification declared by the Institute for that commodity or with a specification or standard of quality prescribed by a Minister of State or with any condition specified in such order which the Minister considers necessary or desirable.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is an official Government amendment to make it clear that in cases where a Minister uses his power to insist that a commodity complies with a standard specification, he should only do this in the interest of public safety and that it goes beyond the previous definition of &ldquo;in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think this is an amendment where the Government are reducing the scope of the section.  I do not know whether it is a good thing or not.  There might be many cases where <Col N="930" /> it would not be in the interests of public safety that it should be unlawful to manufacture articles but it might be in the public interest that these articles might not be manufactured.  They might be frauds.  I feel such articles should not be put on the market. Perhaps the Minister is unwise in reducing the scope of this section.</P>

      <P>This section appears to be the only worthwhile part of the Bill.  It is the only section under which the fruits of this Institute will come home to the public at large.  Under the other sections of the Bill, standards can be set and they can remain there like model standards which will never be attained.</P>
      <P>This vests in the Minister power to prohibit the manufacture of some commodities which do not conform with the standard set in the interests of public safety.  I take the view that Senator Donegan takes, that this amendment does not widen the powers of the Minister.  I think it reduces or narrows the powers of the Minister to commodities which might, in their use, be a danger to the public.</P>
      <P>I should have thought that where the Minister was satisfied it was in the public interest to make orders because too low a standard was being achieved by manufacturers of these types of commodities and, apart altogether from the question of safety and value for money and, on the question of value for money, under the section as it stood he could say: &ldquo;The public are not getting a commodity of a particular standard; I shall fix a standard and it will be unlawful for people to manufacture commodities which do not reach that standard.&rdquo;  I do not favour the amendment.  I would much prefer the section as it stood.</P>

      <P>Take concrete blocks. If it means there is no responsibility to have some standard in, say, the manufacture of concrete blocks, it might be argued that they could ultimately add up to danger.  Suppose people were to make concrete blocks from sand and water and a twenty to one shake of cement.  Somebody who pretended to be uninitiated asked what was the &ldquo;one&rdquo; for.  If the whittling down of responsibility, as I regard it, should add up to that sort of thing, I do not think it would be good.  I should like to feel that, if it should add up to some difficulty in the future, the Minister for Industry and Commerce would mend the matter.  I can see certain dangers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never intended when this Bill was drafted that this section should extend to anything except protecting the public from something that was unsafe.  If the Minister were to extend his power and engage in prescribing compulsory standards in regard to a great number of goods, he would require an army of officials for inspection purposes.  It would be quite beyond possibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister.  There are many commodities for which at the moment there are many sets of standards.  Take whiskey.  Take a publican who &ldquo;racks&rdquo; whiskey, as they call it, who adds distilled water to whiskey, who adds it until the whiskey has deteriorated in gravity to a certain set figure&mdash; in this country at the moment 33 per cent. under proof: it is unlawful to do anything else.  That publican, in my view, is in no less preferential position than the manufacturer except that <Col N="932" /> if he is watering the whiskey, his customers will know it, whereas if the manufacturer is not including the proper percentage of wool or nylon in a garment and puts in a cheaper material, if there is a general deterioration by manufacturers in the country, housewives or persons who wear these articles will not know in fact that they are receiving an article of low quality.</P>
      <P>I feel that the keeping up of the standards of manufactured goods in this country is most important and that the full work of this Institute would include the keeping up of those standards.  More important still, so long as we have the things that were mentioned tonight and were out of order, tariff walls&mdash;have it any way you like, whether good or bad; I know they are accepted in every country in the world and therefore there is no point in debating whether or not they should be there&mdash;the consumer is entitled to be protected just as surely as the consumer of whiskey is protected at present.</P>
      <P>If the Minister says it was never intended, then I must wonder.  This Bill has now reached the semi-final stage on its way through the Seanad and a trip back to the Dáil does not mean very much.  At this stage it could very well be said&mdash;I will not say it&mdash;that the Government are slithering in an amendment whereby the whole arbitrary power, whatever it might be, of this Institute is being nullified.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly mentions concrete blocks.  It is one particular commodity that comes to mind immediately.  I remember well an engineer who is now a priest.  He went to a site where they were building 150 houses.  His test was simple.  He took up a concrete block to the height of his shoulders and dropped it to the ground.  If it broke, he condemned the lot.  That was a simple test.  You could test thousands of concrete blocks.  In this country, just as in every country, things are becoming standardised.  You have the large unit of production.  As months and years go by, you will have larger units of production and a smaller number of factories to produce the same quantity of finished goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> Now that we have the Factories Act, now that we have the Register of Manufacturers and now that we have all those regularised Government agencies, we should have no difficulty in seeing to it that the standard of manufactured goods at least in this country is kept up to the level to which it should be kept.  I feel that this amendment does nullify all the good work we hoped for from the future Institute and the existing Institute.  I feel it might have to be opposed.</P>

      <P>I would oppose this amendment.  I cannot accept the Minister's statement that this is a mistake in the original draft of the Bill. The title of the Bill is &ldquo;An Act to make better provision for the promotion of industrial research and the standardisation of commodities, processes...&rdquo;. I think the Minister, in introducing this Bill, was very conscious of what he was doing in this section.  There must have been criticism of what he proposed to do and he has now decided to take action and to take the teeth out of the Bill. The only teeth in the Bill are in this section.  I do not agree with an amendment which proposes to take the teeth out of the Bill and simply water it down like the whiskey.</P>

That gives rise to a very big question.  We can put down an amendment on Report Stage and discuss it.  I feel that is what must be done because it must be remembered that this is the first deliberative assembly that has looked at this Bill on the basis of the teeth being drawn from it, as Senator Murphy said. <Col N="934" /> In fact the Institute is being left a largely nebulous organisation which does not try to preserve any real standards.

It is just so much window dressing in a general election year.</P>
      <P>For instance, under subsection (1) the Institute would be permitted to lay down a standard life for electric bulbs. It is well known that the life of electric bulbs is nothing short of scandalous. They go almost as quickly as you put them in.  Irish manufactured bulbs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Under the section as it stands, the Institute could specify for electric light bulbs.  That is desirable. Under the amendment, however, <Col N="935" /> they cannot do that and, in my view, that is a great loss.  It is withdrawing from the Institute and the Minister for Industry and Commerce a power which many people would like them to have and more particularly like them to exercise effectively.  This amendment drains off any use there might otherwise have been in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared carried, Senators Donegan, O'Quigley and Murphy dissenting.</P>
      <P>Government Amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (2) to insert the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister may, if he thinks fit, limit the application of an order made under this section to a commodity intended for sale to the public in any country or countries specified in the order or for incorporation in any other commodity intended for such sale.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment is fairly clear.  It means that the Minister may make an order under the section regarding a commodity intended for sale in any country or countries specified in the order or for incorporation in any other commodity intended for such sale.  Goods exported from this country do not necessarily have to come under the orders because of different rules in the countries to which they are exported and it may be necessary to have different specifications.</P>

      <P>This amendment is tied up with amendment No. 18.  It is quite true, for instance, that if the Institute wish to limit the use of a commodity in its purer form for safety reasons, they might permit the use of the commodity when it is incorporated in another commodity so that this amendment is consequential on the previous amendment, but amendment No. 18 must be challenged on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In lines 43 and 44 to delete &ldquo;with the approval of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to delete these words because it is contrary to established practice that the publication of scientific information should have to have the consent of any political authority.  It might be perfectly legitimate in the case of codes of recommended practice but here we have two different topics tied together, the publication of scientific and technical information on the one hand, and codes of recommended practice, on the other.  I would ask the Minister between this and Report Stage to look at the matter and see if it is possible to segregate them. Perhaps my amendment goes a little too far but I would be quite happy if the Minister could bring in an amendment which would safeguard the publication of scientific and technical information by the Institute from any suspicion of its being subject to any type of political censorship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quinlan has a point here.  Half truths can be more dangerous than anything else.  When taken in conjunction with other facts, they can be no facts at all.  Therefore, in relation to the release of certain information, there is a necessity for a safeguard.  I know perhaps that consumers' organisations might not agree with that.  It is true that it is necessary. At the same time, there is the point emphasised by Senator Quinlan. The Minister should look at the matter again and should remove from himself the power of blanketing information as a result of research.</P>
      <P>Senator Carter was interested in the Soviet Union.  The difference between the Soviet Union and the West is that the Soviet Union keep for themselves all the information and release only that which they wish to release.  On the other hand, the policy of America is to release all useful scientific research data they discover.</P>

      <P>I am quite prepared to.  Documents and information of this kind issued by the Institute would be very similar, I understand, to a standard specification.  It is felt the Minister should have the power to restrain, if he so wishes, publication of scientific information.  I will ask the Minister to consider before Report Stage whether by any chance the term &ldquo;scientific and technical information&rdquo; covers too much ground and whether it is intended to cover information in regard to standard practice and standard specification and whether he thinks that section might be altered. It is quite obvious that the Minister has to keep some control over information which is equivalent to a standard specification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Order is to give the Cork Gas Consumers Company statutory authority to make certain modifications in its capital structure and to alter its practice as regards a number of minor matters incidental to the administration of its affairs.  The main provisions of the Order provide for the increase of the authorised capital of the company from £150,000 to £750,000; the extension of the limit on its borrowing powers from £150,000 to £500,000; the capitalization of the company's undistributed profits by the issue of bonus stock and the extension of the area in which it may supply gas.</P>
      <P>The Cork Gas Consumers Company is a statutory body set up under a private Act and is not subject to the ordinary provisions of company law.  To secure statutory authority to cover the matters referred to, it must seek a special order under Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, which enables me to grant additional powers to the company.  Before the Order is made, it must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Houses of the Oireachtas may, by resolution, approve the draft Order in the form submitted or may approve of it with modifications or additions.  When such approval is given I may make the Order in the form in which it has been approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an Order which provides, first of all, for the building up of reserves out of profits in the supply and sale of gas in Cork city; secondly, the issue of bonus shares from its reserves; thirdly, an increase in the capital of the company; fourthly, to permit of this hiding of the accounts from the general public; fifthly, a change of the name of the company from the Cork Gas Consumers Company.  I think the latter provision is the only apt one because quite obviously it is not a consumers company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Order does not say that in so many words.  Certainly, those things are not in the order I put them but clearly that is the intension behind the Order. I should like to go through the sections of the Order before us and show that <Col N="939" /> is the case.  The first section is that dealing with the change of name.  It will be permissible for the company, subject to the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to change its name.  There is nothing in that to say that it is quite appropriate to the general intentions behind this Order to change the name of the company from Cork Gas Consumers Company. Certainly it will not be a consumers company, if it ever was such.</P>
    <P>The second section which is relevant is that which provides for the increase in the capital from £150,000 at the moment to £750,000.  Another £604,000 may be created by the company but in paragraph 10 of the Order, there is provision for the capitalisation of the undistributed profits of the company and the distribution of those profits by way of bonus capital in regard to the existing shareholders.  We are not told how much of the £600,000 it is intended to take up by way of a bonus issue or whether it is intended to look for public subscription and widen the basis of ownership of this company.</P>
    <P>Let the Seanad be very clear about this.  We are dealing with a gas company. Parliament has always been very careful to control, in a special way, companies dealing with special essential services.  It does not come under the ordinary company law.  Certain companies, gas companies, waterworks, water companies, when we had them, railway companies, when there were such things as railway companies, came under special control by Parliament. Parliament was right in doing that and made an originating Act for the Cork Gas Consumers Company in 1868.  It could not be set up under the companies law, as such, but by a special Act of Parliament.  Parliament put certain very definite controls on the Cork Gas Consumers Company as well as on other gas consumers companies, waterworks companies, and other undertakings.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we should know what a gas company is doing. When it is proposed that capital should be increased from £150,000 to £750,000 and, furthermore, when it is provided that reserves can be built up out of <Col N="940" /> undistributed profits, profits out of the sale of gas to the consumers, we should look at the matter very carefully.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is exactly the current position but up to recent years the State did control the charges and dividends of gas companies.</P>

      <P>In Dublin, there was an arrangement whereby there was a link between the dividend the Dublin and Alliance Gas Consumers Company could pay to its shareholders and the price of gas.  In other words, if the gas company could reduce its prices to the consumers, could share its efficiency, it could also have its own share by increased dividends to the shareholders. I do not know what the Cork Gas Company pays at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what rate of dividend they pay.  I suppose they pay five per cent. on their present capital of £150,000.  That means they distribute £7,500 annually.  But, if you issue out of accrued profits from the pockets of the ordinary consumers a bonus capital of £600,000, and thereby increase the nominal capital to £750,000, and pay five per cent. on that, you are then, on the real capital of the company, on the paid-up capital of the company, paying a dividend of 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>That may appear nonsense.  Strangely enough, I came across exactly the same&mdash;not such a big dividend&mdash; device by a railway company recently. Yes, a railway company was paying a dividend.  I shall not name it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On first appearance, this railway company appeared to have reduced its dividend to its ordinary shareholders last year.  When I looked at it more closely, I found that the actual money paid out, distributed by way of profit to the shareholders, had increased.  What had happened? <Col N="941" /> Strangely enough, there was no reference to this in the newspapers and no reference in the directors' report.  In the interval, they had issued a bonus by way of accrued profits over the years out of their reserves to their shareholders: they had issued free bonus shares.</P>
      <P>The rate per cent. appeared to have gone down, but, on their previous capital, they were paying about 11 or 12 per cent, which was doing very nicely for a company that was claiming it could not afford to do certain things. I think we should look very closely at this proposal.  The Minister should make a better effort to convince us that it is right for the Oireachtas to release largely from control of Parliament an undertaking like the Cork Gas Consumers Company, a very efficient undertaking, in regard to what they do with the profits they make out of the sale of an essential commodity in Cork city and how they will deal with the capital we are allowing them to create under this Order.</P>
      <P>Section 14 provides for the building up of reserves.  This Parliament has already done something about that.  An Order was made in 1948.  That Order put a limit of £10,000 per annum as the amount which could be put to reserve.  It said in effect: &ldquo;you shall not put to reserve more than £10,000 per annum out of your profits.&rdquo;  Such reserves were to be used not by way of issuing bonus shares to the shareholders but for the redemption of loans, mortgage debenture or other debenture stock.  Now, in the last paragraph of this Order, we are repealing that section of the 1948 Order so as to permit the gas company, without any control, to put whatever it can into reserves and take up any portion of the £600,000 extra capital we are providing for in this Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 19 provides that the accounts of the company need not be published in any newspaper.  Does that not strike anybody as strange?  This is a company supplying an essential commodity. It is nonsense to say they are in competition.  We all know that gas, as such, is regarded by housewives as the favourable way of cooking.  The Minister <Col N="942" /> may shake his head.  If the gas company are in such great difficulties as the Minister might think, or might be led to believe, what is the need to provide for an increase in the capital? What is the need for the withdrawal of the limit, which previously applied to them, £10,000, as the amount to be put into reserve?</P>
    <P>We said previously in effect: &ldquo;You shall not put more than £10,000 per annum to reserve.&rdquo;  Now the Minister wants us to remove any limit to what can be salted away in reserve and issued by way of bonus capital.  I cannot see the sense of providing under this Order that the company need not, in the future, publish any statement of their accounts in any newspaper.</P>
    <P>Again, it is perhaps apt that they should ask for permission to change their name from the Cork Gas Consumers Company.  It is now to be some sort of secret society.  They are not to be bound to publish their report in the newspapers.  I suppose the Minister will say that we can go to the appropriate office and get a copy of their accounts.  We will not oblige them to embarrass themselves by having to say what profits they are making from the sale of gas, or what amount they are putting to reserve, or what bonus capital they are issuing to their shareholders. They are not to be embarrassed at all in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for the adjustment of charges.  The Oireachtas is being asked to give this company, which more and more is to be a private organisation, arbitrary powers to adjust accounts.  The gas company can say: &ldquo;We are going to decide that Mr. A will be charged so much.  We have not had an opportunity to read his meter but arbitrarily we are going to decide his charge will be so much.&rdquo; If the person is away on a fortnight's holidays and if the meter reader cannot read the meter, the gas company are not going to worry.  They are to be given the power to say that the charge is so much and that is that.  They have the backing of Parliament for that.  Under the section there is an alternative in regard to their method of charging.  Presumably, they might <Col N="943" /> contemplate a reduction, or maybe an increase, but if you are away for a fortnight, it does not matter.  They will decide you would have used so many therms, or whatever the description is, even though you are not there and your account will be adjusted accordingly later on.  You might get credit for it but in the meantime the gas company are to be given the power to do it.</P>
    <P>In Section 21, we are providing that the ownership of the meters shall be retained by the company and we are to provide that the company will be indemnified against any damage by way of fire, theft or such eventualities. I am not happy, and I am sure other Senators will not be happy, at the thought that a poor person who has had his meter rifled is to be responsible for the damage.  Surely if the meter is to be the property of the gas company, they should carry the risk involved if there is any damage or if it is destroyed by fire or rifled by a burglar.  Why should the consumer be held responsible?  Surely it is reasonable that when a gas company owns meters, they should provide an insurance charge in their accounts for such risks. It is nonsense and an injustice to provide that the company will be indemnified against any damage to the meters.  The more I examine the Order, the more I wonder who drew it up. Was it the gas company and did they ask the Minister to put it through? Certainly it is drawn up in favour of the gas company without any regard at all for the consumer, the person who will have to pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would <Col N="944" /> want to make a much stronger argument as to why we should agree to this Order.  The next section is Section 22, which I think, to some extent, I confused with Section 21.  Again, there is this provision for the arbitrary estimation of charges by the gas company.  I do not think that is right.  I do not think we should give them the authority to estimate the charge against a particular consumer and to insist on the charge being collected.</P>
      <P>The concluding section in this Order is probably the most important section because it deals with repeals.  The Minister has not told us what is being provided by this section, or given us any explanation as to what is being repealed.  Sections of the 1868 Act are being repealed.  I had some trouble getting that Act but thanks to the assistance of the people downstairs, I did get it.  The first section of that Act which is being repealed provided for the payment of a one-fifth part of the amount of shares before they were allotted to a shareholder.  Of course that needs to be repealed now because of the intention to issue bonus shares for which the shareholder does not pay.  He will get a present of shares.</P>
      <P>Section 58 of the 1868 Act which is also being repealed provides for a limit to the charge the company may make for gas and the rent for a meter.  We are now being asked to agree that the provision in the 1868 Act which provides for a limit to the charge the company may make shall be repealed. I imagine that has been amended at various times since 1868 but apparently the provision still stands and we are being asked to wipe it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paragraph (b) Section 23, we are being asked to revoke certain Articles of the 1948 Order.  The first Article we are asked to revoke is in relation to the borrowing powers.  Section 2 deals with the issue of debentures and provision for an interest payment of four per cent.  That is being repealed.  The third one being repealed is one I have already mentioned, where the 1948 Order says very fully that the gas company cannot put a greater amount than £10,000 per annum out of its profits to reserve and those reserves can be used only for the purpose of <Col N="945" /> the redemption of loans, mortgage debenture or debenture stock.  If my interpretation of the Order is correct, it is sensible that the provisions of the 1868 Act and the Articles of the 1948 Order should be repealed and revoked to permit the company to do what it seems to me in any case it is their intention to do.</P>
    <P>This is a gas company which is not in competition with any other gas company.  There is no control over it. It is a company supplying an essential service, granted, but it is not now perhaps as essential as before the advent of electricity.  But electricity has been with us quite a long time in Cork anyhow. It was there before the E.S.B. as Senator Mrs. Dowdall, I am sure, can confirm but still up to now and as recently as 1948, Parliament thought it desirable to be a control and keep a hand on the company which supplies gas to the consumers in Cork.</P>
    <P>Now we are being asked to let them go ahead and increase their capital and thereby increase the real dividend they will be taking out of the ordinary consumers in Cork and do other things as well.  The dice is to be completely loaded against the consumer.  I would ask the Minister to look at this again. It seems to me that this is drawn up completely in favour of the company. I will not call it a consumers company. It is completely in favour of the company and against the interests of the consumer.  I should like the Minister to look at this Order.  I do not know what procedure we can follow or whether it is possible at a later stage to suggest amendments to it but, as it stands, I am completely against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JaneDowdall" hpid="Mrs. Dowdall Mrs. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry that Senator Murphy interprets this Order in the manner he does.  Usually, he is a very gentle and tolerant person but he talked about the profit making of the Cork Gas Company and became almost bitter as if making profits were immoral.  I can tell the House that the Cork Gas Company is accepted in commercial circles as one of the best run companies in any part of this country.  It has served the people of Cork well.  It has given excellent employment over the years.  It now finds <Col N="946" /> itself in very keen competition with other firms in the matter of heating and cooking.  It is all very well for Senator Murphy to say that using gas is the one way you can really cook well.  Senator Murphy might secure consideration from the gas company if he is prepared to go round the country and say that in the convincing manner he says it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

    <Speaker pid="JaneDowdall" hpid="Mrs. Dowdall Mrs. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may not be bought but it sounded convincing. On the other hand, the Senator says there is no competition.  My family has had connections with this company for many years, practically since its foundation.  I am one of the people who do not think it is immoral to invest in private companies and that the making of profits by these private companies is immoral. I do not agree with that.  The petty socialist attitude of Senator Murphy is to be deplored.  If this company were a semi-Government company and one which borrowed the people's money, perhaps the Senator would like it better.</P>
      <P>This is a company&mdash;I do not think it is generally known&mdash;which has now to change its complete policy in the manufacture of gas and I take it that this money is necessary for that purpose.  I think it is quite wrong of Senator Murphy to assume that this additional capital is to be divided up amongst the people who have shares in the company.  I think that is quite wrong.  That is the impression the Senator gave here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JaneDowdall" hpid="Mrs. Dowdall Mrs. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>There is need for capital for a new policy in the manufacture of gas which is going to be very expensive.  I think Senator Murphy is quite wrong in his interpretation and his presumption that all this is being done to defraud the working people.  The competition that has been talked about will deal with all that in the price of gas <i>vis-à-vis</i><Col N="947" /> the prices charged by other firms engaged in the provision of heating and cooking facilities.  At this very late hour of the night, I do not want, like Senator Murphy, to get heated on this subject, either by gas or electricity. I should like it to be recorded that it is accepted that this is one of the finest public utility companies in the country.  After its long history of good service, it is strange that a Corkman should come here and try to insinuate that some terribly sinister plot is afoot in the company in Cork.  I should like to raise at least my voice to contradict him.</P>

      <P>Nobody would imagine it was the same document as the Minister asked this House to approve of.  The Minister gave us a very cursory account of the reasons this Order was being made.  The information which Senator Murphy gave comes as a revelation to me.  I understood the plea the Minister put forward in his short statement was that the Cork Gas Company was in competition with other forms of fuel for cooking, lighting and so on.  That might be so. I do not see how that affects the publication of the company's accounts.</P>

I do not understand why the accounts should not be published in the press in the same way as a variety of other companies publish their accounts.

      <P>Senator Murphy is entitled to get from the Minister a reasoned argument against his views. I do not think that to talk of pushing it through is a reasoned argument.  I have listened to most of Senator Murphy's speech: I was out for about a moment.  I listened to the Minister's statement before that and I read the debate in the Dáil.  I think there is nothing wrong with most of what is being done.  I honestly feel that when a company is doing well and has a hope of future profits, then binding regulations, as it were, should be loosened up and high capital expenditure should be allowed over a number of years.  Therefore, I think the increase is necessary.  At the same time, I also say that in the case of a public company such as this for which the shares were subscribed many years ago, it is necessary that, as a public utility, the price to the consumer, based on the service he gets, should also be looked to.  That is the view Senator Murphy put forward.</P>
      <P>I think that most of what has been done is correct.  I do not agree that accounts should not be published.  I have personally been fined in the district court, in a small way, for forgetting to register the accounts of a private company.  Yet the position is that the Cork Consumers Gas Company as it now is&mdash;and which it will not be when it is renamed&mdash;has not published accounts at all over a certain number of years.</P>

      <P>In actual fact, Senator Mrs. Dowdall has already answered, quite successfully and completely, what Senator Murphy has said.  There is complete and absolute competition in the gas world and there is no need to have the controls formerly applied to gas companies when there was no competition.  Senator Murphy obviously wants to preserve the powers over these <Col N="953" /> companies simply for the sake of preserving them, because they have long since ceased to have any meaning. There is absolute cut-throat competition between electricity, gas, paraffin oil, calor gas and all the other gases, and it is ridiculous to expect that we should retain outdated controls.</P>
      <P>Other gas companies besides the Cork Gas Company are not required to publish their accounts in the press. They send them to the city manager and town clerk and they are available for public inspection.  Senator Murphy tried to give the impression to the House and to the country that there was some sinister, dark motive in regard to this.  It is as though I was engaged in a conspiracy to allow Cork Gas Company to make grossly excessive profits and to deceive the people of Cork.  I thought he was a man with a more courteous and understanding mind.  I am amazed at him and I suspect he has some extraordinary prejudice against Cork Gas Company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In line with modern practice, the profits of the company have been reinvested in the undertaking instead of being distributed in the form of dividends, That is in no way objectionable.  As I have already indicated, all the proposals for the company were published in the press and anybody was free to object.  The only objections made were not in connection with anything Senator Murphy dealt with.  In other words, his fundamental objections were not among those which formed the small number of objections when these proposals were published.  The trade unions in Cork have had an opportunity of examining the proposals and to comment on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that the gas company's <Col N="954" /> product is subject to legitimate qualitative control and if it falls short in calorific value, it is obliged to make adjustments.  In connection with the reading of the meters, if an arbitrary reading is given in relation to a particular period, should the consumer be away, it is adjusted in the course of the next period.  Surely Senator Murphy did not imagine that the gas company would arbitrarily make a calculation as to what amount should be paid, based on the previous reading, and then not deduct in the future if there was an overcharge.  Does the Senator think we are childish in this House? The Senator knew very well that the company did not intend to swindle the people.</P>

      <P>I think I have answered all the points.  This is an Order of the kind which has been proceeding in a general way in order to release gas companies from regulations that had no meaning in the modern world.  A great many of them have difficulty competing with other forms of fuel.  They are not universally prosperous.  You require a very considerable genius for management to run a gas company in certain towns today.</P>
