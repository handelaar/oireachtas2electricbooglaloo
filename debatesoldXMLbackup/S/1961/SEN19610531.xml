      <P>The alteration in the hour of meeting has been brought about because of staff difficulties which I can assure the House are under very active consideration at the moment.  In regard to the sitting next week, it is proposed to discuss the matter at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  We hope to have that meeting tomorrow and the information will be conveyed to the Senators in due course as to our proposals for future sittings.</P>

      <P>Might I ask if it is so that the two hours off the sitting, which obviously will be costly to the State, are due to the fact that the State has been endeavouring to employ cut-price reporters as trainees at well under the rate and to have them, at the same time, trained by people who are supposed to do a double job?</P>

      <P>May I inquire if it is intended, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour at which we assemble, that we shall adjourn at the usual hour for tea?  My understanding of the position is that quite a number of people including myself have some amendments down to Bills and we have not had and will not have an opportunity to deal with them.  We cannot be in two places at the one time, dealing with amendments and having a meal.  I would urge upon the House that, notwithstanding the difficulties which have arisen, we should adjourn for tea.</P>

I understand that one of the difficulties with which the Reporting Staff are confronted is that they are expected to work from 10 o'clock in the morning until a late hour at night without a break for tea.

I should like to support Senator O'Quigley's contention that <Col N="559" /> the normal hours of this House should not be transgressed.

    <Title>Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Bill, 1961&mdash;Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Sections 1 to 6 inclusive agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="560" /> SECTION 7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To insert a new subsection between lines 55 and 56 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) (i)  The Minister may by order appoint a day from which the Commission shall thenceforth be known as the &lsquo;Pigs and Bacon Board&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>(ii)  From the day appointed by the Minister under the preceding subparagraph the Pigs and Bacon Board may be referred to as &lsquo;the Board&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>(b)  Every reference in the Act of 1939, the Act of 1956 and this Act to the Pigs and Bacon Commission and to the Commission shall be construed respectively as references to the Pigs and Bacon Board and to the Board.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It ought to be immediately clear to the House that it is most desirable that a body engaged in a business activity should be referred to as a board rather than a commission.  I think it is well recognised that if a Government does not want to do anything about an urgent problem, the way to do nothing about it is to establish a commission.  That is the popular conception of commissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have commissions sitting for quite a period producing tangible results of very little value.  I quite see how the Pigs and Bacon Commission has slipped into this Bill.  In the normal course, a commission for the purpose of some kind of an executive administrative job consists of three people.  We have had this commission, up to date, consisting of three officers of the Minister, two and a chairman.  It is now intended to enlarge the commission to seven members.  The commissioners of the Board of Works consist of three people; the Revenue Commissioners consist of three people; I think the Civil Service Commission consists of three or five people; the Land Commission consists of no more than four or five people.  With the solitary exception of the British Transport Commission which has not been noted for <Col N="561" /> its prowess in the commercial field, one does not find commissions associated with ventures of a business character.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the new body which is to be involved in the export of pigs and bacon products is to be regarded by foreign importers as a business body, as we all want it to be regarded, we must change the title from the grandiose one of the Pigs and Bacon Commission to the Pigs and Bacon Board.  There have been past Pigs and Bacon marketing boards and bodies of that kind.  Perhaps these were not successful.  They were not successful because the scheme under which they were devised was not a good scheme. I do not think that ought to deter us from including in this Bill a power whereby the Minister for Agriculture at whatever time he considers suitable can call this Pigs and Bacon Commission by a new name, the Pigs and Bacon Board.  I cannot see any objection to giving that power to the Minister for Agriculture.  He will never exercise it if the circumstances do not seem to warrant it.  In my opinion it is a power which ought to be vested in the Minister and now appears to be an appropriate time at which to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator O'Quigley's suggestion to change the name from &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; to &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.  The corresponding body in Northern Ireland is known as a board.  They have marketing functions somewhat similar to those of the commission to be set up here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe we do not fully appreciate what a commission means in the eyes of the average man in England.  Perhaps I can best illustrate that by a point made in a talk over the radio about 15 years ago.  Someone, speaking on a visit to Berlin, wanted to describe the characteristics and approaches of the different nationalities. He gave the ridiculous situation where there was a very disastrous hailstorm. The hailstones were probably as big as hurley balls.  Each nationality approached the situation in a different way.  The Russians commandeered the hailstones immediately to send them back to Russia because they might be <Col N="562" /> useful for some purpose.  The Americans were a bit worried about the effect on the morale of the Army personnel so they decided to hold a ball game.  The British established a commission.</P>
    <P>That is what they think commissions are for&mdash;to investigate matters, to stop hasty decisions being taken on all sorts of matters, to delay the sort of neurosis that occasionally affects the general public that something must be done now whether it is right or wrong. I think Senator O'Quigley has made a rather effective point, particularly as the commission we are setting up will be a marketing body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see what difference it makes whether we call it a &ldquo;commission&rdquo; or a &ldquo;board&rdquo;, so long as the functions are clearly defined and the responsibilities set out.  When this Commission was set up under the 1939 Act, it replaced the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board.  It was composed of three individuals who were given a certain assignment.  There was no suggestion from anybody who appeared before the Advisory Committee that there was anything wrong with the term &ldquo;commission&rdquo;. I am not saying there is anything sacred about the term, either. But I do not accept the view that, simply because it is called a commission, it means it has to cover a wide field such as a Government commission inquiring into some social or other question.</P>
      <P>The recommendation of the Committee inquiring into the export of agricultural produce was that the Commission should be reorganised and that, instead of three members, all the different interests should be represented on it and their functions set out.  I see no merit at all in going back to the term &ldquo;Marketing Board.&rdquo;  I believe the Commission established a very good reputation for itself, which is proved by the fact that at the inquiry nobody suggested it should be altered.  The inquiry recommended that the Commission be reorganised and set out the work that should be assigned to it.  I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="563" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many things which do not come within the terms of reference of a body asked to investigate the best way of increasing exports.  I do not know whether or not this matter came within the terms of reference of the body advising on the export and the marketing of agricultural produce, but it is not an argument at all to say that body did not recommend it.  There are a hundred other things that body did not recommend. Every change not made in the 1939 Act are things the Commission did not recommend.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that we have a whole Act of Parliament devoted to converting Córas Tráchtála Teoranta into a semi-State statutory body with an independent existence of its own and not dependent on an annual grant from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  That was done for one purpose, because it was a body concerned with exports.  The argument made in this House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the conversion of that company, dependent upon an annual vote, into a semi-State statutory board was that, being engaged in the export market, it was felt that people engaged in commerce in foreign countries would have more confidence dealing with a semi-State body which was a board and known to be a board in the same way as the Minister for Industry and Commerce argues at present when dealing with boards such as the E.S.B.  I rather think it was an echo of that argument which sounded in my mind and induced me to put down this amendment.</P>
      <P>I think this is the height of absurdity, knowing what is thought of commissions.  The Minister may say that does not carry any weight with him.  None the less, it is a fact. Commissions are noted for not being very diligent.  Commissions are bodies established to investigate matters over a long period.  That is the average man's view on a commission.  In Britain, there is a remarkable profusion of commissions of every kind, as is evident to anybody who looks at the index to publications put out by H.M.S.O.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may have certain views here and now that the title of this <Col N="564" /> board does not matter.  Perhaps that is so.  All I want to do in this amendment is to give power to the Minister and his successors&mdash;as a successor he surely will have some time&mdash;the opportunity, if he should think it right and proper, to convert the commission into a board and to do so by order under the sanction of this amendment in an Act of Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley has made a very strong case and the Minister is very unwise in not accepting it.  Although I have not consulted the New Oxford Dictionary, I think that if the Minister goes to the Library and looks it up, he will find that the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; means a judicial body not influenced by any exterior pressures or powers.  The case was made in respect of one Commission in this House that to interfere with that Commission and say: &ldquo;You have to produce your findings before a certain date&rdquo; was a fundamental interference in its working.</P>
      <P>To use the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; in respect of what is really a public board of directors is certainly wrong.  The members of the Commission, as it is now called, may not at present export the Wiltshire sides we have been discussing. The present situation may continue for some time and individual bacon factories may export individually, but a set of circumstances might arise almost immediately in any given price or supply structure in which these people would export as a unit.  At that stage the term &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; would be quite incorrect.  I would advise the Minister on his way out to his tea this evening to consult the New Oxford Dictionary.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, paragraph (b) (i), line 4, to delete &ldquo;two&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;three&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to give the producers equal representation with the bacon curers on the Board.  On Second Reading, the Minister expressed amazement and disappointment that <Col N="565" /> people had inferred that the present representation gave the curers a majority on the Board and the Minister is right in stating that is not so.  While I have the greatest belief in the new Board&mdash;although I do not think it goes far enough&mdash;at the same time, so long as the pig producers do not have equal representation with the curers, we are starting this Commission off on the wrong foot, in my view.  That is not what is intended if we want to expand our pig production.</P>
    <P>As reported in the Seanad debates, Volume 54, No. 3, at Column 321, the Minister, speaking on the Second Reading, having adverted to the fact that when these decisions are announced, all interested parties rub their eyes and make representations based on their own vested interests, continued to deal with the objection made by the bacon curers and said:</P>
    <P>So it was with the bacon curers. They felt they were not getting fair representation for their business. The farmers had already disposed of the pigs.  If they came inside any of the three grades I have mentioned they had secured a guaranteed price, and the curers felt that after that point had been reached, the pigs were converted into bacon and had to be disposed of on the home or export market.</P>
    <P>The Minister later stated that he accepted that argument and I take it that is the basis on which the baconcurers got extra representation on the Board.  I do not think that was a wise decision.  I do not think that when the farmer's pig is graded and he gets the guaranteed price, that is the end of it as far as the farmer is concerned.  While there are such things as grades and minimum prices at the moment, the farmers have sometimes got a better deal, and, please God, they will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>We must study the supply and demand situation that obtains.  Supply and demand are decided by the capacity of the bacon factories.  One could well imagine that the curers, with their existing accommodation, would not wish to increase that <Col N="566" /> accomodation, so as to create a greater market for Irish bacon and an expanding market for Irish pig products.  They would be happy in an &ldquo;as you were&rdquo; position.  Even though the farmers had got the prices for their pigs, if they had a smaller representation on the Board than the curers, they would be precluded from making their case for the expansion of the bacon curing industry and from participation in the industry&mdash; something I would not welcome except as a last resort.  I feel that the case made by the bacon curers was substantially that once they paid for the pigs, that was the end of it.  That was not a valid case and the Minister was not correct.</P>
    <P>At column 322 in the same Volume, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>We did not interfere with the representation of the producers.  We gave them exactly what was recommended by the Commission and to give justice as we see it, we said &ldquo;We will surrender one of the two we have and give it to the curers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The first sentence, to which I shall return is:</P>
    <P>We did not interfere with the representation of the producers.</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister interfered with that representation.  If he did not change the number representing the producers, he changed the number the other people had and that interfered with the representation of producers. The conclusion he draws in the first sentence I have quoted made it seem as if there were nobody else but producers on the Board, but, leaving the number of producers' representatives stand and interfering with the representation of other interests on the Board certainly does interfere with the representation of the producers.</P>
    <P>If it were for nothing else but the principle of the thing, to ensure that this should not be done, I ask the Minister at this late stage to accept this amendment and clear up this injustice and anomaly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on the Committee's Report said the Government proposed that the reorganised <Col N="567" /> Commission would have two producers' representatives and two curers' representatives, but according to Section 7 of the Bill, the Commission is to consist of the Chairman and six ordinary members.  There are to be only two producers' representatives and three curers' representatives.  The Minister has always told us that he would not be intimidated but I am afraid that somebody has intimidated him as regards this Board.  As Minister for Agriculture, his primary concern should be for the farmers, the producers, not for those who I claim, have grown fat over the years on the farmers' sweat and toil.</P>
      <P>It was well-known to everybody after the issue of the White Paper that the curers were bringing pressure to bear on the Minister.  Our worst fears have been confirmed and the Minister has admitted that himself.  At column 790 of the Dáil Reports, Volume 187, he Minister said:</P>
      <P>The reason for the change has been since the issue of the White Paper strong and unanimous representations were made to the Government by the bacon curers that as the primary purpose of reorganising the Commission was in regard to bacon export marketing and the Commission would have wide powers of control over the bacon curing industry it was inequitable that the representation of curers should be only two out of seven.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister has given way to the strong representations that were made and I think this pandering to vested interests is lamentable. To say that the primary purpose of this Bill is to expand the bacon export market and that therefore the curers should be in a majority is not right. If we examine the list of powers of the Commission in the Bill, we will see that the Board is to promote increases in the quantities of bacon and pig meat products, to conduct investigations, studies, surveys and reports in this State and outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another section states that it will carry out an investigation into the provision of new and improved types of bacon and pig meat and pig products. <Col N="568" /> In view of this, I think it is important that the producers should get equal representation on the Board. The proposed arrangement is inequitable. If the Commission is to carry out an investigation into the prospects of providing new and improved types of bacon and bacon products, it is the farmers who will be concerned and not the bacon curers.  If the pigs are not produced, there will be very little for the bacon curers to do or very little bacon to export.</P>
    <P>What the Minister has done in changing the number and giving the bacon curers a majority spoils any hope the Irish farmers had of an objective and progressive approach to the pig industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>In Volume 187 of the Dáil Reports, the Minister is reported at column 790 as saying:</P>
    <P>The Irish Bacon Curers' Society emphasised that their members, comprising all the curers, could have no confidence in such a body and would fear the possibility of adverse effects so much that investment in the bacon curing industry would gravely suffer.</P>
    <P>I wonder was that the big stick held over the Government's head.  Some people claim that it was the Taoiseach or the Minister for Industry and Commerce who compelled the Minister for Agriculture to change his mind and give extra representation to the curers. The farmers of Ireland have often been suspicious of the bacon curers.  There have been fairly good reasons for that in the past.  It will be very difficult for the farmers to have confidence in this new Board.  If it is to function properly, they should have confidence in it and there should be co-operation between the bacon curers and the farmers. If both had equal representation, then the farmers would have confidence in it and you could have the co-operation which is desirable.</P>
    <P>There is no justification at all for 120,000 pig producers having only two representatives on the Board, while 30 curers have three.  In other words, the curers have a ten per cent representation, while the pig producers have .0016 per cent representation. I do not think the Minister, or <Col N="569" /> anybody else, can claim that that is fair and just representation.</P>

      <P>I merely said that this was a demonstration of the way of the Fine Gael Party.  Senator Burke is a man who knows all about this business as he is in the bacon curing end.  There is nothing discreditable about that.  I would not mind hearing a contribution from him on this subject as to what was fair or what was unfair.  However, he makes his own decisions in that regard.  I have just glanced, as I said, at the speech I made here on the last occasion and I think it was an excellent speech&mdash;if I could be pardoned for <Col N="570" /> saying that&mdash;a well-reasoned speech which showed every evidence of a sense of fair play and no desire at all, as I said on the last occasion, to resort continually to the practice of making everything we do, everything we think, or every word we speak, political.</P>
      <P>I already told this House that those members who want to have things that way, who want to conduct the business of the House in that fashion, are very welcome to do so, but I think it is not profitable even from the narrow, selfish political point of view.  The Board provided for here is just and fair and I am quite satisfied that it will prove to be a competent organisation for the purpose of discharging the work we propose to give to it.</P>

      <P>It is a well-known rule in all political Parties that people who are interested in a particular aspect of a matter put down such amendments as they deem fit.  This amendment is signed by four farmers, Senator J.L. O'Sullivan, Senator P.S. Donegan, Senator L'Estrange and Senator Crowe.  If the Minister had not got a better argument than the one he put forward and did not see fit to prepare his brief&mdash;as he practically told us&mdash;I would see no objection to his saying that he would like to have heard from Senator Burke and leaving it at that, but when the Minister makes half a dozen or a dozen comments about the way people conduct business in this House, I think, first of all, it was out of order.  The Minister under the Constitution is entitled to be here but he has nothing to do with the conducting of the business of the House&mdash;nothing whatever.  I would not have made that remark except for the fact that this is not the first time this Minister has said that kind of thing.  Senator Lenihan may laugh but perhaps we will teach the Fianna Fáil Senators something more about the Constitution.  I just want to say that it was very bad that a Minister should dilate in this way.  If he had confined himself to a single sentence, we would have understood the Minister's little joke but he was not making a little joke.  He was making a savage and sarcastic kind of speech, a dirty political speech, one of the dirtiest I have heard.</P>

      <P>Senators opposite are experts at rattling the doorknocker of any opportunity, especially if they think there is any political value in it. We all know very well that they think there is a little bit of political value attached to this Bill.  I should like to disabuse them of that idea, once and for all.  This is a marketing Bill and it was discussed in both Houses and made clear that that being so, the curers were entitled to a representation just the same as any other section of the community.  There is no point at this stage of the Bill in getting all hot and bothered about it and pretending that the Fine Gael Party are at a great disadvantage merely because the farmers did not get more representation on the Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two reasons for my not wishing to engage in this controversy.  For many years, I was chairman of the Irish Bacon Curers' Association and I am still a member of that Association.  I did not wish to engage in a controversy which would make it more difficult for me to work with people I have to meet on many days of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, by the terms of the Bill, I am put in an almost rarefied atmosphere by the fact that I would be precluded in the Bill through being a member of the Oireachtas&mdash;and I do not wish to be&mdash;from becoming a member of the Board.  I thought it would be better for me not to get involved in this controversy which was raised by the various farmers' associations. In passing, it is fair to say that <Col N="572" /> many of the people who will have votes for the curers' representatives on the Pigs and Bacon Commission, will themselves be representatives of the farmers' co-operative bacon factories. That point has not been made in this House or the other.  It is possible that one of the representatives elected by the curers will be a nominee of the farmers' co-operative societies.</P>

Seemingly, we have already abrogated Standing Orders by the manner in which we have met this evening, and then it was thought to abrogate what has been the practice of the House.  Now a new precedent is being established by the Minister for Agriculture who no doubt regards himself as wise, able, just, fair and liberal-minded, able to assess the interests of everyone, to do justice between all parties, deliver himself of his judgement in clear precise language, and all kinds of attributes about which we could talk all evening. The Minister may suffer from that <Col N="573" /> form of megalomania and we can do nothing about it.</P>

      <P>That is not an answer to the argument on the amendment. If the Minister is going to adopt that as an established practice of the House, we will want to consider the position.  The attitude of the Minister is: &ldquo;I have already spoken&rdquo;&mdash;the great voice has already spoken and is on the record and that is the end of it. I listened to the Minister with my customary care and I recollect that he spoke about certain difficulties with regard to the different groups, the producers and the curers.  He went on to talk then about the manner in which the Minister was surrendering one of his two seats on the Board in favour of one group or another.  The position is somewhat vague in my mind.  We are thrown back now by the Minister on our recollection and memory of what he said.  The House should take note of the Minister's attitude and disapprove of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> To come now to the amendment more particularly, I do not understand how it can be said that it is right and proper that on a body of this kind there should be three representatives of one class and two of another, both of whom to the ordinary layman would appear to have equal interests in the functioning and efficient discharge of the business of the Board.  I have no hesitation whatever in saying, on the arguments made, there should be equal representation for the curers and the producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>He did it, in any case, Sir.  I am surprised, too, that his speech this evening was so short, considering that he could speak for seven hours when he was in Opposition, in 1954, I think.  I am not certain of the year.  I am surprised that the Minister has so stubbornly&mdash;I do not know if it was stubbornly&mdash;defended his decision to place the curers in a dominant position on the Board, notwithstanding the fact that the present marketing system in England, and the marketing system for the past eight, ten or 15 years was anything but good.  We know that the prices the farmers have been getting for their pigs and produce have been anything but good on the British market.  We were getting the lowest price in Europe, and only about a month ago we got 10/- per cwt. less for our bacon than the Polish people were getting for their bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister think that the Board will do anything worthwhile for the producers, even in the years ahead? I doubt it very much.  In Northern Ireland, the very successful Pig Marketing Board consists of 14 members. They get top prices for their bacon in Britain and, as I say, the board consists of 14 members, eleven of whom are elected by the pig producers. Three are nominated by the <Col N="575" /> Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture. Of those three, one is a farmer and another is an ex-secretary of a farmers' union.  The other is the managing director of a motor company.  On that board, there are, one could legitimately say, 13 farmers, or 13 people representing the pig producers, and one other.</P>

The farmers have absolutely no trust in the curers. We all know that co-operation is needed.  I doubt if we will get that co-operation, unless the Minister is prepared to give the farmers equal representation with the curers.</P>
      <P>This is just another proof that the industrial section of the Fianna Fáil Party are in the saddle.  The farmers may expect very little from the present Government and this is further proof of that, because the bacon curers subscribe, and subscribe generously, to Party funds.  That is one of the reasons for the extra representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is in substitution for Section 5 of the 1939 Act.  The 1939 Act dealt with the chairman of the Commission.  The matter about which I should like to ask the Minister is purely a drafting point.  It is why Section 5 which is being in effect completely repealed by Section 8 is not, in fact, in this Bill repealed and does not appear in the Schedule of the enactments repealed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I mention this is that it is the kind of thing that crops up at either Consolidation Committees or the Statutory Instruments Committee of this House and we have found the greatest difficulty in determining what, in fact, was the law at a particular time.  When the indices to the statutes are compiled, they are compiled in the main from the Schedules showing the enactments repealed and you do not find in a case of this kind opposite Section 5 of the 1939 Act any indication <Col N="578" /> in the index that, in fact, Section 5 of the 1939 Act has been replaced by Section 8, as it will be, of the Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Act, 1961. The point, in short, is, why, when Section 5 of the 1939 Act is being completely replaced, it is not repealed and then provision made for the appointment of the chairman of the Commission in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister has got my point at all. Section 8, in the first line, says:</P>
      <P>The following section is hereby substituted for Section 5 of the Act of 1939.</P>
      <P>If you look at the Act of 1939, you find that that is the section under which the chairman is appointed. What I want to find out is why it is that in the Schedule of enactments being repealed, we are not repealing Section 5 of the 1939 Act.  I can only say, as a person who has from time to time to look at these Acts, that it is a completely misleading form of drafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a little experience like that just today, looking at various enactments to see exactly what the law was at the present time. The reasonable approach to this is to look at the Acts as you go along and see what has been repealed by subsequent Acts.  It is alarming to find in the midst of an Act a section substituting for a section in a previous Act without any indication in the Schedule which is usually attached to Acts as to the Acts or parts of Acts which have been repealed.  I do not think that is a good way of doing business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very clear, but when you are looking through a series of measures dealing with one subject, there is the difficulty when you look <Col N="579" /> at an old Act that you do not know whether the section in which you are interested is still the law.  You go through the subsequent legislation dealing with the subject and look at the Schedule to see if section so-and-so of a certain Act has been repealed.  If you do not see that in the Schedule as having been repealed, you assume it is still the law.  There may have been a change and there is no indication.</P>

      <P>That may be in the 1956 Act and in some other Acts, but I want to direct the attention of the Minister and the House to the fact that this is a very bad form of drafting. It makes the ascertainment of the law by members of the public, which at any time is not very easy, more difficult.  If we want to make the law clear in this connection, what we ought to do in the Schedule to the Act is to repeal Section 5 of the 1939 Act.  When that is gone and we want to find out what is the position in regard to the chairman of the Commission, it is to be found in Section 8.  It is as simple as that.  It is to this slovenly form of draftsmanship I am objecting.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before subsection (6), to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( )  The Commission may enter into an agreement with its officers and servants and agents for the determination of disputes between the Commission and such officers, servants and agents about the terms and conditions of their employment <Col N="580" /> including tenure of office, remuneration, allowances, expenses, sick, annual and special leave, and such other matters as may be agreed by arbitration.  The Commission may provide in such scheme for the payment in full of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with any such scheme of arbitration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The section deals with the acquisition of offices and with the appointment and remuneration of the staff of the Commission.  What I want to establish clearly in the amendment is that the officers, servants and agents appointed by the Commission will have some kind of regular machinery by which their terms and conditions of service can be settled in a peaceful atmosphere, that there will be a scheme under which the staff of the Commission may have resort to arbitration and that the arbitration findings will be binding on both sides.  That is an orderly system of staff relations which ought to be provided, not alone for this body but for other bodies of a semi-State character.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the Labour Court is available.  I regard the Labour Court in cases of this kind as merely a kind of fire brigade which is called into action when passions are aflame.  That is not the kind of thing we ought to have.  We ought to have an orderly system in which these things will not arise, in which the fires will not occur, in which relationships will be dealt with in a harmonious way.  The idea is by no means new. In many of the State services, in the Electricity Supply Board, which is a semi-State body, there are provisions in the Acts for a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is revolutionary to say, in relation to the scheme, that matters of salary, terms and conditions of appointment, sick leave, and so on, can be dealt with.  I am aware that in some of the smaller semi-State bodies, by reason of their smallness, there is a very intimate relationiship between the managing director, secretary and staff and that very often there is a seething discontent which manifests itself in inefficiency. That discontent cannot be got rid of <Col N="581" /> because there is not available within the body concerned a scheme of some sort of machinery by which such a matter can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>People in these small semi-State bodies do not want to go to the Labour Court and to set in operation, to deal with their particular problems, the whole machinery of the Labour Court which is not entirely satisfactory for the reason that its findings are not binding on both parties.  Therefore, I think this Commission should, as a matter of policy, establish its own scheme of conciliation and arbitration. My view is that a body of this kind, unless specifically authorised to do acts of this kind, cannot in law do them.  Therefore, it might be the view of whatever commission is established that it ought to have this machinery and we ought to put beyond question the validity of such machinery by providing in a Bill of this kind the authority of the Commission to establish it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in general agreement with what Senator O'Quigley says about the desirability of providing for machinery of negotiation for this statutory board we are establishing.  I am concerned, however, with one phrase he used, namely, that the results of the arbitration should be binding on the parties.  I am all in favour of an orderly way of dealing with and avoiding disputes between an employer, particularly a semi-State organisation, and the trade unions representing the employees. In certain circumstances, there is a lot to be said for the trade unions and the employing board undertaking to accept the results of arbitration.  But that would have to be a free choice at the time in relation to any particular dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, in certain circumstances, they might agree if they felt they could get an impartial chairman &mdash;if they could get a good way of dealing with it&mdash;to put it to arbitration, on the understanding that the decision would be binding on both parties.  However, I think it would be very wrong if we started by saying&mdash;as I think is intended by Senator O'Quigley, in the light of what he said&mdash;that it should be compulsory arbitration.  If that is so, I would oppose it.  It would be a wrong <Col N="582" /> turn in our industrial relations and it would not solve anything.</P>
    <P>I am quite in favour of and would support some agreed machinery of negotiation.  I should like to hear the Minister on whether in fact it would be necessary to write into the legislation some provision in that respect or whether, in the absence of its being written in, the Board could agree with the trade unions representing the staff on some form of agreed machinery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the complaint Senator O'Quigley had to make against the Labour Court machinery, that it was not effective inasmuch as there was no means by which its recommendations could be made effective except by agreement.  I was wondering what type of machinery he had in mind which would achieve the purpose which cannot be achieved through the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>I suppose I do not know the full Labour point of view on this question but I know enough about it to be able to say that it is not clear to me how or what sort of machinery could be designed that would achieve that purpose. After all, either the employers or the workers could in the long run, no matter what you provided, still say: &ldquo;We will not accept that recommendation.&rdquo; There is machinery there.  It is all right to say that the Labour Court has done this and that and that it is suitable for this and that.  It is the machinery that is so far there and that is designed to meet any problems that arise in regard to industrial relations as between employer and employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole history of the Commission since it was first established is one, as far as I can say from memory, where that relationship between the commission itself and its employees has been very good.  It does not mean that things may not change and that disputes cannot arise.  It is the duty of a commission such as we are providing for here or a board to have its own approaches&mdash;the normal approaches that all of us have to make from time to time in dealing with those who work around us, to effect understanding, to bring about a settlement and to reach the stage without resorting to machinery such as the Labour <Col N="583" /> Court to effect an understanding as between the employer and the employee. But, after that, I suggest we should not attempt to deal with this in any piecemeal fashion.</P>
    <P>If the Labour Court machinery is not what it ought to be, if it is not giving us the results we feel it should give, then it is up to somebody to effect improvements and to suggest what amendments are necessary to make it more effective.  To start off with, the proposition that we should have separate arbitration machinery for the Pigs and Bacon Commission, An Bord Bainne, and all the different boards, in my opinion, would mean that, instead of producing peace and tranquillity, it would be a source of aggravation to the relations between employer and employee.  There is no case whatever for this proposal and I must resist it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may make great speeches, as he told us earlier, about the representation on this Commission, but I do not think he will be able to look back with the same pride on the speech he made on this amendment.  He started off by misinterpreting what I said about the Labour Court.  I am not making any complaints at all about the Labour Court.  I do say the Labour Court is the last resort where a dispute is already in existence.  I am seeking in this manner to provide machinery in advance to avoid disputes and to resolve them when they do arise.  The kind of machinery I have in mind is merely arbitration machinery, which will have to be agreed on between the Commission and the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister talks about dealing with this matter on a piecemeal basis, it may be pertinent to point out to him that it is being dealt with on a piecemeal basis.  In the first place, you have the Labour Court and the Industrial Relations Act, 1947, replacing the old haphazard machinery in existence until then.  In 1950, you had a more enlightened approach to the State services with the introduction of a conciliation and arbitration scheme for civil servants.  That is in existence. <Col N="584" /> You have also a scheme of conciliation and arbitration specifically designed to meet the needs of national teachers and separate schemes for secondary and vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>These are all parts of the State service and relate to people remunerated out of moneys voted annually by the Oireachtas.  But, better than that, there is a separate Act of Parliament established for a State body, the E.S.B.  Under it, there are two forms of machinery, one for the manual employees and another for the clerical and technical staffs.  Therefore, the Oireachtas, in legislation relating to that particular semi-State body, has already decided that, notwithstanding the existence of the Labour Court, it was right and proper to have a scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the employees of the E.S.B.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will know that the E.S.B. machinery is not compulsory arbitration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. There is provision in the Industrial Relations Act, 1947, for arbitration under the auspices of the Labour Court.  According to the publications of the Labour Court, the position is that where people resort to arbitration under its auspices in those circumstances the findings are binding on both sides.  I am not asking that that be incorporated in this machinery.  I merely want to establish the position that there will be an agreement between the staff and the Commission in regard to certain matters specified in the amendment and such other matters as may be agreed to.  All the amendment does is establish the principle that the Commission and the staff, which I hope will be an expanding staff&mdash;and I am sure the Minister shares that hope&mdash;will have machinery for the peaceful and orderly settlement of disputes.  There could be nothing more commendable in this age, if we want to advance in all phases of the economy, than the establishment of machinery to avoid obstacles in the way of efficiency.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (10), before paragraph (b) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) (i)  Where at the commencement of section 12 of the Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Act, 1961, a person is employed as an officer or servant of the Commission and the office or position held by him has thereafter been changed or rearranged so that the duties of his new office or position are not analogous to or are an unreasonable addition to those he was required to perform before the change or rearrangement, the change or rearrangement thus effected shall be deemed to be a worsening of the terms and conditions of his employment obtaining before such change or rearrangement took place.</P>
      <P>In this amendment, I want to establish the position in the case of a person who was employed before the commencement of this Act as an officer or servant of the outgoing Commission, and was employed in a particular employment.  It will not do merely to say he will be employed on terms and conditions not less favourable than those to which he had been subject.  A person could be given a much more onerous office to fulfil by the new Commission than he had on the old one but still be in receipt of the same salary, annual leave and other conditions.  It could be said he was being employed on terms not less favourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subsection (10), so long as the terms and conditions in relation to remuneration and allowances for expenses are the same, even though a person has more arduous duties to perform, he may get from the new Commission only the same salary.  The position I seek to establish by the amendment is that where the duties of the office or position are not analogous or where there is an unreasonable <Col N="586" /> addition to the duties required to be performed under the old Commission, this person will be deemed to have suffered a worsening of his conditions of employment and in those circumstances compensation will be payable to the person so affected.  The compensation I envisage should take the form of either an increase in salary and allowances as may be appropriate or a lump sum of such amount as is reasonable.</P>
    <P>There is much to be said for this kind of amendment.  Here we have the Oireachtas interfering with the contractual conditions of employers and employees.  It has always been the custom of the Oireachtas, since the first amalgamations on the railways up to the time the E.S.B. took over a number of minor electricity stations under the E.S.B. Act, 1927, including the Dublin electricity supply station, to compensate people for any loss they might suffer as a result of interference by the Oireachtas in the contractual conditions between employer and employee.</P>
    <P>It may be that there will be only one person affected in a minor or not very serious way under this rearrangement that may occur as a result of the re-constitution of the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  I do not know.  All I know is that if that is so, we ought to take care, having interfered with the constitution and the functions which the Commission has had up to the present, to ensure that no ill effect will be visited on those employed by the Commission.  All I am seeking to achieve in this amendment is that if anybody suffers a worsening of his terms or conditions of service as a result of the transfer from the old Commission of three to the new Commission of seven, such person will get appropriate compensation, either by way of an increase in salary or a lump sum.</P>
    <P>The final matter to which it is, perhaps, necessary to refer is that, in the event of the Commission and any employees or employee concerned, failing to agree on the compensation appropriate, the matter may be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <Col N="587" />
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly support Senator O'Quigley on this amendment. It is quite true that where the Oireachtas has entered into the functions of an undertaking or rearranged it, given it extra responsibilities through legislation, it is the practice to provide for compensation to staff adversely affected by the change.  I have in mind particularly what the Oireachtas did in 1950 when C.I.E. was nationalised and where a somewhat similar provision was made for people whose position was worsened or who were asked to perform duties not analogous, or not a reasonable addition, to their former duties.  It was provided that there should be compensation and appeal to an arbitrator appointed by the appropriate Minister.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be able to accept this amendment.  There are many precedents for it.  It is a good thing that when the Oireachtas deals with legislation like this, it should provide for any staff that may be adversely affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that the existing staff are generously provided for in this measure.  The idea of inserting a provision which would confer on the existing staff advantages that would not be conferred upon those who might join the staff later is something with which I could not have the slightest sympathy.  The proposition that when employees' conditions are worsened in circumstances such as will exist here when the transfer takes place, an arbitrator should be on the spot to determine whether this type of work is more laborious than the work the individual was doing before the transfer, is carrying things very far.  Surely there is the normal method of discussion such as exists also in the case of general conditions as between employees and employer.  If you were to provide machinery as visualised in this amendment. I could imagine the sort of trouble you would let yourself in for in this organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no comparison between this case and the case of C.I.E. which was, if you like, a dwindling organisation; no comparison between this and a Bill <Col N="588" /> giving an authority to close lines and declare men redundant.  In that case, the natural thing was to put the onus to compensate on the authority to whom you are giving the power.  Here we are providing for something I hope will expand and the prospects of the general position worsening from an employment point of view, are, we hope, non-existent.</P>
    <P>Generous provision is made here for the protection of the existing staff of the Commission.  This does not mean that an existing employee of the present Commission will be doing exactly the same sort of work in the new set-up. Those who will come into the service in the future will not have any guarantee of that nature&mdash;why should they? In these proposals, they are adequately protected.  They will not be called upon to perform any work or service that is not reasonably comparable with the work in which they are now engaged. I suppose one can make a case for almost anything but anyone who uses common sense in regard to this proposal will see that it could not be conceded by any stretch of the imagination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister speaks of the employees of the existing Commission being treated generously. I have certain notions as to what is generous and it is perfectly obvious that the Minister's views and mine on the subject of generosity are poles apart.  All the staff get under this section is that they will continue to be employed.  I suppose the Minister would regard the fact that they are not going to be dismissed as the height of generosity.  Under the Bill:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(10) (a) Where immediately before the commencement of Section 12 of the Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Act, 1961, a person is employed as an officer or servant of the Commission, that person, after the commencement of the said Section 12, shall continue to be employed as an officer or servant, as the case may be, of the Commission and shall be employed on such terms and subject to such conditions as the Commission may determine (including terms and conditions in relation to remuneration and allowances for <Col N="589" /> expenses) being terms and conditions not less favourable than those subject to which he was employed immediately before such commencement, but the office or position held by him may be changed and his duties may be changed or rearranged.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think it is generous not to worsen conditions of existing employees?  If that is the Minister's idea of generosity, we should revise our view of some of the things the Minister says because evidently he is not speaking the same language as we speak.</P>
    <P>The Minister then says it is provided in the section, but he does not refer to it, that they will not be called upon to perform duties which are not reasonably comparable&mdash;that is the very point&mdash;with those they have performed before this Bill came into effect.  That is the very thing we want to safeguard, that they will not be so called upon and if they are, by reason of the exigencies of the service, it is desirable that they would be properly remunerated and properly compensated for it.  It will not do for the Commission to point to the subsection and say: &ldquo;You are being paid as much now as you were paid before this Act came into operation.&rdquo;  That will not do if people have to do work which merits a ten, fifteen or twenty-five per cent. increase in salary.</P>
    <P>The Minister finds it difficult to see how one could determine whether a person was doing different duties or whether he was doing more onerous duties than previously and says that what we are seeking in this amendment would require an arbitrator to stand by to decide whether they were different duties from what they were doing before.  That is not being sought <Col N="590" /> at all: when the Commission and the person or persons on their staff have been unable to compose their differences, it will be a matter for the arbitrator appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In case the Minister is in doubt, it might be pertinent to remind him that in 1958, during his term of office as a Minister of the Government, we passed the Transport Act, 1958, relating to C.I.E. staff and an Act relating to the G.N.R. staff, in which we provided that if people were called upon to do duties under the rearrangement, or as a result of the introduction of these Acts, which were not analogous to or reasonably comparable with the duties they were called upon to perform prior to the introduction of these Acts, they would be paid compensation of such amount as the Board of C.I.E. agreed was appropriate and if the employees did not agree, they could go to the standing arbitrator.  The Minister was inclined to pour scorn on the idea that differences in responsibilities could be assessed by the arbitrator who, he said, was going to stand by to see that the employee was fairly dealt with.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that here by Act of Parliament&mdash;let us be quite clear about what we are doing&mdash;we are interfering with the conditions of service or the contractual conditions of certain employees&mdash;I did not know how many, nor am I concerned&mdash;and the contractual relations of certain people in this State and making no provision to compensate them.  We should be clear about that, and the Minister does not want to make any provision to compensate these people if they are called upon to do more work for the same rate of pay as a result of the establishment of this Commission&mdash;and the Minister calls that being generous.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), line 33, before &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the widows or orphans of such officers or servants,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the section which empowers the Commission to prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme or schemes for the granting of pensions in respect of officers or servants of the Commission on such terms as it may think fit. The purpose of the amendment is one which, I hope, will commend itself to the generous spirit of the Minister.  Its purpose is to make provision in the scheme, which I presume will be a contributory scheme, for the payment of pensions to widows and orphans of officers or servants of the Commission.</P>
      <P>I must make a slight complaint about the manner in which the last two amendments have been debated. I feel rather forlorn and abandoned by my colleagues on the Labour Panel on the opposite side of the House.  We would have expected that Senator Carter, who is a representative of the Labour Panel, Senator Ryan and Senator Ahern would at least, if they did not support the amendments, indicate by way of a consolation prize that they thought they were unnecessary. I hope Senators Carter, Ryan and Ahern will support this amendment, which I trust will have some appeal to the humanitarian side of their constitution.</P>

      <P>I cannot see any reason why this amendment cannot be accepted.  I may be in order perhaps, in referring to a Bill already circulated to us, and debated in the Dáil, the Bill in relation to the superannuation of judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Courts and the District Courts.  One of the purposes of that Bill is to make provision by which the members of the judiciary can allocate part of their pensions to their wives or to a dependant. The Minister for Finance has introduced that Bill and last night it got a speedy Second Reading in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>When it comes to providing pensions for prospective widows and orphans, no one will do anything to stand in the way of people helping themselves. If this amendment is accepted, the Commission will be empowered to prepare a scheme which will enable the staff to pay a contribution, amongst other contributions, to finance their wives and children, in the event of their becoming widows and orphans. I do not think there is anything further to be said except to express the hope that the Minister will be softened by this amendment and that he will at last accept an amendment.</P>

The amendment proposes after the word &ldquo;servants&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;or the widows or orphans of such officers or servants&rdquo;.  That would be merely granting to the Commission the right, in trying to put forward a scheme, to put forward a scheme to cover widows and orphans.

      <P>Only occasionally.  This is not a Party amendment.  It really is not contentious. Obviously, it should be supported and we are grateful to the Senator for putting it forward.  It is certainly a principle which we ought to recognise, that we are concerned not only with the pension rights of officers or servants, but also with those who will become, in the event of their early deaths, their widows and orphans.  I should like, therefore, to support the amendment and to express the hope that the Minister may find it possible to accept it.</P>

      <P>According to my information, there is no specific provision in any pension scheme for widows and orphans.  I suppose we could all make a case as to the desirability of making provision for every conceivable occurrence or eventuality.  I have no doubt that we could go a long way to justify it. The contributory schemes designed so far do not contain any such provision. All these schemes are designed as a result of consultation and discussion between the parties concerned.  It is desirable that there should be a degree of uniformity, and I do not feel this is a matter which should be provided for in this separate fashion.  If a case can be made, then it should be a case on the broad basis.  Since no legislation in the past has contained such a provision, I must resist this amendment.</P>

      <P>With respect, the Minister is not quite correct in that.  I remember a Bill sponsored in this House by the previous Government.  It was a special measure <Col N="594" /> to enable a civil servant to give up portion of his pension in order that his widow would receive a pension after his death.  The Minister for Finance at the time made the point that this step was being taken after consultation with the civil servants.  As Senator O'Quigley has pointed out, this principle has been recognised in a Bill now before the Dáil in relation to the superannuation of judges.  There is a special Bill&mdash;we will probably be getting it in a few weeks' time&mdash;to allow judges to set off against a lump sum a certain amount for the sake of providing for their widows.  It is not strictly true to say that no such scheme has emerged in law because we had a special Bill for civil servants designed to do precisely what the Minister is being asked to do here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one thing to provide for such a contingency in a scheme. It is another thing to insert a provision covering the position in a Bill.  According to the note I have before me, provision can be made in the scheme itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, since it has proved necessary in the case of judges to bring in a special Bill to allow them to do this, I feel that unless we put in a permissive clause here, it may be necessary later to bring in a special Bill to allow the employees and servants of this Commission to do the same thing.  Would it not be simpler to put in a simple permissive clause which will not bind the Commission but which will permit them to do it, should they wish to do so?</P>

      <P>The Minister uses the phrase &ldquo;in respect of&rdquo;.  The phrase occurs in subsection (1) and the Minister uses it for the purpose of saying that there is already power under that subsection to provide a scheme of pensions for widows and orphans.  If that is the case he is making, then he ought to accept this amendment because the amendment puts it beyond any shadow of doubt that the Commission can devise a scheme of pensions for employees and for the widows and orphans of employees.</P>
      <P>If that is not the case the Minister is making then it becomes necessary to speak at somewhat greater length. The plain fact of the matter is that there are certain major contingencies in life for everybody.  One of them is fire; we all insure against fire.  We all try to insure against death.</P>

Death, as far as the staff of the Commission are concerned, is a certainty.  There will be widows and there will be orphans. It is not just one of the other conceivable eventualities to which the Minister referred and we ought to take time off in this Bill to have some regard for these unfortunate people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington is quite right in his reference to the 1956 Superannuation Act.  That Bill was introduced by the previous Government. I do not take any particular credit for that on this side of the House because the Bill would have come from any Government in power. These things evolve in course of time.  At any rate, I recollect with pleasure that it was introduced.  The case made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington on that occasion was that the provision being made was inadequate.  He may not recollect that now, but some of the good that people do lives after them.  A specific piece of legislation had to be introduced at that time to fulfil the purpose intended.  The new Bill circulated in relation to superannuation <Col N="596" /> for judges gives power by way of separate Act of Parliament to judges to allocate part of their pensions to their widows or a dependant.  There are no two ways about that.  That is the fact.  I am quite satisfied&mdash;I trust Senator O'Reilly and Senator Lenihan will bear me out in this&mdash;that there is no doubt at all that subsection (1) as it stands does not permit or authorise the Commission to prepare a scheme covering the widows and orphans of the staff of the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a Party issue.  The amendment suggested is a permissive provision.  There is a growing awareness amongst salaried workers generally of the desirability of and the need to provide pension schemes for widows and orphans. Sometimes that is done by way of an ordinary superannuation scheme and it is provided that, if an employee dies, certain benefit is payable to his widow and orphans.  At other times, it is necessary to provide a separate scheme, apart from the superannuation scheme proper.  One might have two schemes &mdash;a superannuation scheme and a widows' and orphans' scheme&mdash;running simultaneously, the employees contributing to two different funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not asking the Minister here to provide that there shall be such a scheme for the employees of this new Commission.  All we are saying is that it would be prudent to make provision so that if the Commission and their employees should at any time think it desirable to introduce such a scheme, they would not find themselves debarred from doing so.  There may be a difference of opinion between the lawyers as to whether or not the position is covered, but, surely, since we are putting through this legislation, it would be prudent to insert a permissive phrase such as that suggested. There is neither politics nor high principle involved.  It would be generous <Col N="597" /> of the Minister to permit the phrase to go in.  It can then be left to the Commission to decide whether or not they want to introduce such a scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that they can in fact prepare such a scheme. What I am being asked to do here is to provide that they must.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister is misinterpreting.  This is a permissive section.  We are not trying to force anything down anybody's throat at all. The Commission can introduce a scheme, if they so desire.  The Minister says he is advised that the section as it stands would allow them to do that, anyway.  If that is so, why then have we had to have amending legislation in the case of other superannuation schemes?  Where the legislation provided for the setting up of superannuation funds, it has been necessary to provide that they could also make provision for widows and orphans.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that it would be possible to interpret it as meaning, in relation to an officer or servant who retires, that provision might be made under this possibly taking into account dependants and so on, but it quite clearly says &ldquo;on retirement to or in respect of&rdquo;.  It seems to be conditioned by the phrase &ldquo;on retirement&rdquo;, whereas, with the amendment, the clause would read thus:</P>
      <P>The Commission may prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme or schemes for the granting of pensions, gratuities and other allowances on retirement to or in respect of such officers or servants or the widows or orphans of such officers or servants, of the Commission as it may think fit.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that that could not be making it mandatory and the Minister is not justified in saying that we are seeking to force them to take widows and orphans into account.  We are seeking to allow them quite specifically, beyond all doubt, to take into account widows and orphans in any pension scheme, whether on death or on retirement.</P>

      <P>The Commission may prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme or schemes for the granting of pensions, gratuities and other allowances on retirement to or in respect of such officers or servants of the Commission as it may think fit.</P>
      <P>That is the first point.  The pension is payable on retirement to officers or servants of the Commission.  Read it again:</P>
      <P>The Commission may prepare and submit to the Minister a scheme or schemes for the granting of pensions, gratuities and other allowances on retirement to or in respect of such officers or servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>It does not include death unless you stretch language and say that people retire from this world on death.  In any event, the pension is payable to such officer or servant.  It does not say &ldquo;the widows or orphans of such officers and servants.&rdquo;  There is no doubt whatever in my mind that widows and orphans are not covered by this section, that they are not covered in any similar section.  The Minister has not pointed, as doubtless he would if he could, to other sections or other schemes which in fact have been interpreted under analogous provisions to cover widows and orphans. It has not been done.</P>

      <P>I just make that remark as an opening sentence.  The Widows and Orphans Pensions Act, 1936, the first provision of that kind on a global basis for this country to cover the social welfare classes, as they are now known&mdash;insured social welfare classes&mdash;was passed by the Minister's Party.  I feel that that group of people, <Col N="600" /> covered nowadays up to £800 a year, are reasonably covered.  When you go above that figure&mdash;and it is a very modest income nowadays&mdash;you have a gap and many of the people employed by this Commission would be likely to be in that gap, that is to say, the gap between £800 a year and whatever is required before people can make provision for themselves.</P>
      <P>I do not know what real objection the Minister has to accepting this amendment.  I suspect that it comes, possibly, from the Pensions Section of the Department of Finance.  There has been an ancient custom that all pensions sections in Bills have to be approved by the Pensions Section of the Department of Finance.  This kind of provision is made only to a limited extent and in a very gradual way.  For example, under the new Bill&mdash;I say this with respect&mdash;some of the most highly paid people in the State are covered.  I understand professors are covered also.  So I have heard.  I do not know it of my own knowledge.  I do not see what real objection the Minister has to accepting the amendment except the control which is exercised over him by the Department of Finance.  I am not taking any sides on the question of the interpretation of this clause because, quite frankly, I cannot interpret it and I do not mind being honest about it.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), lines 7 and 8, to delete &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would shorten the discussion by indicating that he will accept this amendment?  Seeing that there is no response, I had better discuss it.  There is a fairly well-known corpus of cases in which it is generally agreed that the Department of Finance has a right to insert in a Bill a section to the effect that they are to be consulted; in other cases, their consent must be obtained.  What I am about to say now I say genuinely: it beats me how the Department of Finance can come into the question of grading bacon.  I take it that the grading of bacon by the Department of Finance will be done by correspondence. The Minister's Department will write to them.</P>

If they had put <Col N="603" /> in the qualifying clause there &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo; I could say, just as there are to be certain arrangements for subsidy, and so on, you might well put in the Minister for Finance at that point.</P>
      <P>Quite frankly, it beats me.  I came upon this entirely by accident in the Bill.  I do not understand what connection the Department of Finance has with the following:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Commission may export bacon of such grades as may be specified by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance from time to time.</P>
      <P>I can understand the Minister specifying grades of bacon from time to time. He has an adequate staff for the job. He has specialists or he can employ people or he can do it by arrangement with the bacon curers but I do not understand how the Department of Finance comes into the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance are not directly concerned with the grading of bacon but they are concerned to support the sale of bacon abroad.  For example, at present they support the following classifications of bacon, namely, Super Grade and Grade A.  I cannot give the exact relationship as to the percentage of the total sum they contribute to the sale of what surplus bacon we have of these two grades. They are brought into this section for the very good reason that there are other grades of bacon.  There are inferior grades of bacon.  Naturally, if they are to provide a substantial portion of the money necessary to give the support, they want to know from time to time just what they are being let in for.  I am not here to defend the Department of Finance but I think it <Col N="604" /> is the most reasonable thing in the world that they should do that.  I confess that if I had the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, I would insist on knowing where I stood in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides that a fixed sum is to be provided from some source, and that source is the Department of Finance, to enable the Commission to engage in this business.  Suppose they were not to be consulted.  The Commission, with my consent, could agree that several other types and classes of bacon could be included and the Department of Finance could be presented with a bill which would be entirely out of line with what they would regard as a fair commitment on the part of the community.  I do not see anything at all mysterious about this nor do I see anything at all unreasonable on the part of the Department of Finance in asking for the opportunity of from time to time seeing the extent to which a commitment was being entered into on their behalf.</P>

      <P>It may well be that my objection to this section, as drafted, relates to the logical placing of the subsections.  Is it not the case that if this qualification had been put into subsection (4) it would there be related to price, which is the significant matter?</P>

      <P>If the Minister will listen, I shall develop the point. &ldquo;The Minister shall fix prices for each form of bacon...&rdquo;  It may be that my reaction to this section was brought about by the placing of the qualification, as I see it, in the wrong subsection, from a logical point of view.  Certainly, if it had been put into subsection (4), I could understand it.  To put it mildly, it is an unfortunate matter that such grades must be specified by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>It would not look quite so ridiculous because we would not have to make the equation that the Minister made so skilfully&mdash;the equation that bacon equals money. The words mean the same thing in this context.  We would not have to make that equation if the qualifying clause had been inserted in the fixing of prices because prices are stated in terms of money.  Prices are not stated in terms of bacon though different grades of bacon may have different prices.  If the Minister wishes to keep this subsection where it is I shall not press him to take it out but I think there has been a misplacing in the drafting of this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the cardinal policy going through everything in present legislation which has to do with finance; but it is a new conception of the functions of the Department of Finance that it may specify the grades of bacon to be exported &ldquo;in the form of Wiltshire sides or major cuts thereof which include the back.&rdquo;  I could quite see <Col N="606" /> the consent of the Minister for Finance being incorporated in this section, if the Commission were exporting on their own; but once you have a responsible Minister of State, such as the Minister for Agriculture, who is a member of the Government, involved in this, it becomes an absurdity to bring in the Department of Finance on the question of considering what grades of bacon are to be exported.</P>

      <P>We all know that. Is fíor sin.  But have a look at Section 28.  This section says in subsection (1):</P>
      <P>There may be paid to the Commission in each financial year out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas a grant or grants of such amount or amounts as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the Commission in relation to its programme of expenditure for that financial year, may fix.</P>
      <P>If the Commission say: &ldquo;We are going to export so many thousand Wiltshire sides in a particular year,&rdquo; is it not under Section 28 that the consent of the Minister for Finance would have to be obtained?</P>
      <P>I said on Second Reading something to the effect that I did not think this was a Bill that would either kill or cure the bacon industry.  It will certainly leave it jogging along in much the same way as it has been for the past few years.  If the Department of Finance are going to regulate the export of bacon and it is going to be dependent on the well-known parsimonious approach of that Department to financial matters, it is quite certain the Bill, as drafted, will not produce any kind of staggering figures in relation to the exports of pig meat and bacon.</P>

      <P>It is hard to understand all the fuss being made about Section 23.  As the Minister has stated, this Bill deals solely with exports. <Col N="607" /> Where the grant of money to support the sale of certain grades of bacon in the export market is concerned, it is quite evident that the Department of Finance must come into the Bill in the appropriate sections dealing with the various grades of bacon.  I can see, therefore, no objection to the wording of subsection (1) of Section 23.</P>
      <P>Section 23 is complementary to Section 25.  It provides for the making of arrangements for the export of bacon.  Therefore, no objection can be taken to the fact that the Minister for Finance is mentioned in subsection (1) and, indeed, in subsection (4).  It is inevitable that that Department will be mentioned because it is the Department of State that handles the purse. As far as I can see, having regard to the state of the markets abroad, it is the purse that helps to sell our bacon. We should not lose sight of that.</P>

One section of the Bill empowers the Commission to investigate and survey and study reports in relation to markets, potential markets and market conditions for bacon and other pig-meat and pig-meat products &ldquo;in the State and outside the State.&rdquo; Another section says it will carry out investigations into the provision of improved types of bacon and other pig-meat products.  Whatever the Minister for Agriculture may know about this, the Minister for Finance knows very little.  Too many cooks spoil the broth, and I think that is what will happen in this instance.</P>

The Commission are being empowered to export on the British market the grades of bacon principally exported there. The purpose of that is to cure the principal flaw the Advisory Committee on Marketing found in regard to our bacon exports to Britain, that <Col N="608" /> is, the lack of continuity of supply.

Quite frankly, I do not understand why this qualifying clause was put in here.  The Minister has drawn my attention to Section 28.  The Minister for Finance is mentioned twice in Section 28.  I do not want to be offensive about it, but this is an example of people interfering in something about which they know little or nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The power in Section 28 is quite fair and reasonable, but the Department of Finance, apart from the information the Minister may give them, are in no position to come to any conclusion about the state of the bacon market in Britain or in this country and the Minister will have his staff to advise him.  So will the Commission, and they will be informed by the bacon curers generally, and yet we have this extraordinary clause put into a section which deals with the exportation of bacon by the Commission. I know how it got in here and how this kind of clause gets into a Bill. I think the Minister was a bit too soft <Col N="609" /> with the Department of Finance and he should not have allowed them to put these words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo; in this subsection of the Bill.  I do not think they are properly there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Second Reading, I have given this section a great deal of thought.  Has the Minister power under this or subsequent sections to allow a subsidy to be given or a grant-in-aid to be made to other forms of bacon and pigmeat other than Wiltshire sides or major cuts thereof?  In Section 27, I can see that he has power to assist in advertising and even to purchase retail shops in Britain and to do a hundred and one other things but I have not seen the power that would allow him to make grants or to subsidise bacon in other ways.  The intention of the Bill, particularly when it deals with pre-packaging, trying to diversify as much as possible and to sell whatever will be in demand, is to sell pigmeat or products in whatever way is most desirable.  That will not happen if the machinery is not available to make it remunerative, or as nearly remunerative as possible for the people who are doing it.  For example, it took the previous Pigs and Bacon Commission quite a long time to devise machinery for subsidising pork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I raised about the bacon being properly marketed is brought even more pertinently to our notice by the big seminar being held at the Gresham Hotel, I think, for the past couple of days.  A number of very well-informed people on the marketing of food products are discussing self-service and packaged bacon, etc. While some of us might have been a bit more conservative about this development than we should be, I think it is going to come more quickly than we all thought it would.  Many thought it would take about 10 years for such a development to come about <Col N="610" /> and in fact those best informed in Britain thought the same thing, but the amount of publicity given to this type of marketing might bring it along sooner.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister adequate power to allow him to make rules or regulations to subsidise bacon in whatever form it may be to our best advantage to export it?</P>
    <P>I think the assurance the Minister has given in regard to the preservation of the invaluable trader-to-trader relationship, while speaking on this section during the discussion in this House and the other House, should convince anyone that this valuable asset can be preserved and, at the same time, secure the benefits of central marketing and get over the difficulty of weak selling links.  The difficulty about traders who are not in a position to deal with these matters in an effective way has been overcome and I think the Minister's assurances are adequate in this respect.</P>

I raised it on Section 23 because the first subsection to Section 27 begins by mentioning the provision of publicity and the powers of the Commission, as it says in the marginal note, in relation to the development of markets for bacon and other pigmeat and pigmeat products. I thought that might be held to be a purely marketing and promotion section rather than a section giving power to assist financially.</P>

      <P>The Bill gives powers to the Commission, with the consent of the Minister, to provide for the preparation, packing and marketing of bacon in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f).  Specifically in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), this is in relation to bacon sold to the Commission. I want to ask the Minister whether these are powers given to the Commission generally in relation to bacon, the packing or grading of bacon, or the materials used in packing bacon or whether they are restricted to the materials used in the packing of bacon sold to the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a few points particularly in view of what was said on the Second Reading in this House.  It is in the public interest that what I say should be said.  During the past decade, public taste in all countries, including Ireland, has led to a demand for lean meat.  Anyone with experience of meat knows it is the meat that is reasonably prime rather than the meat that has a high percentage of leanness that is the better keeping.  Whether it was beef or mutton or fowl, what we knew in the past as the prime or finished product was the better keeping product. Today there is a world demand for loan meat.  I have seen lamb in Smithfield market&mdash;not Irish lamb&mdash; which I know, a decade ago, would probably not have been passed for export by the Minister's veterinary officers but it commanded the highest prices in London because of the demand for lean meat.  That sort of meat does not hold as long as the meat that is properly finished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the other point, which I think Senator O'Quigley raised, about the keeping quality.  With the development, the world over, of refrigeration, cold counters in shops and &ldquo;fridges&rdquo; in every other house, the public demand has been for an extra mild bacon.  That demand is in England and in Ireland.  It often happens that both the wholesaler and the retailer may hold bacon before putting it on the market and the easiest person to blame is the person who has processed and cured the bacon.  But <Col N="612" /> perhaps the bacon has been around for anything up to two weeks before it is put on sale and perhaps it was not kept under the proper conditions.</P>
    <P>That is one of the difficulties and the marketing officers of the Minister's Department are well aware of that problem.  They have even suggested that when larger quantities of Irish bacon are going to Britain, particularly to places like London and further away, perhaps such bacon should be shipped in insulated containers so that these difficulties could be overcome.</P>
    <P>At this point, I want to refer to a report of the British Pig Industry Development Authority which has been considering these problems very seriously.  They have come to the conclusion that there are other things besides the problem which the curer has to deal with.  There is the method by which the pig has been fed.  Years of tireless research will have to be undertaken before any of these problems are fully understood.  I shall just quote a few lines from paragraph 50 of the 1960 Report of the Pig Industry Development Authority:</P>
    <P>There remains an immense gap in our scientific knowledge of quality in meat, and of the precise ways in which it is influenced by the breeding and management of the pig. There is also a dearth of research (apart from that undertaken by individual firms) into the question of meat processing.  Little more can be done in these fields until facilities for meat research are created and the necessary workers trained.</P>
    <P>Let it be said that here in Ireland a move has been made towards giving these facilities and perhaps we shall be even more ahead than they are in Britain.  A link is now being forged with the Agricultural Institute and an association has been set up composed of bacon curers, meat exporters and canners, in co-operation with the Agricultural Institute and with the support of the Department of Agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just finish the point I am making in a moment.  The section does deal with the methods and manner of packing and preparing bacon to be sold.  I will not go any further than necessary but I will say, in conclusion, that both the Department of Agriculture and the bacon curers are well aware of what has to be done and it is in the public interest to say that defects in quality, which become apparent from time to time, arise from causes which in the present state of scientific knowledge, cannot be pointed to but they know what they are looking for and with the help of the Agricultural Institute and other bodies co-operating with them, I believe they will find part of the answer, and perhaps the whole answer, to these problems as soon as anybody else.</P>
      <P>We have also been able, recently, to become associated with the British Food Manufacturers Research Association and with our own knowledge and their knowledge, some of the causes of complaint that have been made in this House and in the other House will be obviated.  It is well that the people should not think the Agricultural Institute and the bacon curers, as well as those engaged in the meat trade, were unaware of the problems they were up against and for which they are on the high road to finding a solution.  It is well the public should know those things because it is reassuring to know that work is being done to solve these problems.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important sections of the Bill because the packaging of bacon, the sacking placed around bacon, as far as its sale in this country is concerned, has often been open to criticism.  This section, according to the marginal note, deals with the preparation and packing of bacon.  It is very advisable that the packing or packaging of bacon which we export should be an important consideration because if the packing is not better, if there is not a better system of packing than the system used on the home market, it will not be conducive to the better sale of our product in England <Col N="614" /> and elsewhere.  All aspects of the material going out are important, the bacon itself and even in regard to what Senator Burke referred to, the taint, or anything else and the feeding of the pig and the product produced thereby.  We all know of the difficulty in regard to fish taint in bacon, which I hope is at an end now.

      <P>I should like the Minister to give me some information as to the substance of subsection (3) which reads:</P>
      <P>Regulations made under section 45 of the Principal Act in relation to the packing of bacon and the materials and packages to be used for the packing shall not apply in relation to the packing, or the materials or packages to be used in the packing, of bacon in relation to which regulations made under this section apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between &ldquo;packing&rdquo; and &ldquo;packaging&rdquo;, the wording is rather confusing.  I expect that regulations previously <Col N="615" /> made were so inapplicable to modern conditions that they would not apply or should not apply in the paragraph of the section.</P>
    <P>I presume that pre-packing would cover dry freeze goods for which there is such an immense opening for traders.  Everything possible should be done in the care and transport of goods pre-packed in some of our up-to-date factories.  It would be a pity if any subsequent error in dealing with pre-packaged products in transit by rail, sea or air occurred to damage the sale of our products in any foreign market.  The wording of subsection (3) is rather hard to follow, but I hope it means that the restrictions imposed will be more restrictive and effective than they were under regulations dealing with packaging and packing of material for export.</P>

I asked the Minister if he was empowered to assist the export of bacon in any way, other than in the form of Wiltshire sides and major cuts.

      <P>In the dying hours of the reign of office of this Government, after four years, we find Fianna Fáil now introducing this Bill.  Ireland was not represented at the Food Fair held in London last year.  A letter appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of September 25th, 1960, headed: &ldquo;I went to see the Irish Stand at the Food Fair&mdash;but there wasn't any!&rdquo; The letter is from an Irishman in England.  We have often said in the past that if we could only get our Irish people who have emigrated over the past ten or 12 years to buy our Irish products, they would make a wonderful contribution to the farmers of this country.  The letter reads:</P>
      <P>It was with very real interest that I went along to the International Food Fair in London.  I spent some pleasant hours going from one national stand to another, each displaying a bewildering variety of foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>All the agricultural nations seemed to be there: from Ghana in Africa to Japan in Asia. The Communist bloc countries were represented in force with attractive displays by Poland, Hungary, Rumania, East Germany and others.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir, it does.  I want an assurance that this money will be properly used in the future.  We were told four years ago that £250,000 of the taxpayers' money was being set aside to encourage marketing.  I am speaking now, about three years after that sum of £250,000 was set aside, when Ireland was not represented at the Food Fair in London, on our very doorstep, where there are 50,000,000 people crying out for our food, and we are the nearest nation to them.  I hope there is an improvement and that the money being devoted under this section will be properly spent and that Ireland will be represented at the Food Fair this year.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (d) of <Col N="618" /> the section empowers the Commission to carry out experiments and so on, in relation to the new and improved types of bacon and other pigmeat and pigmeat products.  It appears to me to be relevant to inquire from the Minister whether in fact this section relates to the activities of the Commission within the State?  The emphasis so far has been on what the Commission will do in relation to the export market.  We have a market here at home which is very valuable to pig producers and bacon curers and we ought not to do anything that might tend to reduce the size of that market. Indeed, our objective should be to try to increase it.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether or not he considers there is a problem in regard to the type of bacon reaching the Irish housewife.  I receive complaints from time to time from both housewives and shopkeepers.  The shopkeepers complain the bacon they receive is not of the proper quality.  I am speaking now of quality only.  I am not at the moment concerned with prices.</P>
      <P>Will the Commission have any power under this section to enforce certain standards in relation to bacon for consumption at home?  I should like to know also whether the Commission will have any authority in relation to sausages and puddings.  There are frequent complaints about sausages.  If the Commission have no authority, has the Minister any authority to raise the standard and improve the type of pigmeat products reaching Irish consumers?  If the Commission have such authority, I hope the Minister will see to it that they will be encouraged to exercise such authority.  While we are all concerned about our export market, we ought not to allow ourselves to end up in the position in which the home market will diminish and the increase in the export market will merely have the effect of balancing the loss on the home market.</P>

      <P>With regard to one of the points made by Senator O'Quigley there are 40 bacon factories in the country and there are at least four times as many sausage manufacturers.  If a retailer does not like the quality of the products he gets, the most effective way of ensuring an improvement is to buy from somebody else.  That will ensure an improvement more effectively than any Government control.  Unless we become a totalitarian State, no Government can control such matters by regulation. They are controlled by customers' selection.  That is the most effective control.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister a question and, with all due respect to the Chair, I am quite in order in the point I made previously.  Section 27 (e) provides that the Commission shall:</P>
      <P>establish, equip and operate, and provide for the establishment, equipment and operation of, and assist, financially or otherwise, in the operation of, showrooms, information bureaux, and similar establishments, in the State and outside the State, designed to promote the increased consumption of bacon and other pigmeat and pigmeat products and to promote increases in the quantities of bacon and other pigmeat and pigmeat products exported from the State,</P>
      <P>I claim I was in order in raising the point I raised and I think I am entitled to an answer.  Ireland was not represented at the Food Fair last year.  Does the Minister think Ireland will be represented in future at international Food Fairs in London?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That has no relation whatsoever to this section.  The section is identical with other provisions of a similar character in other Acts.  The same powers are being given as were given in the Act establishing An Bord Bainne.  It does not follow that all these powers will be exercised.  It does not follow that any particular form of publicity or advertisement will be undertaken.  It does not follow that we shall have displays at Food Fairs, or anything of that kind.  It merely <Col N="620" /> provides the means by which certain things can be done if the Commission think it wise to do them.  I think even the Marketing Advisory Committee had their doubts as to the advantages of these displays.  While it is only right that there should be power to do these things, it is only natural that those who have the responsibility of taking a decision should ask themselves whether or not they are worth it or whether or not the benefits to be derived from the expenditure involved justify such a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been some talk about the price of bacon in Britain. For some considerable time past, if you add the A Special and the A bacon and take the mean, Irish bacon is among the first three or four national brands of bacon marketed in Britain.  I think it well to state that because there is an enormous amount of publicity if Irish bacon happens to meet a bad market.  It generally meets a bad market for the same reason as cattle, sheep, or anything else.  If 50 per cent. more than is required arrives on the market, the price is bound to fall.  It is well that people should know that.  This Bill is designed to promote a more orderly marketing of our bacon.</P>

Senator L'Estrange was saying that there were a number of amendments put down to this Bill, none of which was accepted by the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister recalled this evening the fine speech he had made in the Dáil justifying the failure to give proper and adequate representation to the producers.  He will also have a fine recollection of the number of amendments put down to the Bill which established An Bord Bainne.  Out of 60 amendments, if my recollection is correct, there was not one to command the sympathetic consideration of the Minister.  The Minister, on an inconsequential Bill relating to dogs, accepted amendments. He always holds himself forth as a reasonable man that on that particular Bill he accepted an amendment.</P>

      <P>Yes, a Chathaoirligh, and I propose to do so.  What I am saying is that in this Bill we have, first of all, a body which is supposed to enter into the export market.  This Bill, the Minister has told us on one of the recent sections, is concerned exclusively with exports of bacon to Britain and the Minister's antediluvian conception of how to increase exports of bacon to Britain is by having these conducted by a commission.  I do not <Col N="624" /> think there could be anything more laughable than the idea of a commission engaging in commercial activities.</P>
      <P>The next thing we found was that the Minister remained resolute in his opposition to any change in the constitution of the Board and even in the one thing which is absolutely essential for the working of any body such as this.  One of the essential parts of the machinery for the export of bacon and pigs from this country in future is that there should be a staff which are relatively contented and well provided for.  The Minister has taken particularly strong action, even against incorporating in the Bill a permissive power to provide pensions, payable by the staff themselves and by the Commission out of the funds at their disposal, for widows and orphans of the staff.</P>
      <P>On Section 28, I think, we were referred by the Minister to the generously worded sections in which the Board were being vested with all classes of powers which they need not use.  That was the argument which we addressed to the Minister on Section 22, that it was a permissive power to be incorporated in the Bill, a power which the Commission might not be able to use, which the staff might not want the Commission to use but which, none the less, should be put into the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister can reflect now with satisfaction on and regale his companions at a later stage, with not alone the fine speech he made justifying the inadequacy of the representation of the producers, but also the fact that, granite-like and solid, he stood against all classes of amendments and that when he had said: &ldquo;This is my Bill: this is the way I want it&rdquo;, of course he had it.  Of course, he did have it with his machined majority and the Senators opposite docilely walked into the lobby and did not even dare to express, upon a matter such as widows' and orphans' pensions, a contrary opinion.  The only opinion we got was from Senator Carter at a late hour of the evening but it was not on the matter on which he might have been expected to speak as a person elected to this House on the Labour Panel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already referred to the repeal of the 1947 Act.  As far as the law on the subject is concerned, it is quite clear that the 1947 Act, in so far as it could be repealed, has already been repealed by the Electoral Act of 1959 and nothing that Parliament can do on this Bill can undo what was done by the Oireachtas in 1959.  That Act is repealed and not alone is it repealed by the 1959 Act but it is necessarily repealed by the provision in the Constitution which says that within every 12 years, the constituencies must be revised.  They have been revised, wrongly, it has been found, but none the less revised.  Some of them were correctly revised and others were not.</P>
      <P>Consequently, I do not see why in subsection (3) we provide for the repeal of the 1959 Act when part of that Act is already valid.  The only thing that is effected by the 1959 Act, the Minister tells us, is that we are repeating Section 6 which is contained in the 1947 Act, presumably repeated, according to his amended version of what took place, in the 1959 Act.  The most of this Bill, with the exception of the Schedule and subsection (3), is the same as the 1959 Act.  The Minister has not yet indicated to my satisfaction what has been the view of the Government, upon what I fear will be the failure of the Oireachtas to revise the constituencies once in 12 years.  If this is an amendment of the 1959 Act, it can be said that the 1959 Act and this Act constitute the revision of the constituencies within the 12 years prescribed by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we repeal completely the 1959 Act &mdash;the first division of the constituencies <Col N="630" /> as far as the law in the statute books is concerned appears in 1961&mdash;there is very little doubt that the provisions of the Constitution relating to the revision of constituencies not less frequently than once in 12 years have not been carried out by the Oireachtas. I should like the Minister to consider at this stage whether or not we ought to repeal that portion of the 1959 Act which is good.  It may be said that that is all technical.  Of course it is technical.  It is a very technical matter as to whether or not you are drunk in charge of a car because with the breach of a particular section of an Act, you may perhaps find yourself lodged in jail.  All these things are technical.</P>
    <P>No amount of arguing that they are technical will get away from the fact that every day we must observe technicalities as, for instance, in the driving of a car.  Once we have a written Constitution, the members of the Oireachtas ought to see to it that, in so far as they can, having wrongly revised the constituencies in 1959, they will bring themselves within the terms of the Constitution by amending the 1959 Act rather than by completely repealing it, as has been done in Section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's point would seem to imply that if there can be a continuation of a legal wrangle on this measure, it would be to his liking and desire.  The 1959 Act did exist and as such the revision was made within 12 years.  We are again revising the constituencies in 1961.  I wonder whether that might not answer the Senator's questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the abstruse reply by the Minister because it is not a reply to my observations. The 1959 Act, I think his argument runs, did exist and the constituencies were therefore revised within 12 years.  The Minister should know (1) that the High Court decision in the action giving rise to this Bill invalidated only certain sections of the 1959 Act and (2) that it is provided specifically in the Constitution that where an Act is challenged and found to be unconstitutional, the Act continues, except <Col N="631" /> to the extent to which it has been found invalid.  That is good law.</P>
      <P>The 1959 Act, apart from Section 3 (1), Section 2 and the Schedule, is good law.  It is the law as of the moment by virtue of the provisions of the Constitution.  Consequently, on Section 9, we ought not repeal that which is already good and valid and is the law, particularly if we want to make any kind of a show of conforming to our written Constitution.</P>
      <P>The second point made by the Minister is quite childish.  When we see the Minister trying to sidestep these constitutional provisions, it can become quite amusing.  He says the constituencies were revised within 12 years.  When the recent census is at hand, there is nothing to prevent the Oireachtas, say, this time next year, from revising the constituencies again. Probably it will be very necessary to do so.  The drop in population, according to all indications, will be so glaring as to require a revision of the constituencies within a year.  The 12-year period to which the Minister refers is the maximum period outside which we ought not to go.  It is for that reason that I suggest that even at this late stage the Minister should reconsider the position and redraft this so as to leave the 1959 Act substantially as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I pointed out to the House on an earlier stage that the suggestion of leaving the 1959 Act, or what was left of it, would merely mean that only Section 1, the definitive section and Section 2, the section dealing with the number of members, would remain of that Bill. Why should we get &ldquo;het up&rdquo; about retaining just those two provisions when it is much more workmanlike to repeal the entire Bill and start afresh?  Surely that is a much more sensible procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Section 5 would also stand?  It provides that the Ceann Comhairle will not have to contest the Clare constituency.  I understood from the Minister that this was a repeat of the 1947 Act and presumably it is contained in the 1959 <Col N="632" /> Act.  If that be the case, if the Minister is right on that&mdash;I did not ask him about the other sections&mdash;why are these not also left in the 1959 Act which could be amended by this Bill? The Minister thinks it is much more workmanlike completely to repeal the 1959 Act and re-enact this Bill.  That may appear to be the practical thing to do but it is not the constitutional thing to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a long debate in the Dáil on the question of Cork.  The main objection seemed to be as to why the Minister decided to put rural areas such as Rathcooney into the Cork city constituency and to take out what were certainly suburban areas of Cork city, namely, the Blackrock and Douglas areas.  Why did the Minister do that and was there any geographical reason?  I do not claim to be a master of Cork geography.  It would seem logical to group rural people together and city people together.  That has not been followed in this alteration.  Naturally, the suburban part of Cork houses the people who commute daily into the centre of the city rather than people who commute from farms outside.  It would appear that there is a grave mistake here and that Rathcooney should have been kept in a rural constituency and Blackrock-Douglas left in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position was that in the constituency of Cork city, as delineated by the 1948 Act, there was a population of over 112,000.  Five seats require a population in the <Col N="633" /> region of 100,000.  Therefore, it meant that between 10,000 and 12,000 should go from that area to some other area. That is what happened in this case. However, the amount taken out brought the constituency of Cork below the limit for five seats and the adjoining area of Rathcooney, smaller in population, was brought in to bring the figure for the new city constituency to the tolerance limit for a five-seat area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by the Minister's reasons.  You find that around the country he has drawn divisions up and down by-ways and has divided streets.  All that has been done in the interests of complete equality, we are told.  Why then must there be an exception in the case of Blackrock?  Why could we not have taken only the portion necessary, in order to leave as many urban people as possible voting in an urban area and, at the same time, leave as many rural people as possible voting in a rural area?  The divisions that have been made amply demonstrate the Minister has not followed the line he is now giving us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>would have desired to put down <Col N="635" /> an amendment that there should be a Louth-Monaghan constituency but I went to the Leader of our Party and to a Party meeting, and so that this Bill would not be delayed, and knowing the Government would not accept that amendment,</P>
    <P>&mdash;because they had stated they would not&mdash;</P>
    <P>I was instructed, and accepted that instruction, not to put down the amendment.  The reason I mention that is the accusations levelled across the floor by Senator Ó Maoláin to the effect that we would be very happy if this election were delayed for two years.</P>
    <P>&mdash;in other words, he is following his leader, the Taoiseach&mdash;</P>
    <P>No amendment, outside those for Dublin, has been put down expressly so that this Bill would not be delayed because, quite frankly, we are very anxious to get at them.</P>

      <P>I notice that the average population per member for the Clare constituency is 19,294.  That is 833 short of the national average per member.  That is perhaps one of the largest discrepancies from the national average in the whole revision.  I suppose the Minister would probably take the view that Clare should probably get the most favourable county treatment, having produced, as it did, the man who was for so long the beloved leader of his political Party, but it does strike one that this figure is not in accordance with the law as it is declared to be at present.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Government might have appealed to the Supreme Court and have not done so does not alter the fact that, here and now, as far as the authoritative interpretation of the 1937 Constitution is concerned, that authoritative interpretation is contained in the High Court judgment in the action which gave rise to this Bill. That judgment laid it down that figures of that magnitude were not correct and that it was possible and practicable, on the admissions of the Minister who was called as a witness by the Attorney General, to get a much closer adherence to the national average than 1,000 or even 500 since the populations of villages, townlands and streets were compiled separately and available in the Central Statistics Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> When one comes to consider Dublin or any other constituencies, and consider amendments, there is evidence that this House should address itself to the problem of getting some information made available to it in order to be able properly to discharge its constitutional responsibilities.  On the Second Stage, I specifically addressed a question to the Cathaoirleach, a question which he chose to ignore.  The only person who can deal with the business of this House on behalf of members is the Cathaoirleach and the question was what steps the Cathaoirleach would take to see that members were provided with such information in relation to the populations of towns, villages, and streets as would be necessary to put down amendments to this Bill.</P>
    <P>As far as Dublin city and county are concerned, it is quite impossible, once you have townlands and streets, to formulate an amendment unless somebody makes the information available.  Following on the disgraceful speech of the Minister&mdash;about which we shall have something more to say&mdash; on the conclusion of the Second Stage debate, no member of any Opposition Party would be encouraged to approach him or his Department for any information. They would never know but that the Minister on another occasion would say: &ldquo;If you say anything about this or that, I shall tell what you said or that you came to me looking for information in connection with the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1961.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As regards the Clare entry, so far as the authoritative interpretation of the Constitution is concerned at present, it is to be found in the judgment of O'Donovan v.  The Attorney General.  The Minister, in this case, cannot say that the Supreme Court will deal with this matter.  He says he has nothing whatever to do with sending this to the Supreme Court and neither have the Government.  That is so.  The Minister is clearly not doing this on the basis that the Bill will be tested in the Supreme Court because the Minister has no function, as he correctly said, in regard to sending the Bill to the Supreme Court for a declaration as to its constitutionality.  Here we have the Minister, in spite of the clear declarations in the judgment which gave rise to this Bill, doing that which is not in accordance with the judgment.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, on the first occasion on which he replied to a Question in the Dáil, addressed to him by the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, said that the Bill would be framed, taking into account&mdash;that was was the phrase he used&mdash;the judgment of the High Court.  I thought at the time that showed a reluctance to accept the restrictions imposed by the Constitution as interpreted in that judgment. That phrase did not find its way into the Taoiseach's reply by accident.  It was quite clear that, smarting under the defeat in the courts and being unwilling to accept it, that was the best the Taoiseach would do and that is all they are doing in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituency of Clare, having regard to the interpretation of the <Col N="639" /> courts in the judgment to which I have referred, is not in accordance with that judgment.  If the Minister thinks that judgment was not right in that respect, that it went too far in that respect, then the Taoiseach could have advised the Attorney General that the Government wished to have an appeal taken in the Supreme Court.  That would have been the correct way to go about it.  This, certainly, is not the way to implement what is the authoritative interpretation of Section 16 of the Constitution in the judgment in O'Donovan v.  The Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a long dissertation, together with some waspish comments, by Senator O'Quigley in regard to the Clare constituency.  Incidental to that&mdash;rather was the Clare constituency incidental to what the Senator wanted to say on the Bill generally&mdash;we have the Senator pointing out to the House that his interpretation of the judge's interpretation of the Constitution is the correct one and everybody else is wrong.  What is now being put to the House is not the judge's interpretation of the Constitution but Senator O'Quigley's interpretation of the judge's interpretation of the Constitution.  I do not agree with that interpretation of an interpretation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two sections of the Constitution were adjudicated on by the High Court, as the Minister well knows.  One section is abundantly clear and a figure of between 20,000 and 30,000 of the population per member is laid down.  In the Clare constituency which we are now discussing, there is a figure of less than 20,000 people per member.  I do not want to interpret anything; I merely want to make my clear statement.  If I interpret that and say it is unconstitutional, the Minister will say that that is Senator Donegan's interpretation of the judgment of the Supreme Court.  I am not going to refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court, to any interpretation or to anything else.  The Constitution says that we should have one member per 20,000 to 30,000 population and in this case we have not.  Will the Minister explain that?</P>

      <P>If there is any point in trying to explain it, I shall certainly try.  The 20,000 to 30,000 reference is the indicator or the measure by which we can ascertain the greatest or least number of Deputies it is constitutional to have.  It does not follow that if a figure departs from 20,000 or 30,000 either above or below, that in itself makes that constituency unconstitutional.</P>

I am interested in the Constitution which says you can range from 20,000 to 30,000 of population and we have not got the ratio between 20,000 and 30,000 in the Clare constituency.  Can the Minister explain why he did not therefore add to Clare constituency a small parcel of votes as he did elsewhere?</P>

      <P>The number of members shall from time to time be fixed by law, but the total number of members of Dáil Éireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be relevant to point out that the interpretation of the Minister's predecessor in office, the Minister for Local Government in 1935, Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly, was to the effect that no constituency should be allowed to drop below 20,000.  The Minister, in 1935, as I read out the other day&mdash;there must have been a tremendous sense of urgency and alarm in his voice when he spoke&mdash;found that there were five or six constituencies which were actually below 19,000, and, I think, 13 below 20,000.  That was the interpretation of an exactly similar provision in the 1922 Constitution and that alarmed the Minister for Local Government in 1935.  His successor, <Col N="641" /> the present Minister, now tells us that Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly was wrong in 1935.  Senator Donegan says that there should not be one member for 19,000 and if the Minister is going to put him in the category of those who talk nonsense, then he will take his seat with the Minister for Local Government, in 1935, Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly, former Tánaiste and President of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be quite wrong for us to let this entry pass without a few sentences about it.  The natural division between east and west Donegal is a straight line from Carrigart to Ballybofey.  I looked at it many times and I calculated the population <Col N="642" /> for the district electoral divisions and so on.  Now we have this line turned on its axis, so to speak, and not only turned on its axis, but an axis which has several dents in it.  It is like the toys which are made with a &ldquo;wobbly&rdquo; pair of wheels.  The same can be said for the line which runs north-west to south-east in Donegal.  It is only right to say that the axis is in accord with the Constitution.  There is no question about it, but it is not the natural axis that would hit anybody studying County Donegal.</P>
      <P>In the old constituency, the division line ran fairly straight from north to south and it would have been quite easy to shift that line eastwards so many miles.  At any rate, the only criticism I notice in the Minister's remarks in the Dáil of the suggestion that the line should run from Carrigart to Ballybofey was that it would run within a few miles of a large town, Letterkenny&mdash;four miles, I think.  That is quite an ordinary feature in these constituencies.  I am sure Senator Lenihan is aware of one change in that connection at any rate, where the town of Carrick-on-Shannon was formerly on the very boundary.  Several of them were on the very boundary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them have, naturally.  I think it is fair to say that this axis in Donegal was not drawn in the place where one would naturally be inclined to draw it and that a good deal of thought went into the particular axis that has been drawn in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly is refreshing at this hour of night on this stage to hear Senator O'Donovan educate the Minister for Local Government as to where the axis of any division in Donegal should or should not be.  For the Senator's information, the only natural or near-natural boundary that could be said to exist in Donegal, if there is to be a division in it, is the old constituency boundary which was put into the 1959 Act.  Two-thirds of its line has in fact been in existence <Col N="643" /> since some time in the 1880's.  In addition, if any further weight were needed to indicate that this line, as we have known it for a number of years, was something more than just the whim of fancy of somebody who came to draw the boundary of the electoral divisions for the purposes of local administration, it may be pointed out that the boundary coincided completely with the boundary between east and west Donegal of old.</P>
      <P>As for the suggestion that a straight line drawn from Carrigart to Ballybofey would seem to meet the requirements of the Constitution, and also seem to be the obvious line, I do not know where the Senator got the idea that my objection to such a line would be that it came near to Letterkenny. It is true that it would come very near Letterkenny but that, in itself, would not be an argument.  What I think is a very definite argument is that Letterkenny is less than a mile from the estuary of the Swilly and if we bring the boundary, as is suggested, from Carrigart to Ballybofey, south of Letterkenny but near it, we will have a small corridor connecting north Donegal with the north-western portion which lies south of Lough Swilly.  That invisible line was suggested during the hearing of the court case.  That was suggested at that stage&mdash;and, in fact, it was even drawn out on the various maps and overlays with which we were provided during the case&mdash;and at one stage so ridiculous was the suggestion that if it were carried out, a peninsula would have been made into an island in the south-west constituency, which would belong to the north-east constituency, and one would have to go through the south-west constituency to get to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a projection of the type of line Senator O'Donovan has been talking about, very good humouredly, I must say, but nevertheless, lest the cold record might seem to imply that that was a sensible line, or that some sinister motive could be attributed to the line that now exists, I want to say here and now that the line that has been drawn &mdash;the present boundary&mdash;is in all the <Col N="644" /> circumstances the best line that could be found and drawn, while it is far from being, in my estimation, a practical solution to the problem.  I do not think it is a practical solution in any sense of the word, but in all the circumstances in which it has been brought about, if it had to be done in some way, I think that is the best way in which it could have been done.</P>

      <P>We have heard to-night about divisions in Donegal, and we heard a lot about them when we were dealing with the 1959 Act.  I must confess I am a little disappointed that in dealing with Donegal, we are talking about divisions at all.  Surely it would have been more sensible and much easier to give Donegal one constituency. There are minorities in Donegal.  The Minister knows far more about them than I could ever learn, but it would be much more to the credit of the Government and the Oireachtas, if there were no divisions in Donegal.</P>

      <P>It is with reluctance that I would mention the question of minority representation in Donegal or anywhere else, but now that it has been brought up, let us be quite clear about it.  The division as it was took care of the minority representation in Donegal. If in the future the situation is that they no are no longer represented, the blame should be put where it belongs, and the finger should not be pointed at the Minister for Local Government, or the Government, who have had regard at all times, in all things and in all ways, to the rights of that minority and of all other minorities in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy suggested that the obvious and sensible solution would be to join east, west, north and south Donegal together.  That is not a sensible solution.  I do not doubt that Senator Murphy makes that suggestion in good faith, but I should like to point out that the constituency of North-East Donegal as it now is, and with the divide in the county, gives a mileage of up to 100 miles.  Has anyone stopped to think what it would have been like in a constituency stretching from the point of Malin Head in the north to the boundary at Leitrim in the south? <Col N="645" /> That is a matter on which I have felt and still feel very strongly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It would not give to the people of Donegal as a whole the best, the fairest, or equal representation. That is why there are two constituencies in Donegal.  While we are on that subject, we should not be too sure that the minority as such will not retain its representation in Donegal. That may be information for some of the Fine Gael people who might begin to feel the draught if they felt it might do so.  Let us keep in mind that the minority which is talked of, whether or not it has representation elected by itself and for itself, will be completely, fully, comprehensively and fairly represented by those Deputies who are elected in that part of Donegal at the next election.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong this debate but the Constitution is concerned with representation of the people and not with mileage Deputies have to travel.  If the Minister is really concerned about the minorities, he could remedy the situation simply by having one constituency in Donegal.  It is all right to say they will be represented, but in this State in which we are living, and with our traditions, we should lean over backwards to ensure that minorities have representation. Even if that made the job of Deputies more difficult in regard to travel, it would be better that that should be so rather than that the minorities should be deprived of representation in Dáil Éireann.</P>

It was an excellent and honest contribution.  The suggestion that, because a member of the Fine Gael Party, in his private capacity, took an action in the law courts, it was our fault there was a likelihood that the minority might lose its representation is, in my view, not only dishonest, but mischievous, hurtful and harmful to the country.</P>

      <P>He gets into bad humour and gets a bit nasty.  I can understand that and I hope that it will not interfere with the good relations <Col N="647" /> which members of my Party on this side of the House will have with the Minister in the future.  It is with a certain sense of delicacy that I rise to speak on the subject of the Minister's home county.  I do not intend to make any reference now to anything that has taken place anywhere else.</P>
      <P>On every possible occasion that offers, the Minister tries to squeeze in something of advantage to himself and his own Party in discussing this Bill.  I should like to refer to the suggestion made by Senator Murphy that Donegal should be converted into one constituency. The Minister professes a hypocritical concern because minorities may lose representation in the next Dáil and he says that the blame for that will not be his and ought not to be placed on his shoulders.  If he is concerned about minorities&mdash;I venture to suggest that he is not&mdash;I should like to know why he did not adopt the policy so clearly adumbrated by the present Taoiseach on the occasion of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill when he said at column 1283 of Volume 51:</P>
      <P>It is perfectly true in theory that the larger the constituency the better chance you give to the smaller minority groups to get a representative elected or an individual candidate to become a member of the Dáil.  If the sole concern that is to operate in the minds of Deputies is to secure adequate representation for minorities it might be argued that the larger the constituency the better.</P>
      <P>If the Minister and the Government are concerned about giving representation to minorities in Donegal, it is perfectly clear from that that the proper thing to do is to convert Donegal into one constituency of six seats.</P>
      <P>Another point arises on that.  The present representation in Donegal is based on the 1956 Census of Population and warrants two three-seat constituencies. What will happen if the recent census discloses that the population warrants only 5.4 or 5.5 members instead of six?  Clearly, there will then have to be one constituency and part of some other county will have to be brought in.</P>

      <P>I gather from the Minister that the natural boundary justifying drawing a line down from north to south appeared in 1800.  The Minister said, at any rate, that it was there since 1800.  The Minister said that such a line would involve Deputies travelling 100 miles from one end of the constituency to the other.  Under the 1959 Act, the greatest distance from the bounds of Leitrim to Horn Head coastguard station was 78 miles and in East Donegal, the greatest distance was 77 miles.  Would the Minister tell us now by how much the 78 and 77 miles respectively have been increased as a result of redrawing the constituencies? If the blame is to be shifted about by the Minister and if dreadful things come upon the people of Donegal, and the country in general, as a result of implementing the provisions of the Constitution&mdash;that is all it is&mdash;I should like the Minister to tell us by how much the 78 and 77 miles have been increased as a result of this new division?</P>

      <P>I should like to emphasise&mdash;the Minister has heard it <i>ad lib</i> in the other House&mdash;that there is a genuine feeling on the part of many people that some other method should have been adopted with regard to the division of the constituencies south of the Liffey.  A position should not be tolerated which allows the greater part of the population of Ballyfermot to be placed in the county. From the point of view of representation, the 1959 Act was better than the present arrangement, because, under it, Ballyfermot was removed from the county and brought into the city, but, of course, the population in South-West was altogether too high.  I appreciate that there is a difficult problem involved but I find it hard to believe that some other and better method could not have been found which would not have resulted in an area like Ballyfermot being included with agricultural areas in County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only comment I should like to make there, and possibly it is only fair that I should, in order that confusion may be removed, is that we are not putting Ballyfermot with this allegedly agricultural area in County Dublin.  We are, in fact, taking part of Ballyfermot out of the agricultural County Dublin and bringing it into the city because up to the present the total area of Ballyfermot ward has been part of the County Dublin constituency. In this event, we are taking only part of it in and part of it remains where it was.  It is the part that is remaining where it was that has been complained of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are difficulties, as the Senator has suggested, but we should be quite <Col N="650" /> clear that we are taking in part of Ballyfermot, rather than sending part of it out to the wilderness of the agricultural area of County Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister feel that there could not be a better method than the method he adopted in relation to Kildare and surrounding counties? It does not seem to me that the method adopted is logical.  If the Minister can convince me that there was no other way he could have done it, I shall be very much obliged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator, I am sure, will have perused the various figures in so far as this new Kildare constituency is concerned.  He will also, I am sure, have found out by now the figures of population that are being taken into the Kildare constituency from Meath and Westmeath.  From that, he will be able to agree with me that Meath as it stood and as it is as a county constituency under the 1947 Act was too large by approximately 7,000 odd of population for the three seats which it has.  It follows also that if it was too large by 7,000, it was too small by approximately 13,000 to add a further seat to it.</P>
      <P>Westmeath, which is part of the constituency of Longford-Westmeath, would again show that the population of the present Longford-Westmeath constituency would be too small for five seats by roughly 12,000 or 13,000 and too large by 6,000 or 7,000 for four seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> So, we had the situation arising that Longford-Westmeath was being reduced to four seats, that it has approximately 7,000 too many to be allowed to remain in, that Meath also had 6,000 or 7,000 too many to be allowed to remain in, that the two lots put together and added to Kildare would bring Kildare up to a point where an additional seat could be added to it.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what has been done and the present situation is that Meath retains the three seats, which is the minimum it can have; Longford-Westmeath has four seats, to which it had to be reduced, and the surpluses of population from both of these constituenies under the 1947 Act have been added to the Kildare county constituency, giving us the present Kildare constituency with an additional seat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my main contribution on the position in Louth and Monaghan on Second Reading. On that occasion, the Minister made the statement that if he had taken this number of votes from Louth, he would almost have to dissect the county, that he would have to go right into the centre of the county to take the number <Col N="652" /> of population he required for Monaghan.  I do not at all accept that. There are two things that must be considered. One is that, if the Minister had not done what he did with regard to Kildare, if he had, perhaps, taken from other surrounding counties&mdash; Kildare is not a seaboard county&mdash;he would have left himself in the position that he would have had 3,000 to give Meath and 3,500 to give to Louth, without disturbing the town of Ardee.</P>
      <P>Neither do I accept that he could not have gone farther north if he needed to give portion from Louth.  I believe sincerely it would have been better, if he had to take portion from it, to take a rural portion because an entity such as Ardee, as I have explained, should in fact relate to the county in which it stands because it does so much business with it.  It would have been quite possible, if he had preserved for the county of Monaghan a portion of the excess in Meath, to have given a small portion from Louth which would have brought the number required for Monaghan up to the desired figure.</P>
      <P>I also believe that it would have been much easier to go north than to take the town of Ardee.  I believe an injustice has been done here and, no matter what the Minister may say, I think it would have been practicable, and I have shown that it would be practicable and possible, not to have removed from Louth the town of Ardee and at the same time to give Monaghan its proper quota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Donegan should know Louth pretty well but he suggests that there is no difficulty whatever in taking 3,500 from Louth, leaving Louth the town of Ardee.  Has the Senator bothered to consider that taking 3,500 from the Louth population of 69,194 would leave a figure of 65,690 odd? Has he considered that that in turn would give a ratio per member for three seats in the remaining part of the county of 21,890 or 21,900, that the national average of which we have been hearing so much to-night is 21,127 and that the amount by which the national average is exceeded in this case is much greater than the greatest amount by which any other constituency ratio per member exceeds that national average at the moment?  In other words taking only 3,500 from the Louth population would leave us with a member ratio in Louth which, in the circumstances of this Bill, could not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection has been made that Louth should not lose anything at all. I put it to the Senator that he differs far from the Deputies he complained about the other night in that he did not <Col N="654" /> think it worth his while to go to the High Court&mdash;although he has made plenty of noise about it since&mdash;  voice his belief that Louth should be left as an entity, whereas one of the Deputies slandered by him the other night, Deputy Faulkner, did go and give evidence to back up his beliefs and his convictions.  Furthermore, he is not going around now crying because this calamity has come upon Louth. He did his best to avoid it but the Senator did nothing about it.  He would like now to make it appear that he is the only man who is sorry about it and that nobody else bothered about it.  The suggestion he has made is absolutely without basis and certainly would not stand up to the legal eye of his colleague, Senator O'Quigley, when it comes to comparing it with national averages, and so on.</P>

The Minister is very good at taking something one says out of its context and pinning it down very firmly.

He could have given from Meath to Monaghan and on the Meath-Monaghan border such parts as would give him his correct figure in Monaghan, in Louth and in Meath. There would have been no difficulty about it at all if he wanted to get down to national averages.  Again, I do not accept that the Minister is tied to this national average.</P>

      <P>And I do not think the court has decided that.  I must take up this question as to whether or not <Col N="655" /> I went to the High Court to object to Louth being interfered with.  In the first instance, I did not know nor did the Minister know&mdash;unless he had made up his own mind, as he probably had&mdash; how Louth would be interfered with. Secondly, I was not called as a witness by those who were seeking to have this Bill declared unconstitutional.  The Minister called Deputy Faulkner as a witness&mdash;and it is relevant for me to tell you that he did call him as a witness&mdash;and the Deputy gave good evidence.  The Deputy was called as a witness for a set purpose.  It was to prove that this area of Louth which at the time had only one T.D. for 23,165 people, could be served by a smaller number of T.D.s in relation to the number of people, even though the Minister for External Affairs had been away for 93 days&mdash;I think that was the quoted number&mdash;on his duties overseas. The purpose was to prove that while Louth was one of the places where there were fewer T.D.s in relation to the people, that was quite permissible.</P>
      <P>That was the reason why Deputy Faulkner was taken there.  He gave good evidence.  He did not succeed in his evidence but he was taken there for the purpose of showing that Louth should not be bisected, that Louth should be left as it was.  He was brought there for the purpose of showing that because of the absence of the Minister for External affairs, it was possible with fewer T.D.s in the county to serve the area.</P>

      <P>I have stated he volunteered to come to court in order to give his knowledge and the benefit of his experience to the court, to convince the court, if it were possible, that Louth would be better left as an entity rather than broken up as it is now. Senator Donegan did not so volunteer. The Senator now would say, in respect of the original idea of 3,500 being sufficient to take off and to leave the town of Ardee in Louth, that for some peculiar reason, he would not mind getting rid of part of Louth which lies south of his own home stamping ground, that it should be &ldquo;hooshed&rdquo; into Meath and that we could further imbalance the population ratio in Meath to the degree that we could then break Meath and put part of Meath into Monaghan.  Surely the Senator does not expect the House to take that suggestion seriously?  Surely the two breaks he suggests would ultimately be a greater upset and a greater nuisance to more of our population than one group going into the adjoining county of Monaghan?  He suggests taking a portion of Louth and putting it into Meath and then taking some part of Meath and putting it into Monaghan.  Why not adopt the easy approach of giving part of Louth to Monaghan where they adjoin each <Col N="657" /> other, which is what is being done? The Senator has no argument when he says that less could have been taken, because the area suggested to be taken by the Senator would not have brought about the situation wherein the ratio per member would come within the permissible limits.</P>

      <P>I should like Senators to understand exactly what the position is.  When this Bill goes through, nobody in Ardee town, the place I am defending, can vote for a Louth Fine Gael candidate.  No one person in Ardee town can do so.  I suggest that the Minister could quite easily take from the Louth-Meath border a slice of rural area and so allow part of Meath to go to Monaghan.  What we are talking about now is people who could vote for a Louth Fine Gael candidate. Therefore, in fact, if you talk about personal politics, I am talking all the time against myself.  I sincerely believe that the Minister did not have to remove the town of Ardee from Louth. I am quite certain he need not have done so.</P>

      <P>The Senator now says that there was no need to touch Louth at all, that we could have looked at Louth and said: &ldquo;There are 69,000, odd, people in it.  What should the average be?  We will divide Louth by three, which gives us 23,000.  Now we will divide 23,000 into the total population of the country and mulct the rest of this country's constituency boundaries so long as we start off with Louth and settle it and its needs.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Next, it is said the Minister is responsible because he fixed the total number of Deputies, which has some relation to this matter but a rather vague relationship, as the Senator put it.  Section 2 deals with this matter.  I did not hear the Senator object.  I did not hear any opposition to it. I do not see any amendment down to throw it out or to amend it, nor was there any challenge in this House on the Committee Stage.  Let us stop talking nonsense.</P>

      <P>The Minister can play all the tricks he likes but he does not have to look at Louth and decide not to touch it and then mulct the rest of the constituencies for that purpose. He has to decide the proper number. If he had decided on a greater number of persons per Teachta Dála, Louth would have been left as it is.  Nobody knew what would be the position in the court case.  There is no use in saying to us that an amendment was not put down or this or that was not put down.  All Fianna Fáil wanted us to do was to create so much trouble over this Bill and to delay it so long that the general election would be delayed for two years.  Is that not so?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The three constituencies impinge on one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the last day that I thought the conception of the old Principality of the Decies had been gravely damaged by the way the Minister had divided up that constituency.  He took 6,411 of the electorate of West Waterford and put them into South Tipperary. Afterwards, I read his speech here in the Seanad.  He told me, at Col. 541 of the Seanad Debates of 25th May, 1961, that the population of Waterford was only 74,000 and that he would be brought before the courts if he did not apply the provisions of the Constitution in this matter.  He did not refer to the fact that Carlow-Kilkenny had a surplus of 6,160 on the basis of the figures in Clare. Would not the sensible way of dealing with that matter be to put some of the northern suburbs of Waterford into <Col N="661" /> the Waterford constituency?  That would be an area whose people work in factories in Waterford and for whom Waterford would be their centre.  They are at present in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency.  The Minister had 6,160 to play about with there.</P>
    <P>The population of South Tipperary constituency is four times 20,674, which is even higher than the Carlow-Kilkenny average.  There would appear to be a surplus of about 5,000 in South Tipperary on the basis of the Clare assessment.  Therefore, if the Minister felt he was taking too much from Waterford, he could have taken a thousand from South Tipperary and it would not have affected the situation. But what he did was to take a long, narrow finger of land and go as far down as Youghal Bridge.  In consequence, he made many of these people vote for people on the other side of the large range of the Comeragh Mountains, away altogether from their natural boundaries and associations.</P>
    <P>The Minister in no circumstances can justify what he has done to Waterford, except purely on the basis of political expediency.  You need only get a sixpenny map at Woolworth's to see how ridiculous the thing is.  The two constituencies touching Waterford &mdash; Carlow-Kilkenny and South Tipperary&mdash;both have surpluses on the basis of the Minister's Clare estimates. He could have made some minor adjustments which would have allowed the traditional Palatinate of Tipperary, which afterwards became the county of Tipperary, to remain a six-seat constituency and Waterford to remain a four-seat constituency.  But that would not have suited, because there are five Fianna Fáil Deputies in Tipperary and there never would have been five Fianna Fáil Deputies elected on that basis again.  It is so obvious that there is no good trying to put a skin on it, because there is no skin to cover it.  The 6,411 people in Waterford have been completely disfranchised as a result of the Minister's action, and we will not be without telling him that when the time comes to tell him.</P>

      <P>Perhaps, if they followed up what they are saying, they would not have a leg to stand on, unless it be their own political purposes. They seem to see a sinister purpose in every line that has been drawn and every boundary, old and new.  I suspect strongly that in every instance these objections are based on their own political motives&mdash;that it is politics from the Party point of view which is motivating these criticisms. However, all these words sound empty on the Committee Stage of a Bill on which no amendments have been put down as an alternative to what is proposed.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke, like others who talked about Tipperary and Waterford, is now shedding copious tears for the sundering of part of the constituency of Waterford from the remainder. There may be method in this approach. Being concerned about the welfare of these people being transferred to South Tipperary might lead them to believe that the person who makes the most complaint on their behalf is their best friend when the election comes around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But let us look at the alternatives to Senator Burke's suggestion which, in the last analysis, means the creation of a further six-seat constituency by joining the two Tipperarys together.  Leaving that aside, there is the suggestion that we should have added part of Tipperary to Waterford in order to retain the four seats in Waterford.  Is Senator Burke one of those who believes that would be the proper thing to do?  Is he <Col N="663" /> satisfied that part of the town of Clonmel should be brought into Waterford and that the people in that part of the town should henceforth vote for Waterford Deputies and that they should not be allowed to vote for anybody from Tipperary?  Would he, on the other hand, have Carrick brought in or would he have part of the country north of Carrick brought into Waterford along with Carrick? Would he go within four miles of Tipperary town to avoid taking in part of Clonmel or would he take in any part of south-west Tipperary?  Would he agree that we should go northwards in South Tipperary to within four miles of Tipperary town and add it to Waterford to retain the four seats in Waterford?  Unfortunately for the people making these arguments without backing them up, there must be an alternative.  Does Senator Burke like any of these alternatives?  Does he prefer any of them to what is being done?  Would he be as voluble in South Tipperary pushing any peculiar alternatives as he would appear to be here?  Possibly he will have something to say about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to amendments.  Senator O'Quigley asked the Cathaoirleach what facilities would be given in regard to the statistical data necessary for Senators to put down amendments in the precise manner demanded in the House.  The Cathaoirleach did not give the Senator any assurance that this material which was necessary for that purpose would be made available to members of the House.  I believe it should have been made available.  I spoke to Senator O'Quigley about putting down an amendment and he said it would be ineffective, without having the resources that should have been made available to the House.  That is why I did not put down the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I suggested to the Minister was that the sensible thing would have been to put the north suburbs of Ferrybank in with Waterford.  They are normally part of Waterford city.  The people of Ferrybank work in Waterford and it is their own environment.  Only 3,000 <Col N="664" /> people need be taken over and very minor adjustments are all that would have been necessary to give Waterford a number in line with the number which was thought sufficient for County Clare.  There would have been no necessity to put the 10,697 in Clonmel urban into Waterford because Waterford would then have a very considerable surplus of about 7,000 over the ratio that was used in Clare. If the whole of Carrick urban were put in, there would still be a surplus on that basis.</P>
    <P>Putting in the northern suburbs of Waterford would have been a normal method of meeting the situation.  Any solution I suggested would have been far better than that which was adopted. From Clonmel town to Youghal bridge is 38 miles and the people of that part of West Waterford are very disappointed with the arrangements made.  That does not apply to supporters of any political Party in particular but to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour supporters in general.  All of them vehemently condemn the way in which the constituency is divided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been considerable resentment in West Waterford about the manner in which the constituency was carved up.  I was in the difficulty that I could not put forward any real alternative for what has been done but it seems Senator Burke has made a reasonable suggestion. He made his point to-night and the Minister did not meet it in his reply.  The Minister criticised Senator Burke and made what I thought were rather cheap political points.  He did not deal with the suggestion that Ferrybank&mdash;which I had thought was in Waterford constituency&mdash;could have been put into Waterford in order to retain the four seats.  Would the Minister now deal with that point and give us some guidance on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  First, I must sympathise with the members of this House who could not find sufficient information available to them to put down any sensible amendment.  Senator O'Quigley and Senator Burke apparently consulted together and decided that, in the absence of this information <Col N="665" /> or the impossibility of getting it there was no point in trying to put down any amendment.  The Census of Population which, I am sure, would be the first volume that anybody seeking population figures would think of, is in fact not unknown, I believe, in the country.  Further, in the explanatory notes which appear very early in that volume, it is clearly stated that populations of individual towns and townlands and any other information which is not already available in the volume may be had on request from the Central Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>Of course Senator O'Quigley would not know anything about the Census of Population being available and even if he had stumbled across it, he would not know that such information as detailed figures for the various small groups of population would be available, nor would he know of this clear invitation to seek further information from the Central Statistics Office which is there for the benefit of Senator O'Quigley and any other member of the public who requires this information, assuming it is genuinely needed.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Burke's point that Ferrybank should be included in Waterford constituency, this would, in fact, encroach on County Kilkenny. Carlow-Kilkenny constituency, as the House is probably aware is already getting a few thousand of population from County Wexford, a number which is not only surplus to Wexford's requirements for the purpose of retaining its four seats, but which is also necessary in order to bring Carlow-Kilkenny up the little bit it needs to retain its five seats.  The idea of bringing Waterford up from 73,000 to approximately 80,000 by dipping into Kilkenny&mdash; which in itself was just under the line but it was fortunate that there was that little bit adjoining in Wexford that could be brought in to leave Carlow-Kilkenny with five seats&mdash;would not be feasible.  If we were to take away Ferrybank from Carlow-Kilkenny to bolster up Waterford, we leave ourselves with an unresolved problem of some thousands of population in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These things have a chain reaction. <Col N="666" /> If you put into or take from any par ticular constituency and if that con stituency is thereby put out of line, no only does it affect the constituency pu out of line but in order to mend the damage done there, further damage is done to an adjoining constituency and so on.  I think this is a matter that is either wittingly or otherwise not within the knowledge of the people who make these criticisms so widely and so volubly.</P>
    <P>Adjusting one constituency, as suggested by Senator Burke would, if we could isolate it, appear to meet the situation and give us four seats in Waterford by taking in this bit of its northern suburbs.  If, as has been said, we dip into the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency and take out of it approximately 6,000 in order to build up Waterford, we reduce Carlow-Kilkenny below the figure which would justify five seats and we leave them with more than would justify four seats.  What are we to do with the surplus?  That is the type of problem that immediately arises when you try to take a single constituency in isolation. There is a consequential upsetting of other adjoining constituencies in the chain reaction I have indicated.  This chain reaction may be overlooked when the problem looks so simple in isolation and anybody talking here may be forgiven if he can think only in a personal sort of way about the problem as he sees it on his own doorstep.  Just have a thought for the difficulties&mdash;the almost impossibilities &mdash;that will be created if what may appear to Senator Burke to be a reasonable suggestion, were to be followed and where it would end before we had done with it.</P>

      <P>I was interested in this chain reaction.  It reminded me of the atomic bomb but I have no intention of throwing any missile of that sort at the Minister because he would try to catch it and throw it back at me. There are 6,160 more people in the Kilkenny-Carlow constituency than required by the average to elect a Deputy in Clare and just less than half that number would bring the Waterford constituency up to the amount required, and which is stated to be constitutionally correct, to elect a member in the Clare constituency.  Therefore, no chain reaction would result.  There is a story told that when a Kilkenny man crosses over the bridge at Waterford, he takes a penny out of his pocket and throws it into the river.  If the penny floats, he will go back but if it sinks he will stay in Waterford.  That <Col N="669" /> is an illustration of how much the people of Kilkenny like Waterford, to allay the Minister's fears that 3,000 of the people in the northern suburbs and the immediate environs of the city of Waterford would object to being brought into the city.  I think the Minister's argument does not hold water.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 22 to 26 inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to get over the difficulty which this section is likely to create.  On the last occasion, the Parliamentary Secretary indicated that it was probably unnecessary because he felt reliance could be placed entirely upon the etiquette and ethics of the judiciary, and that a judge would not hear a case which he handled as a Commissioner of Charitable Donations and Bequests which might have an adverse effect on his judicial capacity to hear the case, and that in the last resort, reliance could be placed on the well-established and well-recognised integrity of the judiciary. <Col N="672" /> The Parliamentary Secretary bad it in mind then at any rate to delete the section altogether.  He rather indicated that if such an amendment were put down, he would be favourably disposed to consider it.</P>
    <P>This section was in the original 1867 Act.  This Bill is, in the main, a consolidation of the 1867 Act, but in the light of our experience of our own judiciary since 1922, I do not think there is any necessity to have this section in the Bill.  It would be far better to rely on the well-known discretion of the judiciary, and we should not appear to make any inroad on the facilities available, and the absolute impartiality accorded to citizens on trial in relation to a criminal matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say first of all that on Committee Stage I did not at any point indicate that I was in favour of deletion of the section.  I merely indicated that from what Senator O'Quigley was saying it seemed to me that the difference between us could be more appropriately argued on an amendment to delete the section. Since then I have reconsidered the matter and I am quite convinced and happy in my mind that it would not be wise to delete the section.  I have argued in the other House and here&mdash; and I observe now that Senator O'Quigley is happy to accept my argument&mdash;that we can rely upon the etiquette and traditions of the judiciary in this matter.  That is not to say that we should delete the section because, if we were to delete it, it could be argued that membership of the Charity Commissions might in itself be sufficient to disable a judge from hearing one of these cases.  That would be so particularly if the Section were in a previous Act and were deliberately omitted from the new Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is no question but that it is a wiser course to leave the section in the Bill exactly as it is and to rely on the well settled procedure, practice, traditions and etiquette of the judiciary to see to it that the danger that was envisaged both here and in the other House, that a judge might come to try a case which he had already prejudged as a charity <Col N="673" /> commissioner, would not materialise at all.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 39, to delete &ldquo;for the benefit of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;would be advantageous to&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  In subsections (1) and (2) we find that the trustees of a charity may make certain recommendations to the Commission and if these recommendations arising in relation to the claim are to the advantage of the charity there may be a compromise.  We find in subsection (3) that when the Board have considered the recommendations, if they think fit and if the recommendations are to the advantage and benefit of the charity, the Board may &ldquo;make such order in relation to the compromise as they think fit.&rdquo;  There does not seem to be any logical reason that I can discover why something which the trustees of a charity think is for the &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; of the charity should, when it comes to approval by the Board, be approved of as something which the trustees of the charity recommend to the &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; of the charity.  By some kind of secret process, when it comes for approval by the Board, it becomes something to the &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; of the charity.  It would be far better to maintain the one set of words the whole way through and that is the purpose of amendments Nos. 2 and 4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Committee Stage, I have examined this phraseology and the use of the words &ldquo;with advantage,&rdquo;&ldquo;advantageous,&rdquo;&ldquo;for the benefit of&rdquo; and &ldquo;beneficial&rdquo; in Sections 22, 34, 35, 36 and 37.  There is a pattern clearly discernible and the House will notice that, where it is the trustees who are involved, and we are speaking of an opinion the trustees may hold, we use the words &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; or &ldquo;advantageous.&rdquo;  When it is a question of the Board doing something, however, we use the words &ldquo;beneficial&rdquo; or &ldquo;for the benefit of.&rdquo;<Col N="674" /> That pattern is preserved throughout these sections.</P>
      <P>I have consulted the draftsman and he is quite satisfied that the drafting is perfectly all right.  That is not to say that Senator O'Quigley could not justifiably argue that his particular pattern of phraseology might not be better from the point of view of uniform phrasing.  There is, however, one consideration to be taken into account in this matter.  If you change the words, in the circumstances in which you are consolidating the old Acts and carrying them forward, there is an implication that you are also changing the meaning. We do not want to change the meaning.  For that reason alone I think it is desirable to leave the words as they are, particularly when there is a logical pattern to be observed running through the various sections.</P>
      <P>As to why the particular pattern of phraseology was introduced in the first instance, I cannot say, but it might be no more than an attempt by the original draftsman to avoid irksome repetition of words or phrases.  It may be that, or it may be some reason that escapes me at the moment.  On the whole, I think the Senator might agree that there is really no difference between us except a difference in our choice of phraseology and, from that point of view, I think it would be wiser to leave the phraseology as it is.</P>

      <P>He was there in 1844, but I am referring to 1867.  The trustees may comply with opinions, advice and directions; later on in the section he forgot all about the word &ldquo;directions.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary says there is no logical reason or justification for that and the word <Col N="675" />&ldquo;directions&rdquo; was left out completely in subsection (1) of Section 21.  Equally, there is no logic for saying something is of advantage and then, through some kind of unexplained process, in the jump from subsection (2) to subsection (3) the &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; becomes a &ldquo;benefit.&rdquo;  That does not seem to me to be logical or clean drafting, or justifiable drafting, in a measure of this kind.  The Parliamentary Secretary is one of the more youthful members of the Government and I regret that he has not got the dash and sense of adventure to take the small jump required from the notion of &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; to the notion of &ldquo;advantage.&rdquo;  I do not think it need stir him out of his chair at all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 56, after &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and the same shall, as far as it is practicable so to do and where it would be advantageous to the charity, be paid out of the income of the charity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is more in the nature of a policy directive rather than a direction to the Board as to the manner in which the costs involved in the recovery of a gift shall be paid by the Commissioners. As far as practicable, and where it would be advantageous to the charity, the costs should be paid out of the income of the charity.  It is preferable to keep the corpus of any charitable gift intact.  It is well-known that solicitor's costs remain outstanding for years, despite what people may think, and in the case of charitable gifts where solicitors are employed by a body like the Board, money of that kind is as good as money saved.  It is certain.  It will come.  I think it would be right and proper to incorporate this amendment in the Bill as a directive to the Board as to the manner in which, where practicable, costs should be provided in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be asked what is the use of giving a directive to the Board?  I recollect that in the Transport Act of 1958 a directive on the lines of the one I suggest here was given to the Board <Col N="676" /> of C.I.E.; as far as possible they were to do certain things in relation to the operation of transport services, ancillary services, pay, etc., and were to have due regard to certain requirements. That was a policy directive in the Transport Act of 1958 to the Board of Coras Iompair Éireann.  Inasmuch as the directive contained in the amendment might be followed, then on that ground I certainly think it is as justifiable as the directive to which I have referred in the Transport Act of 1958.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I promised on Committee Stage that I would have another look at this.  I made inquiries from the Board, though I had an idea in advance what the answer would be.  I ascertained, beyond any doubt, that the normal practice of the Board is to do the best they possibly can for a charity in any given circumstances.  If it were possible that costs of this nature, or any other expenses, could in fact be paid out of income, thereby preserving intact the corpus of the trust or charity, that would be done.  It is unnecessary, I think, to give a directive of this sort to the Board.  Indeed, it might be undesirable.  I know enough about these matters from my own personal knowledge to know that when people are entrusted with a difficult and complex task, such as looking after charitable funds, the less they are tied the better, provided one has complete confidence in their capacity and in their integrity.  I have no doubt we have that in the Board of the Charity Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was trying to visualise for myself whether the directive that Senator O'Quigley wishes to give might in some cases have a positive disadvantage.  I think that in one case, indeed, it might have.  You could possibly have a situation arising where the income from a charity was payable to some beneficiary or other and it might be vitally important to the beneficiary to get that income.  If we directed the Commissioners in all cases to pay these costs out of income, in some cases hardship might result.  I admit that that is a remote possibility but it could happen. I am just giving it as an illustration of the fact that it is undesirable to give <Col N="677" /> a direction when it is not necessary.  I am quite convinced that it is not necessary to give any such direction here because the practice of the Board has always been, and we can be assured it always will be, to act in the best interests of the charity.  The directive therefore, is not necessary.</P>

      <P>As the House will recall, this point was discussed on Committee Stage.  I have since had the wording of this section reconsidered. I am still of the opinion that the wording as it is is perfectly all right, but once the doubt was raised, I felt it would be better to remove it. So, I am proposing to delete the words &ldquo;appearing to the Board to have&rdquo; and simply to substitute the word &ldquo;having&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) For the avoidance of the difficulties which arise in giving effect to the intentions of donors of certain gifts for the purpose of the advancement of religion and in order not to frustrate those intentions and notwithstanding that certain gifts for the purpose aforesaid, including gifts for the celebration of Masses, whether in public or in private, are valid charitable gifts, it is hereby enacted that a valid charitable gift for the purpose of the advancement of religion shall have effect and, as respects its having effect, shall be construed in accordance with the laws, canons, ordinances and tenets of the religion concerned.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 is in substitution for Section 45.  The provision in the amendment will apply irrespective of the religion concerned. The House will recall that I dealt on Second Stage with the difficulty about <Col N="679" /> Foundation Masses.  Gifts for these Masses are only acceptable in accordance with Canon Law.  In order not to frustrate the intentions of donors, we want to provide that a valid charitable gift that is for the advancement of religion shall have effect according to the laws, canons, ordinances and tenets of that religion.  In the case of Foundation Masses, as long as the Canon Law remains as at present, this will mean that the Masses will be said for a period of 50 years unless the founder has determined a shorter period.  The capital and income remaining thereafter will be applied for the celebration of Manual Masses.  If no stipend is provided or if the one sum is provided for Foundation Masses and other religious purposes, the stipend or the apportionment of the particular sum will be settled in accordance with Canon Law.</P>
      <P>On the whole, I think that the House will agree that this broader provision is better than the former Section 45.  I regard it myself as a particularly valuable piece of reform and one which should do a lot of good and which, I am sure, will be widely welcomed by the various religions.</P>

      <P>They are all related amendments.  I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 21, lines 32 and 33, to delete &ldquo;to the spirit of the gift&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the intentions of the donor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was a fairly lengthy discussion on this on Committee Stage and since that I have discussed this matter with people who are interested and knowledgeable in this particular branch of the law.  It is quite clear from the discussion, or it should be clear, that it is the intention of the donor that should apply.  That is beyond question. In the circumstances where a gift is applied other than what was intended by the donor, where you apply the gift <i>cy-près</i>, you then apply it in accordance with the spirit of the gift.  It is as plain as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must disagree with Senator O'Quigley in this.  I am afraid if we were to adopt these amendments we would almost certainly nullify the effects of Section 48 and render nugatory what we are trying to achieve in it.  We are dealing here with the circumstances in which a <i>cy-près</i> scheme can arise and the circumstances in which the original purposes of the gift shall be deemed to have failed.  It is important <Col N="681" /> that we have the two aspects incorporated in this provision.  In the first case we say that the purposes must have failed in accordance with the directions given and the spirit of the gift.  Let me explain that.</P>
      <P>There could be a case where it would be possible to comply with the directions given, in other words, with the intentions of the donor as envisaged by Senator O'Quigley, but where strict compliance with those intentions would not achieve what the donor would intend in the changed circumstances.</P>
      <P>For instance, take the case of <i>Re Robinson</i> (1923) 2 Chancery Reports where this is very clearly brought out. That case was concerned with a gift for a certain church on condition that the preacher wore a gown.  At the time the condition was made, that was perfectly in order and the preacher would in the ordinary way wear a gown; but when the gift came to take effect, it would have been detrimental to the teaching for the preacher to wear a gown.  In that case, it would have been possible to comply with the intentions of the donor, with the directions given, namely, that the preacher should wear a gown, but the spirit of the gift was that the religion should be advanced and the very wearing of the gown would have defeated the donor's object because it would have been detrimental to the services.</P>
      <P>The case brings out clearly the two concepts.  Firstly, you have the directions given and, secondly, you have the spirit of the gift.  The gift might survive on one ground but not on the other.  It is important that we should incorporate both ideas in the wording of the section, and that we have tried to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further consideration in relation to the use of the phrase in Senator O'Quigley's amendment.  It is that direct parol or external evidence cannot be introduced to prove what the intentions of a testator were.  This objection does not apply to a phrase like &ldquo;the spirit of the gift.&rdquo;  I direct the attention of the House to the case <i>In re Julian O'Brien and Others</i> in <Col N="682" /> the 1950 Irish Reports where Judge Kingsmill Moore pointed out that evidence he had excluded would have convinced him to a moral certainty as to what the testatrix intended but that the particular evidence had to be excluded from consideration.  That case strongly supports my view.  Apart from that case, however, the Senator's wording is open to the general objection which I have outlined, namely, that if the phrase &ldquo;spirit of the gift&rdquo; is not used, there are certain circumstances where the pure mechanical compliance with the terms of the gift could be achieved, and where at the same time, the spirit of the gift would be ignored.</P>

      <P>Yes, cooler than the atmosphere of chancery courts.  Nothing will convince me that the phrase which it is sought to amend is a correct one.  I never heard or read of construing a will or gathering the intentions of a testator except through construing and giving effect to the intentions of the donor.  I never heard of such a concept as gathering the spirit of the donor or the deceased testator from reading the will.</P>

      <P>No.  What is always done is to find out the intentions of the donor.  Effect can be given to that or it cannot.  That is what we are saying here.  If effect cannot be given to the intentions of the donor <i>cy-près</i> can be applied.  When <i>cy-près</i> is applied you have regard to the spirit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 25, section 55, between lines 21 and 22 to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Notice of the making of regulations under subsection (1) <Col N="685" /> of this section shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in such newspapers published within the State as the Board shall consider proper.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>It shall be lawful for trustees or other persons having the custody of any deeds or muniments of or relating to a charity to deposit them for security in a repository which may be provided by the Board, subject to any regulations made by the Board under this Act.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting in the amendment that if these regulations are to be made, we do not go to the length of laying them before either House of the Oireachtas but, from the point of view of safeguarding the commissioners themselves, if anybody complains afterwards about not knowing that these facilities were available they would be in a position to say: &ldquo;We put them in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and in the newspapers at the time they were made.&rdquo;  That is as far as a body such as the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests can be expected to go in advertising a facility. If regulations are to be made there should be some public notice of the fact.  The customary way, as far as I know, is to advertise the making of the regulations in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, saying where copies can be bought, and in the advertising columns of the daily papers.  If that is done it gives effect to the section and it requires to be done, I imagine, only once or twice in every 25 or 30 years because the same regulations will all the time apply to the custody of these documents.</P>

      <P>Section 55 of this Bill replaces Section 11 of the 1867 Act.  No regulations have in fact been made under that Act.  The Senator's amendment is not necessary because any regulations which would be made by the board come within the provisions of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947, and such regulations would be a statutory instrument to which that Act, by reason of Section 2, primarily applies. Certain statutory instruments of a <Col N="686" /> particular class may, because of their local or personal application or their temporary operation or for any other reason, be exempted from the operation of Section (3) (1) of the 1947 Act on the direction of the Attorney General.  It is clear therefore that the situation is fully covered by the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947, as amended in 1955.  Normally they would have to be printed and notified, in accordance with that Act, unless the Attorney General exempted them.</P>

      <P>Any discussion on the Fifth Stage must be concerned with what is in the Bill.</P>

      <P>One point that worries me is that amendments have been made to the Bill in the Seanad. That means we have to go back to the Dáil with those amendments.  The 1st of July is getting nearer.  It would be particularly undesirable that there should be any hitch or hiatus in the passing of the Bill into law at this stage.  Senator O'Quigley will be first to admit that it effects valuable and useful reforms and that the sooner we get those reforms passed into law, the better.</P>

      <P>I desire to say something on the Fifth Stage.  This certainly was not included in the agreement that has been spoken so much about this evening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>The agreement went as far as the Report Stage.  Senator Ó Maoláin has had the whole of his pound of flesh out of the agreement and I do not want to be pressed at this stage.</P>

      <P>Certainly, one Fine Gael Senator has kept this House in session from 11 p.m. and is now refusing to give the Final Stage, as much as he is interested in charities.</P>

      <P>The decision as to the taking of the Stage is a matter for the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the taking of the Final Stage is a matter for the House, I propose we take it now.  I do not see why we should allow one Senator to impede the business in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never seen a matter like this pressed.  Personally, I should like to facilitate the Parliamentary Secretary, particularly as he has to go away on official business next week.  Could he get someone to deal with it?  All the matters in the Bill, with which he is so conversant, have been dealt with.  The concluding Stages of the Bill are purely formal in their nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why could we not have it now if they are formal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator O'Quigley is within his rights in making that request.  The rights of any Senator, whether he be a member of a Party or an Independent, have not been set aside in this House in the past.  We ought not establish a precedent now. In my 14 years in this House, I do not remember this time-honoured custom being set aside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been a convention here, always, that we do not press to a vote in a matter of this nature on the Final Stage.  I should not like to do it now, but I should like to know if Senator O'Quigley is adamant that he will not permit the Bill to pass in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not that I want to be adamant or awkward.  The plain fact is that there are certain things I want to deal with on the Final Stage of the Bill and I have to prepare them. <Col N="689" /> I am not in a position to speak on the Final Stage now.  If the House wishes to ride roughshod over my wishes, there is nothing I can do about it, but I would not like to see that being done.</P>

      <P>Fifth Stage ordered for Wednesday, 14th June, 1961.</P>
