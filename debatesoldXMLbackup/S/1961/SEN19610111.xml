That would solve the question of procedure on this motion and motions generally of its kind, and then the matter could be discussed further later.  If the Minister has a <Col N="980" /> particular point of view as to whether he ought to discuss this or not, it would be appropriate for him to put it, if there is no objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one final point about the Bill.  I <Col N="981" /> regret that the Minister did not accept my suggestion to reduce the additional moneys by £10,000,000.  I gave a number of reasons on Committee Stage but I should like to add one other reason, that is, that the figures for sales of electricity over the past six or seven years show that sales have practically doubled.  In round terms, they have doubled. To meet that doubling of the sales of electricity, the additional generating plant brought into operation has been about 12½ per cent.  I agree with the Minister to this extent, that when there is such a situation, the day does come when more generating plant must be added.  My purpose during this discussion was to ensure that the situation which arose in these earlier years would not recur, where there must have been massive surplus plant.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in the main, made the case that there is no surplus plant at present.  I am bound to accept the suggestion that in this context within the next couple of years, there will be no surplus plant if demand continues to increase at the same rate.  However, the provision in this Bill of an additional £20,000,000 for capital expenditure on generating plant puts the Oireachtas in the position of creating a situation where if what happened before were to happen again, there would be in existence a very large amount of plant not required.  Of course, let me say straight away, that to pay the interest and sinking fund on such plant involves a great deal more now than it did seven or eight years ago.  Money is dearer.</P>
      <P>My amendment, therefore, was not put down in any spirit of opposition to the idea that the E.S.B. would always be in a position to supply electricity. I agree thoroughly with the Minister that no danger must be run of a position arising in which power has to be rationed; though indeed there might be worse things than having to ration power in that sense because, in the first instance, such rationing as would occur would take place by way of suggestion to firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the inclusion in this Bill of this very large additional capital will <Col N="982" /> not result in its being spent wastefully. There is no use in the case being made that certain individuals have been responsible for this campaign against the E.S.B.  I did not listen to any individuals about it.  The E.S.B. still has surplus plant but nothing like as much surplus plant as there was four or five years ago.  However, I think we can rely upon the Minister to ensure that this additional authority given in this Bill will not be used to instal generating plant to an excessive extent.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for the assurance that if at any time it should become apparent that plans have been made on too optimistic a basis, they will be rapidly reconsidered.  One of the difficulties on the last occasion was that the plans were not reconsidered nearly rapidly enough, and I am not apportioning blame to any particular Government in that regard.  I ask the Minister for this assurance in relation to this very large increase of 20 per cent. in the authorised capital for development purposes, because at some stage, with the whole country linked up for rural electrification, unless there is large-scale industrial development, which we would all hope to see, there will be a danger of the same difficulty occurring again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I can give Senator O'Donovan that assurance that if it is necessary to revise the programme downwards, so to speak, that will be the object of my Department and myself, in order to ensure that there will be no excess capacity or expenditure which does not result in the proper utilisation of the power plant.  I have said already, and I say again, that the consumption of power has risen faster than was anticipated when the programme was arranged for the period from now up to 1968, and the E.S.B. will probably have to revise their plans in an upward direction.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

I think it is a delaying action that we should find only today that it is to go before this Committee.  Since the Minister is in the House, he could very easily hear the case that is being put up as he has refused to hear the public representatives who have on various occasions requested a meeting with him.  This would be a very opportune time to discuss the matter.</P>

    <Title>Transfer of University College, Dublin &mdash;Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Eireann disapproves of the proposal to transfer University College, Dublin, from its existing site at Earlsfort Terrace, and is of opinion that the substantial cost involved in any such proposal would be more usefully expended in (a) expansion and improvement of the existing University buildings and facilities at Earlsfort Terrace, (b) expansion and improvement of the existing University buildings and facilities at Cork and Galway, and (c) the provision of new constituent Colleges at other provincial centers of population throughout the country.  &mdash;(<i>Senator P. Crowley.</i>)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening <Col N="984" /> before the House adjourned, I had begun to speak on this subject.  I thought for a time that the Minister's declaration would have been made earlier in the debate and perhaps there would be no necessity for intervening at all.  May I draw attention to what the Minister said?  He said the problem was extremely urgent and was particularly urgent with regard to science buildings.  He announced yesterday evening what University College, Dublin was told some few weeks ago, that there is now permission from the Government to proceed with the complete science building.  Previously permission was given for the putting up of one-sixth of a projected science building at a cost of something like £250,000, but now, in view of the urgency, the Government have been good enough to agree&mdash;and it has been stated by the Minister last night&mdash;that the College may proceed to the erection of the complete science building.  That is very good news for the College and the College is extremely grateful to the Minister and his colleagues for that decision.  It is given in the light of the extreme urgency of finding accommodation for science students.</P>
      <P>There is an increase of 400 students in the College and in spite of what has been said here that increase was not sought for, grabbed, enticed or induced by anybody in the College. About half of these students are in science and the difficulty of accommodating science students, as contrasted with Arts students is, of course, very great.  In the case of Arts, if you have 40 people in a room you can, perhaps, fit in 45, with some discomfort of course, but if you have extra science students you have to give them a certain length of laboratory table and a place in the laboratory. It involves problems of equipment and accommodation which are very difficult to solve.  That has been recognised and, to prevent a breakdown, the building has been sanctioned and will now go ahead.  University College, Dublin, can therefore rejoice in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made another statement. He said that the position was not that there were two different sites <Col N="985" /> that the Government could choose from.  In that he was quite right&mdash;I shall come to that later on.  The choice was whether to go ahead with the Belfield site or, as he put it, wait around.  What has been said, if I may say so, by most of those who spoke in favour of the motion was that we should wait around, that we should see our College practically break down, see the most important educational institution in the State&mdash; and probably in these islands&mdash;break down and wait until some very remote contingencies had arisen before we did anything about it.  That is something we simply cannot do.</P>
    <P>The whole tenor of the debate yesterday was that the matter should be postponed until it was further inquired into, until a merger has been arranged between U.C.D. and Trinity College, postponed until something else had been done.  That is to say, the people who are against the project, having been defeated in the main objective of preventing the project coming along, have now moved over to the idea that the project is all right but that it should be delayed.  The Minister has given a definite decision on that matter; the Dáil has given a definite decision on it also.  It has already been too long postponed.</P>
    <P>May I say this about the motion itself?  The motion concerns more than the buildings at University College, Dublin and Senator Crowley, in moving the motion, did so in a calm, clear and very moderate manner but I suggest to him that if he wants to advocate the establishment of a university college at Limerick or if anybody wants to advocate improvements in the facilities at Cork or Galway, they should do that without linking it up with an attempt&mdash;to use a colloquialism&mdash;to crab U.C.D. or, to use a Shakespearean phrase, to crib, cabin and confine U.C.D. in entirely inadequate buildings at Earlsfort Terrace.  The two things do not necessarily have any connection.</P>
    <P>I do not express any view on the question of a university college at Limerick.  Obviously, from the point of view of U.C.D., if Limerick were to attract 200 students from U.C.D., <Col N="986" /> that would not make any difference to the College in Dublin, but to take that number of students from either Cork or Galway would make a difference to these institution and I wish them both well.  I suggest to Senator Crowley that his moderation and interest in the matter would be served if he advocated Limerick and at the same time, allowed the U.C.D. problem to be solved in its own way.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of talk about decentralisation but nobody followed it to its logical conclusion.  It was even said, as I think somebody put it, that you should not make U.C.D. any more attractive.  That is very interesting. It is not the authorities of U.C.D. that made Dublin a capital city; it was the establishment of the State, the headquarters of the Government, of the Army, the police force and of the Civil Service and the attraction that capital cities have not only here but elsewhere, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, for university students.  The only way in which you can really accomplish what some people appear to want is by having a system whereby students would be directed to go to a particular university college.  That, I submit, is something you will never be able to convince any foreseeable Government in this country to adopt.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education&mdash;to take a near example&mdash;is a Clare man and he came to University College, Dublin to do medicine.  He did a distinguished course in medicine in U.C.D.  It is unthinkable that his successors in Clare or Limerick or Cork or Galway should be directed to go to a particular College, if their parents want them to go elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>They should not be directed away from a particular College, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree. That is the whole point of debate, to direct people away from Dublin. I do not think it can be done.  I entirely agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I love to agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington because, as they say in Irish, an rud is annamh is iontach&mdash;what is seldom is wonderful. <Col N="987" /> It all boils down, it seems to me, to an objection to the existence of the capital city or to the siting of a university in the capital city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I found Senator Mrs. Dowdall telling us that this matter should be further inquired into and that other Colleges should be supported. I am an advocate of support for university education generally and I always have been and I have frequently made speeches in this House in support of it but the whole tenor of the debate seemed to me&mdash;I am sorry if my knowledge of English is defective&mdash;to convey that people did not like the fact that Dublin was a capital city and had two universities. That is just too bad but it is not my fault and it is not the fault of the people who govern U.C.D. or the people who teach there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me come back to the Minister. The Minister said there were not two alternative sites.  That is absolutely true and I should like to convince the Seanad of that.  No alternative to the Belfield site has ever been proposed by anybody or considered by anybody except the President of U.C.D., the engineers and architects of U.C.D. Nobody else has ever put up a plan. This notion, a general, vague idea that we could have compulsory power to acquire space around U.C.D. and build a skyscraper or a series of skyscrapers, is not a plan.  It is merely a vague notion and at the very outset comes up against the obstacle that not only one Government but two Governments of different complexion would not consider at all the giving of compulsory powers.  As far as I am concerned as a politician, it seems to me they were quite right.  The only people who ever succeeded in making a plan for Earlsfort Terrace were the people of U.C.D. and there again the <Col N="988" /> Minister is right.  Nobody wanted to leave Earlsfort Terrace.</P>
    <P>I have not got all my papers and I am not sure of the dates but in the forties a committee was appointed at U.C.D. to make a case to the Minister for Finance for increased financial assistance, particularly for increased salaries for the staff.  That was appointed during the presidency of Dr. Arthur Conway, and the present President of University College was a member.  I was a member myself.  The Engineering Professors were members.  It was presided over by the Registrar of University College who was then Professor J.J. Nolan, Professor of Experimental Physics.  We submitted a proposal to the Government, a proposal which was pretty well accepted and on the basis of which not only University College, Dublin, but University College, Cork and University College, Galway, got considerably increased grants.  Having been successful in that particular direction, we were then asked to go ahead with a plan for the future development of the College, which we did.  We made out schedules of what we considered the numbers would be.  We entirely underestimated what the increase would be.  That Committee did nothing at all about the siting of the College. Subsequently the President, Dr. Conway, and the Professor of Architecture, Professor Downes, and the Professor of Engineering, Professor Purcell, and some others, made a sketch plan of what would happen if we took over Iveagh Gardens.  That was the only time that anybody got down to thinking of what would happen if the College were extended on the Earlsfort Terrace site.</P>
    <P>Two things happened about that. First, the student members increased enormously, much more than we had estimated.  Secondly, the Government built a restaurant in the Earlsfort Terrace grounds, adjacent to the Department of External Affairs.  That was something new on the site.  It became clear to us that one could not go ahead on the Earlsfort Terrace site and we are, therefore, in the position of people who are more or less driven out of that site by the facts and the circumstances. There was no plotting, no secrecy, and no planning to do that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> It has been suggested that there was indecent haste in this matter and that it was never discussed objectively in public.  That is demonstrably not so.  Two presidents&mdash;the present President and his predecessor&mdash;and a great number of Governing Bodies decided on the move to Belfield.  Let me say that the governing body consists of 34 members, of whom four are representative of the Government, ten are representative of local bodies, eight from the General Council of County Councils, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, and a representative of the Dublin Country Council.  Lords Mayor have been of various complexion&mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Jew and Gentile, Catholic and Protestant. The suggestion is made that, in some way or other, somebody in University College was so extraordinarily clever that the wool was pulled over the eyes of all these county councillors and the varying and different representatives of different Governments.  That suggestion is just foolish.  No one did any such thing.</P>
    <P>As well as convincing these different Governing Bodies, the move to Belfield and the buying of the land for the Belfield project, was agreed to by several successive Governments, not always of the same political complexion. It was agreed to by several Ministers for Finance and by several Ministers for Education.  There was no hole-and-corner secrecy about it. We here are people of some political experience and anyone who has ever tried to get anything from a Minister for Finance, whatever his name was or whatever his Party happened to be, knows it is not an easy job.  It is not an easy job, but various Ministers for Finance at various times and in various Parties have agreed to this particular project.</P>
    <P>In November, 1951, the Governing Body resolved that it would be in the best interests of the College to move to the site at Belfield.  Later&mdash;I forget the precise date&mdash;the Minister for Finance, Mr. Aiken, I think, moved a Vote in the Dáil for £180,000 to pay for land at Belfield.  Surely that was public discussion.  I do not know whether Senator Ryan would call it <Col N="990" /> objective discussion, but, whatever discussion in the Dáil is, it is certainly the best we can do.  The Dáil is the best public forum we have.  We cannot do any more.  The project was discussed and made absolutely clear. It was stated by the Minister, I think, that the Government were buying the land but they were not committed to the whole project.  There was no secrecy.</P>
    <P>Let me explain the way this land was bought.  Since the matter has been raised, we might as well have it made quite clear and put on the record. Does any sensible person think that there should have been a public announcement that University College, Dublin, intended to move to Belfield, intended to buy land there, with the Government behind them?  Can anybody imagine what the price of land would have been in those circumstances? That was not done, and the people who did not do it were very intelligent.  The land was bought and every time a parcel of land was bought&mdash;I believe &ldquo;parcel&rdquo; is the technical term&mdash;the Minister for Finance of the day was acquainted beforehand.  The land was bought on behalf of the College by a sub-committee of the Buildings Committee, consisting of two Professors of Engineering and a representative of outside interests on the Governing Body, who, at one time, sat on the front bench of this House, Mr. Michael Hearne.  Professor Pierce Purcell, Professor Michael Hogan and Mr. Michael Hearne were the people who negotiated on behalf of the College.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of saying they did an extremely good job.  They got in County Dublin, adjacent to the city, more than 250 acres of land.  One would imagine from the discussion here that one would require an aeroplane to go to Belfield.  That is not so.  It is quite near the city.  They bought that 250 acres for less than £250,000.  That was an extremely good job.  They did that as friends of the College and as people working for the College. Any one of these people, using his own time for his own private purposes. might have made more of his time in <Col N="991" /> financial terms.  They deserve great credit.  They worked very hard.  They were inspired, aided and encouraged all the time by the President of the College and the other authorities of the College.  It is only fair to say that they displayed vision, foresight, courage and prudence; and they displayed a very acute regard for getting good value for public money.  They did get good value for public money.</P>
    <P>The other method, if adopted, would have resulted in heaven's knows what from the point of view of expense.  I think it was Senator Mrs. Dowdall described this as a gradiose scheme.  The only grandiose scheme ever put up&mdash;if it is a scheme at all&mdash;is the vague idea that the Government should give compulsory powers to University College, or should exercise compulsory powers, to take away the rights of private citizens living near Earlsfort Terrace by compulsorily acquiring their property.  The results from the point of view of the rights of citizens and institutions, and from the point of view of expense and expenditure, would have been enormous.  That is the only idea&mdash;that vague idea&mdash;that could be called a grandiose scheme.</P>
    <P>I said last night Senator Ó Donnabháin proposed to acquire all the land from College Green to the canal; I should have said from St. Stephen's Green to the canal.  He was going to stand at the top of Grafton Street and look at the spires and towers on the skyscraper of University College.  I was very comforted to note he was going to make the students walk but he would provide lifts for the professors. That is the only grandiose scheme ever put forward.</P>
    <P>There have been great compliments for a particular pamphlet, but the people who printed that pamphlet studiously avoided getting information in University College about the Belfield scheme.  They were told at a very early stage by a member of the staff that they could be introduced to the President, the Registrar, the Secretary or the Professor of Engineering.  They did not want it.  They were in a state where they did not want to hear about the facts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> Let me take another point.  It has been said that buildings could have been got near Earlsfort Terrace. Again, the people in U.C.D. representing the Governing Body are the only people who ever tried to get buildings. We tried to get Mespil House, as Senator O'Donovan said yesterday.  We were in a position that we had to get Finance sanction to do that.  We were given a particular sum and we were outbid at the auction.  We did not buy Mespil House, and perhaps it is a good thing that we did not do so. Similarly, in regard to other buildings round about, the notion that at any time University College, Dublin, could have bought buildings is rather illusory.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned yesterday evening that the College is now in a desperate condition for space, but it should be remembered that from the very beginning, the College was in a desperate condition for money.  We never had any money.  We had not money to pay our staff or for anything. As my grandmother use to say: &ldquo;We had neither money, nor marbles, nor chalk to make a ring.&rdquo;  What is the good of talking about buying buildings when we had not money to put the bread in our mouths, so to speak?</P>
    <P>Another point has been made that we grabbed students.  It is quite untrue to say that we grabbed students or enticed students to come to U.C.D.  In fact, the contrary charge could be made against us that we tried to discourage students.  What has happened in University College, Dublin, if I may go back to the point about the capital city, is a natural growth.  It does not involve inducing, enticing or grabbing students.  The College has grown because the city has grown and because the College has done a good job which has brought it fame and attracted students to it.  We have high academic standards, particularly high entrance standards for certain Faculties like Engineering, and we have high fees.  We increased our fees on one occasion.  We got a grant from the Minister for Finance who said, I think, fairly enough: &ldquo;You should consider your fees.&rdquo;  We considered our fees and raised them, but subsequently <Col N="993" /> the number of students increased. Quite recently, when we could get no money from anybody, we increased our fees by 50 per cent. and the number of students again increased.  Can anybody maintain that people in that position were enticing students or grabbing them?  We made a rule that helps parents and is good for the students, the two-year rule, that when a student fails in two successive years, he will get no more chances.</P>

      <P>At any rate, the point was that we were trying to <Col N="994" /> get students.  I think Senator Ó Siochfhradha also mentioned that we had recently acquired nursing students, students looking for nursing diplomas in teaching.  As a matter of fact, with regard to the Veterinary College, what happened was quite simple.  The Royal College in London decided that people would not be put on the British Register if they did not get a University degree in Veterinary Science.  The Government here, very properly, decided to accept that.  If we had not done that, the result would have been that people qualified here would not be eligible for employment in England and the Government decided they would have to get a University degree. They came to University College, Dublin.  I do not know whether Senator Ó Siochfhradha's remedy would have been to have none of them come to U.C.D.  But we did not entice them; we did not grab them; we did not fight for them; and, if I may say so, we are not making any money on them.</P>
      <P>The Minister's announcement yesterday evening of a complete science building is a very welcome announcement and it means, I hope, an end of this controversy.  He also announced that there will be a competition for the lay-out of the general site.  I detected a new line yesterday evening in the discussion.  The people who did not want us to get this building, and who, I think, do not want us to get a building anywhere at all, have now switched over to another idea. Their concern is not for the city of Dublin, which they think is going to lose a college&mdash;of course, that is not so&mdash;but is for beauty, art, architecture and aesthetics.  They hope everything possible will be done and every possible delay induced to see that everything is done in accordance with the best canons of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There were people before the Senator as well as after him.  University College, Dublin, is concerned with all these things as well.  In making our lay-out plan, we consulted not only architects here but brought over very distinguished architects from overseas.  As a matter of fact, one of them who was working for us for some time was then brought over to America to do a particular job.  Another was brought to Australia. Really, we have endeavoured to get the very best advice we can.  We are concerned with seeing that this thing is properly done.  It may very well be, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington said yesterday, that while we thought we had any amount of room in 250 acres, actually, with the increase now in the number of University students, we will not have that room at all.</P>
      <P>This plan to get accommodation for University College, Dublin, does not arise from any group or clique or faction. It is not for the purpose of the glorification of any individual or any group of individuals.  It was not decided on, as they said in the Fenian stories, do thuilleamh clú, for fame or notice for anyone.  It was decided on because of the position of university education generally, and because the people in University College want to get the work done for the students who come to them, and for that reason alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>University education, as the Minister indicated, is attracting greater numbers in this country, and I hope it will continue to attract greater numbers. I hope we shall arrange scholarship schemes whereby certain people who cannot get into the University now will be able to get in in future.  Not only that, but university education has become wider.  There are more subjects. The subjects are more complicated and <Col N="996" /> extra faculties are needed.  We began in 1910 with one Professor of Engineering. We now have four and we are, I understand, on the way to a fifth.  At one time, we had one Professor of History and there is no knowing how many we need nowadays.  All those things have become very complex and difficult and there are also more students.</P>
    <P>It was after long and laborious investigation that we came to the conclusion we did come to, that University College should be moved to a site outside the city, but adjacent to the city, in order that there would be room to have everything together.  That, as I say, was done purely for the purpose of getting the work accomplished and for no other purpose at all.  With the Minister's announcement yesterday evening, we came to the end of a certain phase of that matter and also, of course, to a beginning.  We came to the end of the arguments about Belfield and to the beginning of the putting up of the new buildings so that the children of the ordinary natives of this country will have a university worthy of them, and worthy of the traditions of this country about which Senator Ó Ciosáin spoke so well yesterday evening.</P>
    <P>There will be a great increase in students.  The mover of the motion, Senator Crowley, is at one with me, I believe in goodwill and affection for University College, Dublin.  I have spent my life there and he has a son there now, so perhaps we are at two different ends, but I think it is the business of all of us to see that the work University College has to do will be well done and to see that the College gets the different buildings, equipment and endowments to enable it to do the work that has to be done for the people of the country and for the students who go to the College.</P>
    <P>That is not a luxury.  It is universally agreed now that unless a country can keep abreast in this form of education, it can hardly survive at all. I think the Minister's declaration yesterday evening puts the seal on that. The College has an excellent staff, high standards and a splendid history. I believe the mover of the motion and all those who spoke on it will join with me in hoping that this decision <Col N="997" /> the Minister announced will lead to the prosperity and efficiency of the College in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I finally conclude this discussion, if I may, I should like to offer a brief comment on a few of the points made by certain of the speakers.  I should like to begin by correcting any wrong or erroneous impression that might have been created by my presentation of my opening statement, which, I think, was referred to last evening by Senator Ó Maoláin.</P>
      <P>Certainly, the last thing I wanted to do in that statement was to create any suggestion or impression in the mind of anyone that I was attributing responsibility or blame for some form of attempt to avoid or delay discussion on this matter, to anyone in this House.  I certainly did not have in mind that any responsibility in that line lay with the Minister concerned, or indeed with anyone else.  We must all share portion of the responsibility for any delay that has occurred in the discussion of the motion.  I, frankly, do not think that delay could have been avoided without serious difficulty. I am aware that weeks ago when the Minister was available for a discussion on the motion, I personally was not available on that day, and I am also aware that on an earlier occasion when I was available, the Minister was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion was originally put down on the Order Paper on 11th November, 1959.  Four or five months after the motion was put down, in the month of March, I think, the Government came to the Dáil and asked for a token Estimate of £10 in order to proceed with the initial project at Belfield.  I want to make it clear that the point I want to make is that I think the Government at least owed it to this House, knowing that the motion was on the Order Paper for four or five months awaiting discussion, to ask the House to dispose of it and indicate our minds on the matter.  That would not have been too much to ask or expect, and it would, in fact, have been a better way <Col N="998" /> to have done it.  I hope that makes the point clear.</P>
    <P>In the course of his contribution to the debate, Senator Ó Ciosáin made the point that we were legislating here for students all over the country.  His approach to this matter seems to be the direct opposite of what I was trying to bring out.  My point is that we are not, in fact, catering for students all over the country.  I believe we owe as much to the boys and girls of parents in Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Galway, Sligo, Donegal, or any other part one cares to name, as we do to that section of the community to which this College is convenient and consequently more readily available.  I believe university planning should be on the basis of the needs of the people as a whole and not on the needs of those who can get to Dublin or who can afford to send their children there for their education.  I believe that responsibility devolves on any Government.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan attributed opposition to the present project to some sort of dissident group within University College itself.  Again, I want to emphasise that that may or may not be the case, but, so far as I am concerned, I am not speaking for such group, and no such group incited the putting down of this motion on the Order Paper.  I hold no brief for any such group.  My approach to this matter this morning is the same as it was yesterday evening.  I believe that those of us who have a responsibility to deal in public with this matter owe it to the people we represent to present it in an open and candid fashion, as I have tried to do in the presentation of the motion.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Minister's contribution to the debate and here, frankly, I am rather disappointed.  The only cogent point he made in his reply to my submissions was that it was not possible for the Government to wait 12 months for the Seanad to make up its mind on this question.  That observation was hardly called for.  I do not think anybody would expect the Government to wait 12 months for any body to make up its mind on <Col N="999" /> a matter of this kind.  The Government knew this motion was awaiting discussion.  They could easily have come to us and asked us to dispose of it in one afternoon as has been the case now, one might say.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the Government are insisting on an architectural competition for the completion of the buildings.  It is difficult to understand how that will be insisted upon if at the moment they are proceeding with one small part of the buildings in the provision of a new science building. I am not at all impressed by the suggestions, ideas or arguments that a university should be situated amongst all sorts of aesthetic and beautiful surroundings.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of a university is to provide educational facilities.  I believe as much and as good education can be provided in Earlsfort Terrace as in Belfield.  I refuse to accept that a better standard of education will be provided in Belfield just because the University will be located in beautiful surroundings, and so on.  These amenities would be very desirable if we could afford them.  However, in Earlsfort Terrace we have an existing university building capable of improvement and of very considerable expansion.  If the Government have £10 million, or more, to spend, I am convinced it would be better employed in making the utmost possible use of the facilities we already have rather than in plunging into a project of this kind which will take a very long time to complete and will probably cost a great deal more money before it is completed.</P>
    <P>Most Senators will agree that this has been a useful discussion.  Two or three aspects of the debate have left certain impressions on my mind.  I hope I shall be forgiven for mentioning them.  I want to endorse whole-heartedly the sentiments expressed only a few moments ago by Senator Hayes.  Every Senator who contributed to the discussion approached it in a similar spirit.  I want to ensure that the utmost possible assistance and facilities are available to University College for the provision of the highest standard of <Col N="1000" /> education for the present generation of children and all those who will follow them.</P>
    <P>I cannot leave this discussion without saying that, almost unanimously, from practically every university representative who contributed to the discussion, including Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I sensed a certain resentment either towards our right to discuss this matter or our capacity or ability to do so.  That is unfair.  Every member of this House, regardless of what section of the community he represents, has a right and a duty to discuss a motion of this kind.</P>

In particular, I am very grateful to my seconder for one of the most valuable contributions to the discussion.  I am satisfied the motion has served its purpose. When I put it down for discussion I did not do so in order to embarrass the Government or the university authorities by dividing the House on it.
