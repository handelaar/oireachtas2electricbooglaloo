      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann is of the opinion that the present method of assessing and revising Poor Law Valuations is causing grave hardship to owners of new, reconstructed and even well maintained premises, and that the law should be amended so that this injustice is not allowed to continue.&rdquo;</P>

    <Title>Tourist Traffic Bill, 1961 &mdash; Second Stage (Resumed) and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other Senators, I welcome this Bill to extend the amount of Government aid given to Bord Fáilte.  We are all aware of the excellent work done by the Board but it appears to many of us that the funds at its disposal are far too limited for the gigantic task it has to undertake.  My criticism of the Bill is that the amount suggested is altogether too low.  It proposes £5,000,000 over seven years or £700,000 per annum.  The aid does not advance or increase as the results increase.  I should hope that there would be a progressive increase in the funds of Bord Fáilte, depending on the percentage increase shown in the net tourist income in the period, and I think, with any reasonable prospects, for the next five years, we should far exceed the figure suggested by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The picture may look promising.  We are all aware in a superficial way of the increased tourist traffic.  We see more tourists around, more tourist buses, and we read a great deal in the newspapers about records being broken at Dublin Airport and elsewhere in the air lifting of tourists.  That is all to the good, but we have to get back to the facts and figures.  The facts and figures do not bear out this very rosy position. These are given in the latest report issued by the Irish Tourist Board for the year ending 31st March, 1960. They give very striking percentages, as calculated by the O.E.E.C., of the increase in tourist returns in certain countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> We find that in the 1955/58 period the average percentage yearly increase is highest in Austria, with 34 per cent.; West Germany is next with 21 per cent.; Italy, 19 per cent.; France, 10 per cent.; Britain, eight per cent.; Ireland, four per cent.; and Switzerland, two per cent.  The Swiss figure of two per cent. can be written off due to the already very highly developed state of tourism in Switzerland.  I do not think anyone here can feel happy about the lowly position occupied by Ireland in that table&mdash;an increase of four per cent. per annum.  Even bringing it up to date with the last two years, the increase is not very much greater&mdash;probably of the order of five per cent. on the latest figures available.</P>
    <P>This is especially puzzling when we consider at the same time the heavy emigration there has been from here&mdash; far heavier than from any other of the countries listed.  We are aware of the emigrants returning for holidays here, and consequently you would expect that, of itself, should make a considerable increase in tourist traffic.  But what do we find?  The table as given in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> of March, 1960, shows&mdash;Table 2, page 12&mdash;that the visitors from England have been increasing at the rate of about 30,000 per annum.  At the same time, even the most conservative estimate of emigration in that period for emigration to Britain would at least be a figure of 45,000.  Consequently, we are scarcely getting what we might expect to get by way of emigrants returning on holidays.</P>
    <P>It is likewise in the case of emigration to the United States.  The figure for tourists is increasing at 6,000 or 7,000 per annum&mdash;I think it is 9,000 in the last report&mdash;and emigration has been running at between 4,000 and 5,000 a year.  Consequently, no great increase is shown.  More disturbing still is this.  The Minister quoted in his opening speech the fact that last year tourism from America had increased by ten per cent.  It has increased by ten per cent., but the stay here&mdash;the number of days per tourist&mdash;and the total expenditure per tourist has dropped considerably in recent years <Col N="1808" /> as American tourists try to get more and more into their already overcrowded travel programmes.  We find the total spent per tourist has dropped from £68 in 1956 to £39 in 1958.  Consequently, the increase in the overall total is very slight.</P>
    <P>We cannot, therefore, look at those figures with complacancy, although we are aware of the good work done by Bord Fáilte.  Some speakers here queried why Ireland was omitted from certain write-ups on travel in some international magazines.  We are omitted from some of those simply because Bord Fáilte cannot spend the amount necessary for extensive advertising in those magazines.  In fact, it is calculated by Bord Fáilte itself that the total grant available last year, some £500,000, would just be sufficient for about 24 full-page advertisements in some of the leading American and English journals.</P>
    <P>We have to see how tourism can be improved.  The first thing that strikes us is the very short season we have here.  Apart from the efforts to get coarse fishing going and the success in that sphere, there is little else we can show at present in the way of extending the holiday season.  The two main extensions should come from within our own country.  First, we are all aware that at this very moment, in the heart of the tourist season, most of the employees in our building and other firms are going on their two-weeks' vacation.  I take it it is not right that that should be directly in the middle of the holiday season.  If the trades concerned and the Government could combine to have that annual holiday period taken in, I would suggest, early June, it would make a considerable contribution to lengthening the holiday period.  It would be worth while, I believe, to have even some compensation in the way of some additional holiday later.  June is by far the best month here for holidays.  The days are longer.  There is more sunshine. If the holiday season for our workers could be shifted into June and some compensation given by way of a long week-end at the end of September, or even later, that would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> A second cause of overcrowding in our present holiday season is the ridiculous system of holding the children in the national schools until the second week in July.  That is wrong from every standpoint.  The children are exhausted and from the middle of June to the middle of July, teaching and the general development of the child are rather inefficient.  There are schools which close early in June. Their pupils are able to compete quite satisfactorily with the pupils in the national schools who continue until the middle of July.  Keeping the children in school so late means that many of our citizens are forced to take their holidays in the very limited period from the middle of July to the 1st September.  If the Government really want to improve our tourist traffic, they could do so by ensuring that our schools close not later than 10th June. At the other end, the schools could reopen earlier in the autumn.  There could be, too, some compensation by way of a mid-term break in early November after the pattern of schools in the United States of America.  That would be more than satisfactory to all.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that we get only one per cent. of the tourist traffic available from Great Britain and he expressed the hope that that could be increased.  He thought that if we could get two or three per cent. of that traffic it would be a wonderful boost to our tourist industry.  That may be so, but what kind of chaotic situation would we be in if our tourist numbers from Britain suddenly doubled or trebled? At the moment our hotel accommodation is taxed to its uttermost.  The latest report shows we have something in the region of 15,000 hoteliers.  We have about 2,000 guesthouses and a further 1,200 homes available for tourists, private residences listed with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Assuming an average occupancy for about one-quarter of the year, and I think that is rather high, all those added together could scarcely provide for a quarter of our total tourist traffic. The most that can be catered for is 180,000 to 200,000 people.  Where do the rest find accommodation?  Many are catered for in houses that are not <Col N="1810" /> registered with Bord Fáilte.  Many are emigrants returning to their families.  How can we increase our accommodation?  The target in relation to hotel bedroom accommodation is at the moment 500 extra per annum. At that rate 5,000 would be available in ten years.  That would provide for an increase of one-third in hotel accommodation.  Assuming the present pattern continues that would provide accommodation for not more than 80,000 to 100,000 extra tourists.  We must appreciate, therefore, that there are tourists coming who cannot meet the prices for listed accommodation and who are compelled to seek inferior accommodation.  If my estimates are correct, a couple of hundred thousand tourists are using that type of inferior accommodation.  There should, therefore, be a big drive made to step up approved accommodation.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to suggest that we strike out in providing unique accommodation.  We are trying to be unique in relation to our coarse fishing.  We could be more unique still in developing farm family holidays. We are ideally situated to provide that type of holiday.  We have our wide open spaces.  We have our farms. That development could be a tremendous asset.  It would be an advantage to us and an advantage to the tourist. If even five per cent. of our farmers engaged in that tourist extension there would be some 15,000 homes with suitable accommodation listed with Bord Fáilte.  That accommodation could be provided more cheaply than hotel bedroom accommodation.  I understand the cost of the latter is between £2,000 and £4,000 per bedroom.  The additional cost where our farmers are concerned would be only a fraction of that entailed in providing hotel bedroom accommodation.</P>
    <P>This development would also provide a suitable opportunity for the employment of farmers' daughters. To-day, there is very little to be done on the farm because of mechanisation and because the poultry industry has turned into a dead loss.  Naturally these girls would require a certain type of education.  They would need a high degree of perfection in domestic <Col N="1811" /> economy.  That would be all to the good.  It would also solve the problem of the scarcity of young women at the moment to become the farmers' wives of the future.  I find this development particularly attractive because it is based on the family.  It would provide an outlet for resources that are not fully availed of today.  The family car could be rented out to these tourists for short trips.  The pony on the farm could be hired. We have all the essentials of what could be a very attractive and distinctively Irish brand of tourism.  In this regard I must pay a high tribute to the excellent work being done in Inchigeela by the local people.  They have developed Inchigeela as a tourist centre and everyone in the area is co-operating in entertaining tourists and making it a distinctively Irish brand of tourism.  I understand the booking there surpassed all expectations this year.</P>
    <P>We should, of course, go after our own people in every way possible.  It is no use seeing the figures on the plus side of tourism going up if the figures for our own people going abroad for holidays are going up also. In other words, you have Bord Fáilte enticing people to come to stay here and you have Aer Lingus enticing people to take their holidays elsewhere. That is perfectly legitimate competition but we should go after our own people aggressively and make them realise that there is much in this country that is superior to what they can get in other holiday centres in Western Europe and that, above all, it is ridiculous to go on holidays abroad if they have not sampled what is available here at home.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to give some incentive to Bord Fáilte by matching his promises for the future with increased grants for tourism.  If Bord Fáilte can succeed in doubling accommodation in the next two years, then their grant should be at least doubled.  If they are given that incentive they will play their part.  I would also appeal to the Minister and to the Government to consider carefully the <Col N="1812" /> points I have made about lengthening the season.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a good Bill, a necessary Bill, in which we extend the guarantees Bord Fáilte may give to people under the State Guarantees Act, and, at the same time, increase the amount of free grants.  I do not agree with Senator Quinlan that it is possible to lengthen the holiday period here. Almost everybody wants to take holidays in the first fortnight in August. Maybe people are mistaken&mdash;and whether it has any relation to the fact that the Horse Show takes place or other amusements are available during that period or whether it is the best fortnight of the year from the point of view of weather, I do not know&mdash;but the fact is that they prefer the first fortnight in August and we cannot do anything about it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the number of tourists entering this country, it has been more or less accepted that the figures available are not entirely correct. It is nobody's fault.  When there is a high emigration rate and movements back and forward that confuses everything.  It is true to say we cannot be sure how many tourists come here in a year.  In fact Senator Quinlan did prove that when he pointed out that a great number of the people represented as tourists in the official figures could not have found accommodation on the basis of a twelve weeks' season.  Unfortunately our tourists are being compressed into a twelve weeks' season. People in other countries like to take their holidays at certain times of the year as we do and so the holiday season is compressed into a few short weeks defined as high summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must come to a decision as to how we can attract these people.  I have the view that, by and large, An TÓstal was a mistake.  An TÓstal was established as an extension of the holiday period on the basis of good weather.  I do not think we can compete here from the point of view of weather.  If we are trying to attract people on that basis we shall not succeed.  The people of Britain can go to the Channel Islands or the Continent and we are certainly going against the <Col N="1813" /> tide if we try to attract them on the basis of weather.  Our main spearhead in the attack should not be that.</P>
    <P>Our main spearhead should be the sort of thing that will happen next year when for the first time the Irish Derby will be one of the most valuable races in the world.  While it is obvious the Government, through the sort of financing we are doing here today, cannot throw vast sums of money around as prizes for races, golf matches and things like that, I believe that in conjunction with other organisations and in conjunction with large firms advertising such amenities, a great deal can be achieved.  A big golf match or a big horse race will bring a large number of people here who will return again because while we may not have the weather we have something nobody else has; we have peace and quiet; we have the peace and quiet the Germans are looking for when they come here and buy places on the Western seaboard.</P>
    <P>Another type of tourist is the emigrant who comes on a Flight of the Gaels, an organised flight of, say, a hundred or two hundred people who come from America for an all-Ireland final.  However, while that is valuable there is no problem there because our emigrants will return as soon as they possibly can, when they can afford it.  These planes and the method of attracting them through our sports is a good one.</P>
    <P>Apart from the attractions of horse races or golf matches there are also the other sports we could term hunting, shooting and fishing.  The coarse fishing being encouraged by the Inland Fisheries Trust which was instituted by the inter-Party Government is a great step forward.  You have only to go through Monaghan and Cavan where these small places encourage tourist fishing, towns like Virginia and so on, to see the number of people from Lancashire and the midlands of Britain who avail of the coarse fishing about which we would not bother our heads.  However, they enjoy it and indeed people come from France for it.  When they catch their pike they eat it with great gusto.  We should make every effort to expand and advance on that front.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> If we do expand it should not be on the basis of luxury hotels, but on the basis of comfortable accommodation for which there is a demand among middle-class and working Englishmen, who enjoy a fishing holiday.  You will find them along canals sitting on stools&mdash;one every ten feet or so.  They are there.  It is something we have.  It is something we can give to them.  If we can improve the accommodation and extend it in relation to the small hotels and the commercial hotels in the areas where we have coarse fishing, it will be a good thing.  We could also subsidise an occasional contest.  These people love contests.  That would also be a very good thing which might be done without a large amount of expense.</P>
    <P>When one comes to fishing for salmon and trout, it must be realised that there is a great difference between fishing and shooting.  Fishing comes out on top.  You could lose about 500 boats on the Corrib and you would not do the fish any harm, but were you to put in 500 guns in any area you would shoot out the entire vicinity as they do in France.  This type of fishing has great potentialities for attracting tourists.  The season is a natural one. We have the May fly and then we have the ordinary fishing for the rest of the season.  That also should be looked after.  Contests should be subsidised. The number of beds available should be extended and advertisements inserted in Continental and British newspapers. I myself am particularly interested in shooting.  This is an infinitely more difficult matter than fishing.  You must have your shoot organised.  It is something you cannot do indiscriminately.  You must shoot a certain number of birds and these are proprietary things.  Quite rightly, the man who occupies the land is now beginning to take a primary interest in his birds.  You could have a great number of guns in a snipe area, but there would be no shoot for people arriving there three or four days later.</P>
    <P>I know an area in north County Louth where a man went out to shoot snipe a few years ago.  He rang up his friend and told him: &ldquo;I have <Col N="1815" /> beaten your record.  I shot 50 snipe.&rdquo; The friend replied: &ldquo;You have not. My record was 51.&rdquo;  That same year the man endeavoured to beat that record and in order to give him an opportunity of so doing a group had to stay away.  Shooting must be on the basis of a proprietary approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is an opportunity to attract people to shoot, there is no opportunity to attract them to fish.  There is a great opportunity in regard to attracting visitors for hunting if we could only hire out the horses to them.  That is being done in Fermoy, as I am sure the Minister knows.  If Bord Fáilte, with the extra money they have, could co-ordinate this system of providing horses for groups who come here through travel agents, much could be done to attract these people, who are good spenders, to our country.</P>
      <P>I think that Bord Fáilte has not really touched upon that to any great extent.  They have appointed one lady who is trying to organise it but her job would be too onerous if she did not get considerable help.  The appointment of one agent in every two or three counties on a part-time basis would be an immense advantage.  I am very pleased to see an extension of the funds at the disposal of Bord Fáilte and I hope that the effort will bear fruit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is, of course, financial. Briefly, the annual grant towards the board is being replaced by a sum of up to £5,000,000 which will be spent over the next seven years.  That will ensure greater financial flexibility in the administration of the board over a number of years.  The second financial provision is the extension of the limit <Col N="1816" /> of the loan guarantee scheme from £3,000,000 to £5,000,000 and the third main financial provision is that the ceiling which heretofore existed in regard to the grants paid towards interest charges on loans taken out by hoteliers is removed.  There is no ceiling for the future in regard to these grants.</P>
      <P>These financial provisions should give more flexibility to the administration of the board in the coming years and should enable it to spend in a more flexible and freer fashion on the important aspects of administration which can be divided into two categories&mdash;promotional and publicity, particularly abroad, and, secondly, developmental activities at home.  The Minister in introducing the Bill outlined the progress made.  Indeed, any of us who move through the country and compares the standard of hotels now to that of even ten years' ago cannot but admit that enormous strides have been made, particularly in regard to hotel and restaurant improvement. That improvement&mdash;you must have the goods in order to get the customers&mdash; is reflected in the strides forward made in regard to the financial return from our tourist industry.  Last year, visitors to this country spent £42.4 million. That figure is 50 per cent. more than it was in 1953 and 30 per cent. more than it was in 1957.</P>
      <P>It might be pertinent to remark that that very welcome increase of practically 50 per cent. in our tourist business over the past eight years took place since An Tóstal was inaugurated. I believe that much of the criticism of An Tóstal is ill-directed and stems from wrong motives and often political motives.  The fact is that An Tóstal itself had a priming-pump effect in generating local interest in tourism throughout the country.  In general, the effect was that people started to get together within the framework of An Tóstal to organise festivals or whatever activities were suited to a particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that in my own area of Athlone the Amateur Drama Festival was organised by An Tóstal and has since developed on its own.  The Film Festival in Cork is another example. The Tóstal had the effect of getting the people, first of all, into a tourist <Col N="1817" /> mood and made them have regard to the importance of tourism and the importance of brightening up the country to further those interests.  It encouraged and developed local activities which in many areas have proved very successful. They are now going ahead on their own and are undoubtedly tourist attractions.</P>
    <P>I believe An Tóstal had that tremendous priming pump effect in moving our people psychologically towards becoming tourist-conscious in a positive way.  It is noticeable that that improvement of 50 per cent. has taken place since the Tóstal idea was put into effect.  However, there is no reason, and in fact the Minister made it plain in his opening speech, for complacency with regard to tourism. There is still an enormous market in Britain which we have only tapped. Some 30 million people in Britain take holidays every year and we only get an estimated 300,000, or one per cent. of those people coming here. There is a real challenge there, particularly in the promotional and publicity aspects, and if we could induce two per cent. or three per cent. to come here, we would be doubling or trebling our business from that source. There is great room for improvement and there is a challenge presented to Bord Fáilte which I am sure they will be able to meet through greater expenditure on publicity abroad.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that the whole world seems to be going on holidays as along with the increased tourism which we have experienced, there have been similar increases in practically every European country.  It is paradoxical to note that in Switzerland no big increase has taken place. That is probably due to the fact that they have reached the optimum point in regard to tourism.  We have not reached the optimum point and that presents a challenge to Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>With regard to the promotional and publicity aspects abroad and development at home, the advantages we have should be stressed more.  The two outstanding advantages which we possess and which we can give to people coming in are peace and quiet, <Col N="1818" /> which are becoming ever greater advantages, and secondly, our sporting attractions.  Both of these are factors which do not depend on the narrow summer sunshine holiday period. Both are spread out over the greater part of the year.  The peace and quiet which we can give people and the sporting attractions are features which can induce people to come here in April or May or in September or October.  They are both factors which, if emphasised or &ldquo;plugged,&rdquo; should serve to bring people here at a time of the year when it is required to extend the season.</P>
    <P>Reference has already been made to the coarse fishing industry which in recent years has grown to tremendous proportions.  There is also the question of providing proper attractions for the gun sportsman.  It is not strictly relevant, but in that connection the Minister for Lands announced on his Estimate that £7,500 is being devoted by his Department towards the preservation and improvement of game resources.  I am glad to note that that money is to be spent through regional and local game councils.  Undoubtedly, in regard to shooting, many private interests are affected and it is important to get the support of those interests in order properly to preserve and develop our game resources and to make them attractive for sportsmen from abroad.  I welcome the granting of the £7,500 which it is proposed to channel through existing regional and local game councils.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte had some unfortunate experience with some of these councils over the past 12 months.  I think the councils were right and that Bord Fáilte were wrong, but there is no point in going back over that controversy. The money is now being channelled through another source and a network of local game councils, based on local initiative, is the proper channel.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of Bord Fáilte activities which I would criticise to a certain degree, that is, the grading system for our hotels.  I feel that there is not sufficient emphasis, first of all, on food, and secondly on what one might call the personality of a hotel. <Col N="1819" /> It has been the experience of many hoteliers throughout the country that the Bord Fáilte inspection is carried out on the basis of technical criteria: where the reception desk is placed, where the telephone booth is placed, how many tables there are, and how they are placed, how the linen cupboard is placed upstairs, is it awkward to get up and down the stairs, the position of the bar in relation to the diningroom, and so on.  Many structural criteria are taken into account by Bord Fáilte in their inspections and in assessing the grade of a hotel.  Practically no account is taken of the two most elementary requirements, first of all, food, and, secondly, cleanliness.</P>
    <P>I have had the experience, as I suppose other Senators have had, of going into hotels and restaurants in France.  Certainly they are not structurally perfect and in fact infringe the structural laws, but the food is good and the standard of cleanliness is good.  These are the basic elements in any good inn or restaurant, and I feel Bord Fáilte do not give sufficient attention to them and the general personality or impact of a hotel.  There are many grade C hotels which as regards personality, impact and general atmosphere, plus good food, are way ahead of many grade A hotels, and I can say that without fear of contradiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot in that. I do feel that the grading system is too rigid and that a more flexible system would meet the case.  The present system is based on structural defects and side by side with that, there should be another system which would take into account food, cleanliness and general personality.  Another aspect to which I should like to refer, and with which some of my southern colleagues may not agree, is that I feel undue emphasis is placed on time-honoured attractions and I am thinking particularly of Killarney and the southwestern part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Killarney is a great &ldquo;gimmick&rdquo; as <Col N="1820" /> regards American tourists but I would say that none of the Killarney lakes bears comparison with Lough Key at Boyle and the upper reaches of the Shannon.  That is the loveliest lake in the country but it is not mentioned sufficiently in the Bord Fáilte publicity. Yet it is in a centre which would do with some encouragement. There is no big industry near it but there are good hotels and the coarse fishing position is being built up.  Bord Fáilte do not direct sufficient attention to the whole stretch of scenic attractions on the upper Shannon from, say, Athlone through Lanesboro' and Termonbarry, to Rooskey, Carrick-on-Shannon, on to Boyle and then on to Dromahair and the Yeats country. That is a stretch of country which is never mentioned enough in Bord Fáilte publicity and which is never encouraged and where local initiative is doing most of its own work.</P>
    <P>It is an area where first-class hotels have been provided by local initiative, where different counties are getting ahead with game preservation and where the coarse fishing business has assumed tremendous proportions and is now an industry in itself in the area between Boyle, Carrick-on-Shannon, Drumshambo and Dromahair.  There, positive development is taking place primarily by local initiative, with very little help by Bord Fáilte apart from the financial help towards the improvement of hotels.  I feel that greater publicity should be channelled towards areas of that description that need assistance much more than the well-deserved publicity channelled over the years towards Killarney and the natural charms of the south-west part of our country.</P>
    <P>I feel Bord Fáilte are doing an excellent job.  It is essential to have an independent organisation of this nature to carry on with this job.  In so far as the financial measure before us enables it to act more independently and more flexibly than heretofore, that is a factor which should induce us to welcome this Bill and wish Bord Fáilte good luck in its continuing development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like most people, <Col N="1821" /> would like to see our tourist business increasing and flourishing and I would like to see, as a result of the efforts of the various local authorities, cleaner and tidier cities, towns, and villages. Many town committees have worked wonders in the appearance of their towns but there is still a great deal to be done.  Even in Dublin there is need of more publicity to guide the citizens to take home their waste and burn it or to use the receptacles provided by the Corporation.</P>
      <P>It is my belief that the very best and most valuable of our tourists are people of moderate means who come, in the main, from Britain and the Six Counties.  These people do not want luxury hotels.  I would borrow a phrase from Senator McGuire and stress that what is wanted here is first-class second-class hotels which are best suited to our best tourist customers&mdash; the people of moderate means from our neighbouring island.</P>
      <P>Much has been said from time to time about the unpleasant smell which occasionally rises from the River Liffey.  Much has been done to try to provide a remedy.  I want to refer to a somewhat similar matter which causes much discomfort alike to citizens and tourists.  I refer to the shocking odour that, on occasion, envelops the city and causes not only much embarrassment but real distress.  I have not been able to find out just where the offensive smell comes from.  I have contacted Dublin Corporation which suggested fertiliser factories, etc. but they can do nothing about the problem.  Had I been able to find out the source of the trouble I would have made a private approach long ago.</P>
      <P>I have, on occasion, stopped to admire our little gem in Saint Stephen's Green, to enjoy the perfume of the flowers, as well as the scene of the citizens enjoying the fresh air and the sunshine, only to be driven away by this foul smell.  I have had complaints regarding the distress caused to office and other staffs by this infliction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister for Industry and Commerce would suggest to industrialists, or perhaps ask Bord Fáilte to do it, that where offensive vapours have to be discharged the air they <Col N="1822" /> should be passed through some chemical process before being poured out to destroy the air of the city.</P>
    <P>I am told that the problem can be solved at little expense.  I would ask the Minister to examine this problem. There is no use in planting flowers in our parks and public places and then submerging their perfume under a cloud of foul-smelling vapour from factories. If the Minister has been unfortunate enough to be struck with this horrible infliction which must be endured by our citizens, he will realise that it is something that will do much harm to our tourist trade.</P>
    <P>I think there is still a great deal to be done, in regard to souvenirs, in the production of the smaller pottery products that are generally sought after by those desiring a souvenir of the less expensive type.  The numbers of these types of commodities have increased greatly.  There is still much to be done to eliminate the crude, lumpy articles which give no clue to the fact that our potteries can and do produce lovely articles which help to spread the fame of our craftsmen.  Apart from these few grumbles, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people will agree with the aim of the Bill and with the aims of Bord Fáilte to develop tourism. Our income from tourism has grown progressively especially in the course of the past ten years.  Some people find fault with the slow rate of growth but one would prefer a steady growth coupled with a desire on the part of our national sporting organisations to give Bord Fáilte such co-operation in this matter as possible.</P>
      <P>It could be said, I think, roughly speaking, that the income from tourism ten years ago was around the £30,000,000 mark.  It has gone up now from that figure and that is due in part to the efforts of Bord Fáilte.  It is good business and it is business I think which we could develop further.  We have good ideas.  We are located near big centres such as London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with those speakers here and elsewhere who have sought to inculcate <Col N="1823" /> the idea that we should promote the family type hotel rather than the more expensive luxurious hotel.  The ordinary tourist here is a family man with limited means.  We should do everything in our power to make things comfortable for him during his stay with us.  As was also mentioned, a number of people come to this country to visit relatives.  A number of our people who work abroad make a habit of coming back here to visit their friends.  A number of people come here on business trips and people come for unspecified reasons.</P>
    <P>The National Sporting Club which was formed recently is working along the right lines.  There has been an effort, voluntarily, to consolidate activities.  I think of the gun clubs and the fishing clubs who have joined and are trying to promote the idea that the better facilities we have for shooting, fishing and hunting, the better will be our chances of attracting tourists here especially in the off season when hotels, and the managements of boarding houses, could cater better for tourists.</P>
    <P>We can offer a great deal in the way of beautiful scenery.  We have some of the most beautiful scenery in Europe, and we have good beaches.  If we could get an active community spirit, it would be of more help than, if you like, needless criticism.  We should recognise that our purse is limited.  The amount of money which can be given to Bord Fáilte in any year is limited to the amount which the Minister and the Government can provide. Therefore, we must recognise that if we do not develop to the full our interest in tourism, we cannot hope to make much progress, no matter how active or zealous Bord Fáilte may be.</P>
    <P>I notice that there is a marked reluctance on the part of hotel owners and boarding house owners in certain resorts to adopt the new spirit or, if I may put it this way, the changing mood of tourism.  I refer to the tourists who come here in caravans.  In certain resorts, the inhabitants have shown a marked reluctance to cater for caravans. They are doing themselves, the resort and the country a serious injury <Col N="1824" /> by these tactics.  I do not wish to go into the subject any further, but I could build up the argument that the caravan dweller is a very desirable tourist, because he always brings another type of tourist.  There will always be people who will not under any conditions take a holiday in a caravan.  Therefore, it would be well for people in the seaside resorts to recognise the fact that there will always be the type of tourist who wants an all-in holiday and who would much prefer to stay in a hotel or in a boarding house rather than in a caravan.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has brought this Bill to the House to provide this considerable sum of money, and to give Bord Fáilte the confidence they need.  I should like to say, finally, that if those engaged in the catering trade would come together and show a better spirit, they would be doing a good day's work for tourism and, in the last analysis, for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has been an extremely useful contribution on the subject of tourism.  We have had some new ideas from Senator Stanford and, as usual, Senator Ó Maoláin has given us a very interesting dissertation on continental holidays. Since his bibulous tour of the unholy lands on the occasion of the debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, we look to Senator Ó Maoláin to speak with some authority and knowledge of what goes on on the Continent in regard to entertainment.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that there is not a great deal of use in members of the Seanad making their thoughtful contributions on a Bill of this kind because the complaints made year after year, both in the Dáil and in the Seanad, on Bills of this kind, never seem to make any impact upon Bord Fáilte, if one judges by the results. That is the way of many State bodies who find themselves answerable to no one except, perhaps, in a very indirect way to the Minister who is indirectly responsible for them.  Consequently, it becomes a matter of reciting grievances in the hope that ultimately Bord Fáilte will sit up and listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> I entirely agree with the view which has been expressed that too much money appears to be concentrated upon the luxury hotels, and too little attention paid to the smaller type of hotel which caters for the vast majority of the potential tourist traffic of this country.  I had occasion on a previous Bill to refer to the complaints made by proprietors of the smaller type hotels who were being urged, if not coerced, by Bord Fáilte to make extensive alterations which were beyond their means.  The point of view of those proprietors was that they have a clientele which is quite satisfied with the structure, the lay-out, the decoration and the accommodation provided.  The proprietors of those rather small hotels pointed out that if they were to go in for large extensions such as were urged by Bord Fáilte, they would have to increase their charges and that would turn away the existing clientele which had been built up over the years by the owners of those places.  Bord Fáilte will have to make some reappraisal of their grading of hotels of that kind and of the things they want done before giving grants or continuing the registration of that type of hotel.</P>
    <P>Going around the country and seeing the new lounges and bars that have been fitted up, it strikes one that there is a lack of taste in the way those things are done.  There is too much standardisation.  It is too easy to get some plastic material, a bit of chrome and design bars and lounges in the same way.  There is no individuality as far as one can see in many of those places which have been fitted out under the supervision of Bord Fáilte. I would be very pleased to see some individuality of approach to redecoration and design being encouraged and fostered through Bord Fáilte Éireann.</P>
    <P>The Bill, and the other Acts which it amends, provide for the giving of grants to develop tourist resorts as holiday centres.  Visiting places near Dublin and even Bray and similar places recently it appeared to me that either Bord Fáilte or the local authority should do something to ensure that places along the seashore are kept clean.  It is idle to hope that an <Col N="1826" /> anti-litter campaign will produce clean beaches.  As long as there are people, children in holiday mood, and a lack of litter receptacles, there will not be clean beaches and clean approaches to beaches.  It is absolutely urgent and essential for Bord Fáilte or local authorities to appoint somebody who will systematically see to it that these places are clean and kept free from litter.  It is quite shameful, in a place so well developed as Bray, to take one example, to find all classes of litter strewn in all classes of places.  It seems to me to reflect no credit on the local authority or Bord Fáilte that that position is allowed to obtain.  It is very bad publicity for the country and a counter to advertisements published to make this country appear attractive.</P>
    <P>As has been frequently said, the best advertisement for any hotel or tourist resort is the satisfied customer. I do not fear that Bord Fáilte lacks adequate finance for advertising. Every satisfied guest in a hotel or guest house is a potential advertiser.  People talk about their holidays and particularly like to say they had a good holiday if they are able to say so truthfully.  That is the best advertisement. In far too many places the standard of service, of food, on which Senator Lenihan has placed some stress, and of cleanliness, is far below the ordinary minimal requirements.</P>
    <P>In particular, I want to draw attention to the type of thing to which Senator Miss Davidson has been referring in relation to Dublin generally. Senator Miss Davidson should communicate with the Attorney General's office and call attention to this public nuisance and the Attorney General will probably take some steps in the common good, to abate what is a common nuisance.  It would be within his province to do so.  Incidentally, Senator Miss Davidson should be commended for the steps she has taken to try to eliminate this nuisance.</P>
    <P>On that subject, it seems to me to be an essential requirement that the toilet accommodation in hotels should be beyond reproach.  In the vast majority of hotels, apparently, the notion is that once a toilet is installed it requires no attention thereafter.  It <Col N="1827" /> is greatly to be regretted that this part of the functioning of hotels is so neglected.  It must leave an extremely bad impression upon visitors from other countries and on Irish people visiting these hotels on their way from one part of the country to another. Bord Fáilte should do something about this matter.  It is the business of Bord Fáilte to see that hotels are kept in proper condition if they are to be registered.  It does not make any great difference whether or not there is a carpet on the stairs or whether all the rooms have running hot and cold water.  It is much more important, that the place should be kept clean.  If standards were insisted upon by Bord Fáilte there would be much less cause for complaint in matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>In my experience a common cause of complaint is lack of elementary cleanliness in some hotels.  If Bord Fáilte at the present time has not got sufficient powers to insist upon standards it should be given them by statute or, alternatively, the local authority functioning as the sanitary authority ought to take an interest.  It is regrettable, unpleasant and distasteful to have to speak on matters of that kind in public in this House but it is necessary, so that some authority will take steps to remedy these matters.</P>
    <P>The road signs provided by Bord Fáilte and local authorities have often amused me and must be a source of amusement to visitors to our shores. Not infrequently one finds that according to one sign a place is seven and a half miles distant, whereas, according to another sign, that may be only a few yards distant, the place would appear to be eight or eight and a half miles away.  That sort of sign-posting looks absurd and it is certainly a waste of public money.  The work of sign-posting the country is proceeding but as yet there is nothing like sufficient sign-posting to places that are off the beaten track and which are of interest to tourists and to Irish people who may have heard of various places of interest but do not know the way to them.</P>
    <P>In regard to advertising by Bord Fáilte, the magazine which they issue <Col N="1828" /> every two months reflects great credit on them.  It is always a source of pleasure to me to receive it in the post and to scan its pages.  It is extremely well done.  I sometimes wonder whether the advertising is not done in too leisurely a fashion.  I do not know what circulation the magazine has but it certainly gives a very favourable impression of the kind of country we believe Ireland to be and the kind of welcome and the kind of enjoyment and entertainment that are to be found here by people in search of a holiday that is different from that obtainable elsewhere. That kind of appeal is limited. Not everybody wants that particular kind of holiday.  I wonder whether or not all Bord Fáilte's advertising is along that line.  There are young people with money to spend who might spend it in this country but who would like to know of amusements apart from shooting and fishing and the quiet beauty of the lakes of Killarney and Lough Key.  I do not think there is any indication in the magazine <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> that attractions to suit all tastes are available in this country but it may very well be that Bord Fáilte advertises these attractions in other magazines which I have not seen.  I hope that is so.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see further assistance being given to the tourist industry. Tourism holds great prospects for the future.  I am sure it will be appreciated by the Minister and by Bord Fáilte that anything I have said which may be critical has not been carping criticism but the kind of criticism which I believe ought to be made in the interest of a very great industry with a very great future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JaneDowdall" hpid="Mrs. Dowdall Mrs. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I, also, am glad that the Minister has come here to secure that Bord Fáilte will be given added financial help to carry on its work. Some Senators have suggested that we are not giving Bord Fáilte enough. That, of course, could be said no matter how many millions per annum the Minister would make available because, as we all know, the development of tourism is a vast project, the demands of which could be endless and on which we could spend far more money than we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> It is good to know that the average of visitors and money taken is increasing and if it is not increasing as fast as some people might wish, perhaps it is just as well that we should develop cautiously and carefully and retain the goodwill of the visitors who come to us and who will return in the future.</P>
    <P>Much praise is due to Bord Fáilte and I add mine, but in this general backpatting of Bord Fáilte, as if they were the only group doing propaganda about tourism, I should like to draw the attention of the Seanad to the association that started this very firm idea very many years ago.  I speak of the Irish Tourist Association and I mention them now because it is well known to all of us that they, in their wisdom, began their work when it was not even thought of by many people as being very profitable or economically a good thing for Ireland to develop tourism.  Their slogan at the beginning was: &ldquo;See Ireland first.&rdquo; That would cover the argument put up by some of the Senators that many people go on holidays abroad to many countries.  They can tell you about the Casbah in Algiers or what is happening on the Costa Brava but they have no idea of the beauties of Donegal or the West of Ireland or Cork.  That is rather lopsided.  I should say there are hundreds of thousands of our own people not benefiting by the beauty of our own country and not spending their holidays in it.  The Tourist Association by its voluntary work involving all kinds of people all over the country and by their representation on local authorities, in this work of developing tourism, is engaged in one of the most valuable facets of the whole business.</P>
    <P>The voluntary nature of their work and the propaganda they can do on farms and in shops and in the smaller spheres is the essentially important thing that we want for this kind of development.  Granted it is not so difficult to make propaganda about tourism as most people accept it but there is still work to do and I suggest that the Irish Tourist Association is doing more than its share in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is a growing discontent among hoteliers.  I hear them complaining <Col N="1830" /> about the difficulty of securing staffs.  That is understandable. The season is so short and when the hotels and guest houses secure good staffs, they cannot keep them employed in the off season.  I think it has been mentioned here before&mdash;and it is something that I always think is very important&mdash;that if some method could be found of giving occupation to hotel staffs in the winter, either in their own districts or elsewhere, so that they could be kept as members of the staff in the hotel concerned when the season reopened, it would be of great value.  There could be a development whereby crafts could be taught and the souvenir industry benefited if these people who are let off by the hotels&mdash;and many of whom emigrate and never come back&mdash;were trained so that they could usefully employ their time in the winter to benefit themselves.  That would secure continuing occupation and also improve and assist the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who say that we must not&mdash;and Bord Fáilte must not &mdash;think only in terms of luxurious hotels, even if the word &ldquo;luxurious&rdquo; is not used in describing them.  Our country, being a small one, and having as the main attraction for tourists its family atmosphere, the family hotel development as in France and Switzerland appears to be the most suitable.  With proper training of young people and with the aid of Bord Fáilte and the I.T.A., I think these young people might set up business even in a small way around the country.  There are many parts where there is no accommodation at all.  That calls for family hotel development and I hope many young people will think of it and that some of the money now being provided for Bord Fáilte might find its way into such development.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan mentioned certain parts of the midlands that are not mentioned in Bord Fáilte propaganda. That can be said about many small places and smallish resorts on the Cork coast make the same complaint. Certain big important centres seem to get all the advertising but with this <Col N="1831" /> new encouragement to local authorities and with the aid of Bord Fáilte to make improvements and increase the facilities in these areas the local people themselves can, when they find their work meeting with some success in some respects, as I have known it to happen in parts of the south, generate their own publicity and create their own business with people in Britain and America, bypassing the great central authority.  American visitors say they would like a better, a greater variety of goods on sale at the Shannon Airport shop.  There is a large stock there but, after touring the country and being to many towns, they think that the best of the goods available are not shown at Shannon Airport. That is something that might be examined.</P>
    <P>We all agree about the beauty of our country, its peace and quiet, but it is becoming ironic to find that the very beauty of which we are proud cannot be seen because of the height of the hedges.  Driving around the south of Ireland in the past few weeks, I could not find any improvement in that respect.  I know that the Board made an effort to get hedges lowered and I hope they will continue that effort because it is literally true that in parts of the country through which I travelled in the past few weeks the hedges were up to 10 feet high or higher.</P>
    <P>In any development of the hotel industry, I agree with Senator O'Quigley, who spoke of the standardisation and the chromium plating, that it would be desirable and advisable that new hotels, guest houses or restaurants should try to retain something distinctively Irish. Things that are distinctively Irish, at their best, are the best you can find anywhere.  They are artistically correct, in good taste and suitable and I think we could do ourselves a lot of good by developing in that way.</P>
    <P>I agree also with Senators who spoke about the lack of emphasis on food.  In our hotels, restaurants and guest houses there is a lack of imagination.  There is never any doubt about the quantity.  One always gets far too much, I think, but there is a <Col N="1832" /> lack of imagination in the arranging of meals and especially of evening meals.  The lack of choice is deplorable. To remedy this does not call for great staffs of cooks or chefs but just a little imagination and variety in the food supply.</P>
    <P>The idea of increasing the money available to the Board is laudable.  I hope that in the allocation of it, they will remember two things in which I am interested, the great cry about tourism that we have all been making; the desirability of extending the tourist season.  In Cork we have been trying to do that since the founding of An Tóstal and I think at present we have the honour to have the only Tóstal Council in the country.  We started two events which have extended the tourist season.  We have the Choral Festival in the month of May and the Film Festival at the end of September.  Both these events still need subventions from the Board.  I hope with their increased prosperity the Board will see their way to continue that support, even though, according to their own rigid assessment, we may not be able to prove, as they would wish it to be proved, that we have brought foreigners to the country.  We can prove it, but to prove it to the extent they desire is another matter.  I mention it here because I think it is a good time to do so.  These events which have cost, and are costing, a certain amount of money are the result of a great amount of voluntary effort and achieve the important objective of extending the tourist season.  I hope, therefore, the Board will continue to give them the financial support they need.  I have pleasure in supporting the Bill and I wish the Board every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill.  Tourism is one field in which there is great room for improvement. Not nearly enough is being done to keep our own people at home during their holidays.  Last week, a very large amount of money was paid out to people going on holidays. It is too bad we cannot encourage more of those people to spend their holidays in their own country.  Some time ago, I met a man who was going <Col N="1833" /> on holidays with his wife and family to the Isle of Man.  The excuse he gave me was that there was no place here where they could have a seaside holiday as well as amusements for the children and that they wanted the children to enjoy the holiday as much as themselves.  We talk about bringing in tourists, but would it not be as good if we could persuade our own people to spend their money here?</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan complained that Leitrim had been neglected.  The part of the country in which I was born and reared&mdash;the stretch of coast from Achill, Mulranny, Westport, Louisburgh to Leenane in Galway&mdash;is second to none, but I have no hesitation in saying it is left in the background and that it should get more publicity.  As far as sport is concerned, good work has been done in promoting the Westport Sea Angling Festival.  Although I am against the establishment of large and elaborate hotels, catering for certain people at certain times of the year, I believe there is room for better hotel accommodation in that area.  The type of hotel I should like to see erected is the type that would cater for persons such as the man I have just spoken about&mdash;a hotel where he and his wife and family can find reasonable accommodation at a reasonable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to raise, although I do not know if I am strictly in order.  I could never understand the mentality of certain public representatives in my county who kicked up such a row about foreigners buying land.  I want to make my position clear.  There is no Senator more opposed to the purchase of good, arable land by foreigners than I am. However, the area I am speaking of, and which I know so well, contains land on which a family cannot eke out a living at present.  If foreigners buy that land, erect chalets on it and bring tourists into the country, instead of anybody saying anything against them, they should be encouraged to come here.  I think it is madness that responsible public people should kick up a row and oppose that development, which brings money and tourists to this country at no cost to the nation.  I want to make it clear again that I am <Col N="1834" /> against the purchase of good, arable land.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte have a great responsibility in respect of the employees of hotels which receive grants.  I shall not labour the point.  I could, if I wanted to, convince the Minister that the girl employees of some of the hotels have to work under the most slavish conditions in respect of hours, pay and everything else.  The result is that they stay only a while and then have to emigrate.  When we expect a good type of person to visit our hotels, we should at least ensure that the working conditions are worthy of Irish employees.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to say very much on this Bill, in view of the fact that so many aspects of tourism have been touched on by Senators.  We all agree that the tourist industry is now a major industry and that every encouragement should be given to it so that it may expand even more.  Of course, this cannot be done without the expenditure of more money.  A certain amount of criticism has been levelled against Bord Fáilte during the course of this debate.  I do not say that Senators should not be at liberty to criticise the Board, and indeed I would criticise it myself, if I thought such criticism justified.  There has been criticism, for instance, on the ground that their publicity is inadequate. Publicity can be a very expensive item.  I daresay that their <Col N="1835" /> activity in regard to publicity will always be conditioned by the amount of money they have at their disposal.</P>
      <P>They have also been criticised for not paying more attention to certain parts of the country.  Of course, we can all make a case for our own particular area.  Senator Lenihan censured Bord Fáilte for paying too much attention to Killarney and he tried to convince us that there is scenery up the country even finer than the scenery in Killarney.  I wonder would anybody accept that point of view?  Somebody mentioned Wexford.  Wexford has some very fine scenery.  It has a grand coastline, wonderful fishing and wonderful bathing facilities.  But everybody knows Killarney has been the Mecca of tourists for countless years. The splendour of the scenery there and its unique attractiveness are things which have put this country on the map of the world.  I think Bord Fáilte are quite justified in giving generous grants towards the development of that area.  This advocacy for the spending of more money in certain other areas is a bad approach in relation to tourism.  Expenditure is a matter for Bord Fáilte and it should be left to their discretion.  They are the best judges.  They can take a more detached view.</P>
      <P>I think Bord Fáilte are doing an excellent job.  They have approached the question of tourism with imagination and energy.  They deserve the plaudits of this House.  We have been peculiarly fortunate in the specialist Boards we have set up, and very fortunate in Bord Fáilte.  It has been said we are not spending enough money on tourism and that we should spend more.  It is very easy to say that, and we would all advocate the spending of more money, but we must always have regard to the resources available to us. Having regard to the resources available to us, we are not, I think, spending a bad share at all.  We are spending as much as can be expected, and there is provision in this Bill for a substantial increase in the amount of money to be spent on tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the standard of catering in our hotels.  Perhaps <Col N="1836" /> here and there the standard may not be up to the mark but there has been, on the whole, a wonderful improvement in both the standard of catering and the standard of cleanliness in the last eight or ten years.  It has been said that anyone who goes away satisfied is an advertisement for the tourist industry here.  There is no doubt about that.  If anyone is dissatisfied he has his remedy.  He can lodge a complaint with Bord Fáilte. They control the grading of hotels.</P>

      <P>I have a crow to pluck with Senator Lenihan.  I advise him, the next time he goes boating on the Shannon, to go in the opposite direction and take a sail down as far as Killaloe.  He will see scenery that will bear comparison with some of the areas he mentioned here.  I do not wish to belittle these areas.  There is beautiful scenery all over the country. I suppose it is only natural that most of us should find the most familiar the most beautiful.  I should direct the Senator's attention to the views along the lower reaches of Lough Derg.  Both sides of the Shannon are really magnificent. The Tipperary side, perhaps, stands out.  Many people believe the view from the Corkscrew Hill at Lisdoonvarna one of the finest in the country, not to mention Inchiquin, famous for its trout fishing.  The quality of the fish is reputed to be the best in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the best way of extending the tourist industry would be by the provision of more fishing and shooting <Col N="1837" /> facilities, with consequential employment for those engaged in the hotel industry over a longer period than is possible in present circumstances.  The great difficulty for hotels in most of our resorts is the limited season.  They have difficulty in securing staff in the early part of the season.  They employ them for about three months and when the tourist season is over they cannot manage to keep them on.  The same difficulty arises year after year.</P>
    <P>I agree with other speakers that the Tourist Board is doing a very good job.  Long before that Board was set up, as Senator Mrs. Dowdall has reminded us, the Irish Tourist Development Association with very limited resources had to fight an uphill battle and had difficulty in getting a small contribution from various public bodies.  I remember some 30 years ago these matters being the subject of considerable controversy in local authorities but since then it must be admitted that the standard of our hotels has much improved, which is all to the good.  It is wrong for people to expect the Tourist Board or any outside authority to do everything for them. We must get away from that idea. There are certain resorts that had the initiative to go in for a full programme of development and it is a credit to them.  I shall mention just one, not in my own former constituency but in the adjoining one, Salthill in Galway.  They have done exceptionally fine work there.  They took full advantage of whatever grants were made available. Similar grants should be made available in other areas.  I am glad to notice that in Lahinch in recent times they have gone all out on a similar project. It is by local initiative that we shall make progress, if progress is to be made at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister and through him, Bord Fáilte to look into the matter to which Senator Tunney referred, namely, the treatment meted out to young girls who go into hotels for improvement courses.  The Minister and the Board should ensure that they get proper food and accommodation as well as whatever small salaries they are given in these hotels.  These <Col N="1838" /> hotels are profiting well from the tourist development and these young girls should not be ill-treated as they have been in our largest hotels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to enter into an argument with Senator Lenihan and Senator Ó Ciosáin in regard to the merits of Killarney.  At this stage Killarney should not need a boost from Bord Fáilte by the spending of money. The boost in regard to Killarney was started by a song writer who wrote the famous song which is still current. That is sufficient without any further help from Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers mentioned particular areas and drew attention to beauty spots in those areas.  That is a nice thing to do but I wonder how far it is permissible on this Bill?  While I agree that good work has been done by Bord Fáilte, they have a duty to organise tourism to a greater degree all over the country, not necessarily in Killarney, Lisdoonvarna or other places to which attention has been drawn as beauty spots.  There is a lot of natural beauty in the country even in County Wexford of which I have not seen very much.  However, you do not solve problems merely by spending money.  Money must be spent intelligently if it is to achieve satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte should advise the people in small towns and villages in regard to providing accommodation and other necessary facilities, and encourage the development of coarse fishing or other tourist attractions that may exist in an area.  It is also necessary to ensure that tourist income is spread evenly over the country and not allowed to accumulate in well-known centres. That would be a disastrous policy if it were carried too far.  Bord Fáilte must give a lead to the people, survey the facilities available, and so on.  That is most essential unless we want&mdash;as I think none of us wants&mdash;State control of tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More could be done for the unadvertised places whether they be in Donegal, Cavan, Leitrim or Mayo.  I do not believe that sufficient attention has been given by Bord Fáilte to these smaller places.  Perhaps because of the <Col N="1839" /> lack of organisation there, the people may not make enough fuss or shout sufficiently loudly into the ears of Bord Fáilte.  It should not be necessary for small communities to have to do that but I suppose agitation is important and that most of the problems of the world have been solved by agitation of the proper kind.  There are many areas where there is not that agitation. It is the duty of Bord Fáilte to look for the work that has to be done in these areas where people are unorganised and where there is no serious effort to exploit the tourist potential.</P>
    <P>I do not want to follow up Senators in comparing the beauty of Killarney with the beauty of Lough Gill though I could do it.  In areas like Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal, there is more beautiful scenery but we were not lucky enough to get a song writer some 50 years ago to write a song about it.  That was the tragedy of those places.  I should be quite happy so long as the facilities that are made available will be properly exploited all over the country, particularly in the small towns and villages in the congested districts where the money income from tourism is more important.  It is only by leadership, direction and advice that the people will measure up to the requirements.  It is only by giving the proper direction and advice to the hotel people and the people in the small towns who are prepared to accommodate fishermen that a proper spreading out of the tourist income can be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my hope, when I came in this afternoon, to reply to most of the points made in the course of the debate but so many Senators have spoken that I hope I will be forgiven if I cannot deal with each point raised.  The debate was conducted at a very good level.  There was a certain amount of criticism, very constructive criticism, of the way in which we are handling our tourist business.  That is all to the good though Senator O'Quigley seemed to suggest that criticism made <Col N="1840" /> here appeared to fall on deaf ears.  I think the contrary is the case.  While Board Fáilte have eyes to see where the fault lies, they must listen to statements made in the course of debates in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In regard to such statements, one could not help but pay a tribute to the most interesting contribution made to this debate by Senator Stanford. While listening to him on the last evening, I was hoping that he would keep going for some time longer than he did but as an indication that criticism or constructive suggestions can bear fruit, my action, following Senator's Stanford's speech, is a good illustration.</P>
      <P>He spoke about the necessity of developing the historical side of our tourist industry and of making more of our literary history.  He said that we should exploit to the full the perhaps limited literary history we have, in relation to tourism.  I found myself during the course of the weekend in the reaches of the middle Shannon, shall I say.  As a result of his suggestion about Goldsmith, I went to see some of the famous Goldsmith spots.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I must say I was very impressed by the manner in which the Goldsmith Society and Bord Fáilte have combined to provide very excellent and informative plaques in each of these locations.  However, I must say that we, as a nation, do not do justice to these places.  The locations are readily identifiable but when one comes to &ldquo;the busy mill&rdquo; and &ldquo;the never failing brook&rdquo;, one can only see an overgrowth of briars, brambles and all kinds of weeds.  One cannot even discern a stone upon a stone.  One can only hear the &ldquo;never failing brook&rdquo; but never see it.  It is a great pity that we have not done more to identify these locations and also to preserve what remains of these historic spots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scott, in his life of Goldsmith, tried to suggest that Ireland claimed wrongfully the location of many of the features of Goldsmith's <i>Deserted Village</i>.  I suppose an arguable case can be made for that but, nevertheless, there is indisputable evidence of <Col N="1841" /> Goldsmith's birthplace at Pallas which I visited on this occasion, largely by reason of the assistance provided in these plaques of the Goldsmith Society and Bord Fáilte.  Having got there, I was very disappointed, indeed. The outside lane was overgrown. Cattle were gathered round what remained of the house in which Goldsmith was born.  One would wonder, perhaps, that I should come here to make complaints when to an extent the remedy is in my own hands, but, having recently seen these things, I felt rather disappointed that we had not made more of them.</P>
    <P>Similarly with the parsonage at Lissoy.  That is still in a very fine state of preservation.  Were it not for the interest of the farmer who owns the property, it might deteriorate still further.  I am sure that his co-operation and the co-operation of the other landowners on which these famous spots are could be readily got to ensure that these places are not only marked and identified but properly preserved in such a way that reasonable access can be made to them by tourists and our own people and also so that what remains of them will be available for posterity.</P>
    <P>One of the criticisms made during the course of the debate was rather surprising to me, especially from the source whence it came.  Senator Quinlan suggested that we do not spend enough money on tourism.  I agree entirely that we do not spend enough money on tourism but, unfortunately, we have to cut our cloth in every Department according to our measure.  Nevertheless, this Bill is an advance in that we are providing a sum of £5,000,000 to be expended over a period which it is supposed will be seven years.  However, if Bord Fáilte put up a convincing case for the acceleration of that expenditure, it will, of course, be listened to and what money is justified will be made available.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I think we compare very favourably with tourist promotional activity as carried on in other countries.  Here we spend more than is spent in the United Kingdom in relation to the income from tourism.  They <Col N="1842" /> spend over £1,000,000 under the British Travel and Holiday Association per annum and earn about £250,000,000. We spend, as of now, about £700,000 and earn about £43,000,000 per annum. I think we can make the same claim in respect of many continental countries, so that, in relation to income, our expenditure on tourist promotion is pretty high.  In that respect, I think it was Senator Donegan who made the point that much of our income from tourism tends to be exaggerated in so far as a lot of money comes in from our emigrants who, having gone abroad, come back for holidays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not what I said.  I said the official figures were to a certain extent confounded by this question of emigrants coming and going.  I did not suggest that the net result was that our income from tourism was smaller than that published. From year to year, the figures as published tend to be inaccurate because of this flow of emigrants in and out and people coming across the Border as well who are included.  There is no desire to reduce the figure which we think comes from tourism.  The Minister understands what I mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand entirely &mdash;it is a valid enough point; it is a point which was made in the course of the debate in the Dáil&mdash;but Bord Fáilte have been able to estimate fairly closely the amount of money that tourists bring and the number of them who are really tourists, as opposed to former emigrants returning for a short holiday, or people who come and go in the ordinary course of business. Roughly speaking, the divide is, of the £44,500,000 earned last year, £23,000,000 was contributed by tourists who were neither businessmen nor returning emigrants or anybody else in that class.  Of the 1,400,000 visits, almost 700,000 were made by tourists coming to visit the country, in the strict sense of the meaning of the word &ldquo;tourist&rdquo;, so that we are doing reasonably well in attracting people who have no other interest in coming to this country than to spend a holiday in a strange place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that as we attract more and <Col N="1843" /> more of these people, the difficulty in regard to hotel accommodation will become more acute.  However, one of the main efforts of Bord Fáilte is directed towards the provision of greater accommodation, and in fact that is one of the purposes of this Bill also.  I should like to deal with some of the comments made in that respect. In the first place, there is no truth in the suggestion that Bord Fáilte are concentrating more on the luxury type of tourist accommodation than on the ordinary type.  That comment was made more forcibly in the Dáil than here, but nevertheless many people seem to have the idea that the ordinary middle or lower than middle class accommodation is being ignored.  I should like to deal with the point that we are not keeping pace with the increased number of tourists who come here.  In fact we have been doing quite well in the last few years as a result of the assistance given under Bills such as this to hoteliers and guest house owners to improve and extend accommodation.</P>
    <P>In the year ended March, 1961, as compared with the previous year, there has been an increase in hotel bedroom accommodation of 1,383.  Of that number, 615 rooms have hot and cold water facilities and 283 have bed-bath units.  In the overall figure, 93 per cent. of our hotel bedrooms are equipped with hot and cold water facilities and almost ten per cent. with bed-bath units.  In the guest house category, there was an increase of 352 units, bringing the number to 4,009, or roughly a nine per cent. increase. Even in the guest houses, 69 per cent. of the bedrooms are equipped with hot and cold water facilities.  In the other types of holiday accommodation, holiday camps, youth hostels, etc., there has been a very spectacular increase in the 12 months of 859, or from 4,184 to 5,043.  So that all in all we have been doing fairly well.  Bord Fáilte in their &ldquo;better hotels plan&rdquo; envisaged an increase of 2,500 rooms by April, 1963.  At the end of 1961, 1,160 of these rooms had been provided, that is, of the 2,500 planned.  A further 600 are planned in the current year.  Again, by way of reply to the <Col N="1844" /> criticism that we are concentrating on luxury accommodation, half of that 2,500 will be in the nature of the lower grade hotel class.  Later in 1963, there will be a further addition of 500 bedrooms under the international hotel scheme, that is, the large hotel for Dublin and the two large hotels for Cork and Limerick.  By and large, we are making good strides in the provision of hotel bedrooms.</P>
    <P>That brings me to Senator Ó Maoláin's criticism.  I am afraid he has been listening to complaints and giving too much ear to them when he says that it is impossible to get single bedroom accommodation.  The figures for 1960 in respect of hotel accommodation for all grades&mdash;I am ignoring guest houses and others&mdash;were 9,339 double bedrooms and 5,624 single rooms, so we have roughly three single bedrooms to every five double rooms in the hotels.  It is true that there have been some complaints but what is more true, perhaps, is that from now on the cost of providing single bedrooms will be largely uneconomic compared with the provision of double rooms.  Of course, the same four walls will have to be erected but the floor space will have to be bigger in the case of the double rooms.  Obviously it will be more economic for any hotelier to provide for double bedrooms in the future even if on occasion he will let them as single rooms. Nevertheless the fact remains that we have at the moment five double bedrooms for every three single rooms, which is a fairly good proportion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not a lot of these single rooms be occupied by the commercial community, travellers and such people?  I should not like the Minister to overlook that.  They are down as rooms available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fairly likely but usually they occupy them from Monday to Thursday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so that they are available at weekends if they are occupied in the middle of the week. However, it is a universal problem and it is not confined to Ireland, but, as compared with other countries, we <Col N="1845" /> have a good proportion of single bedroom accommodation compared with double bedroom accommodation.</P>
      <P>Some criticism was voiced in regard to the standards we have to offer in our hotels.  Some commendation was made of the improving standards not only in regard to cleanliness and hygiene but in regard to service and food.  We have progressed very well in recent years and during the course of the past year or two, when I have been opening hotels, I have taken advantage of the occasions to relay criticisms which were offered to me and to Bord Fáilte about the standard of the services provided and about complaints in regard to other matters, such as alleged overcharging, or charging extras which were not listed on the hotels' tariffs.  These practices are still with us but I think they are on the decrease.  I have encouraged Bord Fáilte on all occasions to take the strongest possible action that they can when such complaints are brought to their notice.</P>
      <P>By and large, I think it is due to the hotels to pay a tribute to them for the significant improvement in standards, in décor, in cleanliness, in the quality and variety of food.  Similarly, I think I ought to pay a tribute to the private people who have had their homes and shops repainted, particularly on the outside, in order to make their localities more attractive.  This is perhaps due to some extent to the Tidy Towns and Roadside Gardens competitions promoted by Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>Having travelled throughout the country in many directions recently I could not but feel proud of the manner in which the Irish people are responding to the inducement to make their towns, villages and roadside houses more attractive.  Many of them are blossoming into a variety of bright colours in outside decoration which is most attractive.  The more we have of that the more attractive will be our country towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that any exhortations I have made over the past two years have been responsible in any way for that satisfactory state of affairs.  I would rather give the credit in the first place to the sense of pride of the people themselves and, in the <Col N="1846" /> second place, to the promotional encouragement given by Bord Fáilte. In the long run, we must agree that our countryside is presenting a much more attractive and brighter appearance not only to our visitors but to ourselves.</P>
    <P>There are still a few bad spots, unfortunately, where old, rusted, corrugated iron sheds are lying around, where partly dilapidated houses with thatched roofs falling in are left in a dangerous and, I might even suggest, an unhygienic condition.  Certainly, apart from their danger and lack of hygiene, they present a shocking eyesore as one passes through the country. I hope the new Bill which the Minister for Local Government will introduce will provide adequate powers to local authorities to ensure that people will not be permitted to spoil the countryside, to the beauty of which so many have been contributing of late.</P>
    <P>With regard to hotel staffs, Bord Fáilte have, over the years, been taking very active steps to help to provide a sufficient number of adequately-trained hotel staff personnel.  They have cooperated with vocational education committees throughout the country. They have courses such as the six months' residential course in Portnablagh, Rosslare and Cobh under which no fewer than 132 girls were enabled to begin work as junior cooks, waitresses and housemaids.  This scheme began in 1954.  Since then, 800 girls have been trained for hotel work generally.  Fortunately, 75 per cent. of these are still engaged at that work.  That does not mean that 25 per cent. have gone abroad.  Some of them have, no doubt, but others have got married and others have resigned from that type of employment for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <P>There are at the moment 61 boys training to be commis chefs and commis waiters at residential courses at Athenry and Rockwell College.  At Coláiste Mhuire le Tíos in Dublin there are 21 students training to be cooks and commis chefs as well.  These are very desirable activities and ones which should be given every encouragement not only by this House, through the subvention to Bord Fáilte, but by <Col N="1847" /> local authorities and vocational education representatives on local authorities who are members of vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I have heard of the complaint made by Senator Tunney that some of the staffs are not well treated in hotels.  I have not yet got a direct complaint.  I am not suggesting that there are not any grounds for the complaint; obviously, there must be.  If I do get any complaints I certainly would be most anxious to ensure that the causes of complaints are eliminated.  While I should not like to ascribe any degree of responsibility in this, nor would I ask Bord Fáilte to suggest that&mdash;it is not their responsibility, either&mdash;I think it is one that should be looked after by the respective trade unions.</P>
    <P>The trade unions on the catering side are active and are no doubt solicitous for the welfare of their members. However, between the unions, Bord Fáilte and the Minister, there ought to be a remedy for any cases of improper treatment&mdash;I should not like to suggest it is ill-treatment&mdash;from the point of view of food, accommodation or long hours.  They should be overcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford made the point during the course of his interesting contribution that we should pay particular attention to the quality of the guides we provide whether in organised or in unorganised tours.  Guides cannot be provided very readily for unorganised tours.  I have heard high tributes paid to the standard, the quality, of the guides C.I.E. provide in their bus tours. I do not know if there are guides on organised tours except, perhaps, where people go to places of interest such as the Rock of Cashel, the Japanese Gardens in Kildare, and other parts of the country, and there are guides on the spot.  I have been in some of these places.  I have found that the knowledge of these guides is quite wide and can be of tremendous interest to tourists.  In fact, it is almost essential that tourists be given the background knowledge in regard to what they will see.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Education <Col N="1848" /> I encouraged national teachers to spend some time of the week or of the day in teaching the children all the lore and history of the area in which they reside and in teaching them to be able to give directions and distances.  If a motorist, in particular, stops a young person on the road to ask the direction to any place it is very important that the young person should be able to give reasonably accurate directions and should be fairly near or not too far off with regard to distance.  There is nothing more annoying for a tourist than to be told that if he takes a turn to the right about a mile ahead it will bring him nearer his destination and, after driving five miles, still he may find that he has not yet reached the turn to the right.  It has happened to us all.</P>
    <P>It is important that teachers in national schools, especially in rural areas, should acquaint the children of all these matters and I again repeat that exhortation here.  Nothing can impress tourists more than to meet bright and intelligent young people who are able to give accurate descriptions, accurate estimates of distances and accurate directions to places of interest.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with some if not all of the main points raised on this Second Reading debate.  I can assure the House that the contributions to this debate, and the constructive criticism which has permeated it, will carefully be taken note of by me and by Bord Fáilte.  Those of them which are found practicable will be implemented to the greatest possible extent.  I should say, of course, that, as in all cases, Bord Fáilte are limited by the amount of money the Oireachtas can provide.  I think I can endorse what has been said by the majority of the members of the Seanad, that the money that is being provided is well spent in general.</P>

      <P>The Leas-Chathaoirleach will, perhaps, allow me in passing to thank the Minister for the constructive manner in which he has dealt with the various points raised. We must not overlook the fact that about 300,000 people visited us last year from Great Britain.  There must be almost 1,000,000 people of Irish blood living in Britain today.  Of the percentage of people who visited us last year, probably two-thirds were born here.  I do not think we have touched the fringe of the tourist potential in Britain.  We must do more for the small hotels and guest houses. I am on holiday and I noticed English people camping.  There is a population of about 51,000,000 or 52,000,000 right on our doorstep on an overcrowded island.  Of that population we should reach at least 1,000,000.  I suppose half the people in Britain go on holiday every year, and out of that potential we attracted only 300,000, and many came here because they are our kinsfolk.</P>
      <P>On Second Reading I forgot to mention what I consider to be a very important matter.  The toilets in our hotels and on our public conveyances &mdash;our railways&mdash;are not looked after in the way in which they should be. Travelling on the Continent I noticed that there are attendants on all long distance trains.  I am not in any sense criticising C.I.E.  They are doing a great job, but if a train takes three hours, or three and a half hours, to go from Dublin to Cork or Galway, or four hours to go from Dublin to Sligo, there may be children on it who want to use the conveniences and they are not always as clean and tidy as they should be.  It is a very important matter and one of which the Minister should take notice.</P>

      <P>Before we take up consideration of the Report Stage of this Bill, I should like to indicate that I have ruled that Amendment 1, standing in the names of Senators Davidson and Murphy, is out of order on the grounds that it is outside the scope of the Bill as read a Second Time.  The Senators have been notified accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure of what I am allowed to say at this stage, but I should like to say that while the Bill is welcomed for whatever improvement it may bring to a very restricted number of workers, it is very much to be regretted that the Minister did not take the opportunity to include the large number of agricultural workers who through the definition of &ldquo;agricultural employer&rdquo; in earlier Acts are denied the protection which these Acts afford.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he can say if these agricultural workers who, because they work for nonagricultural employers, are denied the benefits of the Bill will be covered in any other way.  Can the Minister say, for instance, if it is the intention that they should be covered by the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961, as they are not covered by the exemption contained in Section (1) (b) of that Act?</P>
      <P>In this age when the importance of our agricultural industry is being stressed more and more, it is deplorable that the workers in this industry are so badly treated and given so grudgingly the things that industrial workers have enjoyed for years.  If we paused for a moment we could draw up a list of professions, occupations and callings that could be done without, but we would be a sad and sorry populace if we found ourselves in the position that our agricultural workers had disappeared from the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1851" /> I would make an appeal to the Minister to examine the position and see if, by regulation or otherwise, he can remove the injustice to a large section of the workers in our most important industry.</P>
    <P>I know there are very many of these workers who will be outside the scope of the Bill.  Even the employees of the State farms are outside its scope because the Minister is not an agricultural employer.  The State employees, however, suffer no hardship because at present they are covered by an agreement with a trade union but that might not always be the case.  I would again ask the Minister to look into this very serious shortcoming in the Bill and to be generous to our fine workers in agriculture.</P>

      <P>I do not understand, but, of course, we have to accept it as your ruling, how the amendment in the name of Senator Miss Davidson came to be out of order.  I would think that once we were talking about an agricultural employer in Section 2, we would be entitled for the purpose of this Bill to define what we mean by &ldquo;agricultural employer&rdquo;.  It does seem to me that you can have agricultural workers as defined in the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Act, 1950, engaged in agriculture as defined but they may not be employed by a person who is an agricultural employer as defined in the <Col N="1852" /> Act of 1950.  That is quite clear. Senator Miss Davidson has given the instance of a person being undoubtedly an agricultural worker, working, say, for the Agricultural Institute and the Agricultural Institute is not carrying on the trade or business of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I am talking about an agricultural employer who is in the Bill in Section 2.  What interpretation are we to put on that? I think the Bill is defective in that there are no provisions for agricultural workers who will not be engaged or employed by agricultural employers. Therefore, all that section of the agricultural working population will not benefit from this Bill.  It is another day's work as to whether they will benefit under the Holiday (Employees) Act which we passed last week.  It would be much more intelligible and intelligent to legislate for all agricultural workers in the one Bill, whether they are employed by agricultural employers or persons who are not agricultural employers.</P>
      <P>There was criticism on the last occasion as to why this Bill and the Holiday (Employees) Bill were separate and distinct.  Whatever justification there may have been for that division between agricultural and industrial workers, there is no basis and no justification for distinguishing between two types of agricultural workers by reference solely to their employer, as is being done in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to make only one comment in respect of what Senator Miss Davidson said.  The farmers whom I meet and know well would like to be able to pay their workers and to be paid themselves as well as the rest of the people in the country.  That is the great difficulty. It puts the farmers very much on the wrong foot with regard to an advance in social conditions.  I shall illustrate that.  Last year, the farmer's income went down by five per cent. and that of everybody else went up by 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>Senator Moylan, when Minister for Agriculture, speaking in this House, said that he could not help remarking that in the Seanad we always congratulated the Minister on introducing anything in the House and then proceeded to criticise him immediately afterwards.</P>
      <P>As an agricultural employer, I should like to concur in the viewpoint expressed by Senator Miss Davidson because I do not think we have any body of employees who are sounder men and better servants to their employers than the agricultural workers.  The maximum in holidays should be theirs because their work is hard.</P>
      <P>When skimming over the debate in the Dáil, I remarked that one Deputy wanted to emphasise to the Minister that in the event of Christmas Day falling on a working day and a Sunday coinciding with a Church holiday, some special arrangements should be made. One point was missed in the Dáil&mdash; the Minister knows this very well, being a farmer&mdash;that an agricultural worker in many cases is dealing with life. He deals with live animals.  Therefore, there must be a very clear distinction between an agricultural worker and an industrial worker.  You may lay down nice regulations and make everything in the garden seem lovely, but on a farm every day there are eventualities which the smartest farmer cannot anticipate. The Minister was very right in making that more or less clear.  There is something to be said for the Labour Party in this country who put up a fight for the agricultural workers because in days gone by the men were very often underpaid.</P>

I should like, first, to remind him that when the Holidays (Employees) Bill was before the House, we were assured by the Minister responsible for that Bill as to those who would be covered and, on the last occasion we debated this Bill, we were told that anybody who was not covered by the sections of this Bill would be caught by the Holidays (Employees) Act.  I would ask the Minister if he can assure the House that the categories of workers to whom Senator Miss Davidson has referred will be covered by this Bill or by the other Act.  That would clarify the point for everybody.</P>

      <P>My difficulty is that I do not know what type of worker Senator Miss Davidson has in mind, nor do the Agricultural Wages Board know.  The Senator who has just spoken has made the position quite clear in the sense that, should it transpire that a worker is not covered by the provisions of this Bill, then that worker is covered by the provisions of the legislation dealing with the other class of work.  For that reason, and for several other reasons I could give, if the Chair had not ruled the amendment out of order, I see no purpose at all, even if the amendment had not been ruled out of order, in the amendment.  In fact it could not be accepted because it is altogether too loose.  One could not make any effort at defining &ldquo;agricultural employer&rdquo; under it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The more important of the two Bills is the Establishment and Constitution Bill.  Its object is to provide for the establishment and constitution of courts of justice pursuant to the requirements of Article 34 of the Constitution.  In accordance with that Article it proposes to establish a Court of Final Appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal and Courts of First Instance.  The Courts of First Instance follow the same pattern as the existing courts and comprise the High Court, the Circuit Court, and the district court.  The fact that no change is being made in the existing pattern recognises that the existing courts have operated successfully since they were established under the 1922 Constitution nearly 40 years ago. However, one important change is being made in the constitution of the district court by the creation of a new office of President of that Court.  The <Col N="1857" /> reasons for the creation of this office will be explained later on when I come to deal with the provisions of the Supplemental Provisions Bill.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of the new courts under this Bill, the existing courts will, of course, cease to exercise jurisdiction and Section 7 of the Bill provides accordingly.  The position of existing judges and justices is being fully protected.  The formal disestablishment of the existing courts will not take place until each judge has vacated office with his consent.  Moreover, these judges and justices, and they only, will be eligible for appointment to the new courts and any judge or justice who is so appointed or who retires before the Bills are brought into operation will retain his existing pension rights.</P>
      <P>The Supplemental Provisions Bill is, as its title indicates, supplementary to the Establishment and Constitution Bill and is, I am afraid, a rather lengthy and technical measure of 61 sections and eight Schedules.  It regulates various matters affecting the new courts and the judges, justices and officers thereof.  In most cases this is done by the application of the enactments governing the existing courts with whatever modifications are necessary, but this expedient cannot be satisfactorily applied in some instances&mdash;notably with regard to the jurisdiction of the circuit court&mdash;and it has been necessary to incorporate new comprehensive provisions.  I should say at this point that I am hoping that when this legislation has been passed, work will be continued on a measure which aims at consolidating all the enactments relating to the courts.  This measure will replace the Act which will result from this Bill and will lead to a position in which there will be only two measures governing the courts of justice&mdash;the Establishment and Constitution Act and the Consolidating Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the most important provisions of the Bill are those conferring upon the President of the District Court powers aimed at securing an improvement in the efficiency of the district court.  This is the court to which most of the citizens have to have recourse. It handles over a quarter million cases a year, and it therefore calls for, in a <Col N="1858" /> special degree, efficient organisation of its business.  I do not want to exaggerate the extent of the complaints that have been made from time to time about late starting of courts or cancelling of courts without giving sufficient notice.  Some of these lapses are no doubt unavoidable in any large organisation and they arise only in a small minority of cases.</P>
    <P>It is important though that there should be adequate powers to ensure that any reasonable complaints of this kind can be dealt with and brought to notice in a manner which is consistent with the constitutional independence of the district justices.  The Bill provides therefore that it is to be a judicial person&mdash;a colleague&mdash;who will investigate complaints about any conduct of a district justice which appears to be prejudicial to the prompt and efficient discharge of business.  The President will also have the power of convening meetings of justices from time to time, but not more often than twice a year, for the purpose of discussing matters relating to the discharge of the business of the district court including, in particular, such matters as the avoidance of undue divergences between justices in the exercise of their jurisdiction and the general level of fines and penalties.</P>
    <P>There is no question of seeking any measure of absolute uniformity in these matters; any such uniformity would in fact be undesirable as it would prevent justices from taking into account all the various factors which determine the punishment to be awarded in any particular case.  The object is rather to seek to prevent as far as possible undue divergences in the attitude of district justices to certain offences and to do this by an exchange of views between justices at these periodical meetings.  Each justice will be as free after the meeting as he was before to ignore any views that may have been expressed and continue to deal with the cases coming before him in accordance with his view of their merits.</P>
    <P>Apart from these powers, the President will also have the responsibility of allocating the business of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court.  The efficiency of that court <Col N="1859" /> , I believe, be improved by placing responsibility for allocating the business of the court on one person and abandoning the present system of having three separate divisions, each in charge of a Principal Justice.  The President will also have a number of powers in relation to making recommendations to the Minister on various matters relating to the district court and provision is being made for his being consulted by the Minister on certain other matters.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (4) of the Bill extends the existing provisions for exercising disciplinary control over district justices by entrusting the Chief Justice with a kind of &ldquo;reprimand&rdquo; jurisdiction over them.  In doing this the Bill is merely giving statutory recognition to a practice which has in fact operated on a few occasions in the past in accordance with which the Chief Justice, at the request of the Minister for Justice, interviewed a district justice privately about certain aspects of his conduct.  In every case the intervention of the Chief Justice had most beneficial results.  The great advantage of this procedure is that it enables action to be taken in a case where a formal inquiry by a Supreme Court or High Court judge would be unduly cumbersome.</P>
    <P>The view has always been taken, and I think rightly, that such an inquiry should not be set in motion unless the misconduct complained of was of a very serious character and sufficient, if the allegations against the district justice were substantiated, to make it necessary for the Minister to move in the Oireachtas for the justice's removal from office.  The formal machinery would not be appropriate to deal with, say, a rather serious but isolated case of misconduct or, perhaps, a number of less serious instances of misconduct.  Indeed, having regard to the publicity which is likely to attend the setting up of a formal inquiry, the procedure might be criticised in these cases as an oppressive use of the disciplinary powers.  The statutory jurisdiction now being given to the Chief Justice will therefore be supplementary to the present machinery of formal inquiry <Col N="1860" /> and I believe that the mere fact of its existence will have a moderating influence on justices.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in Section 7, alters the law regarding the number of judges of which the Supreme Court may be constituted when hearing an appeal or any other matter cognisable by it. Under the present law the Court is not required to sit as a full court of five unless it is deciding on the incapacity of the President or on the constitutionality of a Bill referred to the court by the President.  In other cases the law permits a court of three, four or five judges.  This position is open to criticism on a number of grounds.  It is undesirable that a court of less than five should decide whether an Act of the Oireachtas is repugnant to the Constitution: a court of five is now being made obligatory in these cases.  For other litigation, having a court of four involves the risk of an even division of opinion and all the waste of time and money that that entails: a court of four is therefore no longer being permitted.</P>
    <P>A Supreme Court of three judges may be objected to also on the ground that the views of two judges&mdash;a minority of the full court of five&mdash; might decide the issue: but the practical difficulties of having a court of five in all cases make it necessary, in the Government's view, to continue the existing provision of allowing a court of three whenever the Chief Justice so determines.</P>
    <P>The occasion of the establishment of the courts has been availed of to prescribe, pursuant to Article 34.1 of the Constitution, certain cases in which justice may be administered otherwise than in public.  These cases are specified in subsection (1) of Section 45 of the Bill and comprise applications of an urgent nature for relief by way of <i>habeas corpus,</i> bail, prohibition or injunction, matrimonial matters, lunacy and minor matters, and proceedings involving the disclosure of a secret manufacturing process.  These are additional to the cases already prescribed by Acts of the Oireachtas, such as income tax appeal cases.  Moreover, doubts have been expressed as to whether the provisions in various enactments passed before 1922 for the <Col N="1861" /> administration of justice otherwise than in public survived the coming into operation of the 1922 Constitution; similar doubts exist in relation to the effect of the 1937 Constitution on provisions of this kind in legislation enacted by the Oireachtas of Saorstát Éireann.  These doubts are being removed by subsection (3) of Section 45 which provides that these provisions shall now have full force and effect.</P>
    <P>The members of the House will be aware that these provisions in regard to the administration of justice in private have given rise to some public comment and some newspaper editorial comment. It is well, therefore, that I should give the House some reassurance as to what exactly is involved in this regard. I believe the provisions of Section 45 will operate satisfactorily.  They are mainly a restatement of the existing practice and, in so far as they may, in particular cases to be decided by the court, extend the existing powers to have hearings otherwise than in public, I consider that the extension is amply justified in the interests of enabling the court to ensure that justice in its fullest sense is done in these particular cases.</P>
    <P>I might give an instance of that.  I am sure most members of the House will be familiar with the procedure in income tax cases.  A taxpayer receives an assessment from the Inspector of Taxes.  It is open to him to appeal against that assessment.  If he does so and if his appeal is allowed by the Inspector of Taxes that ends the matter, but if there is still disagreement between the taxpayer and the inspector it is open to the taxpayer to take that case to the Special Commissioner and this, of course, is heard in private.  If again the Special Commissioner decides against the taxpayer, it is open to the taxpayer to take the case to the circuit court.  In the circuit court the case can be fought out before the circuit court judge and a decision given either for or against the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The House will readily appreciate that the whole process of hearing that income tax case in private is necessary if justice is to be done.  You cannot have a taxpayer's private business position disclosed in public.  That is <Col N="1862" /> a typical example of the sort of case we are dealing with in these provisions. We are not in any way extending what is there already.  In fact, we are really not doing anything more substantial than giving effect here in this Bill to what has been the practice so far.  I believe it is well I should make these few remarks about these provisions because I think there has been some misunderstanding as to what exactly is being done.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of other amendments of the existing law which are set out in the explanatory memorandum circulated to Senators with this Bill and the Establishment Bill. The memorandum has been revised to incorporate the amendments made in the Bills by the Dáil in the course of an exceptionally detailed consideration of their provisions.  The thorough examination already given to the measures and the fact that they have been amended in a number of respects to meet the views expressed by Deputies will, I trust, help to lighten the task of the Seanad in dealing with them at a time when there is an exceptional volume of business to be disposed of.</P>

      <P>We are taking these two Bills together and I think that is rational because they do, in fact, go together.  One of them is the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill.  It is interesting, as the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out to us, that the Courts have been functioning under the Courts of Justice Act of 1924 and under the Constitution of 1922 and not under the Constitution of 1937 of which we have heard so much boasting and which I have pointed out was not a new Constitution but an amendment of the 1922 Constitution. It was of such a nature that it allowed the courts already in existence in 1937 to function for a further 24 years before this measure was brought in and clearly they could have kept on functioning quite satisfactorily if I may use the precise words of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be put on record that the legislation which established these courts in 1924 under the 1922 Constitution, in circumstances which could be described rather mildly as <Col N="1863" /> not altogether auspicious or conducive to careful legislation, reflects great credit upon the foresight, the knowledge and clear thinking of the Ministers, of the Government and of the legislators of that period.</P>
    <P>I am not a practising lawyer but I have always been interested in the Constitution because, as it happened, I had a particular function with regard to the first Constitution and its development.  I am also interested in languages and particularly interested in the Irish language.  The Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill strikes me as being an extraordinary example of confusion of languages. The confusion between Irish and English in this Bill may arise from a confusion of minds because I am not sure that even those who drafted it knew what they were aiming at.  To me it is impossible to understand. Let me quote an example. Subsection (1) of Section 1 of this Bill says:</P>
    <P>On the commencement of this Act, the Court of Final Appeal which in pursuance of Article 34 of the Constitution is to be called An Chúirt Uachtarach (The Supreme Court), shall stand established.</P>
    <P>As I read Article 34 of the Constitution it does not mention the words &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; at all.  Article 34 of the Constitution is in English. It contains no Irish words and Article 34 of the Constitution certainly does not set up a court to be called &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo;.  If the intentions were that the Supreme Court, so called in English, were to be always called &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; one could understand it.  Section 1 (2) goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court shall be constituted of the following judges&mdash;</P>
    <P>and throughout the Bill the court is referred to as the &ldquo;Supreme Court&rdquo;. I have read a fair amount about languages and I have dealt with a number of linguistic problems but I am quite unable to understand what this means.  Similarly we are told that the President of the Supreme Court&mdash;not &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo;&mdash;shall be President thereof, namely, An Príomh-Bhreitheamh <Col N="1864" /> (The Chief Justice), but thereafter &ldquo;an Príomh-Bhreitheamh&rdquo; is referred to as &ldquo;The Chief Justice.&rdquo; I do not understand this provision.  Perhaps, as a former colleague of mine said, the words &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; and &ldquo;An Príomh-Bhreitheamh&rdquo; constitute a hasty genuflection to the Irish language and then you go on to use the English language.</P>
    <P>This all arises from confusion of thought.  If the intention is to help Irish then this seems to me to be evidence not only of ignorance but also of insincerity. It is quite a different thing from the attempt made in the Constitution to bring in Irish titles for members of the Government.  The Taoiseach is the Taoiseach.  You cannot call him &ldquo;The Chief&rdquo; even though the word &ldquo;Taoiseach&rdquo; was introduced originally as an Irish equivalent for the &ldquo;Chief.&rdquo;  However, the Taoiseach is called &ldquo;The Taoiseach&rdquo;.  He is not called &ldquo;The Chief&rdquo;.  If An Chúirt Uachtarach is to be the name of the court, it cannot be called the Supreme Court.  If it is to be called the Supreme Court when talking English, it should be called the Supreme Court.  The whole thing seems very strange.</P>
    <P>The Second Bill of which the Parliamentary Secretary spoke&mdash;the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, 1959,&mdash; is enormous.  It consists, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, of 61 sections, eight Schedules, numerous references to statutes, sections and repeals. It does not contain a single word of Irish.  The Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill, which is complementary to the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill, contains no word of Irish at all.  It refers throughout to the Supreme Court, the High Court and the District Court.</P>
    <P>As the word &ldquo;Court&rdquo; is somewhat messed up, so also is the word &ldquo;Breitheamh&rdquo;.  The word is used in the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill to translate judge of the Supreme Court, judge of the High Court and also district justice.  I am at a loss to know what the whole thing means.  For example, Section (2) says:</P>
    <P>(1)  On the commencement of this Act, the Court of First Instance restitution <Col N="1865" /> ferred to in Article 34 of the Constitution as An Ard-Chúirt (The High Court)&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>it is not so referred to in Article 34 of the Constitution</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;shall stand established.</P>
    <P>(2)  The High Court shall be constituted of the following judges&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the president thereof, who shall be styled &ldquo;Uachtarán na hArd-Chúirte&rdquo; (&ldquo;The President of the High Court&rdquo;), and</P>
    <P>(b)  such number of ordinary judges (each of whom shall be styled &ldquo;Breitheamh den ArdChúirt&rdquo;...</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be a hotch-potch of language and is really an insult to the Irish language because it endeavours to use the Irish language in an absurd way.  If the Bill were in Irish, one could understand it.  It would be reasonable and sensible.  In stating what I think about this, I would prefer to say it in Irish&mdash;caint cham, chasta, gan chiall, gan fuinniméid.</P>
    <P>There is an allusion to the style in the following: &ldquo;such number of ordinary judges (each of whom shall be styled &lsquo;Breitheamh den Ard-Chúirt&rsquo;&rdquo;. That is a very awkward phrase.  There was in one of those Bills a section to the effect that new forms of address in Irish would be introduced.  It was suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary in the other House that that was a matter for Rules of Court and not for legislation.  He took the provisions out of the Bill.  I find among the statutory instruments the following: Rules of the High Court and Supreme Court: Mode of Address Rules 1961.  This is a rule made with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Traynor.  Therefore, I think it is proper for us to ask a question about it.  The Rule is:</P>
    <P>(4)  The Judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court (including the Central Criminal Court), and the Court of Criminal Appeal respectively shall be addressed, in Irish or English, by their respective titles and names, and may be referred to, in Irish, as &ldquo;An Chúirt&rdquo;, or, in English, as &ldquo;The Court&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> I wonder what the meaning of that is? I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary knows?  I wonder if anybody knows what are, for example, the respective titles and names of the judges?  Is the Chief Justice An Príomh-Bhreitheamh or the Chief Justice?  Is he to be addressed as Chief Justice?  Is it now improper to address him as &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>If that is so, it is very strange.  What is to happen to people who prefer the older modes of address and rest themselves upon the view that all these things are history and should be preserved? Can you address the Chief Justice as &ldquo;Mr. Justice Maguire&rdquo;? Can we preserve under these circumstances the distinction heretofore observed where a High Court judge was known&mdash;perhaps I should take my own name as an example&mdash;as &ldquo;Mr. Justice Hayes&rdquo;, a circuit court judge as &ldquo;Judge Hayes&rdquo; and a district justice as &ldquo;District Justice Hayes&rdquo;? Is that distinction gone and if it is, what is being put in its place?  There is confusion of thought or lack of thought in this whole business.  Can you refer to a High Court judge in the future as &ldquo;Judge Hayes&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I feel there must be judges in the High Court who would not be enthusiastic about that mode of address.  The whole thing is a result of confused thought and of an endeavour to use the Irish language, not as it should be used as a living vigorous tongue, but as a kind of political weapon to prove that you want to do something about it when, in fact, you do not want to and, if you did, you would not know how to do it.  What is the actual state of affairs?  The first Bill&mdash;the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill supplies Irish titles but the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill has not a single word of Irish in it at all, good, bad or indifferent.  It seems to me that these two Bills, when they become Acts and when combined with the Rule recently made, will make it difficult to address any judge either in Irish or English.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, one of the things commented upon at the recent receptions in Dublin Castle was what a wonderful job was done by the Office of Public Works in Dublin <Col N="1867" /> Castle by way of decorating it and by leaving there the portraits of all the people who occupied Dublin Castle before we took it over in 1922. Exactly the same thing applies to the little Chapel in Dublin Castle which contains the coats of arms of the various Lords Lieutenant.  That is a monument.  It is a beautiful thing and something which should not be torn down.  I think that titles such as &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo; and so on are in the same category.  They could have been left alone.  It is evidence of the slave mind to get rid of them.  They are all part of our history.  The fact that we have judges as a result of Acts passed by the Irish Parliament and appointed by an Irish Government is sufficient.</P>
    <P>This idea of mixing up languages and making a hotch-potch that makes it impossible to call the judges anything is a very great mistake.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary concluded by saying that the Bills had got considerable examination and considerable amendment in the Dáil. Obviously, they can get no such consideration here because it is too late. Obviously, if some thought were taken about how to use our Parliamentary institutions, we could have had these Bills much earlier.  They could have been considered on Second Stage and sent to a Joint Committee when we would have been in the position of having people in this House on the Joint Committee participating in the detailed consideration of the Bills. They then would be able to advise the members of this House on what to do about it.</P>
    <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary explain how he finds the words &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; in Article 34 of the Constitution?  It is not there.  It is in the Irish version of Article 34. The Irish version is a translation of the English which is the fundamental version that comes first in order of composition.  There is no doubt about that.  No good can be done for the Irish language or any other cause, apart from the Irish language, by pretence and humbug.  I think that the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Bill <Col N="1868" /> is an exact example of that.  I should like to have that explained.</P>

      <P>The two Bills we have before us come, as Senator Hayes said, about 20 years too late.  It is a remarkable thing that the Government have not realised that one of the organs of Government is the judicial organ and that that is set down in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary will look at Article 6 of the Constitution he will find that all powers of Government, legislative, executive and judicial derive, under God, from the people.  In this country I regret that the judiciary is one of the arms of Government.  We are rather apt to confuse the Executive with the totality of Government as laid down in our Constitution.  In my opinion it shows a lack of respect for the Constitution that we have waited 24 years before the Government, who were responsible for the introduction of the 1937 Constitution, thought fit to give effect to Article 34 in accordance with Article 6 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable to think that the courts were in existence for a much shorter time, 13 years, under the 1922 Constitution than they have been under the transitory provisions of the 1937 Constitution which kept the Saorstát Éireann courts in being.  We have had the absurd and ridiculous position in the High Court and Supreme Court that in order at various stages to determine what the jurisdiction was and what the position of the courts was <i>vis-á-vis</i> the 1937 Constitution and in relation to certain statutes, that the courts have had to look at a provision of the 1937 Constitution which the 1937 Constitution forbade to be printed after the day the first President assumed office.  Of course there have been no votes in establishing the courts under the Constitution. There were no votes in this kind of thing and there will not be any votes, I am afraid, for the Parliamentary Secretary or the rest of us in this thing.  However, I am not dealing with it on that basis but I do condemn <Col N="1869" /> the attitude of mind that has had so little respect for the institution of law, for an arm of Government established by the people under the Constitution of 1937.</P>
    <P>From time to time I spoke in this House, during my short period here, about the failure of the Government to bring in these Bills.  I had hoped that once they did come we would have an opportunity to amend or to examine the Bills in some detail.  We are being presented with an impossible task.  It may well be that the excuse for not instituting these courts earlier was that it took that length of time to frame and draft these Bills.  If that is the excuse, it is an impossible task to ask us to do in a few days what it has taken 24 years to do.</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary said, the second Bill contains 61 sections and eight Schedules.  We find that in the Third Schedule we have to deal with 29 different kinds of proceedings which may be taken in the circuit court.  In the Fourth Schedule there are 72 statutes, some of very ancient origin, to be examined in order to determine whether or not things have been properly related to the new circuit courts to be established under the Bill.  We have also to examine a further 31 British statutes relating to the jurisdiction of the old county courts and courts of quarter sessions.  There is, in all, the tidy figure of 132 statutes involved in the Schedules.  The Schedules appear to be unimportant but I recall that on the occasion of the debate on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill the unpalatable meat in that particular Bill was contained in a Schedule.  At times one is inclined to pay too little attention to what is contained in Schedules.  As well as that, there are some 22 statutes being amended in whole or in part in one of the final Schedules so that it is hardly fair, or doing justice by a great organ of Government, which the courts are, to ask the Oireachtas at such short notice to examine these Bills in detail.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has indicated that it is proposed&mdash;I took him down as saying this&mdash;to consolidate or amend the law later on.  I do not know <Col N="1870" /> what the difficulty was in amending the law up to the present because in one of the Acts being repealed there are, for instance, only three sections left now out of 23, involving less than a page out of 22 pages in the Schedule.  One wonders why these 22 statutes were not consolidated in this Act.  It makes for great confusion in understanding what the position is and it will make for greater confusion, if these Bills are passed, when they come into operation in the courts themselves.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Parliamentary Secretary has not given any indication of any intention to engage in any kind of reform in relation to the administration of justice in the courts.  That is a matter which falls peculiarly within the domain of the Legislature.  I believe it to be the right of every citizen, no matter what his means, to have justice done by him in the courts.  Unfortunately there are many occasions on which citizens with a good cause of action, with a genuine grievance, are unable to have that grievance or that cause of action litigated in the courts because they lack the means to do it.</P>
    <P>In my conception of democracy that is neither fair nor proper and there is nothing in these Bills to indicate that that position will be improved the slightest bit.  It is quite clear that the stage has long since been reached where there should be some form of legal aid, however limited, for proper cases where persons are too poor to go to court.  I do not want the Parliamentary Secretary to say that people can sue <i>in forma pauperis</i>.  That day has gone out with the workhouses and it does not do to say that that is available. I know of one case, a matrimonial case, where that was available to the parties and where they could have sued in that form and they would not undergo the indignity of such a form of proceedings.</P>
    <P>It seems to be past the time when some form of legal aid, however limited, should have been introduced for the benefit of the poorer sections of the community.  I speak with some diffidence upon that aspect of these Bills because some people would be unkind enough to think that my <Col N="1871" /> remarks are motivated by the purpose of putting money into the lawyers' pockets.  That is not so. Like the medical profession, there is no other profession, perhaps, which does more in the nature of free work for the public than the legal profession. Senator Lenihan, Senator Ryan, Senator Louis Walsh and others, I am certain, can add their eloquent testimony to that fact.  That is why lawyers are so interested in getting costs where costs can be realised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>They recoup the costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Another urgent reform would be effectively to reduce the costs of litigation.  Once we realise that the administration of justice by the courts is a form of State activity, that it is part of the government of the State, it will be easier to make certain reforms.  I do not understand why it should be necessary, in order that a person may issue, say, a civil bill to recover damages from some other person, that he must first pay for the right to do that in the form of a stamp on that civil bill.  I do not see what the justification in modern times for that is.</P>
      <P>The amount of court fees at present is something of the order of about £300,000.  I think it quite improper, where the cost of litigation is so high, to expect people, who are entitled as of right to justice as a public service, to pay for the obtaining of that service. If the State means anything and if in this country democracy is to work fairly, people should be able to go into court with the least possible cost to themselves.  So far from paying for the right to issue a civil bill or to issue a High Court summons, it should be the other way around for the poorer sections of the community and they should get a State subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter in which it seems to me this arm of Government is not being properly treated is in relation to the cost which private individuals, through no fault of their own, sometimes finds themselves obliged to pay, largely because of the clumsiness of drafting or the mistakes of the Legislature. <Col N="1872" /> I do not want, again, to refer to the Court Officers (Superannuation) Bill which we passed in June of this year and which does not make sense. It is an outstanding example of legal gibberish.  It is now solemnly enrolled in the records of the Supreme Court as an Act of the Oireachtas passed in 1961.</P>
    <P>We find in this House in various enactments, and admitted to by Ministers, that certain sections were passed that do not mean anything.  Later on, some citizen finds himself calling in aid a particular section.  In order to ascertain what the Oireachtas meant when they enacted a piece of legal gibberish, some unfortunate person has to pay for a case stated perhaps by a judge of the circuit court to the High Court or the Supreme Court.  It does not seem at all right that where a judge of the Circuit Court or the High Court on circuit, or a district justice, is unable to understand the law, any private citizen should have to pay for having the law clarified.  There is every justification for having a fund out of which the costs of cases stated should be paid.  I think it wholly wrong that private individuals should perform a service for the public in having the law clarified by cases stated.</P>
    <P>A variety of other reforms is required in regard to the administration of justice&mdash;none of which is touched upon in this Bill&mdash;which I would expect would be dealt with. Why is it that a person charged with the crime of manslaughter has to pay for the transcript of the depositions? Why should that be so?  If he is charged with murder, he gets the transcript free.  Apart from murder, in every criminal case, where the person may be entirely blameless, he has to pay not alone for his counsel's and solicitor's fees but also for something which the State can provide for little or no cost.</P>
    <P>I have known of people charged with manslaughter and one rather suspects they were charged merely as a matter of policy.  There were so many cases of manslaughter and deaths resulting from dangerous driving and drunken driving that, for a period, it appeared that whoever was involved <Col N="1873" /> in such an accident with a mechanically-propelled vehicle was automatically returned for trial on a charge of manslaughter.  A number of these people were quite blameless but they had to pay this quite unnecessary bill. In cases of that kind, where no costs are given against the Attorney General, a minimum form of aid which could be given to these people would be to provide the transcript free of charge.</P>
    <P>Another matter which seems to call for some attention, in time, is the manner of the service of documents.  Any proceedings originating in the circuit court are not properly served unless by a civil bill officer.  I do not know why the registered post cannot be used in the case of all originating documents from the circuit court instead of going to the laborious process of serving these documents through the medium of civil bill officers.  While the position of existing civil bill officers requires to be protected, it seems an unnecessarily laborious, tedious and time-wasting procedure which is long since out of date.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to the mode in which Irish is misused, abused and not used properly in the Bills.  It has always struck me as odd that the Rules of the High Court, of the District Court and of the Circuit Court, which are all statutory instruments, have never yet been rendered into the Irish language.  At the same time, it is obligatory upon solicitors and barristers, under statute, to pass qualifying examiations in Irish.  Yet, if such a person, who has passed his examination in Irish, is of a mind to conduct his practice through the medium of Irish, or even a particular case, he cannot refer to the Irish version of the Rules of Court.  These are the Rules which have been made since 1922.  This is something which highlights the monstrous hypocrisy involved in the misuse of the Irish language in these Bills.</P>
    <P>I want to return for a short time to the costs of litigation.  I observe that, in the No. 2 Bill, we limit the number of judges in the High Court, I think, to eight.  I think we also limit the number of circuit court judges to a particular number which is defined.  In relation to the High Court, I think we ought to go well beyond the number <Col N="1874" /> prescribed in the Bill.  We ought to have not one but several High Court judges who, it would be assumed on their appointment, would never be employed full time.  That might seem somewhat strange but one finds, for instance, as far as judges of the High Court and Supreme Court are concerned, that apart from the manner in which they fulfil their duties in the ordinary course of events, they give great service to the community by acting, always in an unpaid capacity, as chairman of a variety of bodies, commissions and committees.  Apart altogether from that, it appears to me unnecessary that costs are being incurred daily in the High Court because, with cases which are listed and ordered, it is not possible to say with certainty that XY, living some place in Mayo, will have his trial proceed with certainty say on 1st November.</P>
    <P>The present position is that he may expect to be taken on Monday and have all his witnesses there, but he may not be reached on Monday.  He may not be reached on Tuesday, or on Wednesday, and, in consequence, there may be ten, 11, 12, or any number of witnesses, professional witnesses, idling in Dublin. If there were an extra judge or two in the High Court, it would be possible to make arrangements under which people could be taken with certainty upon a particular day.  There does not seem to be anything revolutionary or startling in that proposal.  It would certainly avoid wasteful and unnecessary costs, and a waste of the time of the witnesses and litigants, if sufficient judges were available to take actions, and particularly jury actions, on specified days.  Under the present dispensation, that is not possible, and it seems to me that the only remedy is to create more judges.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the places where justice is administered.  I think on the debate on the Office Premises Bill we had occasion to make reference to the courts, where justice as a service of Government is administered.  Some of the places throughout the country where the law is administered are a disgrace and a scandal.  No one can justify some of these places as courthouses except to the extent of saying, <Col N="1875" />&ldquo;We are doing something about them.&rdquo;  In the first place, the antiquated position whereby local authorities are required to build courthouses is responsible for the condition of many of our courthouses.  It seems abundantly clear that this organ of Government, the Judiciary and the courts, should be a national charge in the same way as are the Garda, the Department of Justice, and the Army.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why a county council should be expected to provide the cost of this pre-eminently Government service.  No progress will be made in renovating, modernising and re-building these courthouses until that work is a charge on the Vote for the Department of Justice.  It is strange to say that Garda barracks are built by the Office of Public Works, presumably in accordance with specifications, and so on, approved by the Minister for Justice, but that courthouses are not built by the Office of Public Works but by the local authorities.  I do not see why that system, which has, of course, an historical basis, should be permitted to continue any longer.</P>
    <P>Many of the courthouses that are not letting in rain through the roofs are draughty, cold, dull, badly lighted, ill-ventilated places.  When a subpoena is served upon someone to attend at a particular court on a particular day, irrespective of the condition of his health, the law should not be such that he be asked to attend all day every day, perhaps for a week, in a court which is a source of danger to his health. Frequently, old people in bad health have to attend the hearing of an action in relation to a maintenance settlement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It has been a cause of mortification to many people who practise in the courts to observe such old people having to sit around in those places on a wintry day in November or December.  The Parliamentary Secretary, who seems to have a great deal of zeal for reform, <Col N="1876" /> might direct his attention to the condition of those buildings and institute a widespread building programme to bring the courts up to the level of any Government office in a country town.  That is not setting a very high standard.</P>
      <P>Many other things which might be said with regard to reform are not contained in these Bills.  Anything which can be said at this stage will not be dealt with in the immediate future, but I hope some of the matters to which I have referred will engage the attention of some future Minister for Justice, if not the Parliamentary Secretary, and that they will be attended to. The Parliamentary Secretary dealt rather too briefly for my liking with these Bills.  I had hoped to get a clearer exposition than is to be obtained from the highly complex explanatory memorandum for which we must be grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Second Reading speech the Parliamentary Secretary laid great stress on the district courts, and I think he regarded the provision in that connection as the major change being made by this piece of legislation.  I regret that the Parliamentary Secretary's efforts have been directed to reforms of this kind, which are not nearly as urgent as some other matters requiring reform, which, in my view, are not reforms at all.  The underlying theme of the Parliamentary Secretary's reference to the changes in relation to district courts was that they were inferior not only in jurisdiction but in personnel and that, therefore, someone had to be put in to watch over the district justices.  If that is the Parliamentary Secretary's experience, and if that is the view of the Government, it is an extremely serious situation.  The whole idea is that the circuit court judges can conduct themselves, judges of the High Court can conduct their courts properly, but that district justices do not and cannot be trusted to conduct themselves.  Once you appoint judges, whether to the High Court, the circuit court or the district court, you appoint persons whom you can trust and thereafter you must allow them to function up to the point where it becomes necessary, if it does become <Col N="1877" /> necessary, to remove them by resolution of either House of the Oireachtas after due inquiry.</P>
    <P>I do not think the District Court requires this kind of reform.  Doubtless, there have been&mdash;I do not say quite a number&mdash;some complaints.  It is a pity that the whole District Court bench which consists of quite a number of people should be denigrated by complaints in relation to the few and, furthermore, that that denigration should be crystallised in an Act of Parliament which says that district justices must be watched over in two ways, one of which is prescribed in Section 10 of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill, namely, that the Chief Justice can call in a district justice and tell him he is bringing the administration of justice into disrepute.  I wonder if the Chief Justice can do that in relation to a judge of the Supreme Court, the High Court or the Circuit Court.  The second provision, in case that is not sufficient, is contained in Section 36 under which the President of the District Court may also investigate the conduct of the justice which he believes to be prejudicial to the prompt and efficient discharge of the business of the court.</P>
    <P>If it is laid down in Rules of Court, the Rules of the Circuit Court and the Rules of the District Court, that hours of attendance shall be such and such, and a variety of other things relating in a broad way to the conduct of district justices in the administration of their business, the district justices are as much obliged to observe these rules as they are to observe any other statutory provision which they have to administer while sitting as district justices.</P>
    <P>We must never forget that district justices, like judges of the other courts, take an oath on entering office to carry out and discharge their duties in accordance with law and to uphold the Constitution.  If, having these safeguards, you cannot get satisfactory service, it seems to me the proper people have not been appointed to the District Court bench and if they fall short and if these safeguards are not sufficient, they are not proper persons to administer justice between man and <Col N="1878" /> man and man and the State and then we would be getting to the stage where these people would have to be stripped of their powers.  A threat of that drastic and immediate penalty for failure to discharge duties promptly, for bringing the institution of law and justice into disrepute, would be far preferable to this prefecting of district justices, which is being established twice in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Once you create a President of the District Court, it becomes necessary to give him something to do and it has been found desirable, apparently, to give him authority to convene the district justices twice yearly to hear what he has to say and to hear what people like him have to say with regard to the discharge of the business of the district court and, in particular, with regard to the avoidance of undue divergencies in the exercise of the jurisdiction of the court by justices, in the general level of fines and penalties.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that is a provision which will be useless and cannot be enforced.  A district justice is intended under the Constitution to be independent in the discharge of his duties.  It is provided in the Constitution that all judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to the Constitution and the law.  It appears to me that if a district justice is the kind of man who says: &ldquo;I am going to be independent&rdquo;, he can sit in and smoke his cigarette or pipe and listen to what the President of the District Court has to say and go away and do whatever he wants to do after that.  I should not be a bit surprised if there will be people who will act in that way.</P>
    <P>It seems to me they are perfectly entitled to act in that way under the constitutional provision which says that they shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject to the Constitution and the law, and that means not to be influenced by anybody in the penalties which they fix or in the manner in which they exercise their jurisdiction.  If that position is to obtain, that this meeting will be a monologue, perhaps, by the President of the District Court with a few <Col N="1879" /> interjections by a few D.J.s who feel embarrassed by the tension created, it seems to me to be wholly unwise to put a provision of this kind into the Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the effectiveness and the proprietry of the provision, I very much doubt its constitutionality. Unless a district justice is reported to the Chief Justice and thereafter back to one of the Houses of the Oireachtas for some form of insubordination, I fail to see how this section could ever come to be challenged in the High Court on the ground of its repugnance to the Constitution but perhaps that may come sooner than people imagine.</P>
    <P>If penalties in relation to certain kinds of offences and under certain codes such as the Road Traffic Act were unduly low in certain district court areas, and unduly lenient, I would much prefer to invest the Attorney General with a right of appeal to the circuit court against a penalty, on the ground that it was too low rather than have this roundabout method which seems to me to be behind doors and to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Some people might think that was a departure from precedent, that it was an extraordinary power to vest in the Attorney General, but I think I am right in saying that the Attorney General quashed certain orders of district justices in about 120 cases in the past few years by way of <i>certiorari</i> and that is nothing more or less than an appeal against the order of the district justice in relation to certain offences under the Road Traffic Act, the licensing code, etc.</P>
    <P>If the level of penalties were unduly low in a particular area, it would be far more desirable that that should be dealt with by way of appeal either to the High Court or to the circuit court by the Attorney General or by competent complainants under the various statutes rather than in this roundabout way.  When the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister for Justice, whoever he may be, comes to consolidate and amend these Bills and comes to examine this provision, he probably will find that it would not work and it will be dropped.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> I want to refer to the point raised by Senator Hayes in relation to the mode of address of judges.  It is all very well to try to change these things by a complex order which appears to be simple but when it comes to working it out in practice, it will be found that the old system, whatever its origin, was a useful system and worked well.  Personally, I have no objection whatever to adopting the form of address, &ldquo;A Bhreithimh,&rdquo; to any judge or justice.  The Irish language would be quite suitable in that respect.  Nor, indeed, do I object to the Order, except that it seems it will not work.</P>
    <P>At present when we address the Chairman of Seanad Éireann, we say, &ldquo;A Chathaoirligh.&rdquo;  That is all we have to do.  If the Cathaoirleach gives a ruling under Standing Orders, we are obliged to obey that ruling absolutely and we may not even question it.  We dare not tell the Cathaoirleach he is wrong because Standing Orders provide for immediate expulsion for such unwarranted and untoward impudence; similarly in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>When it comes to addressing the judge in court in the tense atmosphere of a criminal trial, when it falls to counsel or solicitor to tell the judge in polite language that he is wrong in law, wrong in fact, that he has misdirected himself, it does not and will not make things easier if we are to say plainly and bluntly: &ldquo;You are wrong; you are wrong in law; you are wrong in fact; you have misdirected yourself.&rdquo;  That does not seem to me to be something that people who have grown up in another system will find easy to do.  It seems to be the only thing left as a result of the abolition of the old mode of address.  It is quite a different thing to adopt a euphemistic method of telling &ldquo;His Lordship&rdquo; he is wrong, or to say &ldquo;Your Lordship is wrong in such-and-such.&rdquo;  That is a step removed from the immediate person and that seems to me to be the great advantage that was inherent in the old method of address.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the new form would be.  You cannot give it an abstract form such as &ldquo;His Lordship&rdquo;<Col N="1881" /> has had up to now.  I think that would be an obstacle and I, and quite a number of other people who have discussed the matter, do not see any remedy for it.  However, there the matter rests.  The Rule-Making Committee of the High Court and the Circuit Court obviously must have seen the provision in the Bill which was giving to the Legislature the power to invade the domain of the judiciary and must have taken the view that it was better that the judiciary itself should regulate the matter.  In consequence of this change they made, the provision has been dropped from the Bill.  That is preferable to the situation which was presented in this Bill as originally circulated but the new Order seems to contain a procedural difficulty for practitioners that I do not see any real way out of.  I rather fear that the ultimate position will be that the new law will be more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  If that is to be the position&mdash;that it cannot be observed because people cannot break off an old habit&mdash;it would be better that the change had never been made and not have in the very court itself, where law should be upheld and honoured, any rule going by the board because of the impossibility of observing it properly.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is one matter which rather disturbed me in regard to the No. 2 Bill.  I do not quite understand the manner in which pending causes of actions, suits, matters, proceedings and so on are being transferred from the existing courts to the newly-created courts under this first Bill and as regulated by the second Bill.  In Section 49, it is provided that the continuity of the administration and enforcement of justice shall not be interrupted by the coming into operation of the Principal Act or this Act.  It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection</i> (1) of this section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any act done or proceedings taken before the operative date in respect of any cause or matter in the court mentioned in <i>column</i> (2)  of <i>Part I</i> of the <i>Seventh Schedule</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that would mean the existing court</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" />&mdash;to this Act at a particular reference number shall be deemed to have been done or taken respectively in the court mentioned in <i>column</i> (3) of the said <i>Part I</i> at that reference number,</P>
    <P>That is to say, any act done or proceedings taken in any cause or matter in the old courts shall be deemed to have been taken in the corresponding new courts.  We have had an indication over the past two years, shall I say, of the technical nature of returning people for trial and of the various slips there are between the cup and the lip and how ultimately things worked out.  I am not at all sure that subsection (1) of Section 49 is sufficient, particularly having regard to the terms of subsection (2), to ensure that all proceedings, civil and criminal, are being effectively transferred from the existing courts to the new courts established under these Bills.</P>
    <P>If you observe the provisions of the old Judicature Act of, I think, 1877, you find the greatest care was taken in transferring effectively all pending causes of action, suits, proceedings and so on from the old courts to the new courts established under that Act.  Similarly, under the 1924 Courts of Justice Act, one found the position dealt with comprehensively in relation to the High Court, the Supreme Court and equally in relation to the circuit court and district courts established under that Act.  In particular, in the Judicature Act, there is a comprehensive definition of the causes, matter, proceedings, actions and so on and in the Courts of Justice Act one finds that all proceedings, whether civil or criminal, which were pending were transferred into the new court.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that no matter what way one read the Courts of Justice Act or the Judicature Act, one could have no doubt that all pending proceedings, civil and criminal, were effectively transferred to the new courts.  I am not sure that subsection (1) of Section 49 here effectively does what is done in Section 20 of the Courts of Justice Act in relation to the High Court.  However, having raised the matter with the Parliamentary <Col N="1883" /> Secretary, I am sure he will tell us that he is satisfied and has been advised that the section is quite effective and that &ldquo;the Senator need not have any fears&rdquo;.  That is the sort of answer one always gets from a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister in reply to questions like this but, notwithstanding the knowledge that his reply will be of that type, I take the liberty of questioning the effectiveness of that section.</P>
    <P>One finds that this time of the year on Bills of this kind it is rather frustrating to be talking about things that might be in them and changes that might be made.  It seems, having spoken for so long already at this stage, a bit unreal to address ourselves any longer to these matters in an effort to secure better administration of justice.  I hope, having said all I have, a more lengthy time than was given for the Committee Stage of the Civil Liability Bill will be available for these Bills so that, as far as this House is concerned, it can put its hand on its heart and say that, as far as it lay within its power, it did everything to ensure that these Bills were the best that time, thought and examination could make them.</P>

      <P>I am not intervening in this debate at this stage, but I want to draw the attention of the House to the order and progress of business.  As far as I can see, there is no possibility of disposing to-night of the business as ordered to-day and it will be necessary to sit tomorrow.  I suggest we should sit at 11 a.m. so as to give an opportunity to country Senators to get home tomorrow evening.</P>

      <P>These two measures clarify the constitutional establishment of our courts and, as such, are to be welcomed.  It appears to me that much of the criticism and comment in regard to the Irish and English definitions of our courts and in regard to the modes of address in court could be described as much ado about nothing.  Personally, as a lawyer, I <Col N="1884" /> would have preferred the continuation of the modes of address that operated heretofore.  I see no great burden on the intelligence of myself or any other member of the legal profession in addressing the court in the terms: &ldquo;May it please the court&rdquo; or &ldquo;If the court pleases&rdquo; instead of the mode of address used heretofore &ldquo;May it please your Lordship&rdquo; or &ldquo;If your Lordship pleases.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One important matter was referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary in his opening remarks.  It is the question of what might be described as justice appearing to be done.  It is particularly important in the district court.  The district court more than the circuit court, High Court or Supreme Court, is the one intimately based among the people and the one the people come in contact with most. There is no point in a district justice hearing a case and making a proper decision if the people outside involved in the case think it is not a proper decision.</P>
      <P>In that connection I should like to refer to one practice I have noticed, not in many cases but in some cases, in regard to district justices.  That is this business of being friendly&mdash;there is no great harm in it, I know&mdash;with the Garda superintendent or the solicitors involved in the court before the court starts or during the proceedings or during the lunch break.  The question of justice appearing to be done would be much better served by the district justice arriving punctually, having no connection with anybody else, judging each case on its merits and getting away from his court as immediately as possible. In that way justice would appear to be done and the confidence of the people in the administration of justice would be improved enormously.  I am not suggesting there is any harm whatever in the sort of laxity and friendliness I mentioned, but there is that danger&mdash;that the impression is conveyed to the people that everything, to put it bluntly, may not be above board.  However, that is a matter for the good sense of the Department of Justice and of the district justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also feel that much of the criticism of Section 10 and Section 36 amounts <Col N="1885" /> largely to a storm in a teacup.  I would be as jealous as Senator O'Quigley, Senator Hayes or anyone else if I felt there was any attempt at compulsion or any mandatory provision in either of these two sections.  It would be deplorable if there was anything of that nature.  However, I believe subsection (4) of Section 10 is in ease of the district justice. It envisages a very human situation where a district justice may be going off the rails and the Chief Justice has a chat with him to try to get him back again.  The wording makes it quite clear: &ldquo;Where the Chief Justice is of opinion that the conduct of a justice of the District Court has been such as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute, the Chief Justice may interview the justice privately and inform him of such opinion.&rdquo;  If anything, that is in ease of the district justice. It is a sensible subsection designed to iron out the problem that may arise when a district justice may go off the rails.  I do not see anything undesirable about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the preliminary provision in ease of the district justice before the more Draconian step is envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other section which has been criticised is Section 36, which gives power to the President of the District Court in regard to various matters. Subsection (3) is the one that has been criticised.  Under it, the President of the District Court may convene meetings <Col N="1886" /> of the justices for the purpose of discussing matters relating to the discharge of the business of the court. The subsection further states that the justices &ldquo;shall attend&rdquo; such meetings the President &ldquo;may convene&rdquo;.  Again, there is no element of compulsion, no element of suggesting that uniformity of penalty be imposed.  There is no mandatory element envisaged in that. Indeed, any mandatory element would be highly undesirable and completely against the whole principle of legal jurisprudence here that every case must be judged on the merits and facts.</P>
    <P>It is only common sense to have discussions of this nature between the President of the District Court and the justices, to discuss a reasonable attitude towards cases and to exchange views on cases.  I do not see any great harm, particularly in view of the careful drafting language.  He may convene the meeting for the purpose of discussion.  If it went any further than that, I would regard it as undesirable. In that form, however, I do not see anything to get excited about.  It appears to me to be reasonable and practicable.</P>
    <P>Apart from those observations, I should like to welcome Section 50 which specifies in regard to district court appeals to the circuit court against sentence that only matters relating to the penalty can be heard in evidence before the circuit court.  Heretofore, the provision for a complete rehearing in decided cases did not do justice to the appellant.  There is one suggestion I should like to make.  I have felt for a long time it is one which might improve the general administration of cases, particularly in the High Court.  This matter was touched upon by Senator O'Quigley when he talked about professional witnesses coming up from the country on High Court cases, having to wait around the courts for a day and having to come up again a second day and, sometimes, a third day.  That problem&mdash;and, in fact, the whole question of the proper expedition of the hearing of cases&mdash;might be met by the appointment of a judicial officer who would meet the solicitors for both parties before the open hearing of the case and decide on the issues beforehand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> Professional witnesses now have to go through a long waiting period, hanging around for days on end and then, because of some apparent conflict, the action is prolonged.  That situation could be avoided if these professional witnesses could be brought into conference, as it were, before the actual hearing where it could be decided between the parties and their solicitors as to what professional evidence would be agreed beforehand. In many cases, engineering evidence is common case.  If my suggestion were adopted, the hearing time of High Court actions could be halved.  Very often a substantial part of the time is devoted to long technical evidence, with direct and cross-examination, and, at the end, there is really very little difference of opinion.  There is very seldom any great difference of opinion in relation to engineering evidence. Very often, there is not any great degree of conflict in the medical evidence on both sides.  If outstanding issues could be solved beforehand, the hearing of these actions would take half the time they take now.  I understand something analogous to that suggestion has been in operation in Britain for some years past and has been found very helpful.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to a statement made by Senator Hayes this evening, a statement he has repeated again and again, here and elsewhere. It is the statement that the Constitution of 1937 was an amendment of the Free State Constitution of 1922.  I have both Constitutions here before me.  With regard to the Constitution of 1937, after invoking the Trinity in the Preamble, it is set down:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We, the people of Eire, .... Do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Article 48 lays it down:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Constitution of Saorstát Éireann in force immediately prior to the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution and the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act, 1922, in so far as that Act or any provision <Col N="1888" /> thereof is then enforced shall be and are hereby repealed as on and from that date.</P>
    <P>There is no amendment of anything in existence previously.  There is an emphatic wiping out and an equally emphatic substitution.  I cannot understand why Senator Hayes keeps reiterating the statement to which I have referred.  He has made it here; he has made it elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I should like, first of all, to deal with the major criticism Senator Hayes made of the two Bills, particularly of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill.  In these Bills, we are simply attempting to carry out as specifically as we can the directions of the Constitution.  The Constitution is in English and in Irish. There is a provision that, in the event of a conflict, the Irish version takes precedence.  There are not two Constitutions. There is only one.  There is only one Article 34.  Article 34 provides for the establishment of one set of courts, not two.  The combined effort of the English and Irish versions is to direct the establishment of these <Col N="1889" /> courts with an Irish and an English title.  That is the directive purpose of Article 34.  It is to that directive purpose we seek to give effect in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me develop my argument.  There is a very clear, distinct and logical pattern in what we are doing.  I shall take the Supreme Court.  The rest follow the same pattern and it is easier to deal with one particular court.  The Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Bill is an instrument which has for its purpose the fundamental operation of establishing the courts.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1), Section 1 reads:</P>
      <P>On the commencement of this Act, the Court of Final Appeal, which in pursuance of Article 34 of the Constitution is to be called An Chúirt Uachtarach (The Supreme Court), shall stand established.</P>
      <P>That is the basic section performing the fundamental establishing operation. In that regard it is different from all the other sections of the No. 1 Bill and all the other Sections of the No. 2 Bill because they are all subsidiary to it, as it were. That one section, in so far as it refers to the Supreme Court, springs directly from Article 34 of the Constitution.  That basic establishment section is more directly related to Article 34 than any other section of the Bill and we use the two forms to indicate that we are complying as fully and as closely as possible with the Constitution.  Thereafter, these are the English texts of these two Bills and naturally we use only the English version of these courts.  It is very logical and very desirable in the first section, in setting about establishing the courts, to go as directly as possible to the source of authority, Article 34, and give the English-Irish names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to direct the attention of <Col N="1890" /> Senator Hayes to that model of legislative perfection, the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, which he lauded to us here as being the product of brains, Ministerial ability, and so on.  I direct the attention of the House to Sections 4 and 5, in particular, of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, of which Senator Hayes not alone approves but holds up to us here to-night as a model.  Let me quote, for instance, from Section 5 of that Act:</P>
    <P>A Supreme Court of Justice (Cúirt Breithiúnais Uachtarach) shall be constituted under this Act to be the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State.</P>
    <P>If that is not, in Senator Hayes's own darling Courts of Justice Act of 1924, a perfect precedent for what we are doing in this Bill I do not know what is.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear also to the House, in view of the fact that the point has been raised, that there is neither confusion of thought nor hypocrisy involved in this. The Constitution provisions are to the effect that there shall be two languages in this State.  In so far as we can, we are sincerely accepting that obligation and giving effect to it in these Bills.  There is nothing else behind what we are doing. We are following a clear and logical pattern throughout the two Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what has been said by Senator O'Quigley, I welcome most of it.  He has put forward a number of <Col N="1891" /> suggestions with regard to the administration of justice generally which I regard as being very useful and indeed worthy of consideration.  However, with regard to most of them, even if we had more time at our disposal, these two Bills are not the place to give effect to them.  These Bills have a very definite and specific objective, first, to establish the courts and then to deal with all other matters arising out of that establishment.  In the main, the No. 2 Bill should confine itself to matters arising out of and subsidiary to the establishment which is performed by the No. 1 Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan also made some suggestions which are well worthy of examination.  I want to assure the Seanad that that examination is proceeding and will be proceeded with. In so far as anything can be done within reason to improve the administration of justice it will be done but I am sure the House, including the two Senators concerned, will be the first to admit that it is not easy to effect these changes quickly.  A very great deal of time and thought must be devoted to them, apart altogether from the fact that practically every improvement involves considerable expenditure.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes asked what had happened to the modes of address that existed up to now and Senator O'Quigley also dealt with that point. The position there is quite simple. There was a volume of opinion in this country to the effect that it was inappropriate at this time that our courts should continue to use phrases which were by many people regarded as archaic and out of date.  There was a volume of opinion which objected to the use of these phrases in our courts.</P>
    <P>Much of the discussion which has taken place on this matter has been directed to the use of these phrases by the practitioners but in dealing with this problem we must take cognisance of the fact that our people who have recourse to the courts were constrained to use these forms of address. As long ago as 1936 a very distinguished chief justice of this country, <Col N="1892" /> Chief Justice Kennedy, proposed exactly what we propose in this Bill. Therefore there is nothing new about it.  There was no question, as there was an endeavour to suggest in the Dáil, of our having rushed in with this proposal at the last moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that later.  We were conscious of this volume of opinion against these forms of address which were in our circumstances considered out of date and inappropriate. We set about dealing with that problem and very strenuous objections were raised to the Oireachtas attempting by legislation to do something which was strictly and correctly a matter for the courts themselves through the Rules Committees. We took cognisance of that objection. Indeed we received deputations from various interested parties and listened to many views.  It seemed to my Minister and to me that the basic objection was to the fact that this was being taken from the Rules Committee and done by legislation.  It seemed that if we gave the job of prescribing these modes of address back to the Rules Committee we would go a long way if not the whole way towards meeting the objection.  I therefore moved in the Dáil to delete Section 45, as it then was, from the Bill, and the matter of prescribing modes of address in our courts was handed back to the Rules Committee.  The Rules Committee for both the Superior Court and the circuit court have made new rules and these new rules have been accepted by the Minister for Justice.  I have every confidence that they will be accepted by both professions as well.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley raised a point with which I was going to deal but with which Senator Lenihan dealt very well.  Surely the difficulty he foresaw arising in regard to the use of terms such as &ldquo;if your Lordship pleases&rdquo; would be very easily met by the use of the phrase &ldquo;the court&rdquo;.  It is a simple matter to substitute &ldquo;the court&rdquo; for &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo; or for &ldquo;your Lordship&rdquo; in that instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1893" /> The criticism has been made that we spent a long time producing these Bills and neglected our constitutional obligation for 24 years.  I suppose there is something in that criticism but I want to mention the background. Almost immediately after the passing of the Constitution we had the war. We had the period between 1938 to 1946 when the energies of all of us were directed to very important matters other than constitutional matters of this sort.  Indeed, I think that any fair-minded person would agree it was not possible to expect that a major legislative constitutional project of this nature would have been embarked upon in the period from 1938 to 1946.  If anybody is culpable, I suppose it is the people who were responsible between the ending of the war and 1950 because these Bills got under way in 1950.</P>
    <P>When you take all these circumstances into consideration, I think that they were got under way with not unreasonable delay.  The fact that they have been gestating, if I may use the word, since 1950 is due, I think, to the complexity of the various matters involved. The lawyers present in the House will realise immediately that the matters dealt with are complex and required a very great deal of care and consideration before the Bills eventually saw the light of day.  I think that Senator O'Quigley might have said, now that they are here, that they are welcome.  He might have been gracious enough to say that.</P>

      <P>Senator Lenihan dealt fully with the question of the district court.  Let me say, however, that there is no question at all of endeavouring to establish that district justices are in any way inferior to the other judges.  The district court is a different type of court.  These provisions, apart from the provision about the reprimand jurisdiction of the Chief Justice, deal in the main with the administration of the courts.  They are not directed to the quality of the justices themselves.  The reason we have these provisions with regard to the district court is not that we think the <Col N="1894" /> district justices are in any way inferior but simply that the District Court presents special problems.  As Senator Lenihan pointed out, the district courts deal with a vast volume of business. Approximately 250,000 cases are dealt with in the district courts every year. Apart from law, jurisdiction or justice, there is a big administrative problem in the working of these courts.  If we examine these new provisions, I think it will be found that they are directed to administration rather than to anything else.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception, as I have already said, of the reprimand jurisdiction in Section 10.  With regard to Section 10, I think that should be welcomed by the House. Indeed, I think it will be welcomed by the district justices themselves. There has always been inherent in the office of the Chief Justice this jurisdiction of control over judges.  Indeed, it has happened from time to time that he has informally sent for district justices and spoken to them about their behaviour.  All we are doing is putting that informal procedure on a statutory basis and giving the Chief Justice the statutory authority to do what he has from time to time done informally before.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Lenihan was absolutely right in this regard.  It is quite possible that a district justice could benefit by the provisions of Section 10.  There might be some small irregularity, some temporary lapse. Surely, in those circumstances it is desirable that a judicial person, rather than the Minister or the Executive, should come in and have a word with the district justice about his conduct? We should not have undesirable interference by the Executive or, alternatively, the heavy-handed cumbersome procedure laid down in the 1946 Act. I think these provisions will do a lot of good and, on sober reflection by all concerned, they will be generally welcomed by the judiciary and, indeed, by the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, these two Bills in the particular regard which I <Col N="1895" /> mentioned are in their general intent nothing more than an endeavour by the Oireachtas to carry out the obligation which the Constitution has imposed upon it.  I again admit that the establishment of these courts has been long delayed, but I think even at this late stage that it is a good thing that we should give to ourselves courts established in accordance with the provisions of our own Constitution.</P>

      <P>I should like to repeat what I said before.  It is very <Col N="1896" /> ingenious for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that he takes Article 34 to be the Irish and English versions. That is impossible.  It is not right and the Parliamentary Secretary knows it is not right.  It is daft to say that the fundamental law of the country is in two different languages because the Constitution recognises two languages. You cannot do anything with the language by legislating.  You cannot legislate Irish into English and English into Irish.  The idea that because you have two separate pages here and somebody says Irish is an official language and that you can combine two separate versions of the same thing is &ldquo;cracked&rdquo;.  The Parliamnntary Secretary is not right.  The name of the court has to be something. This Constitution was thought out in English: it was framed in English. It was translated into Irish by a Committee and that translation was abandoned.  It was translated then by the official translators.  The name of the Supreme Court is &ldquo;the Supreme Court&rdquo; and, in Irish, it is An Chúirt Uachtarach.&rdquo;  This purports to twist all that around.  If you are going to call it An Chúirt Uachtarach, then call it An Chúirt Uachtarach, just as you call the Taoiseach &ldquo;the Taoiseach.&rdquo;  I do not like that particular kind of thing and I do not think it does any good for Irish.  You have the advantage of knowing what you are talking about if you call the Taoiseach &ldquo;the Taoiseach.&rdquo;  What is the name of the Supreme Court?  Is it &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; or is it &ldquo;the Supreme Court&rdquo;?</P>

What was constituted was a High Court of Justice, and for Irish purposes it could be called &ldquo;An Ard-Chúirt Bhreithiúnais&rdquo;.  What is the good in the Parliamentary Secretary's telling me this, because you cannot talk two languages at the same time, no matter how clever you are.  All this is very fine if you do not know Irish, but if you know Irish, it is a disgrace because it hurts your feelings.  It calls it &ldquo;An Chúirt Uachtarach&rdquo; and then in brackets &ldquo;Supreme Court&rdquo; and you go on to use Supreme Court leaving An Chúirt Uachtarach after you.  It is using Irish in a fradulent manner to pretend you are interested in Irish when in fact you are not.  That is what annoys me.  All the provisions of the other Bill are in English, the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice, High Court, district justices and so on.  This is a linguistic fraud.  There is no doubt about that.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes is entirely correct.  I wish people would study the Constitution.  It is a very valuable document and contains a great deal of information.  I would refer the Parliamentary Secretary to Article 12 which deals with the office of President and which illustrates the point made by Senator Hayes.  In the English text, it says that &ldquo;There shall be a President of Ireland (Uachtarán na hÉireann), hereinafter called the President.&rdquo;  Then you have the National Parliament, which &ldquo;shall be called ... the Oireachtas&rdquo;, and afterwards in the English text, it is referred to as the Oireachtas.  But you do not find any such provision in relation to the courts in Article 34.  That bears out completely, if it required to be borne out, what Senator Hayes, who must be regarded as an expert, has said and I prefer his informed opinion.</P>

      <P>There is a peculiarity of drafting here, the significance of which escapes me.  &ldquo;The District Court shall be constituted of the following judges ... such number of other judges (each of whom shall be styled &lsquo;Breitheamh den Chúirt Dúiche&rsquo; (&lsquo;Justice of the district court&rsquo;)&rdquo; as fixed from time to time by Act of the Oireachtas.  Then we have, later on, the provision that although they are to be called &ldquo;judges&rdquo; they are to be styled &ldquo;justices&rdquo;.  It is a form of confusion that does not appeal to me and I do not understand the reason for it.  If the present district justices are judges why are they not called judges of the district court?

The Parliamentary Secretary will not be able to convince me to the contrary and I suppose it is not worth his while trying to do so.</P>

      <P>I am not very strong in my views about subsection (4) of this section but I know people are dissatisfied with certain things in relation to the district courts.  We have adopted a system which has great merits and for which we have to pay, just as we have to pay for everything that works.  The other Bill we have just passed makes clear beyond doubt that district justices are judges but because there are more of them&mdash; because of the immense amount of litigation which comes before them&mdash; special provisions have been made <Col N="1904" /> which give the Chief Justice power to interview a district justice privately and inform him of certain things.  I am not sure how that will work.  I may say right away that I have complete confidence in the present Chief Justice but we are legislating for the future and I am not quite sure about giving this power to anyone.</P>
      <P>The other power still remains.  The Chief Justice may appoint a judge to go into the conduct of a district justice but that power, very properly, has very rarely been exercised, and it should be rarely exercised.  I take it that power still remains if a district justice, having been admonished in accordance with subsection (4), refuses to change his ways.  Is that correct? Definitely putting it in legislation, and saying that the Chief Justice has power to do this kind of thing, savours to me of trying to have the best of both worlds.  The independence of the district justices is constitutional and this is a departure from that principle to some extent.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary's arguments are sound in many ways but it might be better to leave this provision out.  I know we cannot do it now but it might have been better to leave it out.</P>

      <P>I have seen other sections with similar pious hopes.  I do not see any reason for putting this provision in the Bill.  It does not mean anything. It does not give any power.  I do not think it compels a district justice to go before the Chief Justice.  I do not think there is any obligation on him. If the Chief Justice says: &ldquo;I would like to see you on such and such a date at 3 o'clock,&rdquo; I doubt if there is any power to compel a district justice to go before him.  It seems to me to be a pious wish.  I think this provision is absolutely useless.  It does not improve our law.  I do not think it will improve the running of the courts or the quality of the district justices, because the Chief Justice could interview a justice in a fatherly way in any case as he is the Chief Justice.  To my mind, subsection (4) of Section 10 is just a pious wish.</P>

      <P>The subsection has this value.  If it were suggested to the <Col N="1905" /> Chief Justice that he should interview a district justice, he might very well say that he has no power, or no statutory function.  Once this Bill becomes law, that doubt will be removed and it will be quite clear that the Chief Justice has power and authority to send for a district justice. It seems to me that Senator Hayes to some extent argued against himself with regard to this provision.  He pointed out that we want to preserve the independence of the judiciary.  We all agree with that.  He went on to say that the cumbersome, heavy-handed, or as Senator Lenihan said, Draconian procedure of the 1946 Act should rarely be invoked.</P>

Therefore, the powers contained in the 1946 Act in such a case would not be invoked.

      <P>There is only one thing that I want to say about the Civil Liability Bill.  It relates to the manner in which the Bill will be administered or can be administered in the courts.  In recent times&mdash;this is a matter in which the Parliamentary Secretary should be interested&mdash;when it comes to dealing with negligence actions arising out of motor driving cases, a practice has grown up, apparently between the authorities and the Garda Commissioner or some other authority, under which it is not now possible to get any measurements <Col N="1910" /> taken or any statements in respect of an accident that has occurred unless there be loss of life or very serious injury to the person.</P>
      <P>It has become the experience of solicitors, when they want to institute proceedings in negligence actions, to find there is no Garda evidence available to assist the court in determining who was negligent and who was liable for damages.  This Bill will be greatly hampered in its operation, I believe, if the practice which is growing up is permitted to continue and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able&mdash;during the time he is Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Justice&mdash;to exercise some influence so that there may be available to the courts, whose duty it is to administer justice, the services of a member of the Garda in all cases.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether that is becoming a common practice but I am told also that in certain other cases the Garda who investigates an accident may make a sketch and then make a report to his authorities.  A copy of the report he makes to the authorities will not be given to either side in the negligence action.  The reason, I am told, is that the report is regarded as a confidential document, confidential and privileged as between the Garda and his superiors.  Difficulty has been experienced in getting the Garda in those circumstances to make any statement to solicitors on either side, to attend any consultations or to give any information right up to the day on which a High Court action is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Garda are paid out of public funds and since individual Gardaí would have no objection whatever to making the fullest possible information available to the interested parties, the practice of restricting the supplying of that information should be discontinued.  It greatly frustrates the administration of justice.  People may find only when all the costs of High Court proceedings have been incurred that, on the morning of the court, when the Garda attends under subpoena, there have been grave miscalculations on their part due to the absence of information which was <Col N="1911" /> all the time in the possession of the Garda who was then present.  This is not fantasy.  It is a matter which I have been asked to raise and I know of my own knowledge, in relation to the first point I made, that reports are not being made in a number of types of accidents, reports which up to recently were freely available.  In regard to the second matter, the refusal of the Garda authorities to give copies of Garda reports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are dealing here with questions of negligence and if the courts are to be in a position to know who is negligent or in what degree they were negligent, they must have the fullest information.  The fullest information will be available only if the Garda authorities permit the practice which was in operation for many years up to recently to be revived and to continue.</P>

      <P>With respect, Sir, we have not had the advantage of going through this Bill in detail.  If we had had a Committee Stage, it would have been abundantly apparent that inextricably mixed up with the various provisions is the having in court of evidence, particularly evidence of the impartial kind which the Garda Síochána alone can provide.  So far as the Parliamentary Secretary can influence the position, I hope he will do so.</P>

      <P>May I be equally irrelevant in saying that whereas I do not agree with Senator O'Quigley that the Garda should be forced to investigate and make a report on an accident where there seems to be no likelihood they will have to bring a prosecution, I agree that where they do in fact act <Col N="1912" /> on a report, there is no reason why they should not make that report available to the parties in civil proceedings when asked to do so.  Certainly, in many cases, proceedings are held up for an unnecessarily long time waiting for the Garda to give a report which could be very helpful and could possibly have the effect of putting an end to the proceedings altogether by causing the plaintiff to withdraw or causing the defendant to settle very quickly.  It would be a great help if the police could supply these reports, and I do not see any reason why they should not.</P>

      <P>Against such a formidable array of opinion, I would naturally be intimidated.  I can, however, assure the House this is a matter we have been considering.  Indeed, I think the case made by the Senators is a valid one.  There is, however, another side to the story.  But I will certainly undertake that the whole position will be fully considered and what has been said here will be given more than due regard when we come to take a decision on this matter.</P>

      <P>May I, in conclusion, thank the House for the manner in which they have received these Bills and dealt with them?  I would suggest to the various Senators they need not be unduly alarmed or perturbed at the expedition with which we have dealt with these Bills here tonight.  I think the detailed consideration and examination they got in the Dáil&mdash;and, in the case of one of them, in a Special Committee &mdash;and the manner in which generally they have been prepared and finalised were such as to ensure that they will be valuable and useful pieces of legislation.</P>
