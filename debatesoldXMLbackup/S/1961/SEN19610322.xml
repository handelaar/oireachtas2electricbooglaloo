      <P>This is the section relating to the reception of a patient in a mental institution, who, at the time of reception, is a person who is presumably able to pay for some part of his maintenance and treatment, but ceases to be so capable on leaving the institution.  The institution then gives notice to the mental hospital authority which ordinarily should receive and maintain that patient.  I can understand a situation in which a person, who is a wage or salary earner, and who, at the date of reception, is liable to pay a certain portion towards his maintenance and who finds, after a certain lapse of time, that that source of income dries up; but I am wondering what is the position with regard to persons who own property. One frequently finds that patients who are received in mental hospitals have certain property which may not be very great and in time a very great burden rests upon that property by reason of the fact that, when the patient is made a ward of court, there is an accumulation of maintenance.  I think it would be much better, from the point of view of the preservation of the patient's property, if, from the beginning, there were a proper inquiry or determination as to his capacity to pay, in whole or in part, for his maintenance.  That being determined, the question of arrears would not arise again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister can indicate <Col N="1236" /> whether under Section 108, as amended, the position would not be created where persons who are detained in a mental hospital, for perhaps fairly prolonged periods, may find themselves on leaving that institution, by reason of the failure of the authority properly to assess their means, burdened with the payment of a large sum out of their capital in discharge of the cost of maintenance and treatment they have received in the mental hospital.  I should be glad if the Minister would indicate if any change will be made by mental hospital authorities to ensure that all discharged patients will not be faced with a big bill which could have been paid out of income from property while they were detained in hospital.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not arise on Section 2.  That section merely proposes to amend, for the purpose of more convenient administration, the existing Section 108.  The matter raised by the Senator relates to the whole principle of Section 108 and possibly with its administration.  I cannot discuss a hypothetical point which may be raised here in relation to any one of these sections.  I respectfully submit we are bound to confine ourselves to the net point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally, chargeable patients, that is, patients broadly entitled under Section 15 to receive treatment free or at a reduced rate in a mental institution &mdash; are received into the district hospital in the area in which they reside.  Only after a patient has been received into a particular district hospital does it occasionally transpire that he was not ordinarily resident in the district of that hospital.  Section 108 of the 1945 Act provides for the transfer of such patient to the hospital for the district in which he ordinarily resides.  The proposed amendment is designed to obviate difficulties in the application of the section.  At present, persons must be chargeable patients at the time of reception in order that <Col N="1237" /> the section as it stands in the Principal Act may apply.</P>
    <P>It sometimes happens that patients enter as paying patients and, by reason of a reduction in their means or income, later become chargeable patients.  The subsection is intended to deal with that sort of case.  I cannot possibly deal with the point raised by Senator O'Quigley and I should not be expected to, either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the position of a person received in a mental hospital who, at the time of being received, is regarded as being able to pay, in whole or in part, for his treatment.  Later, he is no longer able to pay.  When the means of the patient are being investigated, the charge should be fixed by the mental hospital authority.  On discharge, the patient should not be faced with an accumulated arrear for his maintenance. There is the danger that the whole of the patient's property will be absorbed in paying debts which the mental hospital authority should have collected week by week or month by month.  That arises quite relevantly on this section.</P>

      <P>Section 2 reads:</P>
      <P>The following sentence is hereby added to subsection (1) of section 108 of the Principal Act: &ldquo;Where a patient in a district mental hospital or other institution maintained by a mental hospital authority, having been received therein otherwise than as a chargeable patient, becomes a chargeable patient, such authority shall, if another mental hospital authority are the mental hospital authority for the mental hospital district in which such person ordinarily resides, give notice of his having become a chargeable patient to the other mental hospital authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net point is whether or not one mental hospital authority shall give <Col N="1238" /> notice to the other mental hospital authority in the circumstances I have detailed.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this new section is to provide that payments may be made to mental hospital patients in respect of work done by them.  At present, there is no power to make such payments but, in practice, most authorities make token payments. All psychiatric authorities agree that payments should be made to patients in respect of work done by them.  There has not been any provision in the Act to enable that to be done in due and proper form.  I must say that, under this provision, only token incentive payments are proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether the regulations to be made by the Minister will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas? Section 280 of the 1945 Act says:</P>
      <P>An order or regulation made by the Minister under this Act and relating to or having effect in every mental hospital district shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>This is a section which provides that the Minister may authorise the making of payments in all or one or more mental hospital districts.  Am I right in saying that if the Minister makes a regulation in relation to all mental hospitals under this section, such regulation could be laid before each House of the Oireachtas?  I think it might be better to have this matter clarified at this stage for this reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the kind of thing which the <Col N="1239" /> Statutory Instruments Committee frequently find difficulty in determining. If the Minister indicated at this stage what the position is going to be, it would ease the situation at a later stage for his own Department and for the Statutory Instruments Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 7, before &ldquo;step-father&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; and in line 8 before &ldquo;step-mother&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;grandmother&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a new provision whereby any visitor or medical practitioner may certify a person for the purpose of having him received into a mental institution. There are certain exceptions set out in subsection (2) of the Bill and it occurs to me that the grandfather should be inserted among the degrees of relationship of the medical practitioner in relation to the person sought to be committed.  If you have a wife, husband, father, stepfather, guardian or trustee, I do not see why you should not insert grandfather.  It is quite possible that the grandfather of a relative need not be very old to be a grandfather and to certify in respect of the patient.  It seems to me that there are likely to be just as many cases in which the medical practitioner could be an uncle or a father-in-law.  I do not understand why so close a relation as a grandfather should not be included among the disqualified medical practitioners under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer is that the degrees of kindred which disqualify a person from certifying in a case of this sort is carried right through the 1945 Act.  It was thought that it was not necessary to amend this section and about eight other sections, thus making this Bill a little more complicated by including a greater number of items of legislation by reference. We have just preserved the existing framework of the 1945 Act <Col N="1241" /> by not having enlarged the ambit of the disqualifications contained in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not find that a very satisfactory reason.  Senator O'Quigley has made a fair case that this relationship is just as close as those already in the measure.  It rather seems as if it would be too much trouble to make the change from what the Minister says.  I should like a little stronger reason for leaving it out.  What distinction is there in the relationship between a grandfather and a stepfather and the rest?  It may mean a little more trouble but that is what we are here for.  We are here to improve legislation. We should, perhaps, press on with this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in the hands of the Seanad in this matter.  I want to point out that if the Senator will turn to the last section of the Bill, he will see that the superannuation provisions of this Bill cannot come into operation except on a first day of April.  I am very anxious that it should come into operation on the first day of April next. Any amendment would mean that this Bill would have to be carried over until after Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in sympathy with the Minister on this.  None of us likes to rush legislation of this kind.  This is rushed legislation and with the greatest goodwill in the world, I do not like it and I know the House does not like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>After all, we are either a House of Parliament or we are not.  I think we are a House of Parliament.  We have a job and a duty to discharge here.  We ought not to allow legislation which may have sections which are meaningless go through.  The explanation given by the Minister is by no means a convincing one.  The parliamentary draftsmen can be extremely adept at times in boxing a whole lot of different sections into one section and saying: &ldquo;They are all amended in this way.&rdquo;  When we have so much legislation by reference in this Bill, there is no objection in principle to making the amendment apply to ten different sections if that is necessary. The Minister says that there are  <Col N="1242" /> other sections similarly involved: If there are, the only thing to do is to amend the 10 other sections.</P>
      <P>When I first read this &mdash; and the more I read it, the more likely it seemed to me &mdash; it seemed to me that a grandfather or a grandmother, in modern times should be included in the section.</P>
      <P>I know quite a number of relatively young grandfathers and the Minister has not given any explanation whatever, except to say that this Bill has to be in operation on 1st April.  He refers to the superannuation provisions.  There is nothing to my knowledge that we cannot do by legislation and I cannot see any reasons why we cannot deal with this without insisting that this Bill should always have operated from 1st of April, 1960.</P>
      <P>But let me say that it must always be borne in mind, when legislation is being introduced under our system of parliamentary representation and our system of legislation, that ninety days should be allowed to elapse from the date on which a measure passes Dáil Éireann, to its signing by the President, with, another four to seven days within which the President may sign it. It just does not do to come into the House of Parliament established by the constitution and to say: &ldquo;We have delayed in bringing in this piece of legislation and now we cannot amend it because we did not bring it in in time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am going to refer to a Bill which we let through before on which the Minister for Industry and Commerce agreed &mdash; and it is on record &mdash; that the section did not mean anything.  &ldquo;It has no meaning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but if we don't pass this, the Dáil being now in recess, a grant due to be paid in September will be held up.&rdquo;  That is not the job this House is being paid to do &mdash; to enact legislation which has no meaning. We ought to pause and consider whether we should go very much further along that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister cannot give a better explanation for the failure to include grandfathers and grandmothers in sub-paragraph (b) of the new subsection (6) of Section 162, we should as a House insist and say that we will have to amend <Col N="1243" /> the Bill.  If the Minister wants to bring in an amendment to the other section, we will give every possible assistance in doing that.  Otherwise, we ought to take stock of ourselves as a house of Parliament.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat what I said at the outset: I am in the hands of the Seanad.  So far as I am concerned, the responsibility will not be on me if this section does not come into operation on the next 1st April. As I say, I am in the hands of the Seanad but I have pointed out the consequences of accepting an amendment which I regard as a trivial amendment, because the Senator has made no case whatever for it, except to say that he thinks that a grandparent is of equal kin with the person, in respect of whom a reception order has been applied for, as his mother, or has equal responsibility for him.</P>
      <P>Let us look at this in a practical way.  Of course we all know grandparents who are comparatively young, but they are not all medical practitioners, in the first instance, and if they are medical practitioners, they are not all itching to commit their sons to mental hospitals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Because he ceases to have regard to practical realities, as the Oireachtas had when it passed the 1945 Act without the assistance of Senator O'Quigley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Because in an Act running to almost 300 sections in untried circumstances, it emerged, in practice, that there were a few minor defects which we have dealt with in this Bill.  Now, Sir, I do not claim the degree of omniscience which Senator O'Quigley seems to possess, but I do think that having regard to the practical situation, having regard to the fact that these degrees of kindred are prescribed as disqualifying in <Col N="1244" /> the Principal Act, there is no reason, at this stage, why we should hold up the Bill for the sake of inserting these two words.  I am putting it to the Seanad &mdash; as I said, I am entirely in the hands of the House &mdash; that I am not endeavouring to drive this thing through.  The House can take it as it stands or make this amendment; but I will say this: when it does go back to the Dáil, I shall say that this amendment went through without due warrant and without any real argument being adduced in support of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>From my point of view, the logic of this section is that a grandfather or grandmother are as closely involved in the welfare of their grandchildren as, say, a stepfather or stepmother and I cannot see any firm line that one can draw between these; but perhaps the Minister would give us the general principle on which these people mentioned are excluded in the subsection and a grandfather or grandmother is not excluded.  Let us not think of this in terms of whether we are going to have a decision division on it or anything like that.  We are genuinely trying to see if this section is the best possible. At the moment, a few new minds are being brought to bear on it.  The Minister may not think very highly of some of the minds here but they are new minds and that is what Houses of Parliament are for and why we have general elections from time to time.  If the Minister would give the basic principle underlying this, we will make up our minds on it but not on the basis of what will happen in the Dáil or on the first of April, an ominous date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section, as I read it, is a sort of safeguard to debar certain relatives of a patient from being able to commit the patient to a mental hospital if they happen to be, themselves, doctors.  I think it is in the way of life we have that it is necessary that we should have that bar, that a person who might benefit by putting a patient into a mental hospital should be debarred from doing so.  It seems to me, however, very unlikely that <Col N="1245" /> grandparents would be involved in such a situation.  In the nature of things, grandparents would be fairly old by the time the grandchildren would have property of their own and would scarcely be of an age at which they would benefit financially from having a grandchild committed to a mental hospital.  For that reason, I do not think there is any real necessity to put grandparents &mdash; grandfathers or grandmothers&mdash;in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an open mind, or I had an open mind about this matter, until I heard the Minister's remarks.  I do not know why a Minister should come in and say the 1945 Act was passed without the assistance of Senator O'Quigley.  Acts were passed in 1908 without the assistance of the Minister!</P>
      <P>Another remark of the Minister was &ldquo;the degree of omniscience&rdquo;.  When people use these kind of remarks, I really see red.  I do not mind somebody saying that I am stupid.  I may very well be stupid on occasions&mdash;but when they refer to &ldquo;the degree of omniscience&rdquo;, then I do object strongly.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other remarks of the Minister to the effect that this Bill should come into operation on April 1st, either we are a House of Parliament, and the Dáil is a House of Parliament, or we are nothing at all. We are just underwriters for the civil service and for their errors.  We underwrote an error of the Minister and his civil servants last week and he charged out of the House without saying a word of thanks.</P>

That kind of offensive behaviour is not right.</P>

      <P>I, too, have an open mind on many of these things, and nothing the mover of the amendment says convinces me that the Minister would be justified in accepting what is in the amendment, namely, that a grandfather or a grandmother should be included as disqualified persons.  I am entirely in agreement with what Senator Murphy said, that it was very unlikely that these people would be involved at all.  There are many degrees of kinship mentioned in this section, and if we go on extending them, I do not know where we will end.  The Minister is right in sticking to the provisions of the 1945 Act, and we are fully justified in supporting him, unless and until there is a case made for departing from it, and no such case has been made.</P>

      <P>I was about to refer to Senator O'Quigley's presumption that if his amendment is not accepted, the section will be bad.  I call that the height of presumption.  Senator O'Quigley sets himself up as a neo-draftsman in this House.  He should have more regard for the fact that the 1945 Act worked reasonably well and, as Senator Ó Ciosáin has said, let us wait and see if this difficulty visualised by Senator O'Quigley will arise.  I think it would be a bad thing to extend the degree of kinship because, as Senator Murphy rightly said, you could perhaps have spite and maybe spleen brought into it.  You could find yourself in a difficult position arising from that fact.</P>

      <P>It is one thing for the Minister to say that he is in the hands of the House, and it is quite another for him to say: &ldquo;If you do not do what I want you to do, there are people whose superannuation rates will be affected.&rdquo;  Whether that be so or not, the Minister had a duty to introduce this measure in sufficient time to enable it to go through all Stages in both Houses and, if necessary, go back as amended by the Seanad to the Dáil.  That is his responsibility but we have a new conception of responsibility on the part of the Minister for Health.  On the Mental Treatment (Detention in Approved Institutions) Bill, the Minister disclaimed all responsibility.  In relation to the state of Castlebar Mental Hospital, he disclaimed all responsibility.  Now in relation to this Bill not being enacted in time, he disclaims responsibility, too.  When does the Minister's responsibility begin or what is his conception of responsibility? I do not want to press this point any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make another remark with regard to what the Minister said <Col N="1248" /> about the assistance I have endeavoured to give in the passage of this Bill &mdash; that there are many amendments made to Bills in this House as a result of amendments put down by me, and that is a fact, whether the Minister likes it or not.  I was not around in 1945 when this other Bill was brought in, but the fact that the Oireachtas at that time thought the position was all right is no reason why we should not raise these matters now, and we ought to be entitled to receive the same courtesy as we extend to the Minister when he introduces a whole series of amendments to existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy has given an excellent exposition of one reason sufficient to satisfy me as to why a grandparent ought not to be included in this section. If the Minister had had the grasp of the principle which Senator Stanford asked him to enunciate and which Senator Murphy so ably and lucidly expounded, we would not have been delayed all this time.  I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, on the Second Stage, indicated that this amendment was being made to the 1945 Act in order to clarify beyond doubt that a member of the Garda Síochána might properly enter upon premises to apprehend a person believed to be in such premises and also believed to be of unsound mind.  It strikes me that the power or authority now being given to a member of the Garda Síochána is unduly wide.  A person might be resident in the premises, or detained in premises, over quite a long period and be of unsound mind, but the fact that that person was there might not come to the notice of the Garda for months or weeks.  It appears to me that it is <Col N="1249" /> only where the person is liable to do damage to himself or to life and limb or to property, that the Garda Síochána should be entitled to enter upon the premises to apprehend that person.  For that reason, I propose that the power of a member of the Garda Síochána to enter upon premises to apprehend a person believed to be of unsound mind, and believed to be therein, should be limited to cases of urgency or emergency.</P>

I prefer to have the original because there is many a slip that the printers make apparently, which is not detected by those who read proofs on behalf of the Minister.  What is contained in subsection (1) applies to a kind of situation that could persist for weeks or months.  There may be maintained over a period of months, or living in a dwelling for a period of months, a person who, in his own interests and the interest of the public, should be lodged in a mental institution. We know how lax and slow people are to take the unpleasant step of committing some relation to a mental <Col N="1250" /> hospital.  That kind of situation can go on for months.  I do not think we ought to invest a member of the Garda with power to go in in a case like that and arrest a person or take a person into custody.</P>

I should not care to be a young man of 22 and to come into this Seanad with the Minister in charge of a Bill.

He is entitled to make that remark, regardless of whether it is proof-reading or misprints or a fall-out of type or a chance word or any one of the many accidents that can occur with documents.

      <P>In page 8, between lines 53 and 54, to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(III)  give a like notice to each member of the Mental Hospital Authority,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I read what the Minister said in reply to remarks I made on the Second Stage. He suggested he might possibly be able to deal with the matter by the way of regulation.  At Column 1164 of the Official Report of Seanad Éireann, Volume 53, the Minister is reported as saying:</P>
      <P>...I should like to draw the Senator's attention to the fact that it is not just as simple a matter as it might appear to the ordinary individual, because, under Section 225 of the existing Mental Treatment Act of 1945, the resident medical superintendent of a district mental hospital is required to make available from time to time to the mental hospital authority case books showing the mental condition of persons detained in the hospital.</P>
      <P>I do not want particulars of the mental condition of the patient.  I want a list of patients who have been detained for a further period of six months or three months, or whatever the period may be, to be available to the members of the mental hospital authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most members of mental hospital authorities take their work very seriously. They take a great interest in the patients.  It is to the members of the authority that the family of the patient turns for information in the first instance. A person might ask me, as a member of a board, something about a patient and I should have to plead complete ignorance.  I do not know what has happened the patient and I am not allowed to know.  It would be reasonable to get a list of these people. It would be a further safeguard against improper detention in a mental hospital <Col N="1254" /> and the more safeguards there are in that respect, the better.</P>
    <P>In the original Act a large number of duties are assigned to mental hospital authorities.</P>
    <P>On paper, it is they who give power to transfer a patient either for treatment in another institution or because the R.M.S. might advise that removal to another institution might be beneficial to the patient.  The relatives should be entitled to know what is happening and therefore lists of people detained for a further period should be supplied to members.  They spend a great deal of time on this work.  They take a great interest in the patients and visit them regularly. Hardly a patient is admitted into such hospital that some member of the hospital authority does not know some relative of his.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Senator not to press the amendment. Perhaps we are a little at cross-purposes. The proposal in Section 18 to which the amendment is put down is that where a reception order in respect of a temporary patient is endorsed by the chief medical officer, thereby authorising the detention of that temporary patient for a further period of six months, up to a maximum of two years in all, the medical officer must give notice to the person to whom the order relates &mdash; the patient himself &mdash; stating the particulars of the endorsement and informing him that, if he so desires, he may send to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals an objection to the extension of his period of detention.  It is also provided that the person who originally asked for the reception order will be informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that these two persons have an immediate personal interest.  I think it would not be right, if the medical officer decides that for the patient's benefit he had to be detained for a further period of six months, he should inform every member of the mental hospital authority.  Surely, the patient's condition, particularly the condition of a temporary patient, is an intimate confidential matter between the patient and his medical adviser or between <Col N="1255" /> the patient's near friend, that is, the applicant, and the doctor who is treating him?</P>
    <P>I do not think we could justify obliging the person who is treating a mentally ill individual to bring to the knowledge of other people who are not intimately concerned with the patient, nor related to him, the fact that the patient has not recovered and must be detained for a further period of six months.  The vast majority of people are very sensitive on a point of this kind.  I think most of them would resent very much the idea that if their relative had to be detained for a further six months some of their neighbours would be informed or some people, perhaps people they would not like to know.  It would cause them great embarrassment if they knew.  Many of the people concerned might perhaps be strangers.  I would appeal to the Senator not to press this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I originally suggested this as a further safeguard against any wrong being done to a patient in a mental hospital.  The Minister suggests that it would be wrong for people who are not concerned with the patient to know his condition but it is the duty of the board to know the position.  We are entitled, as a mental hospital authority, to see everyone of the patients in a mental hospital and I feel it is very reasonable to suggest that we should be informed as much as possible of what goes on in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a previous occasion, the Minister made certain disparaging remarks about some local authorities.  I feel that, perhaps, he does not know some of the local authorities as well as he should because any I have seen working &mdash; they are very few, I admit &mdash; take their job very seriously.  It is to them that the relatives of these patients come, in the first instance.  In fact, quite often their only information about a patient is gained through members of the mental hospital authority.  Many of them experience difficulty in regard to travelling expenses.  They find great difficulty to arrange to travel on public transport to get to see their relatives.  Very often, the only connection they have <Col N="1256" /> with the patient is through the members of the mental hospital authority.  I think it takes away from the dignity of the members that they do not know &mdash; and the Minister does not wish them to know &mdash; whether a patient who is a relative of one of their constituents is detained for a further period of six months and that they cannot be informed as well as the applicant who may not have an interest in the patient.</P>

      <P>(4)  Where a person is absent on parole under this section from an institution, his permission to be absent may be withdrawn, at any time before the expiration of the period during which he is permitted to be absent, by the person in charge of the institution, and, if the permission is so withdrawn, the person absent on parole may, at any time, within twenty-eight days after the withdrawal be re-taken in like manner as if he had escaped from such institution.</P>
      <P>These are the words which are important: &ldquo;In like manner as if he had escaped from such institution.&rdquo;  To my mind, it might be very important for the patient's well-being that he be re-taken in some other manner rather than if he escaped.  I am thinking of the effect on a patient if a junior official were in charge and he simply rang the Guards, or something like that, and said: &ldquo;Bring in so and so.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Section 23 does not authorise a particular person.  It merely provides that if a parole is given, that parole can be withdrawn.  It does not go beyond that and therefore the question of the particular official involved does not enter into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to private mental institutions, of course, the person in charge is the person for the time being managing the institution.  He may not necessarily be a doctor but he will have <Col N="1258" /> to act on the advice of a medical practitioner who will have to sign.</P>

      <P>This perhaps may cover to some extent the point made on Section 18 because it provides that <i>bona fide</i> applicants may be given information as to the detention of a patient in a mental hospital.  The information will relate to his detention; it will not give a right to information in relation to his condition.  But if a member of a mental hospital authority were to seek from the manager information as to whether such and such a person was detained, he would, assuming that the member had good reason for asking, let him know.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>To add to the end of the section the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) furnish a copy of the report of each such visit or inspection to every member of the local administrative authority where the visit or inspection concerns a mental hospital maintained by such authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the section which invests the Inspector of Mental Hospitals with powers somewhat similar to those which he had under Section 37 of the 1945 Act.  The Minister has indicated that, so far as one mental institution in this country is concerned, he was not responsible for the state of dilapidation and dereliction into which that institution has fallen.  I do not fully accept that to be so.  I think the Minister is responsible to Parliament, and to this House perhaps, for the operation and functioning of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and if <Col N="1259" /> the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, in a particular case, fails to report upon the condition of a building, the manner in which the institution is run, the condition in which the patients are kept and so forth, then I think the Minister must accept responsibility for these things not having been done properly.</P>
    <P>However, if the Minister does take the view that he is not wholly responsible for the condition in which mental hospitals are maintained and managed, then I think that, once we have mental hospital authorities in existence, we ought to supply them with the information which will enable them effectively to discharge their role and function as mental hospital authorities.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that in addition to the Inspector of Mental Hospitals furnishing the Minister with details in his report of each visit of inspection, he shall furnish it to the members of the mental hospital authority concerned with the institution.  I do not for a moment say that the particular wording of the amendment I have put down is as precise as might be necessary, but, as I said before, when I came to the House first, I paid particular attention to the drafting of amendments but very quickly realised that this was not necessarily a function of members of Parliament, that all that was necessary was the incorporation of a principle.  That is all that is being indicated in this amendment.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Health has no great view and no high opinion of members of local authorities. He gave expression to that in the debate on the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Bill.  He showed that he had nothing but the height of contempt for the deliberations of these local authorities.  That may be the Minister's view but it is not the view of the vast majority of the members of this House who are members of local authorities, nor is it the view of the public at large.  There is no doubt in my mind that the situation is frequently reached, both in relation to Government Departments and local <Col N="1260" /> authority departments, in which the private person, the citizen, can get no information that is satisfactory and the function of officials in many local authorities is conceived by them to be to give as little information as possible to people who are unquestionably entitled to it.  Hence it is that people like Senator Cole and others on local authorities form an invaluable link between persons detained in institutions, whether medical institutions, surgical hospitals or mental hospitals, and relatives outside.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is right and proper that in the interests of the persons detained in mental institutions, members of the mental health authorities should be given as much information as the Minister for Health sitting up in the Custom House, far removed from the realities of the situation, gets from the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  It seems to me to be an eminently sensible thing that the people on the spot who have immediate personal concern in the particular institution which they are charged to administer should be given the fullest possible information to be derived from the inspections and visits of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. Consequently, I strongly commend that this section be incorporated to provide that the reports of the inspector will be made available to the members of the mental hospital authorities.</P>
    <P>In doing that, no queer, strange or weird new principle is being established. It is doing in relation to local authorities what the Minister does in relation to Parliament.  The Minister is constantly answering questions in Parliament in relation to the functioning of his Department, and is constantly presenting to Parliament reports of every kind.  There does not seem to me to be any reason why a similar facility should not be given on a local level to the members of local authorities. I would urge the Minister to give serious consideration to the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal is unnecessary.  As any person who has any knowledge of the matter is <Col N="1261" /> aware, and as Senator Cole has told us, the members of every mental hospital committee make frequent inspections of the buildings and therefore there is nothing about the building and structure that they cannot see with their own eyes.  All the mental hospital authorities in the country are well aware of the defects in the existing institutions, and their difficulty has been to find the cash to cure them. That has been the great drawback.</P>
      <P>The fact that the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals would be made available, as it is presented to the Minister, to the members of the mental health authority, would not remedy that situation.  The only thing that can in any way improve the existing condition of these institutions is money, and if I may make bold to say so in front of Senator O'Quigley, I am the first Minister for Health for many years who has indicated that I am prepared to provide for the expenditure of up to one million pounds for the improvement of these mental institutions; and, as I mentioned when this Bill was being debated on Second Reading in the Seanad, it was at my insistence that the report from which Senator O'Quigley quoted at length was prepared.</P>
      <P>It was as a result of a report made to me by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in November, 1959, that I urged and ultimately persuaded the authority of the mental hospital concerned to appoint an architect to make a report upon the condition of the building. That was done at my urgent insistence, and, as I have said, the responsibility for the condition of that institution does not rest on me as the present Minister for Health, on whomsoever else that responsibility may be laid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, however, is not the point.  The point is whether it is necessary, in the first instance, that the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals made as a result of his visit should be submitted in full to each member of a mental hospital authority.  That is what Senator O'Quigley's amendment proposes.  That report is a very comprehensive one and in many instances deals with the condition of certain patients.  It would be <Col N="1262" /> a breach of medical secrecy to submit details of the condition of certain patients, and make them available quite unnecessarily, to members of the mental hospital authority.  What is done is that the reports are carefully considered in the Department by the Inspector in the first instance, then by those who are concerned with the maintenance of the fabric of the institutions and so on, and eventually a letter setting out all the matters which, in the Minister's view, require attention on the part of the mental health authority is issued to the mental hospital authority without any reference to particular patients or certain conditions.</P>
    <P>That is the right way to deal with it. It may happen that sometimes these communications from the Department may not be read or made available to all the members of the hospital authority, but if there is any member who does not get them, he has an easy remedy, because he can require the Manager to produce these communications. I suggest that there is no need for this amendment, and that we should not impose on the Minister or any officer of his Department an obligation which is unnecessary and which, in the circumstances as I have detailed them, would serve no useful purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that there are visiting committees of mental hospitals.  I take it that they go to visit the hospitals on certain dates that are prescribed.  The Inspector of Mental Hospitals can go in at any hour of the day or night he likes to inspect a mental hospital, and he may find quite a different state of affairs when he exercises his discretion and authority to go in at any time from what the members of the visiting committee may find on their set dates.  In any event, the Minister concedes that the most the visiting committee can know about is the physical state of the buildings, but there are other things the Inspector of Mental Hospitals has to be concerned with.  One is the condition of patients, and whether patients have been detained and whether their detention has been extended since the previous visit.  The Minister then says that we should not furnish details of that kind to the members of the local <Col N="1263" /> authorities because that would be a breach of medical secrecy.  I entirely agree with the Minister, but there are a whole lot of other useful things contained in the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals that would form valuable material and information for the members of mental hospital authorities. The Minister says that the only real cure for the condition of mental hospitals to-day is the provision of money, and I am glad to see to-day that the £500,000 which he undertook to supply the last day has gone up now to £1,000,000.</P>
      <P>It is all to the good that the Minister is providing that money but the Minister should be quite well aware that money is not everything when it comes to running an institution.  The best meat and the best food can be bought with the money provided by the local authorities.  That is not to say that the food will be served up palatably and properly to the patients. You may have lots of money and still have bad service and a bad return for it.  I would like the members of the visiting committee to know, at the various times when the hospital is visited and inspected, the dietary of the patients so that they would be able to tell the mental hospital committee that the food was well, badly or indifferently cooked, that there was too much monotony or sameness about the diet.  That is a valuable kind of information which involves no disclosure of medical secrets of any kind. Will the Minister tell us what is the objection to giving that information to a visiting committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other matters on which the Inspector of Mental Hospitals can report: whether the accommodation is suitable and adequate; whether the care and treatment provided for the patients is adequate; whether or not the facilities provided for occupational therapy are adequate and so on.  I suggest to the Minister that if a good deal more information of that kind were available to members of local authorities, and indeed to the public, mental hospitals would not be the dreadful places they appear to be to members of the public at present and <Col N="1264" /> this would be all part of the useful propaganda and information which could be disseminated about mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly clear that all the Minister wants is to have the semblance of local administration and to deprive the local administration of any substance and effectively to keep from the mental hospital authorities the real information that would assist them in the discharge of their duties as authorities.  He has given no reason, except that in regard to medical secrecy, which we all concede should be maintained, as to why this would not prove most valuable in the running of mental hospitals.</P>

      <P>That last statement of Senator O'Quigley is quite in keeping with his very adroit attempt to convey the impression that the Minister a few minutes ago was reading from a document which had not been properly proof-read.  I think the Senator is completely out in space orbiting around and getting lost in his own verbosity.  There is no attempt by the Minister or anybody else to deny local representatives any information to which they are duly and properly entitled.  As I said on the Second Stage, there is no reason in the world why the mental hospital committees themselves could not undertake quite an amount of the work which Senator O'Quigley suggests should be done by the Minister and by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I was a member of a visiting committee for some years.  I do not think members of mental hospital committees have changed in their outlook to a very great extent since I was on that committee. I can assure the Senator that we did not wait on any report from any inspector or Minister and we did not confine ourselves to the set days on which one may visit a mental hospital, <Col N="1265" /> according to Senator O'Quigley. We went to the hospital any time we felt like going to find out what was going on.  That I conceive to be the duty of any member of a visiting committee. We were not satisfied with anything we were given on a plate by the resident medical officer or anybody else.  We went around looking at the dining-rooms, the meals, the diet charts; we interviewed the nursing staff, and inspected the building, and did our best to make certain that nothing was going on within that building which was not in accordance with fair play and in the best interests of the patients in our charge.</P>
      <P>I cannot for the life of me see why Senator O'Quigley should have to rely, to the extent to which he apparently does, on reports of other people when there are committees whose duty it is to ensure, for instance, that the accommodation provided in the institution is adequate and suitable. Surely hospital committees should be aware of the type of accommodation provided and whether there is overcrowding. These committees are on the spot and are composed of commonsense men and women who can go around and see any defects which may have arisen.  Surely they have sufficient interest in the ratepayers' money, about which we hear so much talk, and the national finances, to insist that action is taken to correct any defects they may see.  I feel that too much of this mentality is growing up, this attitude of &ldquo;passing the buck&rdquo; and getting somebody else to do a job which the committees are quite capable of doing themselves.</P>

      <P>I have listened to this debate without intervening up to now.  I am a member of a local authority but not of a local hospital committee, although virtually I was one because I drove my father to the meetings of one such committee for ten years and I went around with him.  Senator O'Quigley has made a very valid case for the giving of certain information to members of mental hospital committees and even the entire authority, county council or whatever body is in charge of a mental hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> I can see the Minister's point about medical secrecy quite clearly.  Of course, he is right about that, but in regard to diets, conditions and everything else, as Senator O'Quigley said, it is quite right that the information contained in the Inspector's report should be given, if not to the entire local authority, certainly to the members of the mental hospital visiting committee.  That information might well be a spur to the local authorities to do more about their mental hospitals. That could be a good thing because on the day of the estimates we cut down the rates &mdash; that goes without saying &mdash; but if we do, we might have more regard for the needs of our mental hospitals if in fact we had before us the Inspector's report giving us the position in regard to certain services provided in the hospitals and could compare them with other hospitals.</P>
    <P>In my local authority, we have had a change of R.M.S.  We had two excellent men; the man who retired was an excellent man and the man who succeeded him was an excellent man.  He is reckoned one of the best R.M.S. in the country.  The difference in the approach of the two men was such that we on the local authority had to realign our thinking on St. Brigid's Hospital. Doctors differ and patients die. He started outdoor clinics and other things which were not done by the previous man and yet, in his way, the previous man was excellent.</P>
    <P>If the Inspector would draw attention even in a general way to what might be going on in various mental hospitals, he would prove a valuable asset to the local authority.  It would tend to raise the standard of service and of medicine in the different mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>A valid case was made by Senator O'Quigley, with the one reservation that medical secrecy should not be infringed. The Minister might reconsider the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady2" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a member of a mental hospital committee for about 33 years.  We are entitled to interview all of the patients and not on any one particular day.  They may <Col N="1267" /> visit the male side on one day and the female side on another day. Every question asked is answered by the doctor.  The report of the visiting committee goes back to the county council.  Is every member of the local authority not fully conversant, therefore, with what really happens.?</P>
      <P>We were very fortunate in Clare. We proceeded to remedy the position in Ennis where there was grave congestion. Thanks to the generosity of the Minister, to grants from the Hospitals Trust, and so on, we have excellent accommodation there now.  If other local authorities have failed to keep up with the times, they can blame themselves and not the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley spoke of the withholding of information.  I fail to see where any information is withheld. I agree with what he said about diet.  That can be remedied.  There was always plenty of food in the mental hospitals.  Perhaps there may be a defect in the cooking.  We appointed a dietician in Ennis years ago.  That was very satisfactory.  We followed it up with an appointment in the county hospital.  The diet is varied twice or three times a week. Without exaggeration, the diet served to the patients can compare more than favourably with the diet available in farmers' houses in County Clare.</P>
      <P>Everything is done to further mental treatment.  There are all kinds of amusements.  Pictures are shown twice weekly by the assistant mechanic. There are concerts and visits.  All patients are visited by the mental hospital committee.  The report comes up for review at the following meeting of the county council.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement that there must be absolute secrecy.  Painting and brightening up the hospital can be undertaken in sections over a period of years.  This subject should not be a political plaything.  We should have a deep reverence for it.  It is the duty of every person to do everything possible to improve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because we moved with the times, we now have no congestion in Ennis <Col N="1268" /> Mental Hospital.  We even have a beautiful new church there, situated in its own grounds, for the patients.  I remember when the church was in an old attic.  Local committees can do much to improve the conditions and amenities in mental hospitals.</P>

There is nothing wrong with that suggestion and there is nothing political about it. The fact that people make these suggestions is good.

Month after month, at the county council meeting the report is that the visiting committee visited St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee, on a certain day and found the wards, the dayrooms, and so on, in order.  This report is so identical month after month that it is now the subject of fun and witticism on the part of members of the county council who are not members of the mental hospital visiting committee.  I feel that those men who are doing a good job could be helped if they had further information as to the views of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and what changes he would like.  I am quite certain that those reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals would in almost every case be merely a substantiation <Col N="1269" /> of the views of the R.M.S., when he comes on estimates day to seek further amenities and further facilities for his patients.

      <P>I want to refer to Section 96 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945.  That Act has been in operation for only 16 years.  If Senator Brady and others will refer to Section 96, they will see the number of things you are entitled to inquire into is much smaller and a great deal less extensive than the number of things which the Inspector of Mental Hospitals is entitled, was entitled and will be entitled, under this new Section, to inquire into.  Consequently, if the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals is available, then the members of the mental hospital authorities will have a great deal more information than they are entitled to look for at the present time.  That is the first point.</P>
      <P>The second point is that the Inspector of Mental Hospitals, as I understand it, is a qualified medical practitioner. I am certain that, however experienced you may be and if you had all the experience in the world, you will not be able to say whether or not the care and treatment provided for the patients is adequate, if you are a member of a mental hospital visiting committee because you will not know, as you have not got the capacity to know, whether the treatment and care provided are adequate.  That is another of the things that can be obtained by a perusal of the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals. There are other things that it would take too long to enumerate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the things I suggest which should be made available to the visiting committee.  I have yet to learn any reason for withholding that kind of information from the members of a mental hospital authority.  Is there <Col N="1271" /> any reason why the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in relation to a mental hospital which says the treatment of this type of patient is obsolete, that such and such equipment ought to be installed and such a course of treatment provided should not be made available?  Is there any reason why that information should not be made available via the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to the members of the mental hospital committee? I do not see any reason.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the Dáil and in this House invited the assistance of both Houses in improving this Bill and making it a better Bill.  I firmly believe and I am convinced that the dissemination of more and more information of that kind, the awakening of consciousness, first of all, among public representatives and, thereafter, among the public at large, is one of the ways of advancing early mental treatment in this country.</P>
    <P>I believe, having grown up in the country, that there is no paper read so much and as widely as the local paper which gives an account of meetings of county councils, county committees of agriculture, mental hospital committees and so on.  The papers remain in the house for the whole week, whether it is winter or summer. Between showers of rain the farmers are looking out, as they frequently have to do, at their crops being destroyed and their tillage delayed, but they always read a few columns of the local paper.  It is the local paper and not the <i>Sunday Press,</i> the <i>Independent</i> or the <i>Times.</i></P>

      <P>That is my belief. That is where you get these reports. <Col N="1272" /> Reports of this kind are the most effective way of bringing home to the people the less certain aspects of mental treatment which people should be in possession of.  Members of local authorities do not want to increase rates to a higher degree than the public will tolerate.  The public will not tolerate high rates, unless there is good reason for them, but if they know that an increase in rates is wanted by the particular conditions in mental hospitals, then the members of the local authorities will be less reluctant to increase the rates than they would be if they felt there would be a public outcry against the increase.</P>

      <P>In order that members of the Seanad may not be under any misapprehension as to the powers of the visiting committee, I want to refer to some of the remarks made by Senator O'Quigley.  He has been at pains, on several occasions, this afternoon, to stress that he had available the Principal Act of 1945 and that he had read it with care.  He must not have a very retentive memory if he read it with care, not even in relation to Section 96, because he must have overlooked subsection (6) of that section, when he opened in support of his <Col N="1273" /> amendment.  He endeavoured to create the impression that the visiting committee could visit a mental hospital only on appointed days at appointed times.  But subsection (6) says that the visiting committee of a district mental hospital either acting collectively or by any two or more members shall be entitled at all times to visit the district mental hospital.  So that there is no question of just limiting the right of entry.  They may enter at any time, day or night, to visit and inspect a district mental hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator also endeavoured to convey the impression to the House that the powers of a visiting committee were limited by subsection (3) of Section 96.  He advised Senator Brady to read that section and said he would see that whatever authority a visiting committee had to investigate and inquire, it was strictly limited, he suggested, by paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of that subsection.  Now, I am sure that in the Senator's careful study of the Act of 1945, about which he has spoken to us on several occasions this evening, he did not overlook subsection (7) which empowers the Minister &mdash; at that time, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health &mdash; to make rules for and prescribe the duties of visiting committees of district mental hospitals.  Here are the rules made in 1946 and here are the duties.  I had better read them at length so that there may be no person who feels that this amendment should not be accepted, who will be under any misapprehension or will feel that he is, in any way, limiting the power of a visiting committee, to bring to the notice of the mental hospital authority constituting it, any defect or any deficiency which may exist in the institutions under its care.</P>
      <P>Here are the Rules as prescribed for the visiting committee:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following Rules shall apply to the visiting committee of a district mental hospital or other institution maintained by a mental hospital authority and to the visiting committees <Col N="1274" /> of an auxiliary mental hospital:</P>
    <P>(a)  The visiting committee or any two or more members thereof shall inspect the hospital or institution at least once in each month.</P>
    <P>It is obligatory on them to make that inspection.  The committee collectively or two or more members nominated by them may visit it at all times, but they are bound to visit the institution at least once a month.</P>
    <P>(b)  On the occasion of each visit of inspection to a hospital or an institution the visiting members of a visiting committee shall be accompanied on their visit by the chief medical officer of the institution or by an assistant medical officer acting on his behalf;</P>
    <P>for the purpose of answering any questions or answering any inquiries they may put to him as to the care and treatment of patients.</P>
    <P>(c)  on the occasion of each visit of inspection the visiting members of a visiting committee shall do the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  inspect the premises including the buildings, out-offices, yards and farm buildings;</P>
    <P>I do not think that their inspection could be more comprehensive than that.</P>
    <P>(ii)  inquire into the need for repairs to the buildings;</P>
    <P>(iii)  inspect the different wards and apartments and see whether cleanliness is observed therein;</P>
    <P>(iv)  inspect the furnishing of the different apartments in the buildings and inquire as to the state of repair of the furniture;</P>
    <P>(v)  examine the heating, ventilation, lighting, sanitation and water supply of the buildings and see whether any repairs or improvements are required;</P>
    <P>(vi)  inquire into the health and general condition of the patients;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> (vii)  make inquiries as regards the dietary of the patients;</P>
    <P>(viii)  make inquiries into and examine the occupations pursued by the patients and see whether any improvements can be suggested;</P>
    <P>(ix)  afford patients an opportunity of seeing them and making complaints if they desire to do so;</P>
    <P>(x)  inspect the work on the farms and in the gardens and ascertain whether any improvements can be effected;</P>
    <P>(xi)  enter in the visitors' book any remarks which they think proper in regard to the condition and management of the hospital or institution and the patients therein;</P>
    <P>(d)  within one week after a visit by the visiting members of a visiting committee to a hospital or institution the committee shall submit a report on the visit to the mental hospital authority.</P>
    <P>Could there be any more comprehensive inspection of an institution than that?  Could the Inspector of Mental Hospitals make any more comprehensive inspection?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>You certainly will have an opportunity of replying.  We have arrived at this, that the visiting committee have power to inspect and report upon everything which lay people are entitled to know in relation to these institutions.  Of course, the care and treatment of the inmates is a matter which should be treated with some care and confidence and should not be broadcast in reports to be published in the newspapers.  The visiting committee being fully empowered to make as searching a visit as any Inspector of Mental Hospitals or any other persons could make, there is no need to compel the duplicating of their report to the mental hospital authority.  There is nothing that the Inspector of Mental Hospitals or any other inspector visiting an institution could tell them that they cannot see for themselves and I am perfectly certain they do see for themselves.</P>
      <P>Let us remember that the people on these committees are acting out of a sense of public duty.  They are devoting their time to this gratuitously and voluntarily.  Therefore they must do it out of a sense of obligation to the inmates of the institutions which will, I am sure, at least move them to make certain that the institutions are properly maintained in so far as the finances of the local authority will permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What then, is the position of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals?  His purpose is to inspect these institutions on behalf of the Minister and to investigate one aspect of the institutions which a visiting committee is not competent to do, that is, the care and treatment given to the patients in them. In relation to that matter, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals must often refer to individual cases in his report to the Minister.  The report to the Minister is, like all other reports of this kind, a confidential document.  It is not a document which is ignored by the Minister.  It is very carefully studied and read by the Minister, and from that document, the Minister extracts and conveys to the mental hospital authority everything which he thinks they ought to know about the condition <Col N="1278" /> of their institution and about the care of their patients&mdash;everything which he feels at liberty to tell them, having regard to the fact that there is a certain secrecy and a certain reserve which must be maintained in relation to individual cases or to statements which might lead to the identification of particular patients.  That has been accepted even by Senator O'Quigley and Senator Donegan.  They have at once realised that it would not be possible to give the Inspector's report in full, even if it were otherwise desirable to do it.</P>
    <P>It is, however, neither desirable nor necessary to circulate to all the members of the health authority concerned the full report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals.  What is desirable and necessary is, as I have said, to extract from that report the particular matters which the local authority are competent to deal with and to which they should give care and attention, and that is what is done.  Having regard to the fact that the Inspector's report is indivisible, is one document, which covers ground which Senator Donegan and Senator O'Quigley have both agreed should be treated with reserve and should not form part of any report submitted to a mental hospital authority, I do not see how we could accept the amendment which Senator O'Quigley has moved and which he is now, I gather, withdrawing, but I think it should be on the records of the House that the Senator, in withdrawing this amendment, is not depriving local authorities of another opportunity of knowing everything that should be known about the institution by the members as lay members of that authority and that, therefore, nothing is lost by its withdrawal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must first address myself to the statement of the Minister as to what I said about the local authority of which I am a member.  If I had said what the Minister attributes to me, it would have been absurd. Here one is normally in very good humour, so we will take the Minister as being in his normal good humour, and will not take umbrage.  What I said was that the fact that the reports <Col N="1279" /> of the visiting committee were always identical was a subject of fun and witticism.  As a matter of fact, the members of the local authority say to the members of the visiting committee: &ldquo;Could you not make it a little different this month, because it is exactly the same report each month?&rdquo; That does not mean that there is a jibe or a jeer or anything else.  Fun and witticisms are very different from jibes and jeers.  I have only the highest opinion of the members of my local authority and of the members seconded to St. Brigid's Hospital visiting committee.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Minister to one particular point.  He asked me and Senator O'Quigley to name one thing which would be of use from the Inspector's report.  The Minister is quite aware that over the past five or ten years in no branch of medicine have there been such great strides as in the care of mental health, and the use of new drugs, largely tranquillisers, has meant that many mental patients could leave the mental homes and go home to live a normal life, merely attending a weekly clinic run by the R.M.S. or some other member of the staff skilled in the use of tranquillisers who prescribes for them and provides the new drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a mental hospital were lagging behind the other mental hospitals in the country and the use of these new drugs, and that was in the inspector's report, that is a matter which should be considered at the meeting of the County Council or the mental hospital visiting committee and set to rights.  That is no criticism of our R.M.S. or the past R.M.S.  Everything in our case has been excellent, but there are 20 or 25 mental hospitals in this country and in the nature of things, it is just impossible that they would all step abreast.  If there is a mental hospital which is not using these new drugs, which has not increased the use of these new techniques to the extent to which the rest have, that is valid subject matter for the mental hospital committee&mdash;the members of which, after all, are the people to whom the care of the patient is given&mdash;to discuss and to do something <Col N="1280" /> about.  That is a matter which does not involve any question of medical secrecy and so it is necessary that the Inspector's report should be available.</P>
    <P>The list of rules read out by the Minister makes it quite clear that as well as inquiries into the general health of patients and the diet provided, the other main duties of the visiting committee are to examine the buildings, sanitation and so on.  Now, the members of the visiting committee visit only one mental hospital and therefore as far as they are concerned, by their standards, the matters they are instructed to inspect may be all right but the Inspector who has the advantage of examining every mental hospital may have something else to say in regard to the sanitation, or sleeping accommodation or in regard to the diet and all other matters they have in their charge. Therefore, the second opinion of somebody who not only inspects that hospital but every mental hospital in the country is of value.  On those two points, I would recommend to the Minister that the amendment is certainly worth considering.</P>

      <P>I have been a member of the Louth mental hospital committee and I cannot allow this to pass without expressing my view, particularly in regard to the attitude of Senator Donegan.  We have some 400 patients in the Louth mental hospital and I can say without fear of contradiction that it is examined each month the committee meets and there is not a department in the hospital that we do not visit on those occasions.  Perhaps Senator Donegan will tell me <Col N="1282" /> where he got his information about the way the Louth county committee furnishes their report to the county council once a month?  Do they or do they not?  I am asking the Senator a question, through the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well able to make my case without the assistance of Senator Carter.  I said I agreed with the Minister that there was a limit to the competency of local authorities and I still agree with the Minister on that. It is reasonable that no visiting committee of laymen is able to ascertain, on the occasion of their monthly visits, whether or not the care and treatment provided for the patients is adequate.  I think the Minister will agree that that is so&mdash;or whether or not the accommodation provided in the institution is adequate and suitable. They will not see whether the facilities for occupational therapy are adequate. That does not seem to be a matter on which the visiting committee is able to express a worthwhile opinion, or whether or not the diet is adequate. They can see whether a man got a sufficient amount of what he is having when they go in, but they may not be able to say whether it is suitable for different types of patients in the hospital. That is a matter for medical people, not for the visiting committee.</P>
      <P>To say whether the classification of the patients is carried out presupposes a knowledge of the different types of patients who should be classified and they cannot know&mdash;unless they know the different types of patients who should be classified&mdash;unless they have the prior information.  All that information can readily be supplied by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in his report.  There is nothing secret about that and nothing need be contained in a report of that kind which will identify any patient to members of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> The Inspector of Mental Hospitals is also charged to ascertain whether or not due regard is being had in the management of the institution to the provisions of this Act.  I do not think the Minister for Health suggested that the visiting committee of a mental hospital would know all the regulations under this Act and all the provisions of this Act and could say in relation to a mental hospital: &ldquo;Yes, we are satisfied&rdquo;&mdash;or &ldquo;We are not satisfied the provisions of this Act and the regulations made thereunder are being carried out.&rdquo;  In this amendment, we are asking that the members of the local authority be given all the information contained in paragraphs (c) to the end, excluding anything touching upon medical secrecy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>If the Minister is prepared to allow the Inspector of Mental Hospitals to furnish the matters referred to in paragraph (c) to the end, excluding anything touching upon medical secrecy, we can have that on Report Stage.  The Minister is not prepared to do that and he makes a debating point.  He is not correct in saying that the members of local authorities or the visiting committee have access to as much information as the Inspector of Mental Hospitals can provide in the report.  They are not in possession of that information.  The sole reason the Minister has not yet disclosed it is that he does not want to put the members of local authorities in possession of that information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that that was a most unworthy statement, even from Senator O'Quigley. Apparently there is a division of opinion between Senator Donegan and Senator O'Quigley as to what this amendment is intended to achieve. Senator O'Quigley said there was no virtue in having any reference to the methods of treatment submitted to the local authority.  Senator Donegan thinks the main use of this amendment is that there would be a report by the Inspector of Mental Hospitals <Col N="1285" /> on the treatments carried out in mental institutions by their chief medical officer.  I assume that if the report is of any use it will be discussed by the local authority.  The purpose apparently Senator Donegan sees would be accomplished if this amendment were accepted would be that anything the Inspector of Mental Hospitals might wish to say about the professional procedures, the specialist procedures, followed in these institutions would be discussed by a body of laymen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understood Senator Donegan to say and that is what Senator O'Quigley told us might be achieved as a sort of by-product of the report.  He was not as forthright about it as Senator Donegan who seemed to see as its chief merit the idea that a body of laymen would have an opportunity of discussing the professional procedures adopted and pursued in the local mental hospital.</P>
      <P>Could anybody think of anything less acceptable to public opinion than that?  If I were to accept an amendment carrying that implication, as it does&mdash;what Senator Donegan thinks would be the result of the amendment is now on record&mdash;what then would be the position?  Would it not be that I have a super-specialists or maybe two super-specialists in the Department of Health whose duty it is to regiment and discipline in relation to the treatment of their patients the chief medical officers of all the mental hospitals in Ireland?  Then I should certainly be told I was dragooning the profession.  Then we would hear a lot about State medicine and State interference in this most delicate matter.  Yet, that is what Senator Donegan wants me to agree to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see any merit in that.  I certainly can see a great many objections from the point of view of the general public, of the <Col N="1286" /> medical profession and, most of all, from the point of view of the patients and their friends.  Are we to have these questions debated in public? Think of the uneasiness you would cause to every relative of a patient in the local mental hospital if there were any question as to the wisdom or otherwise of certain treatments which were being pursued in the mental hospitals.  The whole thing is ridiculous.</P>
      <P>The reports which the Inspector of Mental Hospitals makes are to enable the Minister to satisfy himself as to whether these institutions are properly run.  They can contain a great deal of matter which it would not be fitting should be published.  Anything which is relevant to the management of the institution, anything which is relevant to the physical care of the patients is communicated without fail by the Minister in due course to the mental hospital authority concerned.  That is as far as anybody would want us to go.</P>
      <P>If there is any suggestion that the chief medical officer is not doing his duty, is not discharging his functions properly, the matters on which he is supposed to have failed are drawn to his attention and he is asked to say why he has not done such and such a thing.  However, we do not say &ldquo;How is it you have not tried this or that treatment on particular classes of patients?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley spoke, I think, without full thought and without knowledge about the classification of patients.  If the Senator will read the report of the recent Royal Commission in Great Britain on that matter he will see what delicate and difficult grounds a local authority would be entering upon if it had the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in which the subject of classification of patients in an institution were dealt with.  Then he would realise how utterly impossible it would be to submit the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals covering all the matters detailed in this section to the members of a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator will have to be satisfied <Col N="1287" /> with the assurance I have given that all my predecessors and myself and, I am certain, my successors, will always convey to the local authorities all the matters in the report relating to the proper discharge of their functions by them and their officers with which they are competent to deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>We had some talk earlier about printing.  The Minister has great feeling for language.  At all times, he is anxious and careful to express himself with the utmost felicity from the point of view of language, whatever about sweetness of content at times.  I trust it will not be amiss to point out to the Minister that Section 33, subparagraph (f) does not make sense as it stands.  The section being amended is Section 237 of the 1945 Act which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>When making a visit and inspection of a mental institution required by this Act, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals shall...</P>
      <P>and then follow subparagraphs (b), (c), (d), (e).  Then we come to this in the Bill:</P>
      <P>When making a visit and inspection of a mental institution required by this Act, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals shall include...</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would agree that there are occasions when it is desirable for a member of the House to have regard to the originals as enacted by the Oireachtas and published with the authority of the Government by the Stationery Office.  That evidently is one of the misprints, errors of the draftsmen, slips or whatever you like to call them to which I referred earlier this evening.  It is quite clear that it does not make sense at the present time and that the Bill would have to be amended.  I regret to say that I did not observe this slip in time; otherwise I should have put down an amendment.  I have no doubt the matter can be dealt with on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Bank Bill is an amending Bill dealing with superannuation.  When the Act was passed in 1942, the superannuation scheme included at that time was not capable of being amended. The aim of this Bill is, in the first place, to give the board of the central bank power to amend the scheme set out in Section 2.  It then goes on to limit their power of amendment.  The scheme can be amended to deal with a chairman who has been in the Civil Service.  It gives them power to aggregate the service of the particular person in the Civil Service and as chairman of the central bank.  The amendment of the scheme can be retrospective to 1st December, 1960, and it lays down that rules of superannuation in the Civil Service will apply to the governor of the central bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not apply beyond 1st December. It applies to the person who was <Col N="1290" /> governor of the bank at that time or since.  When this scheme comes into effect, no pension will be payable to him from the exchequer as a civil servant. He will be paid by the central bank.  If it should happen that he has received any amount by way of pension from the Civil Service from 1st December until the scheme is made, then that amount will be taken into account.  In other words, it will be deducted from the amount which would be due to him if the scheme had applied from 1st December.  That is the scheme visualised under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The same procedure has been adopted with the chairman of other State companies: the chairman of the E.S.B. and the chairman of C.I.E.  It has been thought well to follow the same pattern here.  I want to make it clear to Senators that if the Bill is passed and the scheme is made as outlined here, then the central bank will be responsible for the chairman's pension.  He will receive his whole pension from Central Bank funds and will not receive anything from the civil service.  That is what has applied already to the chairman of the E.S.B. and the chairman of C.I.E.  I ask the Seanad to adopt this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly most astounding that the first amendment of the Central Bank Act passed in 1942 should be in the nature of a pensions Bill for one or two people.  The long title to the Bill is one of the most extraordinary ever put on any Bill coming before either House of the Oireachtas:</P>
      <P>An Act to enable the scheme made pursuant to paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of Section 33 of the Central Bank Act, 1942, to be amended.</P>
      <P>That certainly is guaranteed to limit discussion on the Bill.  If it had been introduced simply as a Bill to amend the Central Bank Act of 1942, we might have had a much more interesting discussion, but, even as it is, I think one can say one or two things about the Bill it self.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely objectionable that Parliament should be asked to pass legislation to benefit one or two people and I would quote to the House the <Col N="1291" /> case in Britain of a proposal that Lady Louis Mountbatten should receive a part of her own money, money that had been entailed, a huge sum of money which she had been left by her grand-father's will, because she felt she could not live on the income.  The British Houses of Parliament rose up in their wrath and threw it out.  They said: &ldquo;If this kind of legislation is brought in, we have no objection if it has a general application.&rdquo;  They threw the Bill out and, in my opinion, they were right.</P>
    <P>Let us just think of the equities of this matter.  The Minister refers to people with long periods of service in the Civil Service.  They could get their Civil Service pension under the 1914 Act, but of course the purpose of this Bill is to increase the pensions that are probably due to one or two people. Let me make myself clear.  If the Central Bank wants to pay its Governor&mdash;the Chairman of its board of directors&mdash;a big salary, as is paid to such people in other countries, I have no objection at all, none whatsoever. They can pay their chairman, so far as I am concerned, £24,000 a year, if I mention a figure that has created a good deal of discussion across the Irish Sea.  I think this Bill is the wrong way to tackle this problem and it is no use for the Minister to come in here and quote for us two other cases.</P>
    <P>I ought to say that were it not that the name of a particular man was mentioned in the E.S.B.  Act we passed, I certainly would have made the same objection as I have made here tonight. But I think that is more objectionable &mdash;that a particular person should have provision made by legislation for a pension when the General Services conditions apply to him.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Minister's brief, and particularly in the brief he read out in the Dáil, as reported at column 146, to the Act of 1914.  Of course, one of the difficulties about the Act of 1914 is that its administration has not been uniform at all.  At one period of its years, one form of administration has obtained; in another period of years, a different kind of administration has obtained and instead of having it liberalised, as <Col N="1292" /> other forms of legislation are, it has not been liberalised.  It has been restricted.</P>
    <P>Now, the result is, of course, that the Act of 1914 is almost, to all intents and purposes, a dead letter.  It has been so restricted that its original purpose is lost.  The fact is that, if the Act of 1914 had been properly administered, the plain meaning of the Act would have been applied, but it was not so applied.</P>
    <P>There is another objection to this legislation, that is, that it is retrospective.</P>
    <P>We all know that retrospective legislation is extremely objectionable. There is nobody but will agree with me that the Superannuation Acts require amendment in relation to much more serious matters than are covered in this piece of legislation and therefore I am opposed to the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in nothing more does the stern stuff of which a Minister for Finance is made dissolve into a flood of sympathy and compassion than in relation to superannuation. The Minister for Finance has the duty of providing for the payment of superannuation to a wide variety of people and I think that a Minister for Finance does not, at all times, give himself the opportunity of allowing his humanity to remain manifest itself as perhaps he, himself&mdash;and certainly the recipients of superannuation&mdash;would like.  For that reason, I have the view with regard to this Bill that it is a great pity it does not embrace a great many more people than, apparently, the one or two people it is intended to cover.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to the inadvisability of having legislation enacted to provide pensions out of public funds for one or two people.  It strikes me as extremely odd that an Act, in 1942, was so haphazardly framed and drafted without the assistance of people like Senator O'Donovan and myself.  This legislation is brought about by the lack of foresight on the part of those who were, at that time, responsible for the enactment of the Central Bank Act of 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> Presumably, the Currency Commission of the day was consulted with regard to the many provisions of the Central Bank Act of 1942 and it speaks for their disinterestedness and self-effacement that they paid so little attention to the superannuation provisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that this piece of legislation is retrospective to 1st of December, 1960.  I am beginning to wonder where do we stand in regard to the pronouncements made by various Ministers in this House. This evening we had the Minister for Health terrorising us, almost, into enacting the Mental Treatment Bill of 1960, because, he said, if it were not enacted before Easter, the superannuation provisions would not come into operation on 1st April.</P>
    <P>I venture to suggest that there was nothing that Parliament could do in relation to the superannuation provisions coming into operation on 1st of April, 1961.  The Minister for Health was not having any of that kind of legislation; but here we have set down by the authority on super-annuation&mdash;the Minister for Finance &mdash;that legislation can be enacted with retrospective effect in relation to superannuation.  On the other hand, the Minister for Health tells us it would be gravely wrong, a very undesirable thing, for anyone who had any mind to do so, to oppose the Mental Treatment Bill: that in the interests of people retiring they should be in favour of the early passage of the Bill, from the point of view of facilitating senior members of the Civil Service taking up employment outside the Civil Service, and there should be no discouragement by reason of the inadequacy of the superannuation provisions of people from taking up such employment.  Apart from the wide experience they have and the great knowledge they can bring to bear in their outside employment, these outside employments for higher civil servants are very desirable for a variety of reasons into which it is not necessary to go.</P>
    <P>Consequently, it is regrettable that those responsible for this Bill did not, <Col N="1294" /> long ago, have the foresight to see that it would be necessary and did not bring it in, in anticipation of its application to specified individuals.  If that had been done, I think one would not have the misgivings one must have about special legislation to provide pensions for lone individuals.  I trust that, when this Bill is passed, it will have been passed in such a way that it will not require further amendment.</P>
    <P>It does strike me, however, that subsection (3) of Section 2, as it stands, is not adequate and will require further amendment in this House.  It is provided in the first part of the section that the scheme may be amended and it provides that every amendment shall be effected by means of an amending scheme.  Then it goes on to say &ldquo;every scheme under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Every scheme&rdquo;, to my mind, does not include an amending scheme.</P>
    <P>We had a difficulty like that in the Electricity Supply Board Bill recently which the Minister for Transport and Power said, if my recollection is correct, warranted amendment, and had to be amended to make it clear that amending schemes as well as the original scheme would be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  I have not had an opportunity of looking up the provisions of the Electricity Supply Bill, but I believe it might well be worth looking into to ensure that this Bill will not have to be further amended in a few months' time to give proper authority and validity to any amendment of the existing scheme that might be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is of general application, of course in a small way, to all chairmen of the Central Bank, and for that reason it would be wrong to name a person at this juncture because it will apply to future chairmen as well.  There are certain defects in the present system.  If a man becomes chairman of the Central Bank and leaves the Civil Service before he is 60, he does not carry his pension rights with him.  Another difficulty is that if <Col N="1295" /> he dies within five years of becoming chairman, then he gets no death gratuity. There is therefore necessity to amend the scheme laid down in the Central Bank Act to the extent at least to which we are doing it now.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, technically speaking, an element of retrospection in this Bill, but it is the type of retrospection which we get in many Bills. Many a Bill is brought in relating to superannuation and other matters which dates back the superannuation to the first of the year.  In the past two years, for instance, I brought pensions Bills before the Seanad in respect of the Civil Service.  I think that each time I brought the Bill here around the month of August but the pension dated back to the first of April, so it is not unusual and nobody objects to retrospection where we are giving benefits.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be educated in good sense by the Senator. With regard to the application of the 1914 Act, some Senators might consider that it is not as liberal as it should be, that it was restricted.  My experience has been that it has been applied wherever it was considered right and just that it should be applied, and more and more as the years went on.  It has been, therefore, liberalised as the years went on, contrary to what Senator O'Donovan said.</P>

    <Title>Central Fund Bill, 1961&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary function of the Central Fund Bill is to give statutory effect to <Col N="1300" /> the Vote on Account for 1961/62 recently passed by Dáil Éireann.  Section 3 of the Bill accordingly authorises the issue of £43,532,880 out of the Central Fund.  Section 2 makes a similar provision in respect of the current financial year to cover the issue of £5,845,885.  This sum is the total of the 1960/61 Supplementary Estimates not covered by the Appropriation Act, 1960, but passed in time to be included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 1 provides for the issue of £6,937 out of the Central Fund for the service of the financial year 1959/60. This sum represents the amount of the Excess Vote for External Affairs agreed by the Dáil on 23rd February last. Finally, Section 4 empowers the Minister for Finance to borrow up to £49,385,702, which is the total of the foregoing three sums.</P>
      <P>The total estimated expenditure for 1961/62 is £131,715,000 which represents an increase of £8,255,000 on the original estimate for the current financial year.  Non-capital items account for £4,861,000 of this increase and voted capital services for the balance of £3,394,000.  If, however, allowance is made for this year's Supplementary Estimates which totalled £7,894,000 the total increase is reduced to £361,000, capital services being up by £866,000 and non-capital services down by £505,000.</P>
      <P>Senators have been supplied with the usual summary of increases and decreases for the individual Supply Services as compared with the original 1960/61 Estimates so that I need outline only the major variations arising in 1961/62.  These main changes occur in respect of agriculture, social insurance, social assistance and remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the Vote for Agriculture, we find that the provision of £16,145,000 exceeds the current year's original Estimate by £3,895,000, but this changes to a decrease of £752,000 when account is taken of the recent Supplementary Estimate.  The most important project in this Vote is, of course, the Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Scheme, the cost of which is expected to exceed the revised Estimate <Col N="1301" /> for 1960/61 by £568,000.  Increased requirements for headage grants and herd bonus payments in the Southern Counties, for the guarantee payments for fat cattle and carcase beef exports, and for fees to private veterinary practitioners for herd tests, together with an anticipated reduction in receipts from sales of slaughtered animals, are the main causes of the additional net expenditure in 1961/62.</P>
    <P>Next in order of magnitude is the provision of £3,060,000 for lime and fertilisers subsidies.  This includes £430,000 for the new subsidy on potassic fertilisers which exceeds by £230,000 the amount shown in the recent Supplementary Estimate so as to allow for a substantial rise in the use of potash. There is also an additional £150,000 for phosphatic fertilisers to meet anticipated increase in demand.</P>
    <P>A provision of £1 million has been made for the marketing of dairy produce in the coming year as against this year's revised estimate of £2,350,000. Of the requirements for 1961/62, £500,000 consists of a grant to An Bord Bainne towards such losses as may be incurred, or subsidies granted, by the Board in relation to the export of milk products The remaining £500,000 represents the anticipated liability of the Exchequer for butter losses and other dairy produce subsidies until the establishment of An Bord Bainne in mid-May.  The £300,000 being set aside for losses on the disposal of wheat represents the recoupment to An Bord Gráin during 1961/62 in respect of losses arising from the purchase and resale of the 1960 crop.  This year's Supplementary Estimate has already provided £800,000 towards such losses.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for Social Insurance and Social Assistance are affected by a transfer of a number of non-contributory old age pensioners to the contributory scheme established under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960.  Mainly as a result of this, Social Insurance shows an increase of £2,103,000 whereas the subhead for old age pensions in the Vote for Social Assistance is reduced by £2,300,000.  A reduction of £115,000 also occurs in the Social Assistance Vote because <Col N="1302" /> of an anticipated fall in the number of applicants for Unemployment Assistance.</P>
    <P>The main increases in remuneration will have to be borne by the Votes I am now going to mention.</P>

    <P>Practically all of the additional requirement of £678,000 for the Garda Síochána results from the Arbitration award increasing the pay of the Force with effect from 1 March, 1960, and from a recent conciliation settlement substituting a pensionable element in pay for rent allowances.  The cessation of the former rent allowances brings about an offsetting saving of £168,000 under the head of Allowances.</P>
    <P>Heavier telephone traffic and a larger scale of telephone maintenance and renewals necessitate extra staff for which an additional £197,000 is provided in the Posts and Telegraphs Vote.  Primary Education bears an increase of £237,000 in respect of National Teachers in classification schools and grants to capitation national schools.  This reflects the larger number of teachers and improvements effected in the appointment and retention averages for assistants.  Because of the continued growth in the number of pupils and teachers, the Votes for Secondary Education and Technical Instruction are increased by £179,000 and £180,000 respectively.  The additional requirement for Secondary Education arises under the head of incremental salary grant, while the larger grants to Vocational Education Committees <Col N="1303" /> also contain a substantial additional element in respect of remuneration.</P>
    <P>Improved emoluments for officers and men of the Army, including the introduction of children's allowances for officers, account for an additional charge of £221,000 for pay and marriage allowances in the Estimate for Defence.</P>
    <P>Pay increases also contribute to the rise of £230,000 shown in respect of grants to health authorities.</P>
    <P>As the cost of superannuation depends to a large extent on levels of remuneration it is scarcely surprising that pensions show a similar upward trend reflected mainly in the following Votes:</P>

    <P>To these extra commitments is added a cumulative increase of £116,000 covering compensation to staff of Córas Iompair Éireann who have become redundant as a result of internal reorganisation.</P>
    <P>As most of the other major items to which I have not referred consist of capital services to be reviewed shortly in the next Progress Report on the Programme for Economic Expansion, I propose merely to mention them at this stage.  More is being provided to enable An Foras Tionscal to perform their functions in relation to industrial development both inside and outside the undeveloped areas and to assist the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited in the promotion of industrial and commercial enterprises.  Under the head of tourism, schemes for the development of major resorts and holiday accommodation qualify for grants on a larger scale.  Building and construction, including housing, harbours and airports, as well as drainage and rural electrification, will also require more, as will also the development of the telephone system, but this will be offset by substantially increased appropriations-in-aid from <Col N="1304" /> the Telephone Capital Account.  In the Votes for Forestry and Transport and Power there will be additional revenue from sales of timber and landing fees.</P>
    <P>In framing the supply services of the past few years, I have endeavoured to strike a proper balance between productive projects and services of a welfare or redistributive character. Economic expansion has been served and the long-term interests of the community generally fostered by the additional outlay on agriculture, industry and education at all levels. Heavier expenditure on the postal and telephone services has shown a return in the form of larger revenue.  Social services have been considerably improved, enabling those dependent on them to share in the benefits of general economic development.  At the same time it has been found possible to increase the remuneration for the Army, Gardaí, teachers and other public servants following recommendations of conciliation councils and arbitration boards in the light of trends in outside employment and in the national income.  That the Exchequer has so far been able to bear these additional charges without undue strain indicates the growing strength of the national economy.</P>
    <P>Having outlined and justified the main changes in the Estimates for the coming year, I now seek the Seanad's approval for the Central Fund Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not want to blame the Minister for the nature of his brief.  At the end of the brief, he attempted to put some kind of life into it.  I heard it suggested in the lobbies that the nature of the debate in the other House was set by the form of his brief.  The Minister complained about the tone of the debate when he was concluding but it is an annual complaint.  If his brief had more life in it, the debate would have been different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we get rid of all the verbiage about capital expenditure and this expenditure and that expenditure and get down to reality, we find that, contrary to my hopes which I expressed <Col N="1305" /> here when the Minister first came into office, he has been no better from the point of view of expenditure than his predecessor of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The expenditure for his first year in office, 1957-58, when he still had a little of the food subsidies to meet was £111½ million.  The expenditure he proposes for the coming year is £132 million.  You could add to that the £9 million subsidies that are not paid.  So, in fact, expenditure in 1956-57 when there were £9 million for food subsidies was about £100 million.  Now expenditure has gone up to £132 million.  In four years, the Minister has increased expenditure on the Estimates for Public Services by £32 million, not taking into account the inevitable Supplementary Estimates we shall have in the course of the coming year.</P>
    <P>As usual, I want to get away to some extent from the mere figures in this matter.  I remember, in 1952, a well-known politician saying to the people: &ldquo;Pay your way.&rdquo;  What he really meant was: &ldquo;Pay our way.&rdquo; Again, in 1956, he said: &ldquo;Do not eat the seed potatoes.&rdquo;  We are not now just eating the seed potatoes.  We are eating a chunk of next year's potato crop as well.  I shall demonstrate that later.  We are committing ourselves to the money changers for a large chunk of next year's national income.</P>
    <P>When winding up the debate in the Dáil, the Minister did not seem to be in his usual felicitous humour.  I thought one of his less felicitous remarks was that when he came into office, he did not know what the position was.  Later, at rather more length, he made another remark of a somewhat similar kind.  Either the Minister was being disingenuous or if he knew he would be Minister for Finance, he had not made much preparation for taking over his office.</P>
    <P>A famous politician said: &ldquo;We must see what is in the cupboard.&rdquo;  That type of financial baby talk is not good enough for serious political discussion. When the Minister got into the cupboard on the day he went into office he found £5 million in cash out of the <Col N="1306" /> premium bonds.  Instead of expressing any appreciation, he said, as reported at column 675 of Volume 187 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann:</P>
    <P>There was not a shilling credit to be got by anybody.  People had been thrown out of work because the banks would not give the industries and other enterprises money with which to carry on.  Everything was in a desperate mess when we came into power in 1957.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everything was in a desperate mess.&rdquo; Yet he found £5 million in cash on his desk the first morning he went into office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is exactly four years since the Minister took office.  What is the position now?  A few people are going around the country saying: &ldquo;Everything in the garden is rosy.&rdquo;  I notice the chairman of the commercial banks this year, imitating the Central Bank last year, had not a word to say.  I have a few words to say.  The Central Bank in its quarterly bulletin, having had nothing to say for itself for ages, suddenly came out in the last number with practically a blank page except for figures in the middle of the blank page. The figures were something like the following: At the end of 1956, the total hire purchase debt in this country was £10 million.  I remember the end of the year 1955 when the hire purchase debt was £11 million.  I got sick listening to the squawks from the bankers about the extent of this disgraceful thing.  I heard about it until my eardrums were deafened.  Of course, it has become all right since then.  The commercial banks have gone into it themselves, you know.  At the end of 1957, the hire purchase debt was £11 million, an increase of £1 million; at the end of 1958, it was £14 million, an increase of £3 million over the year 1957; at the end of 1959, it was £19 <Col N="1307" /> million, an increase of £5 million on the year 1958.</P>
    <P>I have not got the figures for the end of the year 1960 but the Central Bank bulletin gave the figures for September of £25 million.  You can add £2 million to this for the other months of the year.  At the end of 1960, it was £27 million.</P>

      <P>It is an easy way to increase the national income.  What interests me in regard to that set of figures is the geometric progression.  It is not arithmetic progression; it is geometric progression.  In 1956-57, there was an increase of £1 million; in 1957-58, there was an increase of £3 million; in 1958-59, the increase was £5 million; and in 1959-60, there was an increase of £8 million.</P>
      <P>A somewhat similar pattern of progression is shown in relation to bank advances.  They went down £5 million in 1956.  These are bank advances within the State to our own people by the Irish banks.  They went up by £5 million in 1957.  There was no change in 1958.  They went up by £12 million approximately in 1959 and they went up by £17 million in 1960.</P>
      <P>If the inter-Party Government were in office and these figures came out, I can see the then Taoiseach and Deputy MacEntee saying: &ldquo;This is dangerous ground; this is a dangerous position.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>As if they were passing a graveyard.  Let us take the past two years alone.  There is an increase in bank advances of £29 million and an increase in hire purchase debt of £13 million&mdash;a total of £42 million.  The Minister had something to say at the end of his speech&mdash; I will come back to it in detail later; I propose to analyse it word for word about what Deputy Dillon said in the other House on this matter.  The Minister or anybody else can say that the bank advances are not directly reflected in the national income.  The operative words there are &ldquo;directly <Col N="1308" /> reflected&rdquo; but not even the Minister would have the hardihood to deny that the hire purchase debt is directly reflected in the national income.</P>
      <P>I could make a further analysis of the general position of the Irish banks but I want to take the overall figures. This is the position by analysis as I see it, taking the figures as they appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> a few weeks ago.  Before the war, the total advances, as a percentage of total deposits and similar accounts, was about 48 per cent.  At the end of 1945 &mdash;the end of the war&mdash;they were 26 per cent.  We could not import anything during the war.  There was, therefore, a great deal of money.  If my recollection is right, the figure in regard to deposits was £319 million. The advances were only something like £79 million or £80 million.  At the end of 1951&mdash;this was the time we heard the first very big squawk&mdash;they were 48 per cent.</P>
      <P>That was followed, as everybody knows, by a credit squeeze in the autumn of 1952.  In 1955, they reached 49 per cent of deposits, still just under 50 per cent.  That was followed, as everybody also knows, by a credit squeeze in the autumn of 1956.</P>

      <P>I intend to say something upon the subject in relation to which the Senator has asked me a question.  Let us take one section of the advances.  Indeed, I was one of the people&mdash;and it is only fair that I should say so&mdash;who advocated strongly an increase of capital for farmers.  An amount has now been provided by the banks, which is very substantial.  The Minister reminded us of it last year. Instead of depending on the Agricultural Credit Corporation, I gathered from him that the Government had more or less arranged that the commercial banks would look after the farmer.  Indeed, they have, as far as credit is concerned.  The figure is up from under £20 million to over £30 million in two years.</P>
      <P>How much of it went into genuine production?  I want to say that I am extremely doubtful about the suitability of commercial bank credit for agricultural purposes.  But one must give credit where it is due.  I think the new Chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation has put some life into that organisation.  I believe that the bank advances to the farmers consisted in part of using up next year's income, that is to say, in this context, using up the rise in the price of cattle which I am glad to see has come about. Everybody in the community is pleased about it.</P>

    <P>About a fortnight or three weeks ago, the managing director of one of the banks went down to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and addressed the assembled merchants of Dublin. He made two or three major points that were not very advanced banking. He said that the bulk of their deposits were, in fact, payable on demand. When I saw that in the newspapers, I <Col N="1310" /> said this was a fair warning to the merchants of Dublin that the Ice Age was about to descend upon them again&mdash;probably when the election is over.</P>

      <P>Senator Lenihan, who is a lawyer.  Perhaps the most important statement apart from the <Col N="1311" /> general tenor of the Minister's rather jaundiced remarks came at the very end of his speech when he made what was intended, I take it, to be a serious point&mdash;or intended to appear to be a serious point.  Personally, I think the Minister was being disingenuous.  I am not sure that he was.  Possibly he may not have thought about it, or possibly indeed he may have been displaying the same lack of capacity to consider the matter, to which he referred earlier, which prevented him from knowing what the position was before he became Minister: &ldquo;I want to say that Deputy Dillon seems to have some misapprehension regarding the nature of the national income.  If Deputy Dillon looked at the headings of these statistics...&rdquo; and here, I take it, the Minister held up a copy of the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>&mdash;&ldquo;he would see that the national income is defined as the total of all payments for productive services accruing to the permanent residents of this country.  All wages come into it and all profits, salaries and so on, and farm income comes into this item.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the point I want to make: &ldquo;Deputy Dillon thought it might have been swollen by our borrowing.  It is not true that credit would come into it. Just as a man makes up his own accounts at the end of the year, he does not take in any credit he got as an asset.  Neither is it taken into the national income.&rdquo;  The man does because he has it as a tractor on his farm or he has a debit in his bank account when he adds it up.  A key statement is the simple sentence by the Minister&mdash;and I love simple things: &ldquo;It is not true that credit would come into it.&rdquo;  I do not think the Minister would repeat that here today&mdash;I do not think he would for one instant.  So much for the more serious part of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to come back to the pushing round of figures which the Minister did with regard to emigration.  The Minister and I had a discussion in this House a few years ago on emigration.  The Minister said it all took place in 1956. We have had replies to Parliamentary Questions in the other House that went: &ldquo;There are no figures.  We do not <Col N="1312" /> know what the population is.&rdquo;  It is a most extraordinary matter that not alone could the Minister give figures in Dáil Éireann but he could even give the months.  He said that Fine Gael had the figure of 180,000 and rounded that up to 200,000 for good value.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Senator Carter made that interruption. It is interesting to see whether looking at this thing in the abstract, one can get a more accurate impression than can the people with the calculating machines.  I make it that between April, 1956 and April, 1961&mdash;unfortunately the next census will not be taken on April 9th and that will vitiate the figure&mdash;the figure will be 250,000.  It was 200,000 from 1951 to 1956.  There was a drop of 60,000 in the population in spite of a natural increase of 140,000.  That is my own opinion but only time will tell whether I am correct.  The great bulk of those 250,000 in the five years from 1956 to 1961 will have taken place from the beginning of 1957.  The Minister makes a point, and I make him a present of it, that we, the inter-Party Government, were to blame for the year 1957.  Since I make him a present, I wonder would he agree in equity to making me a present of the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government were responsible for 1955.</P>

      <P>I certainly got a certain amount of amusement from the Minister's statement: &ldquo;If you take the monthly figures in 1957, you find <Col N="1313" /> that half the 60,000 emigrants went out in January and February and we are not going to take credit or responsibility for the people who went out in January or February.&rdquo;  I could get at this thing analytically if I wanted to but there is no need to bother because it is all poppycock.  Figures of unemployment in February, 1957, have often been thrown at this side of the House and that is enough answer to that.  It is rather amusing to find the Minister at the end of the analysis bringing the figure for emigration down to 120,000.  Take 150,000 for the period from March, 1957, to the end of September, 1960.  I think he is doing pretty well in my analysis of the average over five years&mdash;and, mind you, I am giving him credit in that because there was very little emigration in the material period of 1956.  &ldquo;If you deduct from that, which is only fair, the 31,000 that were taken off the unemployment list&rdquo;&mdash;why does one deduct them?  They did emigrate, you know.</P>

If there are no more people in employment here today than there were at that time&mdash;in fact, there are a lot less&mdash;you should add the figures because they are obviously people who emigrated.  It is quite a simple proposition, sticking out a mile. I can see that the Minister is convinced and is making me a present of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is obviously a very serious problem, this problem of emigration.  I made some remarks about it three or four years ago and the Minister referred jocosely to my &ldquo;quoting one economist here and another there&rdquo;.  Indeed, I think I should have looked at what I said because at that time, I gave a great deal of thought to it, but perhaps I will give the Minister the benefit of repeating it on the Finance Bill.  It is quite obvious from the part of the Minister's speech devoted to this that he is now convinced, as I was three and a half years ago, that this was a very serious matter, and that it is not to be got rid of by quoting figures about national income or that kind of thing.  Again, I am concerned when I see the figure like the Minister produces at Column 674 when he said: &ldquo;In those four years, the gross national product rose by 16.3 per cent.  Actually we took only 10.9 per cent. for central government expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Whatever way you analyse those figures, they are wrong.  I can understand how the Minister got his 16.3 per cent. and why he took the gross national product, too, but when he talks about 10.9 per cent. for central government expenditure, of course the Government did not take 10.9 per cent. They took a great deal more than that. What he is trying to convey is that the gross national product went up more as a percentage than the increase in Government expenditure.  I do not believe that is true at all on the figures quoted earlier showing the increase from £100,000,000 to £130,000,000. That is an increase of 30 per cent.  So far as those figures go, it is as good a way of looking at it as any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> I am exceedingly glad that the price of cattle is rising.  It is going to help the Minister.  I hope that perhaps with a bit of luck the prices might go up a bit more.  That is one bright spot in the whole picture.  Another bright spot, I am also glad to see, is provided by the export trade.  One of the reasons for that is the quite illogical one that the commercial banks are quite happy so long as their cash in London is not being indented on&mdash; they are quite happy and you can go through the girths, to use an old-fashioned expression, or go through the roof, to use a more modern expression internally for all they care.</P>
    <P>There are the two bright spots&mdash; the rise in the price of cattle and the increase last year in the export trade; but again, looking at it historically, the evidence is that this kind of increase in the export trade goes by jerks.  It cannot be done continuously. Again, the Minister compared what he called the increase in our national income with France or some other country and showed that in one year we had increased by 2.9 per cent., Belgium by 2.4 per cent. and France by 2.1 per cent. and so on.  That kind of thing is just worthless, taking a single year for increased national income.  The increase in France has been enormous over the last five or six years, completely different from anything that happened here.  It is also true that the Germans have been increasing their real national income.</P>
    <P>There is perhaps one final point, and this is on a subject on which I feel in danger, like my colleague, Senator Donegan, when he referred some time back to something being a subject of fun.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might attempt fun and witticism for a moment, though this is dangerous territory, the Minister said that the cost of living was going up all the time and the value of money was going down.  He went on to say: &ldquo;I think there was never such a long period of stability as from the end of 1956 to the end of 1960&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not really matter.  I am not taking the Minister up on a year or two.  What I want to say is that one would imagine that this was a kind of cyclical period similar to what occurred in the last century or something of that sort.  In fact, without going into the figures, there was one good reason why the cost of living remained stable in this country for those few years, and some people would think it part of a very bad thing.  Import prices were rising.  They had sky-rocketed when the inter-Party Government were in office, and one distinguished economist, J. R. Hicks, maintains that wages and prices vary directly with import prices.  Import prices went up 14 per cent. while we were in office from 1954 to 1957.  They dropped 7 per cent. since then.  In addition, there had been a serious drop of 6 per cent. in our export prices for part of that time.</P>
      <P>That was the reason I mentioned that it would be unfair to claim all the benefit in that way.  The Minister did benefit by it, but he did not show any of the benefit in his Estimates Volume from year to year.  He did not reflect it at all.  Let there be no doubt about it, internal agricultural prices went down, and that is the bad element I referred to, though it was a good reason why prices were stable.  The farmers' incomes went down.  The community as a whole other than the farmers, and, indeed, even the farmers, benefited by the very substantial fall in import prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could make calculations as to the extent of this thing, but again it all depends on which way you work it.  There is not the slightest doubt that it was a very substantial benefit and the Minister for Finance did have the good luck to be in office when it happened.  The Minister and the Government to which he is attached had better continue to look to the export trade, because if they do not do so, they are not going to be able to carry this amount of expenditure very much longer.  I know the habits <Col N="1317" /> of the commercial banks in this country extremely well and they have one scale.</P>
    <P>I looked up the Radcliffe Committee Report, the committee that sat in Britain to consider the working of the monetary system.  When I bought it I became so fed up after the first nine pages that I did not read any more, and I am glad that I did not, because all reviews of the report said that they baulked the main issues and dealt only in generalities.  When I was looking at these figures I thought surely these fellows made some suggestion as to what the ratio between bank loans and deposits should be. When I looked it up, all I got out of it was that in certain circumstances, there was a case for a ceiling based on a percentage, that is to say, you would not, for example, go above 60 per cent. here.  It would be better they suggested than the absolute ceiling fixed in Britain of £2,100 million a few years ago.  As against an advances ceiling of millions, you would put a maximum percentage ratio between advances and deposits.  But, regrettably, the Committee did not make any suggestion in that regard.  In British conditions, it would, I take it, be 40 or 50 per cent. It would be lower in Britain than here because of the nature of our deposits. But they did not come down even so far.  I was innocent enough to believe I would pick up a figure of, say, around 40 per cent., or, say, for Britain, a range of 40 per cent. to 45 per cent., but there was nothing of the sort.  All they said was that in certain circumstances that kind of thing&mdash;a maximum ratio&mdash;would be better than an absolute ceiling.  Such a ceiling in this country would be, say, £200 million or something of that sort.</P>
    <P>One of the troubles about this kind of matter is that you find a committee of genuine experts like the Radcliffe Committee who have devoted their lives to the study of monetary theory reluctant to commit themselves to figures of that sort.  It has always astonished me why the people in our commercial banks are prepared on occasion to speak as if they were biblical prophets or something of that sort.  I regret the Minister has not done better than he has in office.  I thought <Col N="1318" /> at one time he would do well.  Quite frankly I do not think he has done well at all.  As I said earlier, he has not just eaten all the seed potatoes for this year but he has eaten all of next year's crop as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is the first of many debates which we shall have for the rest of the year on the national finances, but the terms of reference for this debate are rather narrow.  We can discuss only expenditure in general; we cannot discuss expenditure in particular Departments and we cannot discuss revenue at all. As expenditure in particular Departments is the thing which interests most people more than general expenditure, the debate tends to be rather academic and perhaps not as interesting as the later debates we shall have to deal with the Budget and taxation.</P>
      <P>Of course one cannot deal with the national finances without some regard to the real economic background.  The two are intimately connected.  The Government Estimates represent their claim on the national resources, represent the share of the national income which they wish to take for public expenditure.  On the other hand the size of the national resources is very largely determined in modern times by Government action.  Government action can act&mdash;to use the well-known metaphor always used nowadays, looking at the economic system as a motor-car&mdash;as a brake if things are going too fast, as an accelerator if things are going too slow.  Also, to some extent, it can act as a steering-wheel to get activities into the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should, of course, try to make some reasonable forecast as to the prospects for the present year.  It is extremely difficult to do so in view of the uncertainties of the situation.  We do not know what sort of harvest there is going to be and the harvest has a vital effect on the balance of payments. We do not know what the condition of affairs will be in Great Britain and the United States of America, but luckily everything points in the direction of an improvement of trade in both countries.  Finally, we do not know what sort of change is <Col N="1319" /> going to take place in external markets owing to the emergence of new trading groups.</P>
    <P>In spite of that we must try to make a forecast.  In 1960, the national income rose by four per cent.  This is gratifying, but, of course, the prosperity was not equally shared. Every person in the community was not four per cent. better off.  The agricultural community in particular did not receive its just share of the increase in the national income.  Nonagricultural employment definitely rose although there is a certain amount of dispute about the exact amount.  This was largely owing to the continued influx of foreign capital. There was also a good deal of improvement in constructional industries.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that the amount of new employment was not enough to absorb the labour which was unemployed. Therefore, it was not enough to put an end to emigration. I do not wish to enter into the question of emigration on this discussion. Everyone agrees that emigration is almost bound to continue within limits as long as British wages are higher than ours and there is no restriction on the movement of labour.  It is fairly agreed by everybody nowadays that efforts should be made to reduce emigration, at least to the point where the population ceases to fall.  If the population could be stabilised at some level near its present figure that would be an achievement and that achievement may possibly be in sight.</P>
    <P>The trouble about the fall in population is that it has a depressing effect on all industries catering for the home market and it tends to increase the <i>per capita</i> burden of debt.  The trouble in dealing with emigration nowadays is that a good deal of it is not created by economic causes.  People are not really fleeing from unemployment&mdash; many of them&mdash;but from one sort of job to perhaps a better one in Britain. If emigration is to a large extent a voluntary movement of people seeking better jobs, it is very difficult to seek to stop it by providing employment here that may not be as well paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1320" /> Government policy should aim at slowing down the rate of emigration.  There seems some sign now that stabilisation of the size of the population is coming into sight.  If it does, that will be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments for 1960 appears to have resulted in a surplus of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000.  This is satisfactory but it is doubtful if it can be repeated in the present year.  The terms of trade are moving against us. Import prices are continuing to rise. There will be a large amount of imports caused by the bad harvest last year and also by the stocking necessary for the new industries which are gradually coming into being.  Therefore, it is probable we shall have a deficit in the balance of payments for 1961, though how much it will be it is impossible to forecast.</P>
    <P>In spite of the surplus in the balance of payments for 1960, the reserves of foreign currencies were down.  This is remarkable considering there was a surplus on the balance of payments and we know there was a continued influx of foreign capital.  It seems to be the result of the depletion of departmental sterling funds which was caused when the new loan was floated successfully and also to a certain amount of hot money moving to Britain to take advantage of the higher rates in the money market when Bank Rate in Britain was very high.  Irish rates did not move to the same extent as British rates&mdash;it is very desirable they should not&mdash;but there seems to have been a certain amount of flow of funds seeking the higher rates.  Now that the Bank Rate is down to a more normal level, the disparity between English and Irish rates has practically disappeared.  Therefore, one factor causing an outflow of funds does not threaten to reappear in the present year.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to make a forecast in these matters but I venture to suggest that Bank Rate is not likely to go up again.  There seems to be a change in the climate of opinion in the world as a whole regarding bank rates. There seems a general recognition internationally that high bank rates <Col N="1321" /> have not been working particularly well in recent years.  It is a reasonable prophecy that the Bank of England rate will not go up in the near future. It is only when it is very high, when there is a disparity between British and Irish rates, that there are hot money movements of this kind.  It is unlikely that the movements will reappear.  If that analysis is correct, there does not seem to be any case for corrective action in view of the outflow of reserves.</P>
    <P>The fall in reserves was slight.  It is becoming more and more accepted today everywhere that the internal economy of a country should not be subjected to jolts simply to correct a small disequilibrium in the balance of payments.  That is why high bank rates are beginning to go out of fashion. I think it is more and more accepted today that countries must not sacrifice their progress and their growth to correct a disequilibrium in the balance of payments that may be trivial, that may be self-correcting or that may be ephemeral.  In view of the figures for this country, certainly there is no case for anything in the nature of deflation &mdash;monetary or fiscal action&mdash;at present because the outflow of money is very slight in relation to the volume of our reserves.</P>
    <P>It is expected that, in order that countries should be able to pursue a policy of freedom of this kind, they should hold adequate reserves and, therefore, it must always be an object of national policy to maintain reserves sufficiently large enough to give elbow room so as to avoid corrective action for small deficits in the balance of payments. There is no more generally accepted principle in banking circles all over the world today than that of avoiding interference with the internal economies of countries because of drains in reserves.  One of the great problems that will be attempted to be solved in the near future is the provision of more adequate liquid reserves so that these temporary jolts can be avoided.  I do not believe there is anything in the situation here to suggest that any action of that kind is necessary, in view of the adequate reserves possessed and the comparatively trivial <Col N="1322" /> drain shown in them by the figures of last year.</P>
    <P>When we come to the subject of this debate, the public financial field, the out-turn of the present financial year looks like being satisfactory.  Revenue has expanded but expenditure, as very often happens, has expanded even more.  Therefore, it looks as if the Minister will end the year with a deficit instead of a surplus.  I do not find anything alarming in the Estimates for 1961/62.  They show an increase on the original Estimates for 1960/61 but they about equal the actual expenditure in 1960/61.  I have no doubt there will be a large number of Supplementary Estimates in the coming financial year.  Probably the actual expenditure in the coming financial year will be about £8 million or £10 million in excess of the actual expenditure in the present year.</P>
    <P>I do not find this figure alarming. As the Minister said, many of the increases in the Estimates are of a productive nature.  In regard to agriculture, there is an increase in the subsidy for fertilisers; there is an increase in the amounts provided for arterial drainage, the Land Project, animal diseases, the eradication of tuberculosis, research and advisory services, grants for farm buildings, water supplies, poultry houses and bacon factories. These increases are compensated by quite substantial reductions in the subsidies on butter, wheat and bacon. Therefore, on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture it seems to me that the increases are of a productive kind.</P>
    <P>Other increases, as the Minister said, are inevitable.  In a period when wages and salaries in Government service are largely fixed by arbitration, a good deal of the costs of services of that kind rises automatically.  There has been an increase in the number of civil servants and wages have been rising, but that is inevitable in a modern healthy community.  It is nothing which we should find dangerous.</P>
    <P>One aspect of expenditure in this country is that a very large fraction is of the transfer kind.  It effects a redistribution <Col N="1323" /> of the national income rather than a net claim on the resources by the Government.  This may have a bad incentive effect on the people concerned who pay taxes and who receive services.  It does not absorb resources in the same way as certain types of Government expenditure as, for example, expenditure on defence will do.  The fraction of the national income taken by the Government has remained remarkably steady in recent years.  The figure given recently in answer to a question in the Dáil was that the fraction taken by central Government taxation of the gross national product, has been less than 20 per cent. for a good many years.  That is not a very alarming figure.  As I said in relation to the increase in national income not being evenly spread, the burden of this increase in national expenditure is not equally spread. Certain classes of taxpayers pay more than their share.</P>
    <P>Taking the overall picture in this discussion, it would be difficult to say that public expenditure was growing at anything like an alarming rate.  At the same time, there is no ground for complacency.  It is the duty of both Houses of Parliament always to watch Government expenditure.  Like other people, Governments like to spend as much as they can get.  Therefore, it is the duty of the Dáil and Seanad always to watch Government expenditure and to criticise it, if it seems to be becoming unreasonable.  Although there is no ground for alarm, there is no ground for complacency.  The national income, although it is increasing, is not increasing spectacularly.  The terms of trade are moving against the country.  Serious depression in Great Britain might upset our export trade. There is every need for caution in the public financial sphere.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for the Supply Services, as far as I understand, are all we are discussing this evening and they do not really tell the whole story of the Government's claim on the national resources.  The Government also claim something from the national resources <Col N="1324" /> in respect of the Central Fund Services which are not voted annually and for a large amount of capital expenditure described as &ldquo;below the line.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister's reference to capital expenditure in his opening remarks referred to &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; expenditure.  As far as I understand, the estimate for &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; expenditure is only revealed to the Dáil for the first time on the introduction of the Budget.  It is well to call attention to the fact that the amount of the Supply Services Estimates does not tell the whole story.  The Government, in addition to what they will be looking for in respect of Supply Services, will be looking for something for the Central Fund Services which have not got to be voted and also for &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The capital needs of the Government in the coming financial year will, I suggest, be abnormally high. In the first place there will be, of course, the normal pattern of expenditure on the various projects of development most of which are completely justified.  Nevertheless, they require capital.  In addition to that in the coming year a large amount of outstanding floating debt will have to be funded.  It has been growing rather rapidly in recent months. Finally, one of the National Security Loans will be due for redemption during the year.</P>
    <P>The Government will be looking for a good deal in the coming year in the capital market.  I always feel that the capital situation in the public finances here could become rather dangerous.  It ought to be carefully watched.  I know it is unfashionable to refer to the Banking Commission of 1938, but the chapters dealing with deadweight debt still seem to have a great deal of relevance to the present situation.  I make no apology for repeating what I sad before.  It is so important that it is no harm to repeat it.</P>
    <P>The mere fact that capital expenditure is productive does not mean that it does not produce deadweight debt. A great deal of productive capital <Col N="1325" /> expenditure perfectly justified on such things as education, drainage and projects of that kind, does, in fact, produce deadweight debt.  From the point of view of the Budget the Minister has to meet the interest and sinking fund on these loans.  The mere fact that the loans have been productively applied does not help him to solve his budgetary problems. It cannot be sufficiently repeated that the distinction between the deadweight debt and the non-deadweight debt is not the same as that between productive and non-productive debt.  That needs to be stated in this country over and over again.  I do not apologise for repeating it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a good deal of new borrowing which seems inevitable in the coming financial year will result in deadweight debt.  One reason why deadweight debt should be undertaken with great caution at the present time is the very high rate of interest.  I ventured to suggest earlier that bank rates will not rise much, I think, in the future.  I think we are coming into a period of low money rates.  That is purely an opinion.  It may be wrong. I also venture to suggest that we are coming into a period of high long interest rates.  One reason for that is the vast demand for capital in undeveloped countries.  Another is the hedge against inflation, people feeling that currencies are losing their value. They will not lend to the Government unless there is some form of insurance against inflation.</P>
    <P>One of the most striking changes taking place in the financial world in the last year or two is the fact that nobody will buy giltedged securities unless they have to.  They have gone completely out of fashion.  They have become dirt cheap.  Nobody wants them.  That reflects the fact that long rates of interest are very high.  People are not going to lend to Governments except at high rates of interest.  The pattern of interest rates in the near future will be that bank rates will be low and long interest rates high.</P>
    <P>It was always said, until about thirty years ago, that the long rate of interest tended to come back to 3½ per <Col N="1326" /> cent.; that there was some norm in the long rate of interest; that whenever the rate went over 3½ per cent.  It tended to come back down and when it went below 3½ per cent. it tended to come up.  The statistics and history of interest rates seem to bear that out until the last thirty years.  That is no longer true.  We have come to a new norm.  I think the norm now for interest rates is more like 6 per cent.  I see no reason for the belief that long period interest rates are going to go down in the near future.  That is why the capital Budget should be framed with great care.</P>
    <P>We are coming into a period of very dear capital.  Funding will become increasingly dear if a period such as I suggested is coming where short money rates are going to be low and long money rates are going to be high.  The temptation for Ministers is to borrow on floating debt and the cost of funding it may become very dangerous factors in the situation.  It is a fact that ought to be watched.</P>
    <P>There is another point I want to make and I do not apologise for making it again.  Another reason why in this country debt should be incurred with great care is the falling population. The normal pattern in most progressive countries is that the national income is rising, the population is rising not so rapidly and the total amount of debt is rising but not so rapidly as either the national income or the population.  In this country we have the very abnormal trend where the national income is rising, the debt is rising but the population is falling. Therefore, as long as the population tends to fall the <i>per capita</i> burden of deadweight debt automatically increases every year.  It is quite an abnormal situation.  It is one aspect of the problem of emigration that is not sufficiently recognised.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to be very cautious in framing his capital Budget.  This is really not quite relevant to this debate because we are dealing only with the Supply Services Estimates.  We are coming into a period of high interest rates.  The population is still falling and there is a great deal of debt <Col N="1327" /> which, although productive, is deadweight. Therefore, the Minister may find himself with increasing Central Fund Charges which may be embarrassing in future Budgets.  Even if the national income grows and taxable capacity grows, the growing interest charge on the national debt limits the Minister's freedom in other directions. The charge for the National Debt is a first charge on the public finances every year.  If that is mounting, it means that the Minister has less taxable capacity at his disposal for increasing desirable educational, health and other social services.</P>
    <P>A country which is borrowing, especially a country with a falling population, is rather like a family which is spending too much on hire purchase.  The monthly instalments on the hire purchase limit the capacity of the family to spend in other directions. Therefore, I think it is relevant to repeat what I said in this House on other occasions.  Debt in this country should as far as possible be avoided because now, with high interest rates and a falling population, the Central Fund charges could easily leave the Minister short of resources for increases in other desirable directions. I should not like to see the country in the position of some of my friends who have too many goods on hire purchase and too many monthly instalments to pay before they can pay the current grocer's bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly it is very interesting to hear Senator O'Brien's very lucid presentation of the economic state of the country and of the trends likely in world and national finance and economics.  I was very interested in one particular figure which I think pinpoints many of the fallacies in Senator O'Donovan's speech.  Senator O'Brien stated that public expenditure in this country over the last few years remained at a constant rate under 20 per cent. of the gross national product.  That is the correct way to approach any statistical argument relating to trends: to take the percentage figure with the total figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An inherent fallacy of Senator <Col N="1328" /> O'Donovan's was merely to talk to us about the increase in the Book of Estimates without having any regard whatever to the increase in national product or the increase in national income. He has been long enough talking about economics to have regard to the truth of what Mr. Disraeli said of three kinds of lies: &ldquo;lies, damn lies and statistics&rdquo;.  There is nothing more fallacious than to lift a statistic figure out and say: &ldquo;There is an increase in national expenditure; national expenditure is up since last year and last year it was up since the year before.&rdquo;  There is nothing whatever alarming about that so long as the percentage is taken into consideration and related to gross national product.  When the trend is right, no amount of statistics juggling can get around it.</P>
    <P>The increase is reflected in the increase over the past two years of seven per cent. in national productivity and that is the most valid indicator of national income.  In 1960, it increased by four per cent., that is, twice the target set out in the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i></P>
    <P>A further fallacy in Senator O'Donovan's argument came when he took the statement showing the audited expenditure on public services during the past few years and took the gross sum of estimated expenditure in 1961-62. This, he stated, was in excess of the gross sum in 1956-57.  Of course, that is the case but he did not go on to tell us that of the 60 odd items set out in that table, the biggest single increase was for agriculture.  In 1956-57, the last year of the Coalition Government the figure for agriculture was £7,996,000 and the Estimate for the coming year is £16,145,000 an increase of approximately eight and a half million pounds.  In the four years which Senator O'Donovan deplored, the Agricultural Estimate has more than doubled and I think that in itself is a concrete expression of how usefully the public expenditure has been increased. It has increased in the direction of more productive spending within the framework of growing national product and income.  There is nothing wrong in increased expenditure, so long <Col N="1329" /> as it is within that framework and is productive.</P>
    <P>Breaking down the Agriculture Estimate, you see that all increases are designed to improve production on the land.  The bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme shows an increase of £1,700,000.  The Government now propose to spend £7 million within the coming year on this very necessary work.  Senator O'Donovan mentioned my reference in the recent by-election campaign to the fact that we estimated last year £5 million for that necessary national work, adding that I would not say that the previous Government would be able to find five million halfpence. I think the basis of that is true though the phraseology may be a little coloured or exaggerated.  Basically, that is the picture.  The national finances are now in a position to meet this very staggering bill of £7 million and the money will be found on the basis of a balanced budget and stable finances.</P>
    <P>Other increases in the Agriculture Estimate are also designed to increase productivity.  The amount for fertilisers is now £3 million and the major share of that is for phosphates and potash and the fertiliser subsidy introduced by the Government which has enabled farmers to obtain artificial manures at very reasonable cost.  I think that is one of the best, if not the best, schemes adopted by the Department of Agriculture. It is going ahead and a further amount has been voted to it. There are other increases in that aspect of agriculture so dear to Fine Gael hearts, the land rehabilitation scheme. It has increased by £200,000 and £2,200,000 will be spent on it in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Right through the Estimate there are increases in productive directions.  Bord Bainne set up to ensure the proper marketing of creamery products gets a considerable sum, in the region of £1 million, an increase of £750,000. These increases are in the direction of increased production and increased marketing and this Government need not fear any criticism so long as the increase is in that direction.  They can certainly hold their heads high and say <Col N="1330" /> that they are fully justified when they meet any criticism.</P>
    <P>The other major increase after agriculture is in the various State industries under the control of the Department of Transport and Power.  That again is a good sign.  These public organisations such as the E.S.B., Bord na Móna and Aer Lingus have been a great creation of the administration here.  These semi-State bodies have loomed very large in the development of our economy and we can be proud of them.  They are a development that the State has encouraged over the years, and a very necessary development, in view of the undeveloped economy taken over when we obtained our freedom.  There are increases under that heading for harbour construction, rural electrification and Aer Lingus. Any increases in that direction are to be welcomed as well.</P>
    <P>Apart from these productive items, the only other increases in the Book of Estimates relate to the very reasonable awards recently given, largely by arbitration, to the Garda, the Defence Forces and others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">

      <P>I do not know how any speaker on the other side can have his cake and eat it.  If you want the Book of Estimates increased, you can make a case on that.  I am rebutting the case that the Estimates are too high.  I do not think they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, apart from the Book of Estimates, this is an occasion for a more general discussion on the economy and financial position of the country.  We have various indicators of progress.  First of all, there is the balance of payments position.  Senator O'Brien mentioned that in respect of last year we shall have a credit balance of between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000. Over the previous three years, we balanced the books, taking one year with another.  That situation has not obtained here since the formation of the State, a situation in which there was a state of equilibrium year in year out.  Too often in the past, the pendulum has swung violently from <Col N="1331" /> one side to the other, from the ravages of inflation to the stagnant waters of deflation.  We had a large deficit in the balance of payments one year, and the following year, a surplus; we imposed all sorts of controls to restrict imports and the result was high unemployment.  That was the pattern we had in 1955-56.</P>
    <P>It has been a real achievement by the Government that for the past four years that violent swing of the pendulum, so long a feature of the Irish economy, particularly in 1955-56, has not occurred, and we have had a pretty exact equilibrium in our external account.</P>
    <P>That is to be welcomed, particularly when it is related to an increase in the national income, and when that balance of payments position is in equilibrium at a higher level.  I would not regard it as anything achieved if we were balancing our payments at a low level, importing little and exporting little.  The trend is the reverse of that, and we are balancing them at a growing level until in today's papers we have the full report with the publication of the final trade statistics for 1960.  There is no need to go into details of that to any great extent beyond the fact that some figures are fairly pertinent.  Last year, this country exported a record total, the highest figure ever in the history of the State, of £152.4 millions.  That was the value of our volume of exports last year, and that figure is shown in its true context of being equated to what might be called the higher level of activity when one comes to the figure with regard to imports.</P>
    <P>Last year imports showed an increase of £13.8 millions, to our highest import figure.  That is real progress&mdash; high imports and high exports and the balance of payments at a high rather than a low level.  When one considers that of the increase of imports of £13.8 millions, £11.1 millions, or practically the whole lot, was capital goods and materials for further production, one gets a true picture of what might be called the expanding economy.  It is a picture of imports going up and exports <Col N="1332" /> going up, each balancing, and the increase in imports relating to capital goods and materials for further production.  However, this is a political assembly so it might be no harm to relate those figures to the conditions which obtained some years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1955, total exports were £110,000,000 odd, and to show the trend which was taking place at that time the figure for 1956 shows a reduction.  The 1955 figure was £110,800,000 and in 1956, it was £108,127,000, a reduction of practically three millions.  Further, it is important in assessing statistics to imagine a graph recording trends rather than individual figures such as Senator O'Donovan picked out.  The graph which was showing a downward trend in 1955 and 1956 has since then shown a consistently upward movement, so that from the £108,000,000 in 1956, we have gone up to £152,000,000 in 1960, an increase in four years of practically 50 per cent. in the value of our exports. That is a positive achievement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better go into the causes of improvement, then, since I am prompted to go into it.  The position is that the increases in exports ranged over the whole aspect of our national economy.  They did not take place in any particular direction, but included manufactured articles, agricultural products, live and processed. Over the whole field, there is an increase, and again this is a healthy sign.  It is not related to some one particular development which could go into recession next year, but covers the whole field of our economy, in which there has been improved production and increased exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the cause?  It is quite plain &mdash;the ten years export taxation remission introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government, introduced by the Minister for Finance, the substantial grants made available first to industry by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1952 in the <Col N="1333" /> form of the Undeveloped Areas Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;active encouragement towards the development of investment in this country in the form of relaxation in the Control of Manufactures Act, and, above all, the financial climate in which business people have confidence to plan ahead.  That is probably the greatest single reason for the improvement, both in regard to industry and agriculture.  We have a situation where national loans are fully subscribed compared with the situation during the last administration when two of those loans were not even half subscribed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman, when Minister for Finance, collected in 1955 something like £8,500,000 on a floatation of loans of £20,000,000.  That situation does not obtain today.  You have further the situation&mdash;and there are plenty of business men on that side of the House to bear me out&mdash;where bank credit is made available to industry on a much freer and easier scale and to a far greater extent than it was made available in 1955/56.</P>
      <P>Going away from industry, you have the situation today where the farming community, once regarded with suspicion in banking circles, are now given money&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers are certainly not regarded with suspicion by a Government which has doubled its expenditure on agriculture over four years and commercial bankers, moving in step with Government policy, have doubled their loans to the farmers.  In the year 1957, the commercial banks had on loan to the farming community £16.58 millions and in 1960, three years later, the figure of credit on loan to <Col N="1334" /> the farmers was £31.16 millions.  In other words&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, loans through the commercial banking system doubled over three years.  In that same three or four years period, as I said at the start, the Book of Estimates expenditure on agriculture doubled also.  There you have practical development in that direction.  However, the important trend, bringing these figures down to human terms, is the trend in regard to employment. It is in this respect that the greatest progress has been made in recent years. The exact figure for the corresponding week in 1957 for the number of people unemployed was 84,752; the figure to-day is 56,577.  In other words, in this week, in March, 1961, there are 28,000 people, in round figures, in the Irish community fewer unemployed than there were in the corresponding week in 1957.</P>

      <P>I knew I would not get away with it: this is why I came prepared.  Senator O'Donovan and many Fine Gael speakers in their discourses on the economic state of the country tended to take figures from the year 1956.  That was before the complete collapse of the economy, following the balance of payments crisis in 1955 and the failure of loans in 1955-56. The chickens had not come home to roost then, but they came home to roost early in 1957, when in January we had the highest number of people unemployed recorded in any table of the <i>Statistical Abstract.</i> There were 94,648 people unemployed in January, 1957, which was the year when the chickens came home to roost, when the bad financial policy of 1955-56 eventually showed its results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> I think I am right in saying that the pattern of any economic deterioration is that, first of all, you have a balance of payments crisis, then you have Budget deficit accounting; then you have unemployment; and then you have emigration.  The pattern would roughly take that form.  The balance of payments crisis would come first; then Budget deficit accounting; then a reduction in economic activity, resulting in unemployment and finally emigration.  The credit squeeze was largely responsible for the fact that, in January, 1957, 94,500 people were unemployed. That was caused by the credit squeeze in 1956 (a) because of the balance of payments crisis in 1955 and (b) because national loans which were needed to provide the necessary capital failed miserably.</P>

      <P>Early in 1957, the first chicken came home to roost when there were 94,000 unemployed.  For every month through 1957 until August&mdash;January, February, March, April, May, June, July and August&mdash;<Col N="1336" /> the pattern is the same.  Each monthly figure in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for unemployment is higher than the figure for the corresponding month in 1956.  The unemployment which started catastrophically early in 1957 continued up to August, 1957. Nobody thought seriously that when the Fianna Fáil Government came in to repair the financial mess that overnight the unemployment situation would be remedied.  It took six to eight months to do so.</P>
      <P>In September, 1957, we see the trend reversed.  For the first time, in September, 1957, more people were employed than in September, 1956.  That is not a freak.  The graph which is going down reached its nadir in August, 1957, and from there on, for every month from September, 1957, until March, 1961, there are fewer people unemployed for every single month than in the corresponding month in the previous year.</P>

      <P>With regard to the emigration problem, which I deplore being bandied around in this fashion, it is a problem of long standing and has existed from before the time of the Famine.  I do not give that as an excuse for the problem.  I am again going to take 1957 and I am going to take the Fine Gael Party on its own figures as bandied about in the Dáil.  We have not got final figures yet, so that we cannot have a scientific debate on it, but in so far as we have figures deducted from cross-channel traffic and people going abroad the Fine Gael Party produced them man after man in the Dáil on the discussion on the Vote on Account.  The figure, and this is the Fine Gael figure, is 180,000 for the years 1957, 1958, 1959 and 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> But for the year 1957, on their own admission, 60,000 people emigrated. The average rate of emigration for the years 1958, 1959 and 1960 is 40,000. We do not deny that the emigration last year was probably 40,000.</P>
    <P>I want to nail the Fine Gael Party to the year 1957.  In that year, 20,000 more people emigrated than in 1960 or in 1959.  That emigration followed the mass unemployment in January, 1957, the highest unemployment figure recorded in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i>&mdash; 94,000.  It ran people out of the country.  That catastrophic figure, coming on top of a balance of payments crisis, where the banks would not give out money and the Government had not money, simply ran the people out of the country.  That trend has been arrested.  The level of emigration is now 20,000 below the 1957 level and unemployment shows an improvement in the neighbourhood of 28,000.</P>
    <P>There you have the complete refutation of the case that the reduction in our unemployment figures can entirely be related to emigration.  It cannot, on a reduction of 20,000 in emigration in the years since 1957 and on a reduction of 28,000 in the figures of registered unemployed.</P>
    <P>Looking through the contributions in the Dáil on this subject recently, I have come to admire the very sane contributions by Deputy Corish, Leader of the Labour Party.  He appears to have a far saner grasp of the problems facing the country and a far more rational approach than many Opposition Deputies.  He is less inclined to use the statistical line and more inclined to grapple with the problem.</P>
    <P>As will be seen at column 218 of Volume 187, No. 2, of the Official Report, Deputy Corish dwells on the figures so often given by the Government. In regard to employment&mdash;not reduction in unemployment&mdash;in industry&mdash;in manufacturing, mining, construction and electricity&mdash;in 1958 and 1959 the figure remained around the same at 272,000 and 271,000.  In 1960, it jumped to 279,000 and for 1961 it is estimated at 288,000.  Deputy Corish rightly bears out what we say, namely, that, for the past two years, <Col N="1338" /> 1960-61 and 1959-60, industrial employment is increasing at the rate of 9,000 per year.  That is our case.  We say that is not enough.  We think it should be more.  Our policy and our <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> are designed to meet that.  The trend is upward.  For the past two years, industrial employment has been increasing at the rate of 9,000 per year, as Deputy Corish pointed out.  We welcome that upward trend.</P>
    <P>The first sign of recovery was in 1959.  That was the key year of recovery. In 1957, we were still wallowing in the chaos left by the previous administration.  In 1958, we began to climb out of it.  In 1959, we had the first sign of recovery with the increase in employment in manufacturing industry from 151,000 to 156,000.</P>
    <P>I claim that 1959 first showed fruition of the practical policy of the Fianna Fáil Government.  With that increase in employment in 1959, we had the increase in the following two years of 9,000 people in each year, 18,000 over the two years, in the wider range of industry, namely, construction, mining and electricity which first showed itself in 1959.  The result of that increase in employment, or because of it, was the dramatic increase in industrial exports which was the first green light in recovery we have had.</P>
    <P>The point is being made that the improvement in the unemployment figures is related solely to emigration.  That is the facile sort of false statistical line that is being bandied about.  We are told: &ldquo;You reduced the unemployment figures by nearly 30,000 but that is entirely due to the fact that the people emigrated.&rdquo;  The answer is that 20,000 fewer people emigrated in the past two years than in 1957.  The numbers employed in the total industrial sector have been running at 9,000 upwards each year or 18,000 in the past two years.  There is the answer. It is irrefutable.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party wants to castigate Fianna Fáil with 1957 but they will not be permitted to do so.  That is Fine Gael's year.  The key month was August, 1957, when unemployment stopped rising.  Starting in September, <Col N="1339" /> 1957, month by month since then, the unemployment figure has gone down compared with the corresponding month in the previous year.  We stand over that record and we will stand over it in any public debate anywhere anytime.</P>
    <P>That is not to deny that there are problems in the country that remain to be faced.  The Taoiseach has made it plain that we are not resting on our oars.  We are not regarding the practical achievements of the Government with complacency.  The level of increase in industrial employment will have to be doubled, at least, on the 9,000 we have achieved over the past two years, if we are to make any indent on the emigration problem.</P>
    <P>We still have the problem of people leaving the land.  Deputy Corish goes on to discuss that in a very sensible contribution in the other House.  That is a problem which is worrying people all over Europe.  It is not purely an Irish problem, much as some political agitators seek to make out.  It is a problem which is worrying probably the most prosperous economy in Western Europe, the Federal German Republic, where there is probably the highest flight from the land into industry.  That problem will remain so long as people on the land feel there is a greater reward in industry.  It is a matter of supply and demand.</P>
    <P>The greatest challenge to this country is to ensure that the standard of living obtainable on the land will come as near as possible to the standard obtainable in industrial employment. Until that is achieved people will tend to leave the land.  The best way to bring that about is to double expenditure on agriculture, as has been done over the past four years, and to ensure that a better type of farming is engaged in by the small valuation farmer.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the efforts of the Irish Sugar Company in the past two years to go into the vegetable and fruit processing business on their own or in conjunction with major organisations abroad so as to develop the tremendous market adjacent to us in Great Britain.  Intensive horticultural <Col N="1340" /> farming can be of real benefit to the farmer under £10 or £12 valuation. The fact that they are engaging in that enterprise shows the value of the public companies which we in Fianna Fáil can claim to have developed and encouraged to a greater degree than any other&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is one of the few opportunities we get of having a look at Government policy as a whole.  I think we are entitled to use it, and to ask what kind of a State have we been building since we had a Government of our own.  We have tried various forms of Party programmes, but we have had the control of our destinies since 1922.  I should like to look at the State we have built.  As I look at it, I see a State of class distinction, vested interests and protected privilege.  It seems to me that that stands as a betrayal of the sort of aim, objective and motivation which inspired our people to work for self-Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at the material resources of the country and if we look at our resources of labour power, both manual and mental, I would say that neither of these sources of power and wealth is being developed and used to anything like the extent it should.  The result of the failure to plan nationally, the result of the failure to plan, on a sound economic basis, for the community, has resulted, under both Governments&mdash;neither of <Col N="1341" /> them can conceal the fact&mdash;in none of the Governments we have had so far achieving full employment, including employment for nearly one million people who have been driven from this country since 1922.  No Government has achieved full employment.  We see instead an enormous human wastage, and what you might call an economic non-plan.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, to our shame, many of our leading politicians seem to be proud of the fact that we leave everything to chance, or to private &ldquo;enterprise,&rdquo; into the pockets of which they are prepared to pour money, but they are not prepared themselves to develop the country's resources in a major way. Frustration is the keynote of our economy, while there is immense work that still remains untackled under the profit system, which is the system we employ here.  As James Connolly pointed out many years ago, no man, no matter what his virtue, talent, ability or training, can get employment at all under that system unless he can find an employer to make a profit out of his work.  That is a mistaken basic concept that has bedevilled the whole question of employment and production and left our political parties fumbling for a solution, and boasting about &ldquo;slightly improved unemployment figures,&rdquo; instead of telling us when they are really going to take the brake off and use all our resources of men and material.</P>
    <P>What is our major source of wealth? I suggest that the answer is our people, and in particular our children.  Our greatest potential source of wealth is in the young people of this country. What about Government policy in that connection?  The Government policy ought to be to assess, plan and consult in relation to all that young ability, and all the material resources to which it could be applied.  Their policy ought to be so to organise our economy as to develop those talents and apply them to the nationally useful production which would be possible under a really nationally planned economy.</P>
    <P>If this were a desert island upon which we had all been washed up, I do not think we would wait to establish <Col N="1342" /> titles to ownership, or wait for a box of money to be washed up before we all started in with a will to develop all the resources of the island, without any preliminary concern for how much so-and-so is going to get out of it, or whether it would be to the advantage of a particular class, creed or clique. We ought, then, first to foster the latent talents of our children, and the Government's educational policy ought to be based on that.  It is quite obvious, moreover, that the educational policy is linked even with our export successes or failures.  If we could, like Switzerland and Germany, succeed in producing products which would have a very high skilled labour content, we could compete on far better terms with the world than at present.</P>
    <P>Now, most Irish children spend seven years in a primary school and some Irish children spend another six years in a secondary school.  There are 450,000 children in the primary schools and 50,000 children in the secondary schools.  It will be recognised that secondary school children come from the better-off homes.  I think we recognise, furthermore, that all education needs State subsidisation.  We all agree on that.  Education is a national responsibility, like everything else, that requires planning.  I think we should also recognise that the child that is more in need of State aid in that connection is the child in the primary school.  He or she is even more in need of that aid than the child in the secondary school.  For clearly, on balance, the parents of the primary school children need this financial assistance in education even more than the parents of secondary school children. Yet we spend nationally per head per year on the secondary school children something in the neighbourhood of £56, which is not a quarter of what should be spent on secondary school children.  I grant that, but what do we spend per head per year on our primary school children?  The sum of £24.  It is glaringly obvious that they ought to be helped more by the State. But in fact what the State does in this country is to fortify the class distinctions already existing.</P>
    <P>Class distinctions by our educational <Col N="1343" /> system are fostered and crystallised. We have down in the hall a very fine copy of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic.  It was hoped that, under a free Ireland, we would cherish all the children of the nation equally.  In my contention, that would be an excellent thing to do, to be able to give an equal chance to every child.  Do we do that? Do we cherish the children even of the workers, and the poor man's children? Can we say that we give them an equal chance to develop their talents to the full?  Do we give every adult a chance to find full employment for those talents and, when they have been developed, to use those talents in tackling all the many tasks of agriculture, forestry, industry and education which are crying out to be tackled for the common good and the wider community of the world?  The answer is an emphatic no.</P>
    <P>All we do is to build up tariff walls year after year.  The Taoiseach tells us that companies &ldquo;will have to be more efficient&rdquo; or the tariff barriers will be taken down, but he never takes any actual step in that direction.</P>
    <P>What I should like to see, then, is a real national plan based on community need rather than on individual greed as a test of economic utility.  The test question we should ask is: do we need it and how much?  And not: can someone make a profit out of it, and how much?  We should plan <Col N="1344" /> to assess our material resources; we should plan to develop our intellectual resources to the full and harness all our intellectual and manual power to all our material resources for the greater good of the community.</P>
    <P>In that way we could sweep aside the existing stratification in our society of privilege and poverty, of talents and abilities crushed and stunted or else exported for use abroad&mdash;our society with its new ascendancy and its new coolie class.  The jobs to be done would be tackled on the priority of need, not of greed, so that Ireland might at last become that Irish Republic towards which people in the past worked, looked forward and for which they sacrificed.  No longer would we have as we have under the present régime and had under the previous Government, money-grubbing instead of community planning, head-shrinking instead of education, emigration instead of planned employment for all our people.  We should have real planning with real powers, real courage, real service and real vision.  We will not get it from this Government, and not from the next Government, but, in my opinion, the day will come when that is precisely what we will get, and then the Central Fund Bill will be, for me at least and indeed for the whole people of Ireland, an occasion of delight and pride.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 23rd March, 1961.</P>
