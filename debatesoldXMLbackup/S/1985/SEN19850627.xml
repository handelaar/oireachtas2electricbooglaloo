      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2 and 3 today.  It is proposed to devote the morning to No. 1 and to take a break for lunch at whatever is the most convenient time around 12.30 and 1 p.m. If a Member contributing to the debate finishes some time between 12.30 and 1 p.m. it might be a good time to break.  I indicated to the Seanad yesterday that there is a necessity to have the Electoral Bill and the regulations under it made before the Houses rise.  I suggest that we start at 2 o'clock with No. 2 and if that does not carry us to 5 o'clock that we go on to No. 3.  The House should, in any event, adjourn at 5 p.m.  Perhaps I should indicate to Senators that because of the statutory meetings of county councils on Thursday next it is proposed that we should sit next week at 2.30 on Tuesday and then sit on Wednesday until 5 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A couple of items on the Order of Business &mdash; I refer particularly to item No. 9 and item No. 20.  Item 9 is the Homeless Persons Bill.  I would like the Leader of the House, in the light of an experience that somebody had recently, to inquire about the progress of the Governments Bill because a charity I know had the ludicrous experience last week of being contacted by a member of <Col N="1142" /> the Government to know if they could make provision for a homeless person who had come into the Government member's clinic.  It appeared to me that the Government member in question was not aware either of the existence of legislation or proposed legislation before the Seanad or, indeed, of a Government commitment to introduce their own legislation. Perhaps we can have either my Bill discussed and indeed passed and brought into law, or else the long promised and long delayed Government legislation. Could the Leader of the House find out or let me know if there has been much progress?</P>
      <P>The second point deals with the Vagrancy (Repeal) Bill.  Given that the Law Reform Commission have now removed the last excuse that the Government had for doing nothing about the question of vagrancy, will the Leader of the House allow time before the summer recess to have that Bill, which basically incorporates a number of the proposals of the Law Reform Commission, discussed? I think they showed considerable compassion and foresight in their proposals &mdash; that is largely because they agreed with me.  They did, and it is something that could be dealt with quickly and speedily.  Will the Government either introduce their own Bill or will they take my Bill before the summer because it is not something that should take another two years to be discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will make inquiries in regard to both these items.  I think, indeed, now that we have the report of the Law Reform Commission on the vagrancy question, together with the Government statement on it, it certainly would be appropriate to have a debate of some type before we adjourn and I will find out what the position is in regard to legislation on both these matters.</P>

    <Title>Report of Joint Committee On Marriage Breakdown: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> That Seanad Éireann welcomes the Report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, urges the widest possible debate on its recommendations and calls on the Government to consider the holding of a Referendum on Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It has become customary in this House to discuss the reports of Joint Committees and to discuss them under the formula of a simple &ldquo;take note&rdquo; motion.  In most cases the motion is formally moved either by myself or by the Deputy Leader of the House and the debate then initiated by a spokesman on behalf of the Government.  In this case the subject matter is so important &mdash; and indeed the motion itself calls for the widest possible debate &mdash; that therefore it is appropriate that I should do more than merely formally propose a motion initiating debate.  I do not intend to speak at any great length and we will be relying on those members of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown to make major contributions so that they can bring into the debate in this House many matters that are not part of the report and indeed are not available in the public domain.  We have, of course, here the report of the Joint Committee as presented and also the evidence of various organisations.  But one of the features of the work of this committee is the extraordinarily large number of personal submissions which were received by the committee.  From my private conversations with members of that committee I think that many of them were certainly affected in their thinking on this problem by the realisation, through these personal submissions, of the widespread and intense nature of the problem on which they were reporting.  I certainly would welcome the fullest possible contributions from the Members of this House who were members of the Joint Committee and who, as it were, represented the rest of us.</P>
    <P>In the words of the motion, I think we should welcome this report.  Having read <Col N="1144" /> through the report I think the Joint Committee really deserve our congratulations. Members of the House know that I was critical &mdash; at times I think I was petulant &mdash; in regard to the continual postponement of the submission date. But, that being over, the successive postponements eventually finished.  There was a postponement for six months, then another for three months and then one for one month and two weeks.  At least it was going down and we did get the report in the end.</P>
    <P>We are indebted to the members of the committee.  The whole Irish public are indebted to the members of the committee for the way in which they did stick to the task, got it done and gave us this report.  We should express our indebtedness also to the Chairman of that committee, Deputy Willie O'Brien.  I have known him for many, many years, long before we were colleagues in this House together &mdash; I met him first when I canvassed him for a Seanad vote about 24 years ago.  I have always been impressed by the thoroughness with which he tackled anything he had to do and with the high degree of common sense which he showed in regard to his attitudes and opinions on a wide range of matters.  He was a good choice for chairmanship of this committee, he has done a splendid job and this tribute should be paid to him here publicly in one of the Houses which caused this committee to be set up.</P>
    <P>The report is, indeed, welcome.  We have here a great deal of information, information that, of course, was available to the experts but available now in a succinct form for Members of this House and, above all, for members of the general public.  Information with regard to the legal situation is here in easily acceptable, readable form.  Information with regard to statistics is here &mdash; perhaps not quite so readable as the description of the legal position.  We have in the report a reflection of the thinking of the committee on the various topics which came up.  We have a summary of the views that were expressed in the evidence which was submitted to this committee and, in the end, we have a report which contains <Col N="1145" /> a balanced approach to this extremely difficult problem.  That is the headline we should follow in our discussion of the report &mdash; to maintain a balance.  We have here now a basis for a public debate.  It is indicated in the motion that it is the view of the Government side of the House that this should be a full public debate.  Thanks to this report it can be an informed public debate.  We have now a factual basis on which to go in regard to this report.</P>
    <P>Before going on to discuss briefly a number of topics that are raised for discussion, I would like to say something about the structure of the report.  I do not know whether it is the academic in me, used to looking at theses and reports, but I always tend to look at the structure of a report.  I think this report would be more readable if a little more care had been taken about its structure.  When we look at the way in which the report is divided up into chapters we find, for example, that chapter 5 is three and a half pages in length and chapter 7 is 57½ pages in length.  This interferes to some extent with the question of easy reading. Having read the first six chapters which vary in length &mdash; some are one and a half pages; perhaps that is not a fair one to take because that is merely the reference to the statistics and if the statistics had been taken from the appendix and put in, it would be very large &mdash; we are plunged into this very large chapter dealing with the question of legal remedies.  The report would have been easier to read if that chapter had been broken up.  It does, indeed, divide itself into three sections. It deals with the broad question of nullity; it deals with the question of separation and maintenance and it deals with the question of divorce.  I say this not because I am looking for something to criticise about the report but I think it is only right when we receive a report from a Joint Committee that we should discuss matters like this as a guidance for other committees. I say this because it is very important that this report should be the basis for a full discussion and this will be true of many reports in the future.  It is <Col N="1146" /> important that these reports be as readable as possible.</P>
    <P>Going on to discuss the contents of the report, the chapter which contains substantial opinion and recommendation is chapter 3 which deals with the question of the protection of marriage and family life.  There are recommendations here with which we can all agree.  It is inevitable that the age for parental consent should be reduced from 21 to 18 following the reduction in the age of majority.  The recommendation is also here that equally the age for marriage with consent should be raised from 16 to 18.  Whereas before those under 16 had to receive the permission of the court to marry, permission is now required for those between 16 and 18.  In my view, &mdash; and I am not an expert &mdash; these are reasonable proposals which should be supported.</P>
    <P>Chapters 4, 5 and 6 can really be taken together.  They deal with different aspects of the question of marriage breakdown. Chapter 6 deals essentially with the statistics, chapter 4 with the nature of marriage breakdown and chapter 5 with the problems caused by it.  The subject is well treated in this report.  The personal misery which is now present in far too many cases, were this problem to be ignored, was reflected in the personal evidence. It is a weakness that the extent of human tragedy which exists is not directly reflected in the report.  The members of the committee had the advantage of evidence of the extent of the personal misery which those of us who read the report do not have.  In reading the report we should not forget this aspect.</P>
    <P>If I were to go into this in detail there are some aspects in the report with which I might differ.  I would like to draw attention to paragraph 4.3.10 which deals with the question of the effect of alcoholism and drunkenness in marriage breakdown. It appears that the committee attempted to say here that drunkenness and alcoholism do not always lead to marriage breakdown and when they do, they are not the single determining factor but in trying to emphasise that point they have gone a little too far the other way.  Paragraph 4.3.10 states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> The view held by researchers is that excessive consumption of alcohol which results in abuse of this nature is not in itself a cause of marriage breakdown, but may conceal a failure in communication or may reveal a personality defect which, for any number of reasons, is only released through excessive consumption of alcohol.</P>
    <P>I think the committee have gone too far in the other direction in that sentence. There is almost a suggestion there that this is a factor which is present but that marriage breakdown would occur even though there were not this factor.  I find that very hard to accept from what I hear from social workers who are dealing with the problem of marriage breakdown. One hears from lawyers who are concerned with the final stages of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to believe that if we could conquer the question of excessive drinking in this country &mdash; whether it is drinking under the compulsion of alcoholism or whether it is drinking for social reasons that interferes with home life &mdash; we would not reduce the degree of marriage breakdown. There is no doubt that we would reduce the degree of misery.  I feel, this added factor in a number of cases is the factor that pushes marriage beyond the threshold to final collapse.  I take mild issue with the way in which the Joint Committee have expressed their opinion in this regard.</P>
    <P>Chapter 5 which deals with the consequences of marriage breakdown is well written.  We must ponder on what is being said here.  It deals not at great length, because that was not their function, but it deals in outline with the question of emotional, social, legal and economic consequences of marriage breakdown.  In regard to statistics, we have them here but we also have the comment by the committee that we do not yet have sufficient statistics in order to work out exactly what our situation is.  I concur completely with what the committee say in paragraph 6.4:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> The committee is of the opinion that any future census should seek to ascertain precisely the incidence of marriage breaksown as manifested by separation or desertion.</P>
    <P>I support this fully.  Let us have an end to the pussy-footing nonsense that went on in regard to the interpretation and processing of recent census forms.  What we find out may be unpalatable; on the other hand, things may not be as bad as we fear but let us know the truth; let us quantify the situation as we seek to deal with it. Nothing is gained at all by endeavouring to fudge these issues.  There is enough conflict between civil and canon law. There is enough difficulty in determining what the status of people is: at least let our census be factual.  We cannot prevent people using the results of that census to bolster their arguments in favour of their own position but let the argument not get into the holding of the census and the very recording of the position.</P>
    <P>The great length of chapter 7 makes it difficult to read.  My comments are first devoted to what I think of as chapter 7a which deals with the question of nullity and occupies pages 33 to 43.  This is a good discussion.  It is not the first discussion we have had in recent years.  We had the report of the Attorney General in 1976. We had the report of the Law Reform Commission a few years ago.  We have had judicial interpretation of the law in recent years but the result of all these recent developments over the last decade or so has been in the direction of further confusion rather than in the direction of clarification on this problem.  The discussion in the report about the situation that has arisen is clear and the recommendations made are ones that could be followed. We are operating here under an 1870 statute.  We have all of the problems created by difference in interpretation of nullity in ecclesiastical and in civil law. This must be cleared and I think the committee has pointed the way well.</P>
    <P>In what I look on as chapter 7b, on separation and maintenance, which is a quite substantial section running from <Col N="1149" /> page 44 to page 70, the committee has brought forward good sensible views.  On the question of judicial separation, they have recommended the abolition of the technical defences.  The most interesting thing which the committee have said in this regard is in paragraph 7.3.8.2.  These recurring decimal points indicate my earlier point about this chapter being too long.  This particular point which occurs on pages 49 and 50 is in one of the most important paragraphs of the report.  It is important not only in regard to the question of nullity but it also represents a very substantial contribution to the question of discussion of divorce as a remedy for irretrievable marriage breakdown. The committee in paragraph 7.3.8.2 give a list of circumstances which in their opinion constitute irretrievable breakdown of marriage.  I commend the committee for having done this.  There must have been a temptation not to deal with this issue but just to keep talking about the phrase &ldquo;irretrievable breakdown of marriage&rdquo;.  I commend the courage of the members of the committee, and I include all the members of the committee in this, in coming forward with this extremely important paragraph.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to read out the points.  My point is not even whether I agree or disagree with them but about the central importance of this.  It could be easy to overlook it even though there is a reference back to it.  We have a group of Deputies and Senators who, over a period, dealt with this problem and came up with their definition of irretrievable breakdown of marriage.  This is important not only on the question of judicial separation but it is important also in regard to the ultimate debate about divorce.</P>
    <P>I have a problem on paragraph 7.4.14. I would like to quote it and then I would like to ask the members of the committee would they tell me what it means.  Paragraph 7.4.14 which starts at the bottom of page 55 which deals with defaulting on maintenance payments reads:</P>
    <P>In the above matter, the Committee is conscious of the considerable time <Col N="1150" /> and expense involved for litigants in pursuing maintenance defaulters.</P>
    <P>Here is what I find is the difficult part</P>
    <P>and the need to balance this against the constitutional responsibility placed on the State to protect marriage and the family.</P>
    <P>I do not see a strict logical connection between these two ideas.  I may be missing something in my reading of that paragraph, but I certainly would be glad if some of the members of the committee were to enlighten me as to why there is an actual balance and why there is a conflict at this particular point.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of property, again the report emphasises the need for study here and for legislation.  I am glad that they say we should not rush into legislation.  It is an extremely difficult area.  The pity is that the study that was called for earlier has not yet taken place so that we could proceed directly to legislation. As the committee indicates on page 64 of chapter 7, there should be no further delay in getting down to a thorough study of this particular problem.  One trusts that there will be no further delay.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of barring orders, this, in my view, is an essential provision: the law for the protection of women in an impossible situation.  It is still an extremely crude instrument. There has to be more thought about this subject.  We started off, with the 1976 Act, with the basic idea that this was good, but there were many disadvantages. There was no power of arrest; there was no power of enforcement of the barring order.  That was remedied in the 1981 Act, but the legislation is still crude.  It is true to say that there are other orders which would have the same effect as a barring order which can be obtained where physical violence itself cannot be proved.  This is an area in which the committee does not point the way as clearly for us as it does in other areas.  Then we have chapter 7c which deals with the question of divorce and occupies about 20 pages of the report.  Here, of course, <Col N="1151" /> the report points out there are a number of questions.  There is the question of the constitutional ban on divorce and the question of the advisability of subsequent legislation and the form which such legislation might take.  I have no doubts whatever on the question of the constitutional ban on divorce.  Indeed, I am one of the political survivors of the 1967 informal committee on the constitution which commented in regard to this particular constitutional provision and I quote from the report of 1967:</P>
    <P>It can be argued, therefore, that the existing constitutional provision is coercive in relation to all persons, Catholics and non-Catholics, whose religious rules do not absolutely prohibit divorce in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>That is true of Catholics as well as non-Catholics because let us be absolutely clear on this, divorce is not something that is, under all circumstances, contrary to natural law.  It is not something on which there is an absolute prohibition in all circumstances.  I stand by what was said then and it is my opinion today.  I do not defend, and would not seek to defend under the circumstances today, the particular solution that was put forward by the 1967 informal committee on the Constitution. The position in that committee was that if all its members were unanimous that fact was recorded.  If they were not unanimous there was no majority or minority opinion recorded, merely a listing of arguments.  At that time, even though I had the greatest reservations about the particular solution put forward, I thought it was important not to break the unanimity of the committee when the committee were unanimous that the constitutional prohibition should be removed.  That was the important thing. There have been many changes since then in regard to public opinion but, unfortunately, there has not been a change in regard to this particular matter.  It is true to say that people are more ready now to accept such a recommendation than they were then and I trust that it will not be long before the people are so ready for <Col N="1152" /> such a change that such a change can be made.</P>
    <P>We must take a balanced view on this question.  The committee have done a good job in dealing with the arguments for and against divorce.  They have summarised them well.  It is important for all of us, no matter what our personal view is, to consider the arguments that support the side which we advocate as well as the arguments in the other direction.  At least we have advanced in this country to the situation where most of the public protagonists no longer believe that this is a black and white question.  The critics of the proposal to remove the prohibition from the Constitution are making very different arguments today from what they made in 1967 when an all-party committee recommended its removal.  The arguments which are being made, for example, by the Catholic Hierarchy, are being made on the basis of public order and on the basis of a balance between the remedying of a situation of human difficulty and misery and, on the other hand, what they see as the requirement of public order and of the social order. This is a very distinct advance.  This is the way in which the debate should continue. I do not believe that divorce is an absolute right which an individual can claim or that it must be allowed automatically. My opinion is that, on balance, in the situation as we see it in this country, the possible dangers to the social order by the introduction of a very strictly limited law on divorce do not outweigh the benefits that would flow from such an action.  I take that, not as a question of black and white, but as a reflection of my own personal opinion on where the balance lies.</P>
    <P>The committee have done a good job in what they have said here.  They have set out what would be the effect if we do nothing and what would be the effect if we change and again we must commend them for going forward and discussing the question of the nature of possible divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>What they said in regard to what they <Col N="1153" /> consider to be the conditions for irretrievable breakdown becomes of great importance here.  I am quite sure that this question is going to form a large part of this debate but I do not want to go into it in any further detail now.  I want to emphasise that this is not the only thing in this report.  I want to emphasise that to act on the question of divorce is not the only thing we can do to improve the lot of people who are in marital difficulty or whose marriages have seriously broken down.  There are, indeed, a number of immediate steps which can be taken such as immediate steps in regard to the establishment of a proper mediation service and immediate steps in regard to the establishment of family courts which can act in an objective and consistent manner, which is not true of our courts at the moment.  I am not trying to suggest that our courts are not objective; our courts are objective but they are not consistent.  We have inconsistency here, because of the way in which marriage cases are dealt with.  They are not dealt with by judges who have specialised in this area or by judges all of whose work is in this area.  Consequently, there is, inevitably, a degree of inconsistency which, in an area like this, is most damaging. What is recommended in this report in chapter 8, in regard to mediation in particular, is welcome.  I think the committee have argued well that there should be an independent mediation process. The arguments they have put forward here stand up.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of a family court the committee have set the scene well.  I certainly advocate that there should be the fullest possible debate on the question of the removal of the prohibition in the Constitution and the possibility of divorce legislation.  I stuck my neck out in 1967, when it was pretty lonely to do so, on this matter.  I believe there must be the fullest possible debate. It would be a tragedy if we concentrated entirely on the question of the prohibition if we had a debate in regard to the question of divorce.  In particular, it would be an appalling tragedy if there were a premature referendum in this country <Col N="1154" /> before a fully informed debate had taken place, and if such debate resulted in the retention of that particular prohibition for a long time to come, due to a referendum failure.  All of these results could be tragedies.  One of the worst things that we could do is to start a long discussion about divorce and think that that was the only possible remedy to the problem.</P>
    <P>In this report there is the basic material for such a discussion on divorce, but there is much else besides.  There is a great deal of good sense in regard to the question of mediation and in regard to the question of the manner in which the law could act. There is a great deal of sense in regard to the manner in which the law could be amended to improve the situation without going into the question of divorce.  There are excellent discussions in regard to the longer term problems of education.  They refer to the fact that part of education is education for living, not just education for getting a job.  Education for the formation of personal relationships can be the foundation of a solid marriage.  Let us take everything that is in this report.  Let us not look at one chapter only, even if it is a very long one.  We have here the material for going forward on a large number of fronts.  For that we are indebted to the Joint Committee and for that I thank them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, in seconding this motion from the Government side of the House welcoming the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown I would like, with the Leader of the House, to pay a tribute to the members of the committee, the chairman whom he has mentioned, and the members from the other House.  In particular, I would like to thank the Members of this House, including yourself, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and Senators Katherine Bulbulia, Catherine McGuinness and Mary Robinson, and Senator Tom Hussey.  The committee have had, in fact, many months of very difficult and delicate discussions and negotiations.  They have accepted the presentation of documents from many sources.  The committee have come up <Col N="1155" /> with what is a major document on this area of marriage breakdown.</P>
      <P>Suddenly everybody in Ireland, particularly people dealing with social legislation, has become keenly aware that we are now faced with a new problem.  In this area, unlike other areas of social legislation which have been debated and amended by legislation, or otherwise, people came forward in a matter of privacy regarding marriage breakdown and the problems arising from it.  We who are active in public life must admit, from our dealings with people in this category, that there is a considerable amount of difficulty in what would normally be accepted as a stable family situation in Ireland.  We come across bad situations arising from marriage breakdown, such as claims for the deserted wife's allowance, claims for the deserted wife's benefit, claims for assistance in connection with barring orders, and the rehousing of people who are thrown out of their homes with their families.  We have to address those problems as best we can.</P>
      <P>I contend that there has always been marriage breakdown in Ireland.  It is inevitable in human situations that there should be.  Any situation, even with the best will in the world to make it perfect can change.  Unfortunately, in some marriages things change for the worse and the marriage has then irretrievably broken down.  I contend that even if there was marriage breakdown in Ireland at some level which we may not have addressed 20 years ago, the rate of marriage breakdown is now obviously on the increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say at the outset that the Labour Party have been unequivocal on this issue for a long number of years. They were probably one of the first political groupings in this country to address themselves to the problems and to set up special case studies and committees to look at it.  They had the courage to come out and say from their research and from their interest in this that, as the Tánaiste said, whereas the vote in specific instances is a moral decision for the people concerned &mdash; by moral I mean they have to take into account their religious beliefs <Col N="1156" /> and religious teaching &mdash; from a legislator's point of view legislating for it is a matter of right.  That fairly sums up the position of the Labour Party in this area. It is easy to say we should have a referendum in the morning, or next week, or in the lifetime of the Government.  Of course I would go along with that.  If there is not a referendum in the lifetime of this Government it could be postponed until another Government with a bit of courage in this area might be prepared to sit down and consider all the aspects and legislation for it.</P>
    <P>In trying to come to an agreement with my colleague, Senator Dooge, about the wording of the motion which gave this House an opportunity to discuss it, I had this Government in mind when I used the words &ldquo;calls on the Government&rdquo;.  The Government will honour their obligations having gone through the process of setting up the joint committee and listening to the debate that was initiated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would leave it to the movers of the amendment to decide why they felt it was important. Many people on my side of the House would like to put a date on it too.</P>
    <P>However, in trying to make a contribution to this debate I must have regard to both the necessity for a referendum and the outcome of the referendum when it takes place.  I have a duty to ensure that when the electorate are faced with this they will know all the sides to the problem and all the consequences arising from it and, when they give a decision, that decision will not be based on political considerations.  As Senator Dooge said, this is not a black and white issue.  It is certainly not a political issue and it would be a tragedy if people were to &ldquo;play politics&rdquo; with this delicate subject.  I hope people will be informed by all of us on the total implications and the necessity for a positive response to a referendum. In my contribution I will deal with how I feel that should be done.</P>
    <P>I commend the committee on the way they dealt with the various contributions made to them.  There are arguments on all sides.  I come from an area in which both sides are put to me regularly.  It is <Col N="1157" /> my obligation to examine both sides and to come down in favour of one side or the other.  I do not have any problems about that whatsoever, but I do have a responsibility to outline what I feel are the problems.</P>
    <P>The joint committee said the reasons for marital breakdown can be divided into two phases.  In the first phase which is in the first five years of marriage the breakdown is often brought about by failure to establish the necessary minimum relationships, whether physical or emotional.  The second phase concerns marriages which have negotiated the first phase with reasonable success.  In the second phase relationships are subjected to different stresses such as the increased maturity of the personality with the passing of time, the new ideals which may not be recognised or met by the partner, and the arrival and the rearing of children which are major developments in any family relationship and a blessing from God.  The arrival of children and their rearing &mdash;and all the trauma which is created by such events &mdash; is a difficult period, particularly for the mother, and creates some stresses and strains.</P>
    <P>It is also recognised by most people who address this problem that the earlier the marriage starts the greater are the likely changes in the personalities.  If there is no ability to adapt to the personality changes during these earlier years of marriage, then the marriage could be in difficulty.  The marriage will experience many new problems when the children begin to grow up.  They will leave the family home and both parents will then be exposed to a new challenge in redirecting their emotional and social lives, having completed their task of rearing their children.  Again, this is a particularly significant time in the life of the mother. When she has fulfilled her obligations at home she finds herself suddenly with time on her hands and the social consequences of that.  This can also create strains on the marriage.</P>
    <P>The extent to which the stability of the marriage is subjected to pressure will vary.  Pressure is brought about from <Col N="1158" /> within the relationships, from the interaction of the personalities of the spouses on each other and from outside the marriage by social and economic and even environmental pressures such as bad housing, unemployment and the changing values and ethos of society.  Most marriages in Ireland are able to cope with these pressures but in an increasing number of cases these pressures can lead to friction and conflict which cannot be resolved and which can lead to marital breakdown.  We know that in housing estates, with the low-cost housing developments, where the front doors are all adjacent to one another a ghetto type situation is being created which makes it difficult for people to retain some semblance of privacy around their own front door.  In a planners mind this does not look like a situation that might lead to a problem. You have only to canvass in an area like this, as we did recently and speak to people at ten doors and you find out that of the ten couples perhaps only two agree with each other.  It is amazing.  It came forcibly to my attention during the last campaign and it worried me.  When we develop these environmental situations we are adding to the problems of people trying to tolerate one another on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there are personal factors.  Marriage fluctuations can create moods in men and women, in men particularly as I can only speak for them.  We all have our moods.  These fluctuations happen and it is natural that they create tensions.  There is the question of loneliness. I often wonder how the wives and husbands of politicians can tolerate the loneliness that goes with being associated with politicians, and the amount of time we are away from home day and night, week in, week out, in pursuit of our public functions.  The public never realise that a politician is lonely despite being in the public eye.  The amount of time a politician can spend with his or her family is minimal compared to the time that should be spent with them.  In other family situations, apart from politicians, there is this element of loneliness, and there is undue sensitivity on the part of <Col N="1159" /> the person who is lonely.  For those who are away there is a feeling of guilt and remorse and a lack of self-confidence. There is a loss of temper, a need to dominate and perhaps not to be flexible enough in a marriage.  All of these create social tensions in the human relationship which make the holding together of a marriage more difficult.</P>
    <P>Marriage itself is a very important institution. The Constitution has a special responsibility to the marriage and to the family unit.  Marriage is a legal contract entered into by the celebration of the marriage ceremony.  By law, marriage creates a new relationship between partners and alters the status of both of them. The essence of marriage is a formal commitment made in the presence of witnesses to create and maintain a lasting, stable relationship between the spouses. That is the aspiration of all of us who have entered into the married state.  We recognise that.</P>
    <P>According to Article 41 of our Constitution, the State recognises the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society.  Nobody in this House or outside it would argue with that.  There are problems in some of those relationships and in some of those family units.  But pejoratively speaking, all of us would accept that it is a very natural, primary and fundamental unit and group in society.  It is obviously the basic unit. It is essential and original as well.  It is natural.  The institution of marriage can be found all over the world.  Attempts to abolish it all over the world have failed. Many countries have divorce legislation. The marriages of many Irish people living in England, where divorce laws are available, have succeeded.  Despite the availability of divorce, it has not put pressure upon them to run off down to the registry office every other week. Attempts to abolish the marriage as a concept have failed.</P>
    <P>There are basic elements which are common to all families, the ordinary human relationship between husband and wife, the public marriage ceremony which is regulated by society, the definite <Col N="1160" /> habitat of the home, the provision within the home for childbearing and child rearing. There is also the important feeling that your home is your kingdom.  It is your own privacy.  It is something we all look to.  Home is associated with the family unit but there are changing attitudes in society now towards the family. There is the changing attitudes that people need and are entitled to freedom of choice, which is a basic fundamental constitutional right.  There is the right to express dissatisfaction, which many of us do and all of us contribute to it.  Many social pressures to continue a marriage are now diminishing.  For example, in Italy the identification of people in a marriage culture is increasing.  In Ireland the opposite seems to be happening.  There are demands on husband and wife to go where they like separately.  Most of us would join in that expression of freedom of choice.  Irish marriages in the past, perhaps, started off in Lisdoonvarna, or some such place, based on a contract commitment more than anything else. There was relatively little love in the earlier days when the matchmakers were busy.  Marriages were decided on the number of livestock available from one spouse to the other or the marriage gratuity that followed.  It was based on almost one and a half personalities.  For a marriage to work as an efficient unit there must be at least two personalities.  It has been proven where there are two people with similar rights which have been legislated for and have been proven, there is more likely to be success in that area than in one dominating another in the marriage situation.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in Ireland to which the Church is now addressing itself, the problem of relatively little preparation for marriage.  There is no formal training in schools.  There is a move now by the present Minister in the area of education in this field.  There is a limited success in pre-marriage courses which are now run by various organisations, including Church organisations.  That is a good thing.  Many people entered into marriages with relatively little preparation. That, of course, was asking for trouble. <Col N="1161" /> There are changed expectations in all homes nowadays.  There must be formal attempts to improve the quality of marriage if we can.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge spoke about the importance of not just talking about referenda or legislation in that area, but trying to improve the services to existing marriages which, with some assistance from the State, would survive the trauma they may be going through.  In regard to improving the quality of the marriage, improving marriage counselling and areas of advice, should be part of any future law.  The prerequisite for a divorce would be that you would have gone through the whole process of trying to make the effort.  If all of us did not make the effort to try to survive and if there was an easy way out, then people might make no effort.</P>
    <P>The family is a vital institution.  It is expected to provide fundamental personal fulfilment and satisfaction to all the members of the family.  Morally, this has meant a great shift in emphasis from duties and responsibilities to rights and gratification.  In the area of family life modern society has created an area of social activity that sociologists have called the private sphere, which contains the world of private associations.  The family is the most important institute in the private sphere.  The private sphere is an area of life segregated from the great public institutions, notably the economy and the State.  It is this segregation that characterises the family in our society.</P>
    <P>Thus there has been a massive shift in the overall social position of the family. Today the barriers between the micro-world of the family and the macro-world of society at large are very sharp and clear.  As a result, the individual between birth and maturity crosses a number of sharply defined social thresholds.  Adults look on the family as a place of refuge. Many of us would agree that marriage is a place of refuge, a place of consolation when under pressure from the everyday life.  It is nice to come home and be able to talk to somebody with a sympathetic ear.  It is also a place where children grow up to come to realise that the family is a <Col N="1162" /> place in which they will remain until they go into the larger world.  The family place is the locale of highly significant expectations for self-fulfilment and emotional satisfaction.  The family is also taken for granted as an essential unit.</P>
    <P>Three basic human activities are affected by the family: sexuality, procreation and primary socialisation.  Within the family the child's significant attitudes are first encountered and the motivating of a child to have respect for its parents and for its home, for its elders and for society generally in preparation for its life ahead. The family is the place where that can best be found.  The family also provides an individual with a name and determines his basic legal standing which is the whole area that we often discuss in the question of illegitimacy and so on.  It is one thing the family does provide, a basic legal standing for children.  It makes it not only possible to reckon the individual's descent but also provides the basic means by which individuals can be identified and located and put into statistics by the social order of the State.  The family household is also regarded as the basic economic unit.  If we are to do anything in the area of legislation which might disturb or disrupt or take as under that family unit, we have to look at how it is done and the implications of doing it and the implications of not doing it.</P>
    <P>This brings us to the area of divorce. Everybody accepts that a divorce law is a corrective law.  Two subsections of a Section 3, Article 41 will have to be removed if the public decide that there should be a positive response to a referendum. Firstly, they will have to decide if there is a situation in Ireland with regard to marriage which warrants correction. That is a matter for the Government.  It is a matter for this House and I am satisfied that there is a situation in Ireland at present that warrants attention from experiences that have been related to me by constituents in regard to irretrievably broken down marriages.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, people will tell you that there are serious negative sides to divorce.  There are no figures available <Col N="1163" /> with regard to marriage breakdowns. There is a special section in the committee's report dealing with statistics.  They have admitted that in their research they found it very, very difficult to quantify the actual statistics of marriage breakdown. We can only depend on the information available to us.  A figure was mentioned of 70,000 broken marriages.  There are also statistics available from some research which show that about 10 per cent of marriages eventually reach the courts for maintenance orders, or barring orders, and that is an indication of a high level of marital breakdown.  I do not know if these statistics can be verified.</P>
    <P>In the UK where divorce is legal, one in every three marriages ends in divorce. The highest divorce rate of all is in the USA.  In Montana the divorce rate is extremely high.  They have divorce on demand there which means that there can be dozens of divorces in one year.  People are motivated by the Dallas-Dynasty syndrome and look on family life as they see it portrayed on the silver screen with the availability of divorce, marriage breakdowns and bed hopping with everybody and anybody.  It is a pity that kind of attitude to family life is being projected through the media, particularly in America. Unfortunately, we see many American films on television.  They tend to cloud and colour people's minds and I suppose this reflects the high divorce rate they have in America.</P>
    <P>The Irish situation is probably different with the vast majority of people having strong religious beliefs.  The largest religious group here would have reservations probably about changing the Constitution. It is to that group of people that we must address ourselves in advising them to make a major decision like this.  Unless they are satisfied they will be very slow to change their minds.</P>
    <P>Divorce as we knew it in the past was generally for the aristocracy because in divorce settlements you had alimony and large estates handed over to dependants and wives.  If a man was wealthy enough he could get married and divorced as often as he could afford to distribute his <Col N="1164" /> assets to all his women.  In the past, when we talked about divorce, we talked about that kind of divorce.  Nowadays we are talking about ordinary poorer people with major problems.  Something will have to be done about them.</P>
    <P>Marriages here only began to be registered legally about 150 years ago.  They were registered for the first time in 1858 and the only way you could get a divorce was by a special Act of Parliament.  I am sure Senator Ross would love the idea that every divorce would be at his discretion in this House and that he would make a decision on it.  We would then be able to go into the individual details of everybody's problems in a public way.  In 1858 that was how it was done but, of course, that was a British Act of Parliament which probably made it a little bit more difficult for ordinary humans to be considered in a compassionate way.  You could only do that if you returned your property to yourself.  Up to 1922 there was divorce in Ireland.  I am sure Oliver Flanagan will be delighted to know that when he started his life, divorce was available.  I wonder would he think Ireland was a better place at that time than it is now.  In the twenties there were many happy marriages.  Admittedly, the country was an unhappy place.  This is not something new.  The Constitution which was written at that time wrote in these special protections for the family.</P>
    <P>I am speaking as a person who comes from rural Ireland.  In rural Ireland society is much more stable.  There is less demand or need for divorce.  There is always the expectation that marriage will survive in the country.  People are too busy, too healthy and too happy going about their business to have marital breakdown problems.</P>
    <P>We are inclined to think they always had divorce in Italy but it was only introduced in Italy in the sixties.  When the Government get all the information, they can then make a decision on how to move forward in this area.  The Government also need to know for social welfare reasons, for job purposes, for tax purposes and so on, whether a person is married.  They want to be able to identify <Col N="1165" /> with statistics one's personal status. Otherwise, they would not be able to administer the social services and social welfare schemes and systems that we have improved and advocated for a long number of years.</P>
    <P>We have to be able to make a decision on whether we want the prohibition on divorce to remain in the Constitution or to be removed.  Article 41.1.1º of the Constitution says:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imperscriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>That is a very strong section of the Constitution. It is a very positive wording and, to amend that wording, the law will also have to be very positive.  Many of us believe that it should be amended.  Many of us realise that to amend it in a positive way will take a lot of education of the Irish electorate, the Irish rural people, conservative as they might be.  Even if they are liberally minded, people will always be concerned about the implications of changing that positive provision. That is what this debate is all about.  It is not about whether we will have a referendum tomorrow, or next week, or at the end of the year.  The Government should look at that positive section and see how it can be put in a referendum so that people will accept that it has to be changed.  Article 41.1.2º says:</P>
    <P>The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>That section is particularly important to all of us.  Most of us would agree with that section.  The Government, the country and the Constitution should defend the family institution and defend the family, as we understand it.  If it is progressing, if it is successful and if it is doing what God designed it to do the <Col N="1166" /> Government, the State and the Constitution should defend and support it in every possible way.  Article 41.2.1º says:</P>
    <P>In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>That was a pious statement to make at that time.  It is probably very true today of many homes.  There are many women who make a major contribution to life and to the economy of the nation outside of their home and, thankfully, we have legislation which ensures that people have the right to work inside or outside the home and that goes for married women, single women and married men and single men.  There should be an equality in this area and that statement, which might have been a pious one, still is believed and acted upon by the vast majority of the women in this country. The right for women to do otherwise is also enshrined and is properly stated elsewhere.  Article 41.2.2º it states:</P>
    <P>The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
    <P>I am sure that, although some mothers leave the home for economic reasons, because they find they have to have a second income to survive and rear a family, many of them do it for the self-satisfaction of pursuing a job or a profession that they have been educated and trained to do, and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspirations in this Article which at 3.1º states:</P>
    <P>The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institutions of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P>There are many families in this day and age under attack through economic circumstances, unemployment, poverty, vandals, old married couples in their latter years being attacked day and night in rural parts of Ireland.  There you have a <Col N="1167" /> constitutional section in which you would wonder how much effort we have put into the actual protection of the marriage unit, of the home and the family.  Article 41.3.2º states:</P>
    <P>No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>That is the fundamental problem involved in this resolution.  That is why a Joint Committee sat down to look at the problems. Divorce in law is a corrective law and one would ask what rights would it conserve?  It could be a legal separation with the right to remarry.  The Joint Committee went through a whole lot of different areas of annulments and legal separations and divorces outside the jurisdiction and all sorts of other areas but none of them conferred the right to remarry.  Our understanding from talking to people on this issue, is that apparently fundamental to any divorce law would be the right to remarry and have an opportunity to make a new beginning and achieve some happiness in life, if that was possible; to do that by some legal process if that was possible.</P>
    <P>We have to accept that the law in regard to any marriage, whether it is in a Catholic church, a Protestant church, in a registry office or wherever else a marriage is contracted, must be seen to be a reasonable law.  I suppose people would say that divorce elsewhere is now a kind of culture.  It is fashionable in some areas. It is fashionable even to be in favour of it in some countries.  It is probably fashionable in this country to be in favour of it.  It is a social organisation and it organises the conditions of one's married life.  The conditions that should be available and should be recognised before divorce is given would be that there would be a breakdown of marriage. In the words of the committee, in the words of most commentators now and even in the words of my own party, where a marriage is irretrievably broken down that would be one area in which one could legislate.  I suppose there are many other areas.  There is the area of marriages that <Col N="1168" /> are not blessed with children, which creates trauma, misunderstanding and unhappiness.</P>
    <P>The Church even looks at these areas and occasionally uses that together with others as a reason for annulments.  It would also have the important function of regularising what, in fact, are Church laws and State laws.  There is no doubt at all in my mind that the Church has a major role in ensuring that its moral law is adhered to by the people who believe in it.  The State has an obligation to legislate for all, irrespective of which Church they belong to, or what their beliefs are, if any.</P>
    <P>There are many arguments against divorce.  I have heard them all.  There would be a fundamental change in the attitude of society to marriage.  There would be fewer incentives to make marriages work.  There would be less commitment and responsibility among those who are married.  There would be less ability to cope with problems.  There would be less preparation for marriage in the knowledge that it was easy to get rid of it.  Children would be less secure, especially in times of conflict, because if divorce was easily available, in a time of a quick flash of temper or conflict the children would be insecure in the knowledge that they think, well, this home of mine could break up.  There would also be the possible stigma on children and on parents where there have been divorces.  There would be less emotional support for children. There would be bitterness and resentment among children, depending on which parent they were allocated to by law.  There would be the economic insecurity and instability.  Children would find themselves almost being bribed by individual parents to know which side they would take.  Children then would feel insecure.</P>
    <P>There are arguments that divorce would undermine society, create economic hardship, reduce incomes and that marriage ceremonies in the Church would lose credibility.  These aspects are of the other side of the stories that have been mentioned to me.  It is important in <Col N="1169" /> a reasonable debate that all the pros and cons should be put down.</P>
    <P>Another point is higher taxation because of increased need for Government support in cases of hardship or support of the family which is a constitutional right.  There would be more pressure on voluntary agencies to try to help and assist people.  The legal separations would be inadequate if remarriage was automatic or desirable and then that would create other problems.  As a country which statistically has a large Catholic majority, it would undermine traditional Catholic values enshrined in the Constitution. The vast majority of Catholics in Ireland would agree with that.  I would have a different view.  I would feel that Catholic teaching, if it is as strong and as good as what I hope it is, would have no problem in convincing members of the Catholic Church if they need convincing at all, that the morality of divorce is a question for the individual conscience. There would be added strains on associated families, in-laws, aunts and uncles; divorce in the community would make divorce more or less acceptable and, therefore, more common, and less effort would probably be put into trying to ensure that marriages survived.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the arguments against it.  Many of them probably would not hold up to individual analysis.  People go to the Bible and say that divorce is against the teaching of Jesus.  It is harmful to the children, harmful to society and everything else.  Then you could also say that the teachings of the Bible are ideal. They are absolutely ideal if we could achieve the ideal situation in life.  Would we not all love it?  But we are all humans and being idealistic is probably too difficult. It is very very difficult.  If you do not have divorce at all are you doing more harm to children who are living in marriages that are absolute hell and if love has gone out of a marriage what is the relevance of a marriage?  What is the relevance of it for the couple or for their children?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste was right when he said that divorce for individuals is a moral decision but for legislators it is a matter <Col N="1170" /> of principle and right.  The reason why I went for this motion rather than a Private Members' Motion was to allow the fullest time for discussion by all Members on all sides of the House with no limitations on the time and not confine it to a three hour debate.  It is also the responsibility of the Government to initiate this kind of debate, to call for a debate and to take cognisance of what the debate shows up. This is not a party political issue.  It is a matter of fundamental principle.  There should be a conscientious debate, not that the electorate who will make the decision will be subjected to various political persuasions but will make their judgment on the information we try to transmit.  The question for all of us is whether or not there should be legal divorce in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This motion welcomes the report which is important as it represents a major step forward in trying to put together the various strands of the problem.  It allows for this full debate on all sides of the House and asks the Government, following an informed debate, to decide to allow the Irish people to express their views in a constitutional referendum. This committee calls for a constitutional referendum.  This motion calls for it and calls on this Government to hold it.  The amendment talks about the lifetime of the Government.  If the Government are not there one cannot talk about their lifetime, so we are talking about the lifetime of this present Government and saying they should do something about this problem during their lifetime.  There is no ambiguity in my mind in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want to state categorically that the members of the Labour Party in the Seanad group are in no doubt whatsoever that that is what is intended in this resolution. Otherwise they could have and would have put down an amendment.  It is this Government who will make the decision as to when is the appropriate time to hold a referendum after the issue has been debated in full.  There are many who are impetuous and want it tomorrow. That is fine.  In fairness, the people who want that now are the people who <Col N="1171" /> have helped to educate the Irish people into stopping to consider this problem over a number of years when it was unpopular to do so.  I compliment people like Senator Robinson who went through the process of putting down Private Members' Motions many years ago.  To Senator Robinson's credit she was never found wanting in courage to say at any time what her views on the subject were.</P>
    <P>I would like, however, to sound a word of caution because I come from a country area.  The majority of people I know &mdash; and I know many people &mdash; will be very slow to change.  That is not to say they do not understand the problems of marriages that have irretrievably broken down, but they will be very slow to change unless they have assurances that they will not be opening up the floodgates to easy divorce and so on.  They will not change the Constitution unless they are sure that what we are doing is legislating in a very narrow category for people who have problems without creating many other problems for other people who could, with a little effort, make a marriage survive.  They will be looking for assurances from the Government that, in legislating for people in difficulty, we will ensure that the legislation will protect existing stable relationships.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Government will do this.  They will need to set down the rules that will apply to any legislation that would follow a referendum if the result were positive.  They will need to have a prototype of what divorce law would be like if a positive decision were given by the people.  The Government have a dual role here.  They have to inform the people by this debate and they have to point out to the people what the consequences would be if the answer were &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  If people do not know the possible and likely consequences of this measure they will say &ldquo;no&rdquo; and this whole area of social legislation will be put back another 20 years.</P>
    <P>I am asking people with a genuine deep-felt commitment in this area to realise that there are people who would be very slow to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; unless they <Col N="1172" /> knew what was to follow.  I sincerely hope that, after a full debate in this House and the other House, and in any other forum, the Government will give this outline to the people so that they can decide positively in the referenduam.  They will do so in the knowledge that they are protecting what should be protected &mdash; something that we are all proud of in this country &mdash; and that we will legislate compassionately for people who are genuinely in difficulty. That is my commitment.</P>
    <P>I commend the members of the committee for their work in this area.  I commend those responsible for all the documents that have come through the Law Reform Commission.  I commend also all the other people who have addressed themselves to this problem down through the years.  I hope the debate will be extensive.  Although the debate is concluding today at 1 p.m., I anticipate that every week the Seanad meets, some time will be allocated to this debate so that, by the end of the day, Senators who want to contribute to the debate will have had an opportunity to do so and we will get a consensus on what we as legislators want to do, and advise the Government on what we want them to do so that the electorate can be informed on their responsibility when referendum comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Government&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to hold a referendum on Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution within the lifetime of the present Government&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The versatility of the Government in avoiding this issue, or any immediate decision on the issue of divorce and the amendment I am moving, never ceases to amaze me.  I was very surprised to see on the Order Paper this week that &mdash; having given a commitment &mdash; they managed to cobble together another form of words which fudges this issue.  That is why I had to put down this amendment today.  The history of this issue in this House is very interesting.  I have a feeling of <i>dejá vu</i> about this Motion today because two <Col N="1173" /> years ago myself and Senator Robb &mdash; who, unfortunately cannot be here today because he has no cover in Northern Ireland for his medical practice &mdash; put down a motion calling for the deletion of Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution which prohibits divorce.  Amazingly the circle seems to have turned.  The amendment to that motion was put down on that day by Senator Dooge and Senator Ferris referring it to an all-party committee on marital breakdown.  The issue was ducked.  All parties in this House &mdash; and it is notable that on that day two members of the Labour Party broke ranks on a vote &mdash; were very relieved to refer that issue to the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I should remind the House that that all-party committee were given six months to report.  After six months, as we all know, that all-party committee came back to this House and asked for another six months.  They came back twice after that seeking an extension.  The committee succeeded in having four postponements granted by the Dáil and Seanad.  In the end, having faced the issue of divorce, the committee succeeded in making no recommendation about whether Article 41.3.2º should be abolished. After they had reported the Government put a motion to this House to be debated at no particular time merely noting, not welcoming, the report of that all-party committee.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago another strange thing happened.  The Independent Senators, in Independent's time, put down a motion noting the all-parties committee's report and calling for a referendum on divorce. The Government again ran for cover. First of all they put down an amendment shortly before the debate was due and, on the day, they decided to stifle the debate on divorce and voted it down.  In an unprecedented move in this House they decided there would be no debate on divorce in this House.  Nevertheless they gave us a pledge that there would be a debate on their motion on marital breakdown in this House yesterday.  I will forgive them for delaying it yet another day.  We have had to wait quite a long time for it already.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> A new Government motion was put down for today, a very careful, very ambiguous, very ineffective form of words.  We know why this motion was changed.  It was changed under pressure from Senator Ferris's party because they wanted to put in a recommendation on divorce and the other party in the Government did not.  I welcome that pressure from Senator Ferris's party, but I do not think they got very far.  The reason why I put down this amendment today, and why I do it quite openly and willingly with Senator Ryan, is that I see no specific commitment from the Government on this issue at all.  I am not surprised that there is no specific commitment from the Government on the issue of divorce.  This amendment asks for a specific commitment from the Government within their lifetime because we have had ambiguity and delay for much too long.  This delay is deliberate.  I see another example of it here today.  I am sorry that when the issue of divorce comes before this House &mdash; 13 different times it has come before this House &mdash; the Government continually get themselves into contortions about it.  They cannot for some reason, say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, &ldquo;we are in favour of it&rdquo;, &ldquo;we are against it&rdquo;, &ldquo;we will or will not hold a referendum&rdquo;. We have to have ambiguity and we cannot get any commitment.</P>
    <P>The motion before this House leaves us exactly no further forward than we were two years ago, not one inch and not one day further forward then we were and it is almost two years to the day since we had a debate on divorce in this House. It is vague and it is completely inconclusive. I would like to read the wording of it very carefully.  &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann welcomes the Report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown....&rdquo; While I do not share the smug satisfaction which we have from all parties on the report of the all-party committee, I am prepared to accept that that all-party committee did a lot of good work in areas which were not related directly to divorce.  That should be acknowledged by those of us who are supporting the amendment to this motion.  But I do not <Col N="1175" /> think it is a matter for great congratulation that that all-party committee specifically avoided the issue which they were set up to avoid.  That is what they did.  They did a very good job.  They delayed this issue for two years and avoided the issue after two years.</P>

      <P>They urge the widest possible debate on their recommendations. That is a very clever phrase and it is a very deliberate phrase.  What does this phrase &ldquo;the widest possible debate on their recommendations&rdquo; mean?  It is quite obvious to me what it means, because the widest possible debate goes on forever.  The widest possible debate is open-ended.  This new idea of the widest possible debate on this issue has only come out since the all-party committee reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was under the impression that the issue of divorce had been debated for a long time.  The only places where it has not be debated are in the two places where it matters which are the Dáil and Seanad.  It has been debated in the media for 20 years and the Government say they want the widest possible debate.  What they mean is that they want to have a debate in the Seanad, probably going on until October or longer, and then they will have a debate in the Dáil in the spring.  Then they will want a large public debate on the issue and every county council will have to debate it to get a feeling for public opinion and we will still be debating it when it comes to the next general election.  That is what they mean. The motion goes on to say: &ldquo;...and calls on the Government to consider the holding of a Referendum on Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution.&rdquo;  That is the <Col N="1176" /> most extraordinary phrase.  The governing parties in the Seanad are calling on the Government to consider something. Senator Ferris said that his understanding of this was a call on the Government to hold a referendum.  That is what the words do not say.  The words say almost the opposite.  The words call on the Government to think about whether to have a referendum or not to have a referendum. This is another delaying device. It seems amazing that the Government have not considered this yet.</P>
    <P>The implication of this motion is that the Government have been in power for three years with a Labour Party who professed to be in favour of divorce but do nothing about it, and have not even considered it at this stage.  I am looking forward to the Government's consideration but, having been in power for so long, they might have considered it at some stage.  Perhaps when this motion is passed the Government will consider it.  When our amendment is put to a vote at the end of this debate, I presume we will have the support of the Labour Party in calling on the Government not to consider something but to make a commitment to hold a referendum on Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution within the lifetime of the present Government.  That is Labour Party policy as I understand it.  I presume that we will have their support in the lobbies for that.</P>

      <P>In 1967 we had an all-party committee on the Constitution to which Professor Dooge referred.  This problem was considered by the 1967 all-party committee. Some of the same personnel who considered that are in this House today. That committee agreed that this prohibition must go.  It is unreasonable to maintain that there has been no national debate on this problem nearly 20 years later.  There has been a national debate and it was a recommendation at that time which was before its time.  To ask for a national debate now when it was the unanimous decision of all the parties in these Houses at that time to delete this article, seems totally unrealistic and seems to be once again avoiding the issue.</P>
      <P>We apparently need more time 20 years later, having reached a consensus at that time.  Now the evidence of marital breakdown, it is agreed by all parties, is overwhelming.  The statistics, it is also agreed, are difficult to get hold of and difficult to agree on, but I think it is agreed that there is a chronic problem and that fact emerged in the all-party report.  There were, in 1982, about 2,400 applications for barring orders.  In 1983 there were about 2,500.  That only proves that certain numbers of marriages have broken down.  In 1983 there were 15,000 applications for the deserted wife's allowance but that figure excludes people under 40 with no children and a means test is involved.  So the figures are probably much higher than that, but they are very difficult to get hold of.  That is agreed.  What there is a consensus about is that there is a real problem here and it should be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alone in Europe for some reason, apart from Malta, it should be noted that we are the only country who refuse to face up to the problem of divorce, and alone in the EC we are the only country which has no divorce at all.  We should ask ourselves why is that?  Why are we <Col N="1178" /> out of line with everybody else and why do we continually avoid this problem?  It is worth noting that in eastern Europe as well, of course, there is divorce.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons besides the reason of marital breakdown why this clause should be taken out of our Constitution. Apart from the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, in 1983, this is the only purely denominational clause in our Constitution in that it discriminates and it dictates the laws and the doctrines of one Church against the doctrines of another.  That is a very good reason why it should be taken out, apart from all the evidence of marital breakdown at all.  The Presbyterian Church specifically provides for recognition of divorce and so it is a specific discrimination against the beliefs of Presbyterians, however small their numbers in this country.  That is a reason which has not emerged in this debate, why divorce should not be prohibited by the Constitution.  It should be noted here as well that all Churches regard the family as a fundamental group in the country. All Churches have that in common, that the family, as Senator Ferris rightly said is the fundamental group in which people live.</P>
    <P>It should also be said, in terms of North-South relations, in terms of the constitutional crusade which was launched in this House four years ago, that divorce is a running sore and a striking difference between the way of life and the beliefs and the laws of North and South.  It is absurd to talk of unity of hearts and minds or of even a Unionist acceptance of our way of life, if that is what we are looking for, if we do not have some sort of uniformity in our laws on these matters.  Whether it is true or not is a different matter, but it is seen by the Unionists in Northern Ireland that this is a case of discrimination against a minority.  Either we have to explain that it is not, which is very difficult to do, or we have to change this law if we are in some way to convince them that we are genuine about the pluralist society which so many of us espouse but we are so ineffective and weak in putting into effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> I will sum up by saying I am very disappointed. I am not surprised.  I had always been under the impression that the Government should lead not only the country in terms of legal frameworks but that the Government should lead public opinion.  The principal excuse which we have heard from Senators Dooge and Ferris for not holding a referendum is that public opinion must be right, that we must have a clear majority of public opinion in our favour, because the damage it would do apparently if this was defeated would put social progress back ten years.  What they are looking for is a guarantee of a result before you actually hold a contest.  That is never, ever going to be the case.  You are never going to be able to get a cast-iron guarantee of what the result of this would be and I have no reason to believe, and I would like to know why Senator Dooge and Senator Ferris have, that the result tomorrow would be any more in favour than the result today.</P>
    <P>Although I certainly see trends as being in favour of a prohibition, there is no reason to believe that in terms of timing there would be a larger majority in favour tomorrow than there is today.  This is another piece of evasion.  This is the Government saying: &ldquo;We do not really want to have it, but this is a very good excuse.  We are basically in favour of it but we cannot hold it just yet because we are not sure of winning&rdquo;.  You are never going to be sure of winning and you are not going to be any surer of winning tomorrow than you are today.  It seems that this moment the omens are fairly propitious and it is as good a time as any to hold it.  What I would like to see and why I put down this amendment is a rejection of these vague delaying tactics from the Government, but a commitment from the Government to hold a referendum within their present term of office, and that this Government should cease leading from behind on this issue.</P>

      <P>I would like, first of all, to pay tribute to the members of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and to thank them for the work they have done on the committee and to pay tribute to Deputy Willie O'Brien for the job he did, which was not an easy one.</P>
      <P>I am in full agreement with the motion in so far as it urges the widest possible debate on the recommendations contained in the Joint Committee's report. This is particularly necessary in relation to some of the recommendations made. I may say here that my Department are already considering proposals in relation to many of the matters dealt with in chapter 7 entitled &ldquo;The Legal Remedies&rdquo; and the views of the Joint Committee on these matters will of course be fully borne in mind.</P>
      <P>As regards the holding of a referendum on the constitutional provision prohibiting the enactment of divorce legislation my attitude is that I would have no objection to the holding of a referendum at the appropriate time.  I am not convinced that that time has yet come.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee received a very large number of submissions relating to the general question of divorce and the report sets out very fully the various arguments for and against.  The report clearly illustrates the complexity of the question and the very important issues that arise both for the individual and the general community.  I think the report is a very useful aid to the continuing discussion on the general question of whether or not it would be desirable to have some form of divorce having regard to all the wide-ranging implications.  Senators will agree that this is probably the most important social question that has come up for debate in recent times.  The question really is whether, and to what extent, we should now depart from the concept of marriage as a life long commitment between two people which has been for centuries a fundamental tenet of our law and society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> I do not propose, however, to say anything about the merits of whether or not we should have divorce.  The arguments on both sides have been set out by the Joint Committee and it is essentially a matter on which people will undoubtedly form their attitudes in the light of their own consciences and their experience and view of life and, of course, it is the people and not the Government who will decide the issue.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect, however, I would like to speak about.  The committee believed that it would not be appropriate or feasible for them to recommend the details of any divorce legislation that might be provided in the event of a change in the Constitution.  In my view the form that divorce legislation would take in the event of a change is a crucial question.</P>
    <P>There would seem to me to be little point in asking the people of this country to say whether or not a referendum should be held on the consitutional ban unless they have some idea of what possibly would be put in its place if the referendum were to be carried.</P>
    <P>I know, of course, that any legislation introduced now could, in the absence of constitutional provisions setting limits to it, be changed by subsequent legislation so that we could not say what the position would be in years to come.  There is an argument, and it is a strong argument, to the effect that the experience in other countries plainly shows that it is a very difficult to contain the grant of divorce within narrow limits and that, once the principle was accepted in the law, there would be an inevitable trend towards wider and easier divorce leading ultimately perhaps to acceptance of divorce by consent or on demand.</P>
    <P>To that extent it could be argued that the type of legislation that would immediately follow a change is not that relevant in the long term.  These are important points that need to be brought out and borne in mind by people in relation to any referendum that might be held.  I am aware, of course, that in our situation the provisions of the Constitution protecting the institution of marriage would be a <Col N="1182" /> restraining influence but the precise effect would, I imagine, depend on the specific constitutional amendment made following a referendum.</P>
    <P>That being said, I think strongly that people have the right to know, if they are to be asked to vote in a referendum, what are the different alternatives for the immediate future if a change is to be made and to have an opportunity to indicate which they favour.  It follows that, before a referendum could be held, there is a need for a more informed debate on the different alternatives that might be considered.  I do not myself think that the discussion of the subject so far has in fact dealt adequately with this aspect.</P>
    <P>My purpose today is not to set out the form which I, or the Government, think legislation should take if we must have divorce.  Rather is it to refer to some general aspects which may help to focus minds on some of the important issues that arise on this side of the question.</P>
    <P>I must say, at the outset, that there appears to be some confusion in the minds of some people on an important aspect and I might say, with respect, that the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown have not helped to dispel that confusion. The report states that it was the view both of the committee and of a great majority of those who made submissions to it that divorce rates that prevail elsewhere would not be desirable in this country and, later, that they, the committee, were also of the opinion that divorce on demand would not be appropriate or acceptable to the people.</P>
    <P>The committee then go on to say that any divorce law should be based on the concept of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, which is a common feature of modern divorce systems.  It seems to me that these statements as they stand are mutually contradictory.  Irretrievable breakdown of marriage is something that can, essentially, be brought about deliberately and unilaterally by one spouse who wishes to end the marriage so that if you were to have a system based simply on breakdown, in reality, what you would have would be divorce on demand, if one spouse objected, or on consent, if both <Col N="1183" /> spouses agreed.  Experience elsewhere bears this out.  This illustrates the need for more precise discussion.</P>
    <P>The committee were probably right in their conclusion that divorce on demand would not be acceptable to the people. However, if that is accepted it argues for some restriction on the availability of divorce.  What should these restrictions be?  In what precise and limited situations should people become entitled to relieve themselves of the duties and responsibilities of marriage, an institution which it would remain the policy of the Constitution and the law to uphold and protect? There is a need for discussion of the different alternatives that might be adopted and on the extent of the restrictions that people generally would wish to see.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention some aspects that would undoubtedly arise in any such discussion.  One of the first questions is whether or not &ldquo;fault&rdquo;, i.e. adultery, cruelty, desertion, should play a part in any legislation that might be necessary.  In modern systems the concept of no fault divorce has become common.  I mention this because there seems to be a view that fault should play no part in any legislation we might have, whereas I think that that question would be, to say the least, still open.</P>
    <P>The argument usually made is that the necessity to prove fault can lead to allegations and counter allegations and can result in a painful and humiliating public inquisition on the marriage.  I venture to say that the matter is not quite so simple. The fact that matrimonial cases are heard in our jurisdiction <i>in camera</i> obviates public, if not private, embarrassment of the parties.  It has also been recognised that fault cannot be completely eliminated from divorce legislation, for example, questions of conduct inevitably arise in coming to decisions on maintenance, division of property, custody of children etc.  To that extent fault remains.</P>
    <P>Again, even with breakdown as the basic ground, if that were to mean something more than a mere formula of words, it should presumably impose an obligation on the court to satisfy itself that <Col N="1184" /> breakdown had in fact occurred and this could mean an inquisition into the marriage as painful as any under a fault system.  Fault is a feature of our existing family legislation in maintenance, judicial separation, succession, occupation of the family home and barring orders, and I would not accept that we should get rid of it in these areas.</P>
    <P>The situation in England is of interest. While, there, divorce is granted only on the basis of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, in order to establish breakdown it is necessary to prove one of five facts, three of which are fault-based.  In 1982, 70 per cent of decrees were granted on proof of fault-based facts.  For the majority of divorces in England therefore, breakdown is not really the issue; it remains proof of fault.  It is rare indeed for the court, on proof of the fault-based fact, to refuse a decree on the basis that the marriage has not in fact broken down because it has been recognised that it is the parties themselves &mdash; and essentially one of the parties &mdash; who determine whether the marriage has broken down and not the court.  It is interesting that, in the major review of divorce legislation carried out in England last year, there was no change from fault.  Of course, the vast majority of petitions in England are not contested.</P>
    <P>If on the other hand, breakdown were to be considered as the basic ground, quite apart from the question of the extent of the inquiry which a court would have to conduct into the allegation, there would clearly be a need for something additional.  If it were suggested, as it probably would be, that the fact of breakdown should only be accepted after a period of living apart, the question would arise as to what that period should be. Should it be three, five or seven years, which have been suggested or used in other jurisdictions, or a longer or shorter period?</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that any legislation introduced here should proceed one way rather than the other.  I am merely suggesting that, in any consideration that may be given to the matter, we should <Col N="1185" /> not lightly assume that the question is settled.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that would need careful consideration is the position on children. Senators will agree, as most people would and the committee felt, that every care would have to be taken to protect any children of the marriage who on any view are the innocent victims.  But again, is it sufficient merely to say that?  Is there not a need to develop precise proposals on how the welfare of the child could be protected in the best possible way and is there not a need for fuller discussion on this aspect also?  At one extreme it could be argued that where there are infant children there should be no divorce.  At the very least it would seem to be necessary to ensure that there would be no divorce if adequate arrangements had not been made for dependant children.</P>
    <P>There are also aspects that are less obvious, for example, relating to cost.  In many cases where married people part company, one or other forms a new relationship so that two households may become dependent on one individual and on one wage packet.  The grant of a divorce creates an additional legal duty of maintenance towards the new spouse. This has obvious implications for wives and children of first marriages who, through no fault of their own, may find themselves in very reduced financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>This could be particularly so in the case of women who had given up employment and had remained at home during the first marriage and who may find themselves, in later years, when the marriage breaks down, without the benefit of a developed career to sustain them. Women remaining at home would still seem to be the most common situation in this country so that this problem could be more acute here.  What should our attitude be to possibilities such as this, and how do we envisage that the claims of the different dependants would be catered for in divorce legislation?  In other countries this has led to increasing demands on welfare authorities.</P>
    <P>Again, divorce legislation usually leads to demands for conciliation services and <Col N="1186" /> this again is a complicated matter on which the basic questions are not settled. To say simply that there should be conciliation does not advance the matter much. I presume that any conciliation arrangement should be optional since compulsion would seem to defeat the purpose. Should it be in or out of court and who should conduct it; lawyers, social workers, others?  Senators will be aware that I, as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, have already set up a pilot scheme, a three year conciliation service in Dublin, hopefully to commence before the end of the year.  I hope this will help to clarify how effective conciliation can be in these cases.</P>
    <P>My main purpose in speaking is to suggest that we need further time for debate and that we need to be clearer in our minds on basic features of the legislation which it would be appropriate to recommend in the event that a referendum to change the Constitution were to succeed. Otherwise people would, to some extent, be voting in a vacuum.  To that extent, I am not satisfied that the time is yet appropriate for the holding of a referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion emphasises three aspects, first, that the House would welcome the report &mdash; which it does &mdash; secondly, it urges the widest possible debate with which everybody would agree, and finally it calls on the Government to consider the holding of a referendum on Article 41.3.2 of the Constitution.  It is important to point out that it does not call on the Government to hold a referendum but to consider the holding of a referendum.  I would feel that a consideration of this kind would be ongoing with any Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the order of reference, the purpose of the committee was to consider the protection of marriage and family life and to examine the problems which follow the breakdown of marriage. It is worthwhile pointing out that it did not refer to divorce.  In some places, during the life of the committee, this committee was referred to as the divorce committee.  Divorce does come up for <Col N="1187" /> consideration; 20 pages are devoted to the subject, pages 71 to 91, inclusive.</P>
    <P>The media and the newspapers are inclined to label those for and against divorce in various ways.  Despite these labels it should be pointed out that those who campaign for divorce and those who are in a situation where they want divorce are really taking a conservative stance because, by and large, they are acknowledging the institution of marriage.  They are striving to get a legal termination of their marriage in order to marry again. A radical approach would be that they would want to abolish the institution of marriage altogether.  Of course this does not arise and very few people want to do that.  It is important to point out that. When the time comes for me to make my decision about divorce I would have to consider, on the one hand, the sacredness of marriage, the sanctity of marriage, the history of marriage in this country and the whole ethos regarding marriage.  On the other hand, I would have to consider, very sympathetically, the number of people who are involved in this sad and tragic situation.  The report tells us it may be as many as 36,000, which even if it is the lowest in Europe, is a considerable number.</P>
    <P>The deadline for the report was 7 July 1984.  This was extended on four occasions; on 28 June it was extended to 1 December 1984, subsequently to the 19 February 1985, then to 21 March 1985 and finally to 2 April 1985.  Personally, I welcomed those extensions because it seemed that the committee were doing their job in a very thorough manner.  I congratulate the committee on a job which was very well done.  We are told in the report that there were 500 written submissions and oral evidence from 24 different groups.  Those of us who are members of the different committees realise the hard work and the time-consuming exercise it is.  In effect, the result of this report is that we have a handbook which I am sure will be used for many years by those involved in the situation, whether as experts or those who are in a marriage breakdown situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> I agree with Senator Dooge that perhaps the report could be more readable because it does cover the legal situation in a very thorough and very exhaustive way.  Perhaps it would be an advantage, where a large report like this is concerned, to have a prêcis or a synopsis which would cover the important points.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago we had a situation in this House when Members tried to raise the matter for discussion.  I am not overanxious to get involved in this area because it is not one on which I have an great competence.  But even allowing for the time which has gone since then I feel more time would be needed for an indepth study which the subject really demands.  As Senators have pointed out previously, the situation is never a black and white one except perhaps to those who are personally involved, for whom it is always black and white.  To those who are not involved it can be a 50-50 situation or a 49-51 situation.  It is difficult to come to a conclusion in that kind of set-up.  I believe the matter will come up again in a much wider context and so my contribution will be brief.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Dooge, I look forward to hearing the contributions of the members of the committee.  I will confine my contribution to some aspects of the report. Before I do so, I would like to say that I believe that any analysis of marriage must be in the form of a dichotomy of husband and wife.  Sociologists tell us that there is overwhelming evidence of the beneficial effects of marriage to men.  Compared to single men, married men are more successful in their careers; they have higher incomes; they have a higher status occupation; their mental and physical health is significantly better and they live longer and happier lives.  It is very well established that marriage itself is responsible for this situation rather than that happier and more successful men marry.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, women's marriages present a completely different picture. There are surveys to show that more wives than husbands are unhappy in their marriage situations.  Wives suffer much more from stress, anxiety and depression than their husbands.  The physical health <Col N="1189" /> of single women is much better than married women.  Single men compare unfavourably with unmarried women.  There are few differences between married men and unmarried women, but single women are better off as far as pyschological distress symptoms are concerned, suggesting that women start out with an initial advantage which marriage reverses.</P>
    <P>In that situation we should have a special consideration for the position of women.  I do not wish to appear to be patronising and I do not want to suggest that I can presume to interpret the views of women but, looking at it objectively, I think special consideration should be given to the position of women.  I am sure, with all men, I pay a special tribute to women and to those women in our lives who have been such a great success.</P>
    <P>The change in the rate of marital breakdown reflects the change in norms and values.  Some people claim that this is because marriage is increasingly valued, that people want to get more out of married life.  They look, and perhaps rightly so, for a considerable return in many ways.  Some sociologists claim that a rise in divorce rates may indicate a higher rather than a lower standard of marriage in society, from the expectation of people.</P>
    <P>We know that the industrial society reduces the specialist functions of families and the economic bond is considerably weakened when the family is no longer a unit of production.  I would like to quote a short extract from &ldquo;Sociology Themes and Perspectives&rdquo; by M. Haralambos. On page 363:</P>
    <P>N. Dennis suggests that the specialization of function which characterizes the modern family will lead to increased marital breakdown....</P>
    <P>then it argues that:</P>
    <P>In so far as companionship, a close, durable, intimate and unique relationship with one member of the opposite sex becomes the prime necessity in marriage, failure in this respect <Col N="1190" /> becomes sufficient to lead to its abandonment.</P>
    <P>To put is simply, when love goes there is nothing much left to hold the couple together.  This has been referred to by previous speakers.  Even regarding the notion of old fashioned love we might have a question mark in some ways because, as has already been mentioned in this House, over 100 years ago marriages took place in this country at a very early age, in the early 'teens.  Many marriages were contracted before the couple even met.  There did not seem to be the great problem that might be expected from young marriages.  Perhaps love and sacrifice are losing out or not getting the attention they deserve.  At the same time I am not saying that those qualities are missing in the marriages which have broken down.  But we do know that in European countries the decreased marriage rate and the increase in marital breakdown has been as a consequence of heavy industrialisation which we did not have in this country.  Perhaps that is the reason for the change as much as the religious or the moral one, with which people are inclined to associate this situation.  Here it is a rather happy situation when compared with other European countries.</P>
    <P>The report states that the number of people who marry has not increased at the same rate as the number of persons of marriageable age has increased.  The number of marriages taking place has decreased.  This gives cause for concern. The report states, on page 2:</P>
    <P>The committee acknowledged that the present law does not provide adequate protection for those persons whose marriages do not remain viable and that this, in itself, is a threat to marriage.</P>
    <P>This is something with which the Government should be immediately concerned.</P>
    <P>The report emphasises the importance of education and preparation for marriage. This is something with which we would also agree.  I do not think that it is sufficient to prepare for marriage because <Col N="1191" /> I feel that education everywhere should be a preparation for life of which for most people marriage would be a part.  It is the duty of the State to make that provision and to see that that facility is provided. Relationships should be an essential part of education in schools.  This is important. From that point of view, sexes should not be segregated in schools.  Mixed schools are the best media for the training of young people.</P>
    <P>There should be an obligation on the State to provide easily accessible and effective counselling services for married persons.  As Senator Ferris said, we owe a great tribute to religious groups and individuals who have done trojan work in this area.  The marriage of young people presents the most difficulties.  The committee are of the opinion that the minimum age for marriages should be 18 years.  This is commonsense.  We all realise that people develop in different ways.</P>
    <P>In section 4 which deals with marriage breakdown it is stated that spouses provide for further growth in their respective personalities as well as the requirements for the rearing of children.  This is something with which nobody could take issue. Spouses should provide for further growth; they should have this ability to complement each other.</P>
    <P>Under environmental factors on page 24, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The development of birth regulation is increasingly playing a large and important part in the fabric of family life.</P>
    <P>This is an area for discussion which could be developed to quite an extent.  There is no section in the report which deals specifically with sex.  This is most important. To deal with marital breakdown and with marriage without dealing in some comprehensive way with sex is really to try to plan a motor car without the motor wheel.</P>
    <P>In this specific area the Family Planning Bill will perhaps help in the area of the family.  But there is also the other side to it, that outside the family situation <Col N="1192" /> it may do the opposite.  I would not be convinced that, taking the situation as a whole, it would be helpful rather than the opposite.  I would be somewhat apprehensive about that.  In this area the whole approach to marriage could be discussed because marriage at the very lowest consideration seems to be a licence to enjoy sex.  I would like to see a development which would consider this from the point of view of the Church, the majority Church in this country, because the teaching of the Church has been that sex outside marriage is always wrong.</P>

    <Title>Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1985: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to apologise at the outset for the absence of the Minister for the Environment who is abroad on official business and the Minister for State in the Department who unfortunately, is ill.  The Seanad will have to tolerate my presence here again.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the extension of voting rights at Dáil elections to persons other than Irish citizens who are normally resident here.</P>
      <P>Under existing law, the right to vote at Dáil elections is confined to Irish citizens. Residents who are not Irish citizens are entitled to vote at local government elections and, if they are nationals of an EC member state, they are also entitled to vote at elections to the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Senators are aware of the background to this Bill.  They will recall that the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983, which was passed by both Houses, proposed to extend voting rights at Dáil and presidential elections and at referenda to British citizens resident here.  The Bill was referred by the President to the <Col N="1193" /> Supreme Court in accordance with Article 26 of the Constitution and the Supreme Court ruled that the measure was unconstitutional.  Following that ruling, the Government decided to recommend an amendment of the Constitution which would enable the right to vote at Dáil elections to be determined by legislation.</P>
    <P>The Ninth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1984, which was passed by both Houses in April last year, proposed to allow the Oireachtas to extend to non-citizens resident in the State the right to vote at Dáil elections.  That Bill was approved by the people in a referendum held in June 1984.  It will be recalled that the proposal was approved by a majority of more than three to one.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House provides for the extension of voting rights at Dáil elections, on a reciprocal basis, to citizens of EC member states resident here.  The United Kingdom already allows Irish citizens to vote in parliamentary elections and, in recognition of this, the Bill confers directly on British citizens resident here the right to vote at Dáil elections.  Once the Bill becomes law, British citizens resident here will be eligible to be included as Dáil electors in the next register of electors and will be entitled to vote at any Dáil elections held after 15 April next.</P>
    <P>At the moment, no other member state gives voting rights at parliamentary elections to Irish citizens.  However, with the development of closer relationships between the countries of the European Community, it seems appropriate to look forward to the day when member states will be prepared to confer on each other's citizens the right to vote at parliamentary elections.  We would welcome this development and, in anticipation of it, this Bill proposes to enable the Minister by order to extend the Dáil vote on a reciprocal basis to nationals of other member states.</P>
    <P>The extension of the parliamentary franchise is an important step and the Bill, therefore, provides that any order extending the franchise must be approved in advance by a resolution of each House.</P>
    <P>The same requirements as regards <Col N="1194" /> entitlement to the Dáil vote will apply to non-citizens as apply in relation to Irish citizens at the moment.  This means that a minimum age of 18 years will apply; there can be no discrimination on the grounds of sex; the person concerned must be free from legal disqualifications in relation to voting and must be ordinarily resident in the State on the qualifying date for the register of electors, which is 15 September in the year prior to the coming into force of the register.  There is, of course, provision for specifying criteria to determine whether persons resident here are nationals of a member state for the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Apart from section 2, which provides for the extension of the voting rights, the remainder of the Bill is taken up with consequential technical changes.  These are necessary because the extension of voting rights to non-citizens relates only to Dáil elections.  Voting rights at presidential elections and referenda will still be confined to Irish citizens and a new category of elector must be created. Under the Bill this category will be &ldquo;presidential elector&rdquo; which will be confined to Irish citizens.  Only persons in this category will be allowed to vote at presidential elections and referanda.</P>
    <P>During the debates on the 1983 Bill and on the Ninth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1984, the view was expressed in both Houses that any extension of voting rights should not be confined to nationals of one particular country and that there should be provision for the granting of voting rights on a reciprocal basis to nationals of other member states of the EC resident here.  I am sure most Senators will now welcome the wider provisions of this Bill which enable this to be done.</P>
    <P>I think the proposals contained in this Bill strike the correct balance by extending voting rights to EC nationals resident here, provided their country of origin gives similar voting rights to our citizens resident there.  We are the only member state of the E.C. which already allows nationals from all other member states the right to vote at both European and local elections without reciprocation. <Col N="1195" /> This Bill can be seen as a further development of this country's open approach to the granting of the franchise to a wide category of foreigners living here and I hope it will also be seen as an important first step towards mutual extension of voting rights at parliamentary elections among EC member states.</P>
    <P>The extension of voting rights at Dáil elections to British citizens is more than just a reciprocation of the voting rights which Irish citizens have for so long enjoyed at parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom.  It is a reflection of the special relationship which exists between our two countries and I hope it will add to this relationship and to understanding between both countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation in its present form.  When the previous Bill came before this House I felt that it was unconstitutional.  I said that and it is on the record.  At that time we got an assurance from the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, that his legal advice was that it would be constitutional. There was a grave error of judgment on the part of the legal advisers, whoever they were, who advised the Minister at that time.  Fortunately enough for this State no election of any sort took place during the interim period.  We had legislation that was deemed later on to be unconstitutional but that would have been the legislation under which elections would have taken place if an election had come up in the interim period.  Luckily for us, no election was forthcoming.  We were not embarrassed in that regard.  It would have been an embarrassment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future when legislation is coming to this House the best legal advice in the land must be sought in order to ensure that it is not repugnant to the Constitution. That is the principal issue.  It could arise under other headings as well, and has arisen.  It is of the utmost importance to all legislators to know that we have proper legal guidelines.  On this occasion our legal advisers informed the Minister of State incorrectly.  I am sure he was speaking as he was advised at that time <Col N="1196" /> and that he felt it was constitutional, but later on it was found to be unconstitutional. At that time also we, on this side of the House, as you will recall, accepted the Bill because if we did not, it would appear that this side of the House was against British citizens getting the vote.</P>
    <P>Being a member of the European Community we felt that our European counterparts should have the same facilities to vote in this country as British citizens.  We stressed that in the Dáil and the Seanad while the Bill was going through the two Houses.  We felt that as we are working within a European Community and Britain being part of that Community, they had been singled out to get priority treatment as against the other nations who, as a result of this legislation, will have the right to have that reciprocal arrangement by a regulation of the Minister.  This is the first time this Bill has given power to EC member states for such legislation.  If the member states so wish to give us that reciprocal arrangement we, in turn, will hold out our hands. When this Bill reaches its conclusion we will have legislated for it.  That is how it should be.  We welcome that section of the Bill whereby EC member states are given the same right as British citizens.</P>
    <P>A prior Bill gave power to the British citizens to vote at all European and local government elections, together with presidential elections and referenda.  I welcome the deletion of the latter, which this Bill enforces.  That is how it should be, because we do not enjoy that right across the sea in Britain.  While we have a right to vote in elections we have not the right to vote in the House of Lords, or in other elections in Britain.  Sooner or later we may reach a stage in this State when a decision may have to be taken in a referendum here about our national territory, our neutrality or other major issues that may concern the nation.  I welcome the deletion whereby the presidential election and referenda register will be for Irish citizens only, as it has been heretofore.  The legislation is coming to us in the form we wanted in the first instance.  As I said at the outset, we on this side of the House did not want <Col N="1197" /> to seem to oppose that British right at a time when we were trying to get negotiations under way on the unification of this country, when we had launched the New Ireland Forum and at a time when it was conducive to introduce legislation that would bring about a better relationship with our partners across the water. At that time we felt it was necessary to accept the Bill in its form although we did sound a warning.  Our warning was justified at that time becaude it was found to be unconstitutional.  Be that as it may, the Bill is before us now in the form in which we felt it should be at the outset. I welcome it wholeheartedly on these grounds.</P>
    <P>As you know from the Bill, we will be setting up two different categories of registration for electors.  I would appeal to the Minister &mdash; who may not be the Minister involved at this time &mdash; to look into the reasons why many people were unable to vote in the recent local elections due to a variety of errors.  The right to vote at a local government election is a fundamental right.  Citizens who voted for many years found that at the recent elections they were unable to vote because they were not on the register of electors.  As legislators we should ensure that in future whoever is compiling the register should do so in a painstaking fashion and it should be screened very carefully.  There should be no errors in the way names are spelt nor should there be any deletion of traditional voters from that register whether it be through computer error, clerical error or whatever. There should be a full-scale screening in the final analysis to ensure that nobody entitled to vote should be left off the register.  Many thousands of people have been left off the register through a variety of errors which should not have occurred.</P>
    <P>When we were doing an ordinary compilation of the register of electors in each municipal authority, using the old system of checking and rechecking, before the age of science advancement and technology, we got a true and accurate register. Somehow, since we began to follow this modernised fashion of computerisation we make more errors than were ever <Col N="1198" /> made in the past.  I came across many people during the election who were unable to vote because of the mishandling of the compilation of the register.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill.  I will be looking for the interpretation of one word in this Bill on Committee Stage.  I know the Minister is anxious to get this Bill through and we are willing to go through to Committee Stage.  We will not hold up the operation. On the last occasion, we had a long teased-out debate and it is not my intention to go back and be parrot-like again. Unfortunately, a lot of time was taken up the last time with legislation that was found to be unconstitutional.  I hope everything will run smoothly on this occasion.  I welcome the Bill as it meets our requirements on this side of the House.  The other Bill did not, but we accepted it on the grounds that we would have appeared to be against the British citizen had we rejected it.  When the Taoiseach last met the British Prime Minister he gave an assurance that he would bring in legislation to provide that facility.  We are now honouring that commitment.  I am delighted that we have the opportunity to put forward amendments to the Bill.  I think the Bill will be acceptable to most people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill in its entirety and the balance it has struck arising from a previous debate in this House and even from the debate leading up to the constitutional referendum on this subject.  I would like to refer to the point made by Senator O'Toole about the register.  It has nothing to do with the Bill but it is appropriate to join with him in commenting on the way in which the register is compiled.  I am aware that every effort is made by county councils and everyone down the country to have it right but since the rate collector's functions around the country became defunct there is no common contact with people to ensure that they are on the register.  The Department of the Environment waste a lot of money on television advertisements etc. but they are not personal enough for people in country areas. On the last polling day people turned up <Col N="1199" /> in the rain without having a vote.  They had a vote on the last occasion.  There is a lack of final responsibility.  Perhaps the politicians should look after the electoral lists in their own interest.  Senator O'Toole's party will not knock off my voters nor I his.  We will share them but we would not knock them off.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was passed in 1983 the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, said they were of the opinion that its constitutionality was questionable.  They recommended as far as possible &mdash; one cannot fully recommend to the President &mdash; that it should be referred to the Supreme Court for a ruling.  It was imperative that if a Bill was passed through this House which was questionable as we realised it was, that it should be examined carefully, because, it would be indefensible if English people were allowed to vote in a general election and somebody questioned it constitutionally.  The whole election could be declared null and void.</P>
      <P>The Government in a responsible way put legislation through which contained commitments from Deputy Haughey and the Taoiseach that this reciprocal arrangement would follow through.  It was important that we check the constitutionality of it.  We did, and that necessitated a referendum.  We had a debate in this House about the referendum.  The result of the referendum without a campaign justified this legislation today. There has always been the right of Irish people in Britain to vote in general elections and it was appropriate that we would give the British people the same right here.  We have a Constitution and we have to change it to allow them to do so.  It is appropriate that anybody who lives in this country and has to work and survive under any Government should have a right to say who the Government might be and the right to change a Government if necessary.  That would be a constitutional right of anybody, a citizen or otherwise, provided he is resident and functioning in the country.  This Bill extends that right to British people here over a length of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish vote in Britain confers a <Col N="1200" /> status on the Irish in Britain.  They are very proud of it.  They use it vociferously in elections, particularly on the Labour Party side.  The Irish voter in Britain tends to be a Labour supporter.  I would hope that the English voter over here might also be a Labour supporter.</P>
    <P>The Bill also extends a bit further.  It gives the possibility of reciprocal arrangements with EC countries.  At the moment we have non-nationals living here.  Some of them were voting for the first time when I met them on polling day.  I have known them since they arrived here but they were voting for the first time.  Their interest, apart from their interest in the candidates, was in the PR system.  I had some pleasant times talking to them and explaining our PR system in relation to the list system in Holland.  They can participate in a local government election but they cannot participate in the election of a Government.  From my discussions with them they would like to be able to do something about it.  I hope that when this Bill is passed, the Minister will communicate at diplomatic level with the various countries and inform them that we have passed this legislation and that we would like a reciprocal move from them in election procedures for our people in Holland, Belgium, Germany and other places.  There is nothing contentious in the legislation.  I am glad the Opposition have agreed to take the next stage as soon as possible.  I commend the Bill to the House as being an answer to the people following a referendum on the Constitution.</P>

The situation which the Senator envisages whereby an election might have occurrred during the lifetime of the previous legislation is not accurate. The President referred the Bill to the Supreme Court so the Bill did not become operative at any stage.

Section 2 (c) states that every application shall contain such information as will satisfy the Minister that the applicant complies with the requirements as to good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence referred to or specified in regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972.

Is the Minister satisfied that Irish <Col N="1203" /> carriers will not be placed at a disadvantage compared to European carriers on the question of transport?  What is the position with regard to the transportation of Irish goods from Ireland to the Continent of Europe?  Are we now introducing a system which will penalise Irish carriers unfairly and will bring about a situation where the cost of carrying goods to Europe is an impediment to the development of industry and commerce here? Will the system obstruct the principle of convergence, which was referred to yesterday by the Taoiseach, while examining the position of the European Community? Would the Minister put the new criteria in that context for us?</P>

      <P>There is nothing relevant to that in this Bill.  There are no problems as far as Irish hauliers are concerned. There is no impediment against them on the international circuit.  These are covered by bilateral and multilateral agreements so that, in fact, we can ensure through the various arrangements we make with other countries that we get equal treatment.  I have heard this discussed at the Council of Transport Ministers. While it is an extraordinarily complicated and technical matter, generally speaking, our people are extremely happy that we suffer under no impediment and that we face all of this competition on an equal basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether the Minister would like to comment on to what extent other transport companies operating from the Continent of Europe will be able to operate in spite of low restrictions in this country?  Will it be possible for European competitors of all transport industry competing for the transportation of goods between Ireland and the Continent to use bigger lorries than would otherwise be used on our roads?  What will be the effect of these on the economics of the Irish transport industry and on the road maintenance programme of the Government?</P>

      <P>All hauliers are entitled <Col N="1204" /> to operate under Community law of free circulation.  There are bilateral and multilateral agreements.  There are certain restrictions as regards weight, but that does not arise under this Bill we are dealing with here.  There are restrictions which various countries have and various efforts are being made at international level to get a uniform common system which is naturally not possible.  There has been an ongoing situation for the past 25 years which Ministers for Transport are trying to sort out.  As far as this is concerned, there are regulations which give free access to hauliers on an EC basis. There are certain restrictions as regards weight, but that does not arise here.</P>

      <P>Surely our national hauliers are going into a new dimension. Senator O'Leary is quite right in saying he will pursue this further.  I want to pursue it a little further.  Our traditional hauliers have been pegged to radius counties within a certain radius and provinces and, indeed, to the Twenty-six Counties heretofore.  Now the new dimension will be that our national hauliers will be going into the European Community to compete against traditional hauliers that have been competing and travelling the length and breadth of Europe.  They have the type of articulated truck that is suitable to travel the whole of Europe and, indeed, the eastern bloc.  In addition to the language barrier and the unladen weight barrier, as a result of this Bill our traditional haulier will now have to compete with the international haulier who knows the language and the geographical terrain of the country and who has the personnel, trucks, organisation and back-up services all geared for international haulage.  For the first time we are breaking into that type of haulage and we are not accustomed to it.  We will not be able to compete in unladen weight or in prices.  The likelihood of getting a return load for an Irish haulier is a lot less than it is for a haulier from Spain, Germany, France or from any other <Col N="1205" /> State.  The Irish haulier has to depend on whatever type of imports might be coming into this country but a continental haulier can pick up a load in one part of Europe and have a return load as he has the organisation, the experience and the geographical spread.</P>

      <P>I will leave it.  If you apply for an international licence, does that international licence cover you for the national scene as well?  There are two types of licences.  You can apply for a national licence or an international one. If you get a national licence you cannot drive abroad, but if you apply for the international one, can you compete both internally and internationally?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I will answer that, it certainly does not come under the Bill as far as the Continental situation is concerned. There is a large number of hauliers already operating extremely successfully on the Continent, who have all this expertise at this moment and who are operating extremely successfully. What would happen under this Bill is that extra people would get licences and they, if they get an international licence, would be entering in that field as well.  But it has already been very well proved by our own hauliers who are operating there that they can do so very successfully.  Nothing will take away from their activity but there will be extra people coming in who, I am sure, will be equally successful and who will make it more difficult for the continentals but not for our own people.</P>
      <P>The international licence is the extra dimension licence.  If a man gets an international licence he will be covered for national work, but if he has a national licence without the extra dimension of an international one, as the term indicates he will be confined to national activities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>every application shall contain such <Col N="1206" /> information as will satisfy the Minister that the applicant complies with the requirements as to good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence referred to or specified in regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>When one looks for a certificate of competence, having passed the AnCO exams, the last question on that certificate asks if one is of sound financial standing, has entered any agreement with a bank or has entered into any financial arrangement with creditors.  I would not know of anybody in the road haulage business who would not have an arrangement with a bank or with hire purchase companies or with leasing company. There is no way the person could sign that form realistically because he would have made a deal already with a hire purchase company or a bank to purchase his vehicle.  What is the situation regarding, not the question of sound financial standing, but the actual question on the certificate of competence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point the Senator is making and I will take note of it.  In practice, and this has been operating in the past, it has never given rise to any difficulties except where the person involved was not of sound financial standing. It was, of course, extremely useful in that respect.  What we have here is the previous experience the Senator is talking about but it has not given rise to any difficulties except where the person was not of sound financial standing.  In other words, there was no difficulty for the person who was of sound financial standing in meeting the criteria and getting through as far as his licence was concerned. Naturally, and obviously this is the purpose of it, it did create difficulties in a limited number of cases where people were not of sound financial standing.  Of course, that is the value of it to the general haulage business and to the general public as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that anybody who has a signed arrangement with a <Col N="1207" /> bank or a hire purchase company and who then signs the declaration form will be making a false declaration.  The provision gives an out to the Department at any stage, irrespective of a person's standing financially, to revoke his licence because he has made a false statement. The Department will say that that is not what they mean, but it is stated quite categorically that an arrangement made with a creditor or with a financial institution disqualifies an applicant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume what is meant by an arrangement would be an arrangement of the kind mentioned in the Companies Act, an arrangement with creditors, meaning that you have come to an agreement with creditors for them to write off some of their debts to you. An arrangement does not mean one has done a deal with a bank.  It means that there is an agreement that they would forego some of their liabilities if one was not in sound financial circumstances.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm that that is what is meant by an arrangement, rather than that one borrowed money.  I presume what is meant by an arrangement is that one has an agreement with a financial institution or with creditors for them to forego part of their debt so as to retain the financial viability of the operation. That is what an arrangement is.  It is not just an agreement.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator O'Leary for coming in on behalf of the Minister but while one can play around with words for as long as one wishes the fact is that the question is asked and the applicant has to sign a guarantee that he has not made a financial arrangement with anybody. If one walks into a bank and makes a financial arrangement, that arrangement may not be what one thinks it is but it is what it says and that is important.</P>

If, however, the <Col N="1208" /> Minister would confirm that a financial arrangement in this context means a financial arrangement in the technical company law sense, then for a person to borrow money from a bank and to be in the process of paying it back in the normal way is not a financial arrangement within the meaning of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is well aware that in the personnel involved in haulage throughout the length and breadth of this State since the 1933 Act, a lot of traditional hauliers felt that when this type of additional licence would be issued, giving a semi liberalisation of haulage, some compensation or protection would be forthcoming to existing hauliers. Would the Minister state whether it will be easy to come by a new national or international licence in the future?  My interpretation is that if one is well got and has a fair type of statistical presentation on one's application form that will be the requirement for getting one of the new licences.  If they are going to be given out <Col N="1209" /> ad lib, as might be the case under this new legislation, the existing hauliers who depend on their haulage for a livelihood will have their trade severely damaged by fellows who will get into the haulage business.  Firms who are doing their own haulage may now apply for international licences and may compete against our own traditional licence holders.  Will there be any protection for the existing hauliers on the enactment of this legislation?</P>
      <P>There is a great fear in the minds of hauliers at present that these licences will be given out by civil servants, that they will be numerous and that you will have the Johhny Come Lately who knows nothing whatsoever about haulage going into this field of operation, who will no doubt damage the status of Irish hauliers internationally which will have a damaging effect on our existing fleet of traditional experiencd hauliers.  The Minister said most Irish hauliers are successfully doing business abroad.  If that is the case, will the Johnny Come Lately who will be issued with licences ad lib come into the market, unable to give a service, and complete with our traditional hauliers. This may reduce fares and tonnage rates right across the board.  I would like the Minister to comment on the new licences and how they will be issued.  Will they be issued on demand or determined by the amount of work that cannot be carried out by the existing system?  That should be the criterion for issuing new licences. Where there is a shortage of proper international traditional licensed hauliers and they are unable to do the job effectively because of an overload of work you may have to put in one or two additional hauliers to take up that slack.  Only in these cases should additional licences be granted.  I would ask the Minister to make a statement here on that issue.  It is an important issue in the minds of existing hauliers who have been in the trade since 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that this is a liberalisation move and that is accepted.  This will mean more licences. <Col N="1210" /> But that should not result in less work for licensed hauliers.  The situation was pretty chaotic with a vast number of regulations, some being adhered to and others not being adhered to.  Liberalisation first took place in 1971.  At that stage own account hauliers had 80 per cent of the market.  That has been substantially reduced since the liberalisation and the development of the professional hauliers with the result that own account hauliers has decreased to the region of 60 per cent.  Our belief is that with this further very badly needed development, professional hauliers will gain a further slice of the market which is being handled on an own account system.  There will be extra licences but the granting of new licences will have to conform to the regulations specified under the European Communities Act, 1972.</P>
      <P>It is not a question of filling in a form and getting a licence.  It is recognised that there are various interests on all sides and there will be a readjustment period as far as licensed hauliers are concerned. Because of that, and as a fair compromise, the new licences will not be available for a two year period.  The overall reaction of hauliers to this legislation, while there are reservations, has been pretty good.  It is felt by everybody that this type of legislation is needed because there is a great deal of unlicensed haulage taking place.  The situation should be clarified when the Bill is in operation. With a new legal structure for which everyone has been asking, there is no doubt that professional hauliers will be able to win over, through their competence as professionals, a much larger slice of the own account haulage that is now being carried out by the various companies throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said and we all know, that there is a huge amount of illegal haulage going on.  For the Minister to admit that his Department are aware that illegal haulage is going on is an indictment of the authorities who allow illegalities to occur.  There are many facets. There are illegal radio stations which <Col N="1211" /> nobody bothers about.  The Minister admitted that he is aware that there are illegal hauliers now operating.  One of the problems is that nothing has been done about it.  If something had been done by the authorities to stop this illegality, there would be very little opposition to the liberalisation which is taking place and which, basically, will give to illegal hauliers, if they get a certificate of competence, the same rights as somebody who has been adhering to the law throughout the years.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to comment on that and to specify what the situation is regarding own account licences.  In many cases own account business has been carried out by limited companies.  Can limited companies obtain an own account road haulage licence, or will they have to employ somebody who has a certificate of competence in each firm considering going into own account haulage?  If somebody from that firm who has a certificate of competence leaves the company, do they have to employ somebody who holds a certificate of competence?  The Bill does not specify that an individual in the own account company has to have a certificate of competence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point is that obstruction of the liberalisation by a number of vested interests &mdash; which would include hauliers themselves &mdash; generated the conditions that led to illegal hauliers.  We are now regularising the whole thing.  This will, we hope, get rid of illegal hauliers.  Similarly the Local Radio Bill, when introduced, will be the vehicle through which pirates can be got off the air.  We are taking action at this stage.  Own account applications are treated in the normal way.  They have to meet the various criteria.  If such people obtain a licence then they can carry for reward like everybody else.  As far as the situation of the manager is concerned there is no specific reference to own account applications.  There is simply a reference to applications by any type of applicant and the conditions are laid down in the later sections of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the same as any other company, even as a professional operator. A professional haulage company which is not owned by a single person has to have a designated person who would be the manager.  We will be coming to that in later sections of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The first liberalisation took place when we allowed livestock and grain to be hauled.  A lot of livestock was going on rail at that time and the same applied to grain, manures and other merchandise but at the moment there are no grain or cattle wagons available.  If you wanted to send a wagon of cattle from one point to another you could not get a cattle wagon.  CIE have not got a cattle wagon.  The amount of merchanidse travelling by rail at the moment is negligible.  That is one of the things liberalisation brought about.  It took trade away from CIE, both in livestock, grain, manures and so on.  The own account people who had to get their merchandise to and from their plants and mills had to get their own fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No attempt whatever has been made by the Department of Justice in the past few years to rectify the situation with regard to illegal haulage.  I believe that under the new legislation it is not the intention to have the personnel available for any surveillance of illegal haulage.  I have seen nobody from the Department of Justice who has been interested in illegal haulage over the past number of years.  I hope the Minister will give me some assurance that in the future when this Bill is enacted we will have the personnel to do the job.  At one time we had a fleet of Garda squad cars to wipe out illegal haulage, but they are not on the road today.  That was ten years ago.  We had a fleet assigned to the different locations. Is the Minister going to re-introduce these squad cars for that purpose alone under the new Bill?  If he is not we <Col N="1213" /> will have a further liberalisation that will only damage the existing haulier.  I see no protection whatever in this Bill for the existing haulier.</P>
    <P>Liberalisation will not help existing hauliers.  They have their tradition and they have their organisations built up. They have their expertise and a big capital investment in trucks and trailers. From the tone of the Minister's speech it will be very easy to get an international or national licence under the new system, and I will be advising my people to make application immediately.  They are there for the taking.  This certificate of competence is just a free for all and will be detrimental to existing hauliers.  They will have no protection whatever and no compensation. We will have a type of haulier coming on the market whom we would not like to regard as the Irish haulier because he will not have the expertise or experience required for the haulage business either nationally or internationally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the Minister's liberalisation which is referred to and in fact introduced by the section which we are now dealing with, section 3.  The position is factually as stated by Senator O'Toole, but that is the way it should be.  Existing hauliers should not be protected.  The competition which will result from the implementation of this Bill, and section 3 in particular, should be welcomed because it will lead to a better quality of service.  It is up to the Minister to ensure that the criteria are applied sensibly.  There will be a limitation on the number of people who will be able to qualify because, obviously, if they do not have the right equipment they will not qualify, particularly for the international licence.  I presume the Minister will indicate to us that a more stringent requirement will exist in respect of the actual equipment in the case of an application for an international licence then in the case of an application for a national licence.  I would expect that to be the case but, subject to that, the more competition we have in this area the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> I have sympathy, of course, for the existing hauliers but it was never intended that this would become a system whereby licences issued by the State should be worth money and be sold by one person to another.  That was never the intention of the legislation and we have got to be careful of that kind of a licensing situation in the future, and not create a situation where licences issued by the State become in themselves valuable assets. This is what has happened over the years in the haulage business and it is not in the long term interests of the haulage business or the consumer that that should happen.  Section 3(1) (a), (b) and (c) specifically outlines the holders of existing licences and certificates of one kind or another and extends to them the facility of trading in their licence for either a national or an international licence.  I support section 3 and the Minister's attitude to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few comments on what Senator O'Leary said. Of course there is no reason at all why the State should issue licences for road haulage.  The only reason they were brought in in the first place was to protect CIE.  They did not protect CIE because CIE were not able to protect themselves. There is absolutely no reason, except a bureacratic reason, why we should have road haulage licences at all.  What we should have are road vehicles which are adequately taxed, adequately insured and adequately maintained and let the marketplace dictate the number of vehicles on the road.  Therefore, there is no reason why the State should be involved in the issuing of licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I cannot agree with the Senator's assessment of the state of the industry.  He states that the consumer will be protected by the liberalisation of the haulage industry.  The Senator must not be reading the advertisements put in by hire purchase companies and garages for repossessed vehicles over the past number of months.  People in the haulage business, whether they are licensed or unlicensed, cannot afford to keep their vehicles.  The only people who are really <Col N="1215" /> benefitting are the banks and the hire purchase companies.  The hauliers, whether legal or illegal at present, are getting rates which they were getting in 1978.  They are running vehicles which are costing ten times more at running costs which are 100 times more than they were in 1978.  Liberalisation will not help the consumer.  If too many licences are brought on the market the rate will go down, people will go out of business and there will be an inadequate haulage system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question of what happened in the livestock industry after the liberalisation in 1971.  At that period a vast amount of livestock was in fact being carried illegally. Then you had decontrol.  There was a rush at that stage of many people into this business but the experience since has been rather illuminating as far as the possible effects of this Bill are concerned. In fact most of the livestock carried now has returned to the professional hauliers. The business has gone back to the professionals. Senator Lanigan just now enunciated fairly clearly the guiding principle behind the Bill, that quality should dictate. There certainly will be licences available for people who will have the competence and the financial standards and, of course, there are very strict regulations as regards the standard of the vehicles.  This is governed by an EC regulation operated here by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and Senator Lanigan raised the question of the enforcement of the new regulations when they are introduced.  On Second Stage Senator Lanigan made various suggestions.  These are still being considered but I can assure the House that this Bill, which will we hope become an Act very soon, will be strictly enforced.  There is absolutely no point in making new regulations if they are allowed to go by default.  There will be strict enforcement of the regulations. The points raised by Senator Lanigan on the Second Stage debate are being <Col N="1216" /> considered.  Those points relate to the policing that might be introduced.</P>

      <P>Will there be any identification on the vehicle, under the new licence, that will be visible to the gardaí or indeed to anybody so that they will be able to identify these trucks in transit rather than holding them up at a check point to interview the driver to see if in fact he is a merchandise licence holder at all?  There was an old system where a plate was attached, but it was not visible at a distance.  Will there be any identification that will be visible to most people so that everybody throughout the State will know that this is one of the new international or national licences under the new legislation?  There should be something that would be identifiable at a long distance to enable the Garda and for other merchandise licence holders to identify their own counterparts.</P>
      <P>Has there been any discussion with the Northern Ireland people who seem to have an advantage in hopping across the Border?  They have cheaper diesel, cheaper tyres, cheaper running costs, cheaper trucks and they are doing a lot of internal haulage here.  Is there any discussion taking place with the Minister's counterpart across the Border in connection with this type of in and out haulage from the Six Counties?</P>

      <P>The present regulations, as Senator O'Toole pointed out, involve the carrying of a plate and also the driver has to carry a copy of the licence.  There is nothing in this Bill which suggests any change but I note very well and I am impressed by the points made by the Senator in this respect.  I will ask for them to be examined because obviously that would facilitate the people who are responsible for enforcing the law and would be beneficial.  Northern Ireland people carrying goods are subject to the same laws as people within this State and if they are carrying illegally, or not qualified to carry here, they are subject to the laws just as people are here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a series of questions to ask.  They relate to section 4 and they are interrelated with section 5 but I think they are properly asked under section 4.  Section 4 seeks to substitute a new section for section 14 in the principal Act.  Section 4 of the Bill says &ldquo;Every merchandise licence, being a national road freight carrier's licence, shall entitle the holder...&rdquo;  I want to emphasise the word &ldquo;holder&rdquo;.  That is the person who is entitled to carry on a merchandise road transport business in the State.  Take a limited liability company operating transport.  I understand from the Minister, from various answers he has given to Senator Lanigan and other speakers, that it is a designated person within that company who is going to be the holder of that licence.  It might be the secretary of the company or somebody who is a director of the company. The person who is going to be held legally responsible is the holder of the licence rather than the company.  Look at that and compare it with the revocation of the merchandise licence dealt with in the following section.  Under (b) it says &ldquo;on the ground that the holder has been convicted of an offence&rdquo;.  It talks about the holder.  In the case of most offences relating to motor vehicles compliance with the law is mostly the responsibility of the registered owner of the vehicle rather than anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here a situation where somebody is convicted of breaking some condition of the licence, or convicted of carrying too much weight, or convicted of having the vehicle in a dangerous condition, or convicted of not conforming with some other statutory obligation. It is the intention of the Minister <Col N="1219" /> that that would be one of the circumstances in which the Minister could consider the revocation of the licence.  It is right and proper that that should be the case, for example, if the vehicle was found to be on the public road uninsured that should come within the ambit of the Minister to decide that the holder of the licence would no longer be a suitable person to operate an international or national road licence.  In the case of an insurance problem it is not the holder of the licence that would be convicted but the registered owner of the licence who may not be the same person as the holder of the licence.  The holder of the licence and the registered owner may be two different people.  The registered owner could be convicted of a string of offences but the holder of the licence would not be convicted of any offence.</P>
    <P>Unless there is some other provision in the Principal Act with which I am not familiar &mdash; if there is, the Minister will let me know &mdash; that links the two of them, the Minister should consider making it an obligation that the holder of the licence should, for the purpose of the Road Traffic Act, be considered the registered owner of the licence and should be expected to conform with the Road Traffic Act and all other statutory requirements in every respect in his or her personal capacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>To cover the various points raised by Senator Lanigan, if the proprietor of a haulage business has notice of a change then he must arrange to get a new manager in good time for that.  If a manager leaves suddenly without giving any appropriate notice the problem of the difficulties that may arise there is something I will have examined. While it would be possible to take a lenient action in that case and allow a reasonable time, there may be considerations that there should be some specific provision for and I will have that point examined.  Section 12 covers the case of emergency where we have death, physical or legal incapacity.  I do not think legal incapacity would cover the point made <Col N="1220" /> by Senator Lanigan as I myself thought it would.  That covers what happens in those cases.  Section 5 (c) covers the case where he continues without having a designated manager.  The licence can then be revoked where there is not a designated manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the points I have made?  There appears to be a distinction being drawn between the holder of the licence and the registered owner of the licence.  The holder of the licence being a different person from the registered owner need not necessarily be held responsible for the road traffic offences, including the non-insurance of the vehicle.  As a result of that the holder of the licence would not be responsible and it would not be open to the Minister to revoke a person's licence for the flagrant violation of these very important provisions.</P>

      <P>In section 4, if we look at line 8 it says: &ldquo;Every merchandise licence, being a national road freight carrier's licence, shall entitle the holder...&rdquo; I am asking the Minister whether he should re-define the word &ldquo;holder&rdquo; to include the registered owner, whether they should become one and the same person for the purpose of marrying together the duties and responsibilities under this Bill which devolve upon the holder of the licence and the duties and responsibilities under the Road Traffic Act which devolve on the registered owner of the vehicle.  That is the point I am making and it arises because this is a section under which we are deciding that the person who shall be entitled to carry on the business in the holder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to reinforce what Senator O'Leary said when he dealt with section 14 on &ldquo;penalties&rdquo;, it does not mention the holder at all when referring to penalties.  There are no penalties for the holder of the licence in that section. <Col N="1221" /> It talks about &ldquo;Every person who carries merchandise in contravention of this section...&rdquo;  If the owner of the vehicle is carrying the material surely there should be a penalty on the holder of the licence as well as &mdash; that being the own account situation &mdash; the owner of the vehicle.  It is to the owner that the penalties apply and not to the holder.  There is a double problem there as between the owner and the holder.</P>

      <P>In connection with the points raised by Senator O'Leary with regard to a licence in a family unit where the holder of the licence is the husband in that family and in the event &mdash; and it is not too uncommon today &mdash; that the husband takes off at any time with his merchandise licence, does the merchandise licence go with him, or is the business that stays behind eligible to run the concern for the future?  Or, has he the right, as has happened in other cases, to sell his interest to a third party and leave the family unit high and dry in poor circumstances? Would it be advisable &mdash; it would not apply to a company &mdash; that new applications should be in joint family <Col N="1222" /> names where family units are concerned, or could the Minister give any guidance on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The point being raised by Senator O'Toole might possibly be more appropriate to family law than it is to transport law.  But the situation as I see it is that the deserted spouse &mdash; that is what the Senator is talking about &mdash; could then apply for a licence or could have some designated person apply for a licence for that haulage business.  The licence as such is designated to an individual who would possibly be the husband in this case, or the manager, or whatever, of the company.  It is not something that could be provided for here but I can see that it might be necessary to have it regularised again.  I imagine it could be done through a manager or perhaps if the spouse was a competent person he or she could qualify for a licence.  It is a new slant that I had not anticipated coming up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Under section 5 (b) the Minister may revoke or suspend a licence</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>...on the ground that the holder has been convicted of an offence (whether under this or any other Act) in relation to the business to which the licence <Col N="1223" /> relates or a vehicle used in such business,...</P>
    <P>There are two points I want to raise. Could the Minister define what offence he is referring to under the Act?  It just says &ldquo;convicted of an offence&rdquo;.  Could he elaborate on what would constitute an offence under the Act.&rdquo;  The second question is: where you have a licence for six trucks, do I take it that if one of your trucks was involved in an offence, your licence would be revoked or withdrawn for the other five trucks?  One question is to define the offence and the other is if one licensed truck comes under penalty for an offence, do the other five operate under the existing licence, or does the revocation effect the one truck rather than the six?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the second question first, yes, all would.  It is the licensee who would be involved.  As far as the various offences are concerned, this is a re-enactment of existing law, and could cover any persistent breach of the regulations as far as his licence was concerned. The question also would have to be considered whether a licence would be revocable if the vehicles as such were being used in criminal activities such as smuggling, if you like, and other types of criminal activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider making it a specific offence under the Principal Act and under this section which we are now substituting for section 24 (2) of the Principal Act, allowing the Minister to revoke at his discretion a specific case where there has been an insurance offence under the Act?  I have in mind the difficulties expressed by my colleagues, particularly in the early stages of this legislation, where an increased number of people might decide that they are going to go into this business. I have no doubt that what the Minister said happened after 1971 or 1972 will happen again, it will eventually consolidate in the professionals.  In the meantime there could be quite a number of <Col N="1224" /> small-time &mdash; and I do not want to use the word &ldquo;cowboy&rdquo;, but something like that &mdash; operators in the area.  It is very important that we put great emphasis on the need for these people to be adequately insured and that a conviction for an offence, which is an insurance offence, should be taken very seriously by the Minister because it has grave repercussions for the public at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I go absolutely along with the point made by Senator O'Leary as regards the gravity of insurance offences.  It is one of the totally unacceptable factors that people should drive on the roads with the possibility of all the damage they could do, even while doing their best, or while being a threat because of some accident that might arise.  I do not think any vehicle should be allowed on the road without adequate insurance.  As I understand it, the insurance offence would be covered under section 5 (b).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, getting back to the own account and to try and get the own account situation totally clarified, section 5 (b) states that a licence may be revoked:</P>
      <P>on the ground that the holder has been convicted of an offence... in relation to the business to which the licence relates or a vehicle used in such business,</P>
      <P>Does that mean that in the case of a company which is carrying say, ice cream, or the businessman in the own account class who is convicted of an offence under the hygiene Acts, that his certificate of competence can be withdrawn from him? If that is not the case it should be stated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such thing as own account licences as such.  It is useful for explaining, I suppose, the point that the Senator is making.  There is no such thing as own account or a licence for hauliers under the various criteria laid down here.  I would not imagine that that relates to the business to which the licence relates.  I cannot be totally dogmatic <Col N="1225" /> about it; I will have it checked out for the Senator but I do not think it would be grounds as contemplated by section 5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister and accept that he could not possibly see that it could happen, but it broadens the grounds on which a revocation could take place, whether under this or any other Act.  It says &ldquo;the business to which the licence relates&rdquo;; The licence is there for the vehicles.  The business might be a totally different business.  It might not have anything to do with the road transport end of it.</P>

Under section 112 of the 1944 Act a person who uses a vehicle of which he is not the owner to carry his own goods is deemed to be carrying for reward and would be required to hold a merchandise licence. <Col N="1228" /> The new provision in section 9 (6) provides that where a person leases or hires a vehicle without a driver to carry his own goods he shall be deemed for the purpose of section 112 of the 1944 Act to be the owner of the vehicle.  This new provision and the repeal of the Road Transport Act, 1956, will in effect extend to own account operators the facility to lease or hire vehicles which is at present enjoyed by licensed hauliers, users of vehicles of 2.5 metric tonnes unladen weight and persons using vehicles in exempted areas.

      <P>This is the section dealing mainly with penalties.  I will just go back to the points that were made earlier by Senator O'Toole.  There is no point in having penalties listed in legislation unless there are enough people out on the roads to check out, to catch these people who are contravening sections of this Bill.  I would like the Minister to say how many convictions there have been under the tachograph legislation over the past five years since tachograph legislation came in.  I know that no one would have this at the tips of his fingers but I feel that if we bring in legislation which is restrictive in some senses but which is for the good of the public and is good for the environment, we should have enough people on the ground to enable the legislation to be monitored effectively.

If you go abroad with a road vehicle and commit an offence you cannot move that vehicle from the spot on which the offence has been committed until whatever problem there is has been sorted out, or the vehicle will be towed away.  In this country &mdash; this particularly applies to foreign vehicles &mdash; lorries can be overloaded, underloaded, or can have no <Col N="1230" /> tachograph and yet they can drive away. A summons might arrive perhaps three months later in Bulgaria.  What difference does it make then?  That truck will never be back in Ireland again and there is no law enforcement at all.  Are we strengthening the law so that people who came in from outside can be effectively stopped from misusing our roads under any circumstances?</P>

      <P>I regret that the exact figure for prosecutions on tachograph offences is not immediately available but it is thought to be, perhaps in the region of 1,000 prosecutions taken but that does not necessarily mean successful prosecutions. As far as the power to confiscate or immobilise a vehicle goes, there was a provision for that in the legislation but it was repealed.  We have substantially increased penalties for offences but we have not gone as far as confiscation or the other method of immobilisation mentioned by the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

      <P>There is a lack of willingness on the part of the Department to deal with the offences if we are not going to allow the temporary immobilisation or the confiscation of a vehicle for the time being.  The Minister is saying that if there is a vehicle on the road which is grossly overloaded and in that situation its brakes could not work properly, the whole system could not work properly.  It is being stated that that driver can get back into his cab with a note from the garda or a note from a person from the Department of the Environment nothing that an offence has been committed.  The driver then merrily drives up to the North or down to the docks.  He could cause a major accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, if a vehicle from the North is stopped on the Naas dual carriageway with four bald tyres and a garda summons him, telling him he has four bald tyres, the driver says: &ldquo;That is grand, I have four bald tyres&rdquo;.  The garda gives him a summons for having four bald tyres and he drives up to the North with the four bald tyres and he could jackknife going up Hackball's Cross and create the type <Col N="1231" /> of accident we have seen too often in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently there was provision in the 1933 legislation for confiscation of an offending vehicle but considering the present values it was thought since then that that penalty was too severe.  As far as offences against the transport regulations are concerned, perhaps confiscation would be too severe, but there are some elements that come under the Department of the Environment and other elements that come under the Department of Justice.  Certainly, where a vehicle is dangerous, in the circumstances as pointed out by the Senator, it should not, as far as possible, be allowed to continue to be dangerous. Accidents might easily occur in circumstances where deficiencies such as bald tyres exist.  I will keep in mind the points that have been raised by the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about confiscation until the offence is rectified.  If a truck driver from Ireland is going through England and his tachograph is not in order, when he reaches the docks in Liverpool and is checked by the tachograph official from the Department of the Environment over there, he will not be allowed to leave the docks until he gets the tachograph system in working order. That is a provision we should have here. If somebody is stopped for a tachograph offence he should have to produce evidence, within a day or two, showing that he has fixed his tachograph system.  If it is a case of a vehicle being in a dangerous condition, there should be an immediate temporary confiscation of that vehicle. When I say temporary confiscation I mean that the gardaí should have the power to phone a competent garage or a competent MOT station to tow that vehicle off the road immediately and to have the fault rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Such things as the tachograph are dealt with by us, by the Department of Communications, and possibly by this legislation.  Such things <Col N="1232" /> as bald tyres and defective vehicles are dealt with elsewhere.  I will take those points into consideration.</P>

      <P>Is it the intention of the Minister to consolidate the legislation now, or are there amendments coming which will make that inappropriate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be desirable if it could be consolidated, but it was felt that this was the best way to proceed at this stage because there was great pressure for this type of Bill.  Hopefully, at some future stage it will be consolidated, but there is no present plan for it.  It is a question of when we can get around to the consolidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have some consideration for the person who is trying to understand that.  There are a number of different pieces of paper which it is necessary to have in order to understand this legislation.  We are talking about the Act of 1933, the Act of 1971, the Act of 1978, and the Act of 1978 inserting things into the Act of 1933 and they, in turn, being taken out and re-inserted in this Act of 1985.  It is becoming incomprehensible. It was incomprehensible in 1933 and it is getting even worse now.  Eventually even the Minister will not be able to understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that he will have the absolute support of my Department in what he is saying. Indeed, we came across examples of it during the course of this Bill.  This is an incredibly complicated Bill, referring back to several Acts.  Consolidation, of course, would be the ideal thing.  I will pass that along with the strongest recommendation, but it is really a question of time with a lot of new legislation coming along.  I would like to see it consolidated. <Col N="1233" /> I know that it would be extremely useful for all people referring to it, because it is a very laborious task trying to put all the pieces together and to follow it in a coherent fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the various points raised by Senators O'Leary, O'Toole and Lanigan, and from the Minister's commitments that he will look at them, could I respectfully suggest to the Minister that as these problems were identified in this House in the Bill as initiated, that he would do us the courtesy, over the weekend, of looking at them?  We will take the final Stages of the Bill at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 2 July. There will be ministerial amendments, if they are considered necessary.  There will not be a debate on them.  The Minister will have the Bill as he considers whether it should be amended or not and the advice from his Department within a matter of 20 minutes on Tuesday.  As a House of legislation we would prefer to ensure that the problems we have raised on the Bill would be discussed and finalised in this House because we would have no control over them when they go to the other House.  I would prefer, as acting <Col N="1234" /> Leader of the House, if the Minister would agree to that.  The Minister has been most co-operative in going through the legislation with us.  Perhaps he will agree finally to allow us to have the final tidy-up on it on Tuesday.  We will then facilitate the Minister for the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with that, but it might not be possible to have the various considerations completed in time for that.  I am naturally anxious to get all Stages through so that we can get the legislation through before the summer recess.  It might not be possible to have the considerations finished by the next sitting.</P>
