      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Higgins that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the public disquiet following media reports of the guidelines circulated to members of the Catholic Managers Association the need for the Minister for Education to confirm that these guidelines which restrict appointments to practising Roman Catholics are not the ones which will prevail in the making of appointments as national teachers and that professional qualifications and competence as a potential teacher will be the criteria that the Department of Education will require.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in that order and to suspend the sitting from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and to take No. 5 from 6.30 p.m. until 8 p.m.  For the information of <Col N="764" /> Senators, it is proposed that the House should sit tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we have an indication from the Leader of the House about the arrangements for business today, tomorrow and next week?  I think it is important at this stage that we should know, if not exactly, at least what his intentions are for tomorrow and next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in regard to the question of tomorrow's sitting, it is proposed that we should resume, as is customary on Thursdays, the debate on reports of joint committees.  It is not anticipated that tourism, even if reached today, would be concluded today. Accordingly, I think it will take up a fair amount of time tomorrow.  If the debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Small Business in relation to tourism is concluded we will then move to the report of the EC Joint Committee on Nine Statutory Instruments.  If that should be concluded before 4 p.m. tomorrow we will then move to the report of the Joint Committee on Building Land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of next week, I understand that discussions have not yet concluded between the Whips in another place in regard to when the Appropriation Bill will be passed by the Dáil. Senators will realise that the Appropriation Bill must be passed into law before the conclusion of the calendar year.  The position is that the Seanad has been extremely badly served in this regard down through the years, the Bill being passed at the last moment by the Dáil and the Seanad then being obliged to pass the Bill without debate, and debate the substance of it on a motion in January. Last year the situation was remedied.  I am sure other Senators share my hope that what happened last year would continue to be the practice.  My latest information is to the effect that the Appropriation Bill may not pass Dáil Éireann on Tuesday which would allow us to have a substantial debate on it next Wednesday and Thursday.  As soon as I have any definite information, I will be <Col N="765" /> talking to the representatives of the groups so that we can best decide how we can organise our work.  I have already conveyed to the Opposition Whip my view that if at all possible we should debate the Appropriation Bill for a few hours without prejudice to a full two-day or three-day debate in the New Year. Whether, indeed the time of the passing of the Bill will enable us to do that or not, I think the dignity of this House calls for some measure of debate on that Bill and not a mere passage of it as we walk out for the Christmas break.</P>
    <P>The other legislation which is expected to pass through Dáil Éireann this week and be taken by us next week is the Valuation Bill and the Irish Steel Bill.  In addition, there is a Social Welfare order, which will not be controversial and will be taken next week.  I understand there will probably be two orders from the Department of Agriculture which will also be taken next week.  As already indicated, the statutory order in regard to the creation of Galway County Borough will be moved as the first item of business tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered everything.  I will be in touch with the representatives of the groups as the programme becomes more definite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>To ensure that there will be some discussion on the Valuation Bill and the Irish Steel Bill, I presume we will be taking only the Second Stage of each of those?  There should be absolutely no question that next week we should have to rush through very important pieces of legislation such as the Valuation Bill and the Irish Steel Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare order will go through quickly, but I do not think we should be put into a situation next week where the Appropriation Bill is going to be rushed through, voted on and discussed afterwards by this House.  This <Col N="766" /> is not a suitable way to deal with the Appropriation Bill.  Equally, I do not think that next week we should be forced to take all Stages of the Valuation Bill, which has enormous implications for householders or for business people throughout the country.  If that is the intention, I will say now that I will disagree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that it is necessary that both the Valuation Bill and the Irish Steel Bill be made law.  Certainly it is highly desirable, but whether it is absolutely essential I do not know.  These are Bills in which there are very important points of principle, which, of course, is the substance of the Second Stage.  I have always argued in this House and always endeavoured to dispose the business of this House in such a way that Committee Stages are not rushed.  It should be possible to have all Stages of these Bills taken without curtailing debate.</P>
      <P>I do not know exactly the position in regard to the Dáil.  It will be necessary to have discussion in the course of today but I am prepared and this side of the House would be prepared, to meet three days next week in order to ensure that there could be separate Committee Stages on both these Bills.</P>

    <Title>International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, 1985    [Certified Money Bill]:    Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise a voluntary contribution of £8,330,000 by the Irish Government to the seventh replenishment of the resources of the International Development Associations and to authorise a voluntary contribution of £1,500,000 to the Special Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa which will be administered by the International Development Association.</P>
      <P>The International Development Association was founded in 1960 as an affiliate of the World Bank.  Like the bank itself, it provides loans to developing countries for investment in suitable projects designed to strengthen their economies and to improve the standard of living of their peoples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of the association was in response to a view that there should be a concessionary arm to the World Bank.  It was felt at the time that the bank's normal assistance, which is on virtually commercial terms, could not be availed of to the extent that would be desirable by one important group of its members, namely the poorest of the developing countries.  Such countries required, not loans on commercial terms such as the bank offered and which they would have considerable difficulty in <Col N="768" /> repaying, but loans on highly concessionary terms that would not impose a heavy repayment burden.  Accordingly, the association came into being to fulfil this need.</P>
    <P>The majority of the bank's members joined the association, which has resulted in a total membership of the association of 134 countries at present.  Members are divided into two categories &mdash; Part I members, including Ireland, which are developed countries of which there are 22; and Part II members, which are developing countries, numbering 112. Broadly speaking, the Part I members provide resources to fund the association's activities and the Part II members engage in borrowing from the association, provided that they meet certain eligibility criteria.  Some Part II members contribute to the association's resources. At present more than 50 of the Part II countries satisfy the eligibility criteria for borrowing.</P>
    <P>Loans are made by the association directly to Governments for the financing of suitable projects in their countries. The principal criterion for eligibility to borrow is that a country have an average <i>per capita</i> income level of a maximum of 790 US dollars a year, but in fact some 90 per cent of the association's lending goes to countries with an average <i>per capita</i> income level of less than 400 dollars a year.  The eligible countries are concentrated mainly in Africa south of the Sahara and in South Asia.  I do not need to remind Senators of the continuing problems of extreme poverty that are faced by these regions.</P>
    <P>At present the association provides over three billion dollars annually in loans.  This makes it one of the largest providers of concessional aid to the poorest countries.  The loans are provided on an interest-free basis for 50 years with capital repayments starting only after ten years.  While these terms are extremely favourable, it must not be thought that there is any lack of rigour in assessment of projects approved for financing by the association.  On the contrary, the loans must be for productive projects which are economically viable.  They must meet the <Col N="769" /> same standards of viability as are required by the World Bank itself which, as I have indicated, lends on commercial terms.  This ensures that the assistance is used in a way which promotes the development of the borrowing country.  In addition to providing actual financial assistance, the association also offers policy advice and assistance in building up institutions in the borrowing countries. This part of the association's role can be of great importance for countries which need and seek independent and expert advice on their development problems.</P>
    <P>The concessional nature of the lending undertaken by the association is made possible by the grant-type resources which are made available to it.  To date these resources comprise, in round figures, initial membership subscriptions amounting to $1 billion, transfers from the surplus income of the World Bank of $2 billion and nearly $30 billion from periodic replenishments provided by the member countries.  By far the greater part of the funds for these replenishments has traditionally come from the developed countries.  All the members of the EC and many other European countries participate; so too do the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia.  There are as well a number of OPEC contributors and, in recent years, an increasing number of better-off Part II developing countries.  The latter group include Argentina, Brazil, Korea and Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Ireland joined the association on its foundation in 1960, and subscribed $3 million to the initial capital.  We did not contribute to the first or second of the three-yearly replenishments of resources, but we agreed in 1971 to make a contribution of $4 million to the third replenishment, even though Ireland was still a Part II member at that time.  When Ireland became a Part I member in 1973, it was accepted that this would involve a continuing commitment to contribute towards IDA financing.  Since then Ireland contributed $3.1 million to the fourth replenishment, £5.8 million to the fifth replenishment and £6.2 million to <Col N="770" /> the sixth replenishment.  In addition Ireland made a special one-year contribution of over £2.07 million to the association in 1983.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the current replenishment, the seventh, began at the end of 1982 and concluded towards the middle of last year.  The negotiations agreed on an overall amount of $9 billion for the replenishment.  This represents a decrease of 25 per cent in US dollar terms on the amount of $12 billion negotiated for the sixth replenishment.  The agreement on $9 billion was dictated by the principle of preserving equitable burden sharing between donors and by the refusal of the United States of America to go beyond a 25 per cent share in a $9 billion replenishment.  The United States maintained its stance in spite of pressure from ther donors to support a replenishment of $12 billion, the level which all other donors considered to be the minimum necessary to provide the association with adequate funding.</P>
    <P>The basic principle adopted in the allocation of contributions among the donor countries was that each would maintain in this replenishment the same share as it had taken in the sixth replenishment. The allocations have been made on the understanding that commitments to them are not final until approval has been obtained, where necessary, from the legislature of each country.</P>
    <P>As for previous replenishments, donor countries have the right initially to substitute non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing demand notes for cash payments.  The notes, denominated in the members' currency, are to be deposited over three years.  Actual cash payments under the replenishment will arise over the years 1985 to 1995.  The precise rate at which the funds are called upon will depend on the progress made in implementing the projects financed by the replenishment.</P>
    <P>As a Part I member of the association, Ireland is, as I have said earlier, expected to contribute to the periodic replenishments. In accordance with the sharing arrangements agreed in the negotiations, the Government have indicated that, subject to legislative approval, it is prepared <Col N="771" /> to contribute £8,330,000.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the seventh replenishment has been regarded generally as disappointing and, as a consequence, efforts were made to raise supplementary resources.  Negotiations were initiated with the group of countries which contribute to IDA and agreement was reached on the establishment of a Special Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa.  Most donor countries are pledged to participate, though one notable exception is the United States.  The facility is designed to provide fast disbursing funds to finance structural adjustment and sectoral policy reforms in low-income African countries which are committed to undertake stabilisation and adjustment programmes which can be satisfactorily monitored. Under the terms of the facility, IDA will be entrusted with the administration of over $1 billion to be lent on the same highly concessionary terms that apply to the normal IDA assistance.</P>
    <P>The Government have indicated that, subject to legislative approval, it is prepared to contribute £1.5 million to the facility.  This level of contribution corresponds approximately to the share we assume in replenishments of the association itself.  Cash payments on foot of our contribution will be spread over a period of about four years, starting this year.</P>
    <P>Ireland has traditionally been a strong supporter of IDA.  Its aim of assisting the poorest of the developing countries makes it an especially worthy form of development assistance.  This group of countries is particularly hard hit by the world recession.  Both IDA and the Special Facility aim at helping to remedy the ultimate causes of famine and in doing so, will complement the more immediate famine relief work of other agencies.</P>
    <P>Already, attention is being focused on the next replenishment of IDA.  At a meeting of donor countries held during the recent World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings in Seoul, it was agreed that negotiations for the eighth replenishment should start in January next, with the aim of concluding them by September 1986. Ireland will be seeking to ensure that <Col N="772" /> these negotiations result in an adequate level of resources being made available to IDA.</P>
    <P>The payments both to the seventh replenishment and to the Special Facility will count as part of our national official development assistance programme. They are in line with the Government's commitment to develop that programme. The present Bill is required to authorise the contributions.  Ireland's membership of the association is covered by the International Development Association Act, 1960.  As in the case of previous replenishments, the legislative provision to authorise our contribution to the seventh replenishment takes the form of an amendment to that Act.  The Bill makes separate provision for our contribution to the Special Facility.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill by the Minister.  I think that we must welcome it with reservations because, in effect, there will be a reduction in what has been suggested as being the amount of money needed by the poorest, as the Minister said, of the developing countries.  One of the unfortunate facets of the International Development Association is that we see another indication that the United States in its foreign policy is going away from multinational agreements and seems to be dealing on a bilateral basis with countries which have political associations with itself.  It is very unfortunate that the United States should take this stance at this stage.  What they are basically saying is that they will not get involved with the International Development Association because the International Development Association are helping countries with which the United States do not have the best of political associations.  In other words, what they are saying is that if you go along with our foreign policy we will help you, but if you do not go along with our foreign policy we will not help you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw a further indication of that attitude recently when they pulled out their contributions to UNESCO. <Col N="773" /> Another unfortunate development is that they have forced the British Government, or by association between Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan the British Government have been forced to withdraw their support for UNESCO.  It comes back to a political reason again &mdash; because Ronald Reagan feels that UNESCO is a left-wing Third World-orientated body and that they should not be supported in the future.  We see in his attitude to the International Development Association a further development of that policy.</P>
    <P>There is a huge need as the Minister has stated for aid to the Sub-Saharan area.  The sub-Saharan area is growing at an enormous rate and the poverty in that area is growing.  At the same time we see the United States pulling back on commitments that it had entered into voluntarily in the beginning and pulling back at a time when that whole continent has problems in supporting itself.  The aim of the Bill is to give a little extra aid to an area of the world which has to be supported.  When they will not commit themselves to this special facility for the Sub-Saharan area it is an indication of the lack of willingness on behalf of the United States to get involved in helping people where that help is most needed and forget the political implications that aid might have.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed in the Minister's statement that the facility is a means of providing fast-disbursing funds to finance structural adjustment and sectoral policy reforms in low-income African countries which are committed to undertake stabilisation and adjustment programmes.  I would like the Minister to tell me what he means by stabilisation and adjustment programmes.  Who is to judge what is a stabilisation and adjustment programme under the International Development Association rules and regulations?  Is it a stabilisation and adjustment programme which suits the disbursing countries or is it one which suits the countries to which the moneys are being disbursed?</P>
    <P>We have to agree with the Government on the fact that we are providing extra <Col N="774" /> moneys in this Bill to help those who are really in need but must be very careful in our assessment of the International Development Association because it has been suggested by countries to which moneys are going that the aims of the association are not being met, that too much of the money that goes into these countries from the International Development Association goes into capital projects. The only input that the locals have in those projects is the labour.  In too many cases machinery is provided to deal with capital projects, the machinery is provided by the disbursing country, so that a firm in the disbursing country makes a profit on the sale of the particular machine or implement to the International Development Association. Therefore, there is benefit to the disbursing country.  The loans are made by the association directly to governments for the financing of productive projects and the money disbursed will be on an interest-free basis.</P>
    <P>I think the money will be paid in the currency of the country receiving the money but that the repayments will be made in dollars. If this is so it means that the country which gets the money will have to repay in dollars and even though there is a low interest rate and there will not have to be a repayment for the first ten years, if the dollar increases in value there is no such thing as a low repayment rate.</P>
    <P>The dollar has been the criterion on which all international borrowing or payments have been made.  Because of the increase in the value of the dollar the receiving country has been at a total disadvantage even in the area of soft loan: even though the interest rate might be extremely low, because of the increase in value of the dollar people cannot afford to repay.  Unless there is some means of changing the method of repayment from dollars into another currency, whether it is something like the ECU or whatever, the receiving country will always be at a disadvantage.  The increasing strength of a multinational currency such as the dollar has created problems not just for Third World countries but we can see in <Col N="775" /> our own budgetary efforts the problems the increase has caused us.</P>
    <P>We must thank the Government for going along with this replenishment to that fund and express extreme disappointment and anger at the United States attitude in this matter.  I hope the other members of the International Development Association will try to bring pressure to bear on the United States Government to get involved in the further disbursement of funds because the funds are going to an area of the world which is in extreme need.  I do not think the United States will suffer if it goes along with the increase in grant aid in the long term.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to satisfy me on the question of the stabilisation and adjustment programme because that is the kernel of the argument that is put up by people who live in that area, that too often people from outside decide what is stabilisation, too often the countries to which the moneys are going are not contributors in essence to the development programmes which are being imposed in a lot of cases by agencies from outside these countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with pleasure that I welcome this Bill.  The Minister has stated that the measure is to authorise the Government to make a contribution amounting to £8,300,000 which would be Ireland's contribution to the seventh replenishment of the funds and the resources of the International Development Association.  The IDA is one of the major limbs of the World Bank and the financial assistance provided by the IDA is given to the poorest countries in the developing world.  All in all, Ireland's contribution to the IDA consists of approximately one-fifth of our total Overseas Development Aid for 1985. The total amount expended by Ireland on ODA will be approximately £38.5 million for the current year.  It is interesting to note that approximately two-thirds of this money will be spent in Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We fully appreciate that there has been a lot of criticism about the fact that <Col N="776" /> Ireland has failed to meet its UN targeted figure of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as our contribution towards ODA by 1987.  Nevertheless, there has been a substantial increase in our overseas assistance in recent years.  A good background against which to take it is that in 1974 our official assistance amounted to 15 per cent of the OECD average but by the end of 1984 it had grown to 60 per cent of the OECD average. In 1973 Ireland's ODA amounted to approximately £1 million; in 1985 it has amounted to almost £39 million.  We find that everything is set for further increases to be maintained over the next two years as the Government are committed in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, to increase the level of ODA to £50 million in 1987.</P>
    <P>We appreciate the criticism.  I admit that we have not met the UN target in terms of percentage of GNP.  Nevertheless, we have to be mindful of the fact that one of the major constraints on Ireland making a greater contribution has been the state of our public finances.  That has been brought about by mismanagement of public finances over some of the years in the recent past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A beauty.  You should be ashamed of yourself, turning a serious debate into a political football.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We always speak with truth, Senator Lanigan.  Let us contrast Ireland's growing contribution to the developing world against that of the United States, which is the wealthiest country in the world.  Senator Lanigan will agree with me on this.  After making an initial promise to carry about 25 per cent of the sixth replenishment of the IDA in 1980-1983, the United States welched on its promise when the US Congress forced a rescheduling of the payments which led to a crisis within the IDA in 1983.  Ireland was one of the countries which at that time responded very generously to make up the shortfall which was created by a decision which was taken on Capitol Hill in Washington. I said then and I say now that it was a most despicable act on the part of the <Col N="777" /> most powerful country in the world, a country which has countless billions to spend on armaments of mass destruction, yet in this odious piece of tardiness it took from its contribution to the very poorest of the poor in the world.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to see that section 2 of the Bill provides for a special contribution of £1.5 million which is to form part of our contribution to the Special Facility in the replenishment for sub-Saharan Africa.  That facility is to amount to $1.1 billion.  This money is to be spent on those countries in that region which have been worst affected by tragedy over the last numbers of years.  We should mention that the total value of the seventh replenishment is to amount to approximately $9 billion.  It is particularly sad that this is a large reduction on the value of the sixth replenishment which had currency between 1980 and 1983.  That fund had $12 billion, which had to be augmented by the special contribution I mentioned. At the outset of the negotiation for the seventh replenishment a far greater fund than $12 billion was envisaged and it was set out at that time as being absolutely needed.  But, because of the reluctance of the United States to take on a greater share, when the negotiations eventually ended last April a figure of only $9 billion could be agreed upon for this replenishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the brighter side, however, at the conclusion of the negotiations this Special Facility of $1.1 billion was set up in addition to the $9 billion as a special fund for the worst afflicted countries.  These countries are across the broad middle of the more northern part of Africa, usually called sub-Saharan in Africa.  It is a very positive move in the sense that the funds from the facility will be made available to countries like Ethiopia, Sudan, Mali and other smaller countries which have been cursed by the destitutions of famine. These funds are to be used to support fundamental and basic reforms, especially in the area of agriculture, to be undertaken by the various governments. That is attacking the very fundamental and underlying problems of famine, food shortage and emergency needs in those <Col N="778" /> areas.  It is the purpose of this facility to get to the root cause of the famine.</P>
    <P>One must thank the donor countries for making this special contribution, but again I must be critical of the US, which has refused to make a pledge to this fund. We also compliment the governors of the World Bank, who do not often come in for compliments, for identifying this special need and for giving the go-ahead for the negotiations on this facility to commence.</P>
    <P>This special need was identified by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, when earlier this year, in one of its published reports, it stated that 20 of Africa's sub-Saharan countries would face very serious food deficits in 1985.  I spoke here on the first report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries and in that speech I quoted fairly extensively from that report.  That report focused fairly closely on what was emerging and, indeed, what was taking place not alone in the sub-Saharan region but right across that blighted dark continent.</P>
    <P>If we focus again on that sub-Saharan region, which consists of countries like Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Chad and the Cape Verde Islands, which is an archipelago off the western coast of Africa but is an island nation, we see that in those countries collectively something like 200 million people live.  According to the best estimates almost 35 million people in those areas were severely affected by drought and famine.  In addition to this over ten million people across that continental region have left their homes and lands and become wandering nomads. They are in search of food, water and new pastures.  They have with them their few wretched belongings and their half-starved and ever declining herds.  This phenomenon of millions of people uprooting themselves, wandering hither and thither within their own countries and across each other's borders, has caused unbelievable havoc and destruction, both economic and social.  It has also contributed to the continued weakening of these wretched people who are caught up in it.  In a fundamental way it <Col N="779" /> has disrupted the settled populations who have been affected by the movement of these people and has contributed in a major way to the spread of disease and a general decline in the state of health across the afflicted country.</P>
    <P>This great natural disaster of drought has lasted over several consecutive years, and one of the results has been the major damaging and deleterious effect it has had upon the whole ecology of the region. There has been a disappearance or, at best, a drastic decline in food production. Because of the effects of drought and the withdrawal of husbandry, land which was once reasonably fertile has reverted to desert at a frightening speed.  Not alone has the destruction caused a huge ecological and food production breakdown, but the old systems of delivery and distribution, which were allied with these economies when they were stable, have also broken down.  This is another factor which makes matters worse and even more tragic.  As output has fallen because of the drought, farmers no longer put back essential inputs.  There is no purchase of new or essential services.  Production shifts from essential grain like maize, sorghum and millet and to the production of cash crops like cotton, cocoa or coffee.  This is a disastrous trend which has been taking place for the last 15 years or perhaps longer.  While many people working in the area of development assistance saw the tragic consequences coming, it is a criticism of many of the official relief agencies and especially a criticism of the African Governments themselves that they failed to recognise or address the coming Armageddon.</P>
    <P>There is now approximately 15 per cent less food produced in this area of Africa than there was ten years ago, while the population figures for this region have increased at least by that percentage figure.  The great misfortune visited upon these countries can also be seen in another way.  Their economies are primarily agriculture in base, and because the rate of increase of domestic food production has fallen behind the rate of <Col N="780" /> increase of domestic population growth, this has always meant &mdash; even in better years &mdash; that they had to make up their food deficits by major grain importation from abroad.  In recent years they have had to do this at an ever-increasing rate while at the same time the value of their exports has been gradually declining. Their exports are mostly raw ores or basic raw materials for western industry.  In recent years the prices of many of these commodities have fallen, resulting in decreased return to the countries selling those resources.  You have the awful problem of their running down their own natural resources by having to sell them in huge volumes to try to keep apace with the value of falling prices.  They have had to use foreign exchange for the import of essential food imports.  In addition to this, these countries have taken on an ever-increasing debt burden.  All of these factors have combined to bring about a situation of utter stagnation within their economies and the normal development activities seem no longer to exist.</P>
    <P>May I go back again to give an overview of the awful scale of the problem, using as my reference the United Nations report on emergency operations in Africa, which is a comment on the situation country by country?  It is a comment on the worst affected countries as of 1 October 1985, but it also deals with the situation in the other African countries. If we look at Ethiopia &mdash; I take Ethiopia as the example because it is the one that is best identified in the Irish consciousness as far as the present African famine is concerned&mdash;we find that the latest report from these states that approximately eight million people are still affected by drought and hunger.  The report feels that this figure is probably greater, due to the worsening situation in the western provinces of that country because of insurgency and because of the effects insurrection has on settled economic activity, especially food production. These problems exist mostly in the western provinces and in the province of Tigre, a place well known to people in this country.</P>
    <P>We understand that in Tigre especially <Col N="781" /> there is an ever-increasing number of famine victims reporting to distribution points.  I agree that there are conflicting reports as to the effects of the official displacement of large portions of the population from the northern region.  We have all read media reports about this, where it is claimed that the government have forced hundreds of thousands of people to move from the northern regions, which are the worst affected, to the southern regions.  We are told that they are being moved from the worst affected areas to lands of greater fertility where the population density is lower and that the condition of the people who have been compulsorily moved from their former regions has greatly improved in their new environs.  Contrary to that, we have received reports which told us that the displacement was totally enforced and that the condition of the people moved has deteriorated rapidly, with disease and hunger their continuing everyday lot.</P>
    <P>However, there have been some other very encouraging reports coming out of Ethiopia recently.  That is contained in the later report by the FAO issued in October.  They state that the rainfall levels during the crucial months of August and September were generally about average.  This is the first time in several years that this has taken place. The crops that were planted earlier were doing very well.  However, it is generally felt that Ethiopia will need at least one million metric tonnes of food aid for distribution to at least six million people during 1986.  Imagine six million people needing emergency food aid in 1986.  It is one and a half times the population of Ireland, at least.</P>
    <P>Regarding the problems of distribution of food to the worst affected areas, the report is not very encouraging.  The condition of the major ports continues to be grossly inadequate and in many cases they are reported to be deteriorating. The condition of the internal railway system, always bad, is reported to be getting even worse.  A similar situation would appear to obtain in the case of the internal road network, that is the road <Col N="782" /> network that exists at all in that country. Many people in Ethiopia live at least one week's walk or longer from any kind of public road.  However, it is hoped that the internal truck transport could improve because of the establishment of a United Nations truck fleet and we gather a large portion of the funds raised from the famous Band Aid concert last July will go towards aiding this.  These trucks will be used as distribution vehicles throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Another African country in which Ireland has a great interest and indeed with which it has very strong connections is Lesotho.  When I talk about Lesotho I am moving away from the Central African portion to the very southern part of the Continent.  Geographically Lesotho is placed within the borders of South Africa itself.  We have a great interest in that country because it is one of the three countries which we have earmarked for our direct development assistance and official aid.  It has been a relatively fortunate country up to now and it has never had the problems of drought and famine associated with the regions which are close to the Sahara.  Now we find, unfortunately, that Lesotho, because of the vagaries of the African climate, is going to join the wretched league also.  Last October the Prime Minister was forced to declare a national emergency because of the effects of famine and drought. There are also frightening reports about the deterioration of the health situation of the population of that country.  There are reports of widespread outbreaks of typhoid, of tuberculosis, of dysentry and cholera, almost the biblical plagues.  The reports states that fresh water supplies are drying out rapidly right across the country.  Of course this is a major source of disease as well.</P>
    <P>We are inclined to think that the problems of hunger can be answered simply with food donations.  That is understandable because we see pictures of people starving, with distended stomachs etc., on television and we see their needs as being only food.  That is totally inadequate thinking, because side by side with hunger always goes disease.  The non-food <Col N="783" /> aspect of emergency relief is an aspect which is often forgotten and is of equal importance.  Very often it is of greater importance.  I make that point because in the case of Lesotho, for instance, we find that less than 2 per cent of the non-food emergency relief needs have been covered by pledges of the various donors.  That is less than 2 per cent of the non-food needs and the non-food needs are the ones that I have gone through in relation to health, sanitation etc.</P>
    <P>Ireland's direct assistance to this country has been in the field of agricultural development and the provision of water supplies.  These have been concentrated in specific projects.  We understand they are doing very well.  They are having a great impact within the areas where the effects of these developments can be seen or communicated.  However, it is very tragic to read that cereal production has fallen short by 30,000 metric tonnes of the expected figure and there is no doubt that Lesotho will be on the primary list of countries needing emergency food aid in 1986 and 1987 and perhaps beyond.</P>
    <P>Sudan is another country where we have a direct interest because we have a number of direct assistance programmes going on there also.  One of them is a very interesting one which relates to the development of dairying projects.  However, we read that, according to the latest figures copiled for last September, the number of people affected by the emergency has increased from 8.5 million to a figure close on nine million.  These are mainly located in the eastern, northern and central regions of that country. Approximately two million people are suffering from very severe malnutrition and many of the larger cities have had areas which have been completely overrun with a huge influx of people fleeing from their rural communities where famine and pestilence have destroyed the community fabric.  New cities of destitute squatters are being created on the fringes of the larger towns and especially the cities.  There are tens and perhaps hundreds of thousands of people with no <Col N="784" /> shelter, very little food and of course seething with discontent.</P>
    <P>Naturally, all of that adds up to a frightening prospect.  Sudan has had a change of Government by the medium of a military coup which took place in the middle of this year.  One of the main reasons the coup leaders put forward for taking power from the previous regime was that that Government &mdash; the Nimeiri Government &mdash; had failed to tackle the problems of food shortage and all the attendant evils.  Perhaps it is too early to judge at this point, but there is no evidence that the new Government in Khartoum are any more effective in dealing with the problem than the ousted Government of Nimeiri</P>
    <P>Of the more newly independent African nations south of the Sahara region we might take a look at two former Portuguese colonies, Angola and Mozambique.  They are well known to people reading the media in this country because of prolonged independence struggles in the seventies.  It is particularly sad for those countries that internal insurgency and civil strife and, in the case of Mozambique, strife on its borders &mdash; there is a continuing conflict with South Africa and South Africa makes almost daily raids &mdash; is a major determinant in causing the food and health emergencies in both of these countries.  There are widespread reports of measles, of cholera, of tuberculosis and other diseases related to malnutrition from both Angola and Mozambique.  Allied to this, seed shortages, shortages of fertilisers and other essential agricultural inputs and diminishing supply of material goods for barter trading are all part of the daily output of misery coming from that region of Africa.  The FAO predict that for 1986 and 1987 emergency food relief and other emergency non-food aid will be life and death matters both in the cases of Angola and Mozambique.</P>
    <P>In Zimbabwe, the largest of the more newly independent African nations, it is very heartening to read the reports of the FAO and to see that, despite internal strife and all the problems that any new independent nation has in settling down, <Col N="785" /> the food emergency which existed there in the earlier years of independence from 1979 and 1980 onwards has practically ended now.  That is a very good development.</P>
    <P>In Zimbabwe, the Food and Agricultural Organisation are saying that the Government there have now focused on the rehabilitation and the development of food production resources which the governments of many countries in Africa have totally forgotten about or would appear to have totally ignored.  The FAO credit the Government in Zimbabwe with tackling the problem.  Zimbabwe is now reported to have a surplus of maize, much of which is exported.  The Government there have a plan to store at least 500,000 metric tonnes of cereals as a strategic food reserve this year.</P>
    <P>Briefly, I would like to refer to such countries as Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Chad, which are more familiar to us. Those countries between them comprise the greater part of the central African region.  In Mauritania the indications are that the prospects and the general conditions for harvesting will be favourable this year.  However, another great plague is reported from this country &mdash; an explosive increase in the numbers of grasshoppers.  These insects have a capacity to destroy, and indeed are destroying, thousands of hectares of newly-emerging crops.  This highlights the breakdown in essential inputs like pesticides.</P>
    <P>In Mali, the most recent reports state that for the first time in a decade the rainfall levels have been close to normal. However, as in Mauritania, crops are threatened by the ever-spreading plague of grasshoppers.  Yields are much lower than they should be because of lack of fertilisers and of pesticide use.  However, against that, the general report is that the nutritional status of the affected population has improved in Mali and the disease situation seems to have at least stabilised.  This country reports a very severe fuel shortage, especially fuel for cooking.</P>
    <P>The situation in Chad, relatively speaking, is not that bad.  Chad itself in recent <Col N="786" /> times had a major problem with internal insurgency which we are told Colonel Gadaffi had a hand in.  Apparently, the political situation seems to have quietened down within its borders as of this year.  It is estimated that the output of cereals in Chad this year will be approximately in line with the national need. They need about 650,000 tonnes and that amount should be produced.  However, the major problem of this country would appear to be that it will have a food surplus in the south and east while there will be a major food deficit in the northern and eastern regions of the Sahara Desert.  Internal transportation is in an appalling state, which greatly hampers the logistical problem of getting the food from areas of surplus to areas of need. The fear of major famine, especially in the Sahara region, exists for 1986 and beyond.  This country has 1.5 million people affected by famine and almost .5 million of those are displaced persons. They can only be described as refugees.</P>
    <P>The last country on this list of nations which are outside the area of sub-Sahara is Tanzania, which is like Lesotho.  Sudan is another country where we have direct involvement.  Our Government are directly involved with assistance programmes in this country.  Tanzania had major food problems in 1982 and 1983, and, indeed, in 1984.  However, the most recent reports are much more optimistic. A good rainfall has been reported and food production is said to be back to normal.  This is a very good development.</P>
    <P>We would like to make the point that this restoration of the normal pattern of production has more to do with good government policies that it has to do with the improvement in the climate.  For this one must singularly congratulate the Tanzanian Government for their understanding of the nature of the problem they faced and for tackling it in a manner which had very successful results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the enmity of the international financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take your point.  The Government have put the national finances of that country at great risk in <Col N="787" /> doing this.  It used up much of its foreign reserves in purchasing necessary food aid.  More significantly, it reduced its reserves to buy abroad essential inputs like fertilisers, tools, seeds and pesticides. The responsibility is on the international community to ensure that the financial problems that will now be faced internally by Tanzania, because it took this very enlightened step, will be alienated and that the necessary aid will be made available to it.  It should not be allowed go bankrupt.  Tanzania used its reserves to buy essentials, and this has had the effect of putting food production on a sound footing and of bringing the national food stock situation from a serious deficit, which led to local famine within its borders, to a situation where it now has a food surplus.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment Kenya and, in particular, Zambia &mdash; an underdeveloped and poor country &mdash; for adopting policies broadly similar to those adopted by Tanzania.  Kenya has always been one of the more developed and stable of the African countries.  It has weathered the emergency better than most African countries because it had a stronger economy. Nevertheless, it was affected by the emergency caused by the weather and the drought.  However, the Government policies adopted there were a major factor in avoiding a situation of disaster.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would like to take a closer look at non-food relief, which is a most essential part of tackling this emergency. It is an area which very often gets lost in the reports of famine, when people's minds are concentrating only on getting emergency food aid to affected areas.  When I talk of non-food relief, I refer mainly to the logistics of distributing food &mdash; for example, the transport system, health care for people affected arising from malnutrition and poor sanitation, provision of proper water supplies and, of course, the whole area of agricultural inputs and agricultural rehabilitation measures to restore degraded soil and to cope with the problem of arresting the ever-increasing encroachment of the desert on fertile land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> Last March, the United Nations office for emergency operations in Africa reported that the non-food sector needs amounted to approximately $490 million. However, by 1 October 1985 the same body reported that these needs had increased to almost $900 million.  This gives us some idea of the scale of the problem.  The logistical problem of getting food is multiplied by the fact that a number of the major affected nations are inland and have no seaports at all.  They are dependent on the ports in their neighbouring maritime countries.  Very often these ports are completely blocked, as in Ethiopia.  Senegal is one of the countries that has a port.  Mauritania is also a maritime country.</P>
    <P>The facilities at these ports are usually totally inadequate.  In many cases we have had shiploads of food actually rotting as the ships waited to embark or to tie up at these ports.  It is one thing to get the food distributed throughout the region but there is the major problem of food arriving at these ports and not being allowed to unload because ships can be tied up for weeks and months due to lack of facilities.</P>
    <P>The deficiencies in internal transport even in those countries with a reasonable level of development &mdash; and very few countries in this particular region have a reasonable level of development &mdash; are very hard to imagine.  There is no such thing as a continuous road or a rail road link or any kind of integrated rail-road system across the broad middle of Africa, going from the Atlantic on the one side of the Red Sea on the other.  There is an international or a multi-national communications problem.  This is one of the fundamental drawbacks in tackling the food needs of this area of the African continent.  Aid from the west through all the agencies, aid from the OPEC countries and aid from the Soviet Union, if there is any to give, should be co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>Water supply and sanitation which create huge health problems are very often not appreciated at all.  It is estimated that the needs in the health sector increased from $88 million in March of <Col N="789" /> this year to approximately $125 million by 1 August of this year.  In the area of sanitation and water supply it is estimated that the needs increased from $81 million to $127 million in October.  The range of problems are not often fully understood. It is estimated that on 1 October of this year the unmet needs of these sectors amounted to over $270 million.  While the donor response in the area of immediate food aid has been good, the donor response in the area of health, water supply and sanitation has been far less than the contributions to date within these areas.  They have covered only about 40 per cent of the total requirements in all of these sectors.</P>
    <P>While it may be a little boring listening to all of those figures, I am making the point because of what is obviously a lack of understanding.  People understand that people are hungry and need food.  But they seem to understand less that the delivery of the food has to be arranged. There are the attendant evils of malnutrition and diseases like cholera and measles.  There are problems with bad water supplies, which multiply the problems of poor health and the spread of disease.  This is a very fundamental part of the problem.  It, too, has to be tackled together with the problem of getting food by one means or another to hungry people.</P>
    <P>Another disheartening aspect of the food relief aid received has been the very inadequate response to the plea for agricultural inputs, which are absolutely fundamental to the restoration of food production.  This is another problem that seems not to be too well understood.  It is estimated that in this year approximately $295 million worth of assistance for basic inputs is needed, while only $85 million have been contributed.  There is a huge gap.  This again illustrates the problem that the international community are very good at responding to television pictures of starving people and yet we do not seem to have adequate comprehension of the real problem, which is the problem of food production.</P>
    <P>As countries reach a stage where they no longer need emergency relief and are <Col N="790" /> put, although still in a fragile state, on the road to recovery, an ever-increasing amount of the international contribution should be channelled towards the important area of agricultural rehabilitation and the restoration of production.  Poor soil conditions, combined with the general health conditions of the people, all lead to a downward spiral in food production. Only a fundamental attack on these problems can redress that situation.</P>
    <P>There is one other problem which is related to the logistical one, and that is the time of the arrival of food in areas of food need.  It has often been found that food has arrived just at the time of harvest. This has depressed local prices and very often has ruined the livelihoods of local small farmers and local small economies which exist around small farm communities.  Food arrives in large amounts.  The harvest there is a very short period.  When food is being distributed and suddenly food aid arrives the effect that that has is to depress the price of food produced locally.  Naturally, the people who engage in the production of food there have no option but to get out of it. They are financially ruined.  They need money or they need something to barter with in order to buy their seeds or their imputs, so that they can survive.  The whole food aid programme has been insensitive to many local conditions.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome this country's response.  I wish it was more generous. Nevertheless, we are among the most generous in the world, and not alone in what we give officially through the various mediums.  The generosity of the Irish people is well-known.  It took an Irishman to conceive the idea of Band Aid.  <i>Per capita</i> the Irish gave more than most other nations during that worldwide collection.</P>
    <P>We are talking here today about the idea of the funding of the International Development Association and the setting up of this Special Facility which started off all this examination which I have made of central Africa as well as other regions of Africa.  I welcome it because I see it as a fundamental addressing of the problems, albeit very small in scale. <Col N="791" /> Nevertheless, it is a fundamental addressing of the problems.  This facility is aimed at tackling the problem at its most fundamental, which is down at the level of production.  It means getting special funds to Governments which they can pass on to their producers to use for imputs for the restoration of soil.  Much of the soil is degraded and has been lost to the desert.</P>
    <P>I wish this fund well.  I sincerely hope that when the eighth replenishment comes up it will be much larger and that this facility will be greatly expanded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the previous speaker, Senator Connor, on the wide-ranging speech he has made, addressing the whole range of development issues.  We have all been indebted to the reference, particularly in the Minister's speech, that said that what we are asked to vote on this afternoon is part of our total ODA contribution.  This enabled Senator Connor at least to give a total overview of the need for development assistance.  It was a very fine speech and I compliment him on it.  I am glad that Senator Lanigan, the previous speaker, has drawn attention to the technical problem of currency exchange, which is an important one.  I intend to confine my remarks very precisely to the question of the IDA itself.  I believe there will be other opportunities to discuss the broader development issues.  I do however, want to make one or two points.  I do not want to delay the House by being repetitive.  The important point has been stressed by all of the speakers so far, and indeed in the Minister's speech, that the default of the United States in making its contribution was a major factor in our being asked in previous replenishments to vote additional sums.  It created a very interesting problem, which at the time was seen too much in terms of the sums involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember speaking on this in the other House.  The point I stressed on that occasion was that there was a political significance to it which seemed to be missed.  The political significance was &mdash;<Col N="792" /> perhaps I am wrong in this, and I would like to be advised on this later on &mdash; that by and large the IDA limb of the World Bank had operated since its inception on more or less technical criteria.  When one looked at the evolution of the decisions that it made in relation to projects it approved to recipient countries, the criteria were independent development criteria. To cut a very long story short, the United States' limit on its contribution and the accompanying text that it offered at the time showed the politicisation of that particular wing of the World Bank. My question will automatically follow from that.  I remember clearly the circumstances of that default.  It was a question of an agreement having been entered into which was later broken and which created shortfall problems for other contributing countries.  We had been a contributing country since 1973.</P>
    <P>Apart from the additional burden that it placed on those less wealthy than the United States, there was the very serious question that put into tension the political criteria and technical criteria of development. From the wide-ranging speech that Senator Connor has given, one can see the effects of much of this.  The Senator spoke, for example, of Tanzania and Kenya.  Tanzania is at war &mdash; as I perhaps should not have not interrupted him to say &mdash; with some of the international financial institutions, particularly the World Bank and the IMF.  Kenya is looked on with more favour.  In Kenya the private commercial sector &mdash; in that country the Asian sector &mdash; has been viewed differently than it has been viewed in Tanzania.  The principle at stake was one of the right of the Tanzanian Government to pursue an independent, generically-informed path to development &mdash; in other words, that it would decide on its development needs and that it would tend to resist the difficulties of exposure to pressures that would be required by international financial institutions.</P>
    <P>I will concentrate on just a few points in that regard.  I would welcome a comment on this question of politicisation of the IDA section of the World Bank.  I <Col N="793" /> have been looking closely at the Nicaraguan relationship to that particular section of the bank, not only at the question of the status of submissions made and the outcome, but what has happened to projects and how they compare with equivalent projects treated by other countries.  The speech which preceded mine was very interesting.</P>
    <P>There is sometimes a view in this country, which I think is disappearing, that world development problems can be explained in terms of natural disasters. What the previous speaker did was to move on from that and push it beyond basic ecological explanations towards looking at development problems in the context of a world economy, and a world economy that has a particular set of structures in relation to trade, aid and debt. The debt negotiation problem has been adverted to earlier.  There is another factor which is important and that is the technological transfer question.  It arises to some degree in relation to where the Minister makes reference in his own speech towards the criteria for approval of particular projects.  For example, the principal criterion for eligibility to borrow is that a country can have an average <i>per capita</i> income level of a maximum $790.  The Minister made the point that 90 per cent of the recipients had average <i>per capita</i> incomes of less than $400.  If one qualifies by certain criteria it is important to look at what criteria prevailed, say, ten years ago in the pre-Reagan times, and what criteria prevail now.</P>
    <P>The information available to me suggests that there has been an interference with the technical and professional staff work in this section of the World Bank. There has also been a tension created between political and technical decision-makers. There is a great deal of discontent among people who felt that they were making choices on a basis that had evolved.  Admittedly, they were talking about a very small area.  It is interesting that the Minister for Finance is here because it sets up another dimension which is very important.  On previous occasions when this subject was under <Col N="794" /> discussion the Minister for Finance was in the Dáil also.  One has to integrate the discussion here with foreign policy, because there is overlap of issues, whether we like it or not.  We do not just allocate the sums.  The Minister, in his own speech, indicated a concern that went far beyond legislating so as to transfer two sums &mdash; one just over £8 million by way of contribution to the seventh replenishment and a special sum to assist in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
    <P>What is now at stake is this.  I have the impression that as we wait for the position that will be taken on the eighth replinishment we will be dealing with an entirely different international context.  There is no doubt at all that the debt relationship will prevail.  There is a growing feeling in the countries which are overburdened by debt that a new form of relationship in general terms will have to be created. I cannot see how the IDA association section, and the criteria it uses to give funds, will stand separated from this general change.  It is useful to address those points.  The idea, for example, that the United States refused point blank to increase its share, that it defaulted previously and that it refused to be involved in the special sub-Saharan African subvention is quite scandalous.  It reflects a geo-political shadow that has been cast across the entire world's foreign policy under the present Reagan administration. Practically everything has to be made subservient to the idea that one is speaking about who is strong in the world.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the United States in a one-sided way, because when looking at the overall contributions of different countries to the whole question of development aid one finds that both super-powers have first plateaued out towards the end of the Seventies.  At the end of the Seventies the proportion of contributions fell.  There was a slight increase in some of the Arab nations but, by and large, both superpowers, in relation to aid, have not behaved in any way that I think can be admired.</P>
    <P>This does not interfere with some fundamental <Col N="795" /> principles.  The major push in the debt-ridden countries is coming from population increases.  It is coming also from some good things, as well as uncontrolled population increase in so far as that a number of the interventions in relation to, for example, eliminating the peri-natal illnesses, have now the effect of saving young children who have to be catered for in other ways.  Therefore, the total need structure has changed and the situation requires the additional resources that Senator Connor referred to.</P>
    <P>There is something to which Senator Connor did not refer, and that was the whole question of urbanisation and the impact that that had on the structure of development projects.  I have no doubt that the people who have expressed concern about the difference between state to state projects and lending, and nation to nation aid and projects and lending, have addressed a very real point.  I must confess to some despair about a number of things.  The comments that have been made so far in relation to renegotiating the debt position of the worst affected countries &mdash; and these are the people we are talking about here where 90 per cent of the people are on incomes of less than $400 a year &mdash; is that the whole question of a debt-relationship is one on which there is no new thinking.</P>
    <P>The Brandt report, a mixture of benevolent concern and self-interest, is almost dead and gone. Nobody is now talking in its terms about a new economic order.  There is some pressure from some of the undeveloped countries themselves towards demanding a new international economic order.  But that is a very highly politicised demand.  There has, however, been a hardening of attitudes by the super-powers and particularly by the United States.  So where is there hope, one might ask, towards addressing this question of debt?</P>
    <P>Equally, in relation to trade the whole question of the transfer of commodities has meant that greatest regional competition has broken out between the <Col N="796" /> major economic regions of the United States, Japan and the European Community, for example and that there is almost inevitable toughening of attitudes towards commodities coming from the very countries that would have been in receipt of aid that we will grant under this.  That is why I said that there is a connection in a way between what you give through the Minister for Finance and the kind of foreign policy aid issues that you administer through, for example, the Development Aid section of your foreign policy.  The two meet at an interface in many ways.  This is not to say that Ireland has the obligation of sorting out the world problems in relation to development, but I think we have a contribution to make in trying to advert to the enormous difficulties that are there and the lack of political will that is there in relation to dealing with these issues.</P>
    <P>It is very good to see this money being given and I compliment the Minister and the Government on doing so.  I think they are quite right to claim credit for anything they are doing in this regard.  I am not getting involved in the question of whether or not we meet the UN target. The view I have always held was we should make whatever sacrifices are necessary and I would assist the Minister for Finance of the day and support him should he want to make any cuts anywhere else that would enable us to meet the UN target.  I have said so publicly and I have said so privately and that is my position and there are other occasions for developing that argument.</P>
    <P>On this occasion this particular section is a very interesting one because when you look at its evolution since 1960 the whole idea was that you could in fact have a concessionary relationship with a certain membership, countries that were donor countries and recipient countries. In many way it was paradoxical and contradictory because the major fundamental philosophy that had guided the main thrust of the bank was one that saw this rather like the Quakers who used to be worried about the industrial society in Britain.  The word &ldquo;concession&rdquo; has a very particular history in the philosophy <Col N="797" /> of the World Bank.  In many ways what countries like Ireland are doing is keeping a kind of a moral glimmer alive at a time when there has been an international crisis of a general debt kind.</P>
    <P>I have been watching this question of the international debt with a considerable amount of interest.  If some of the debtor nations push the matter to a certain point they provoke not a crisis for themselves only but for the lending banks and lending institutions and it is clear that the greatest failure is taking place in the absence of significant initiatives to break the debt cycle and to renegotiate debt.  It is very clear to anybody that that has to be done.</P>
    <P>That raises more technical questions in relation to the forms of exchange.  It is purely symbolic to be talking about whether you are borrowing in one currency and you are receiving in a soft currency and you are paying back in a hard currency and the implications of that.  The kind of thing that comes out of what Senator Connor was saying was this. I do not want to take all the countries he mentioned but if you look at the attempts at development that are being made by individual countries, more and more they are moving back towards trying to establish their own basic needs strategies towards developing, for example, forms of technology that are less dependent on donor countries that had often given them tied aid and it made them more dependent and it represented real leaks from their development strategies, moving towards intermediate forms of technology and so forth.</P>
    <P>One of the main points that is very interesting is that in these countries I think there is a developing awareness of the ecological impact of different industrialisation strategies.  May I say why we are not able to move towards dealing with something like the international debt problem.  Part of the problem is political but some of it, too, is philosophical and here I have something quite controversial to say and that is that nearly 90 per cent of what is being taught in the western world in the area of development studies is not only irrelevant but it is dangerous <Col N="798" /> in so far as it is based on an assumption of development that no longer simply applies.  Nearly all of the economic models of development at this stage represent real leaks from these economies that are the recipient countries and recipient economies under legislation like this.  They simply have nothing to say. They represent not something neutral or not something of very little value but dangerous ones because many of the development economic strategies are ones that would quickly leak up not only whatever a body might receive under this section of the World Bank but much more besides in so far as, for example, there is nothing in what I have read in development economics in the last ten years that addresses the question adequately of either the consumption of new loans and assistance and so on by élites within urban populations or the question of it being absorbed almost entirely by dangerous import practices or the question, equally, that it might set up new forms of consumption that would require return taxes on the rural hinterland which in turn depresses the entire country and so on.</P>
    <P>If development economics in the west are bankrupt, so also are most of the social sciences in relation to development mainly because of the ideological prejudices within which these studies were developed.  They were developed in an atmosphere that did not sufficiently break the links with colonialism.  They started and grew out of in many cases estate management in colonial Britain through ethnocentric anthropology, various kinds of missionary activity that concentrated on the social disorganisation of rural people moving to towns and so on and there was very little strength in it.</P>
    <P>What is needed and where Ireland has an enormous contribution to make is doing the generous things that are being done and for which I complimented the Government and the Minister but also much more in making an intellectual contribution towards developing new thinking in economics and in the social sciences and in political arrangements and so on. I worry about that because our own economy <Col N="799" /> is a very exposed one and most economic thinking here tends to be so orthodox and so reactionary in many ways that it deteriorates into different minor managerial strategies rather than any kind of genuine macro-economic thinking.  That is reflected in practically every one of the journals you see.  There is not a very significant major thinker at all now in this country or in these islands who is thinking in the way I am speaking about.  The fact of the matter is that there was such an economist as Keynes who in his own way made a contribution to Britain after paying for the war and so forth.</P>
    <P>In relation to the development economics the developing countries are realising something very interesting.  They are beginning to produce some of their own thinkers and they are thinking out their development strategies themselves.  They are beginning to liaise more with each other.  They are beginning to develop regional interchanges of intellectual skills.  I see great hope in that.  Where countries like Ireland are important is in siding with that.</P>
    <P>This is one of the opportunities for Bills like this, which appear to be short Bills but they are important ones.  They are one of our windows on the World Bank and I would like to hear in the reply to this Stage a comment on the kind of remarks I have been making.  There are two views of the world in relation to this. The world is not in the grip of some forces that can never be reversed or controlled. I recall reading speeches by McNamara in the context of the World Bank which dealt with the necessity for its own sake of turning things around and all the rest of it but conscious decisions can be taken and they affect all the millions of people that Senator John Connor was talking about.  There is no point in having this notion that you can go around on a tour of the poor nationally and internationally as much as you like and it is very good for the soul, but behind it all hangs structure and structure is not abstract.</P>
    <P>The point is that you trade on an equal basis or on a basis that is imbalanced. <Col N="800" /> Equally, aid is transferred in particular ways.  Technology is transferred in a way that is creating dependency or not creating dependency.  There are development strategies that are generic, that is, they grow from responses being made by several different countries and one tries to put them together in a new way.</P>
    <P>I would on this occasion make a plea for thinking and for thought.  I represent a university seat.  I am very conscious of that.  I pay tribute to every single person who has travelled.  One of them of here, Senator Dooge, has made a distinguished contribution to development.  It is at the level of overall thinking in relation to development that I feel there has been quite a paucity of thought.  There used to be a group of people in the undeveloped countries who wandered around from one undeveloped country to another bringing so-called skills, and who were known in Africa as the &ldquo;when wes&rdquo;, because they used to say &ldquo;When we were in Kenya, &ldquo;When we were in Tanzania&rdquo;, &ldquo;When we were in Latin-America&rdquo; and &ldquo;When we were in Asia&rdquo; and so on, as if the world development issues were some kind of high class tourism.  The fact of the matter is that one must ask the question as to whether one can reconcile the economic recovery strategies of the western world with anything like development issues, the development of the major recipient countries under a Bill like this. That is too sharp a contrast.</P>
    <P>What one must try to do now is look for different regional economic strategies. The new thinking will come in that direction.  There are African economists who are now preparing new proposals that are very human in character, that move less back from the dictates of the market, from the basic needs, the problems of transferring agricultural surplus produce to urban areas where too many people are running on the urban areas and so on.  All the planning issues are different.  There are about ten or 20 different ways.  All of the cities are different from the Western model.  Yet the glasses that the western people have on in looking at these countries have remained <Col N="801" /> the same.  They are out of date and dangerous very often.  For example, in the Mexican disaster tens of thousands of deaths were the direct responsibility of some Western advice in relation to urban planning in Mexico City.  There were people arriving with their models and imposing them in that case on that Latin-American city.</P>
    <P>The good point about short Bills like this is that they remind us that in the most harsh places people have moments of compassion which they call concessionary sections.  What I was most interested in &mdash; and the point at which I finish &mdash; is that, if that be concessionary in good times and if it becomes politicised in bad times, the people who are affected by it, the people who receive in the end, will look at it with more jaundiced eyes.  I think we will be respected as a small country for not only making our contribution but being willing to come forward again when a major donor country like the United States falls down on its commitment. In many ways the keeping together of the IDA and what I hope will be the beating back of the politicisation of it is in a way keeping the development area out of geo-politics despite the worst efforts of the present administration in the United States.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In one sense this Bill is merely the technical carrying out of decisions already made in regard to our programme of Overseas Development Aid and in regard to the balance between the items in that programme.  On that basis it is not a Bill which should delay us very long.  On the other hand it is a reflection of our policy and our attitudes in this regard which is a proper subject for debate.  The reason I intervened is that to remain silent on such a Bill might be taken by some as an indication that I or other Members of the Seanad had lost our enthusiasm for these policies. Accordingly I intend to make a brief contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before doing so I would like to say that I join with Senator Michael D. Higgins in welcoming the wide-ranging speech of <Col N="802" /> Senator John Connor.  It would not have been appropriate if a large number of Members of the Seanad had spoken over such a wide range.  That would be more appropriate to one of our regular discussions on development aid.  Nevertheless, I think it was appropriate that one Senator should have done so and, in doing so, should have spoken for all of us.</P>
    <P>As Senator Michael D. Higgins has emphasised, this whole problem is a complex one with many strands interwoven. A good deal of the tragedy of the developing world derives from the failure to recognise the complexity of the problem. The great hopes of development aid, the great hopes of economic development of 20 to 25 years ago have themselves contributed to the present difficulties of the situation.  Senator Michael D. Higgins was wrong if he intended to convey, although he may not have intended to do so, that the main flaw in development economics at that time was the concern with the narrow financial viewpoint in regard to development aid and to the remnants of colonial viewpoints.  I think there were many development economists in the period of 20 to 30 years ago whose background and whose ideologies were very far from colonialist but who still saw that problem in simplistic terms.  The major error that most of the development economists made was thinking that there was a sudden take-off point.  The major error was the view that once there has been a certain degree of pump priming from the developed world there would be a sudden magic moment when everything was swoosh and from there on aid would no longer be needed to the same extent as heretofore.  That certainly has not come to pass.</P>
    <P>Senator Michael D. Higgins said that we make a mistake if we think of the present situation of the developing world in terms only of natural disasters.  The problem here is that the economic and in many instances the social structure of the developing countries make the impact of natural disasters so much more serious <Col N="803" /> for them, but it is not the whole story.  I have been concerned with the problem of drought.  The countries of Africa, through the Economic Commission for Africa of the United Nations, have now reconciled themselves to the view that the main problem they face is how to live with drought, how to plan for drought, how to adjust their national planning for this recurrent phenomena under modern conditions.</P>
    <P>While we must do all we can in regard to the question of appropriate technology, which Senator M.D. Higgins mentioned, in regard to such questions as community involvement in the carrying out of actual projects, in regard to the question of reversing something that has been a fault of the developing countries and that is the urban bias of their governments which has been a critical factor in accentuating the difficulties of the development.  None of these is an answer.  We have to recognise that there are a number of things which must be done, there are a number of defects which must be cured, every one of which is necessary in order to cure the situation but none of which is even close to being sufficient for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We are voting moneys that are necessary for long term development in particular to the continent of Africa which has been so stricken.  In our own approach to the spending of this money, in what we should advocate in the international fora in regard to the matter, the tremendous complexity of the problem must be recognised. I would like to take the occasion of this Bill not only to welcome the fact that we are contributing but to make passing reference to our increased ODA expenditure, and beyond that to welcome not only the way in which our ODA programme has been balanced but equally the way in which the ODA section in the Department of Foreign Affairs has ensured when we give money for foreign aid that that money is well spent.  It is clear that the increased amount the Irish taxpayer has contributed to Overseas Development Aid over the past decade <Col N="804" /> or so has been enormous.  There were some fluctuations but there has been steady progress.  I would like to welcome in particular the fact that, under the national plan, the Government have indicated what the path ahead will be.  This has enabled other organisations who are engaged in development aid work to do their own forward planning over a period of two to four years.  This is extremely important from the point of view of ensuring that the whole Irish effort, both the official effort and the private effort and the combined effort of the Department and the private agencies, that all these will be as effective as possible. Many people are not satisfied with the amount of aid and would have hoped that we would have moved more quickly towards the UN target, but at least we are not dropping back as many countries with far greater resources have been doing in regard to the question of the percentage of GNP which is being devoted to Overseas Development Aid.</P>
    <P>We must pay tribute to the Government for what has been done and to the Minister for Finance, who is with us here today, for his willingness to increase the amount of budgetary resources for this area.  We must also pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, for the enthusiasm and efficiency with which he has carried out that programme and in which he ensured that we are getting good value for this money.  There has been an appropriate balance in this programme in recent years, there has been an appropriate balance between multilateral aid, which is the subject of the Bill before us, and bilateral aid.  There are advantages and dangers in each.  There are dangers in multilateral aid in that we cannot see exactly what is happening to our money, that it is not something as immediately visible as a bilateral aid project in which the Irish taxpayer can be shown the results of individual projects under bilateral aid.  It would be wrong that we should either devote almost all of our aid to multilateral and equally wrong to devote almost all to bilateral aid.  The balance in our programme between the short term <Col N="805" /> and the medium term and the long term is something that has been well maintained. There is a tendency for our aid to focus on Africa, but this is appropriate.  Our priority countries, which are among the poorest in the world, include mainly African countries.  We have made a very real contribution to that unhappy continent.</P>
    <P>Our national overseas aid policy is a well balanced one and is a worthwhile one.  In respect of what has been done in this Bill in providing further money towards the World Bank system we can welcome some new directions in regard to the operation of the World Bank itself. In the particular areas of the development of water resources and supply with which I am concerned in my professional work, there has been a very distinct change in World Bank policy.  There has been a sensitivity in regard to the decisions made by officers of the World Bank in regard to projects which recognise the reality of what is happening on the ground.  We can see a far more flexible policy, a policy that is far more socially meaningful than at the earlier stages when there was a concentration on infrastructure with all the connotations that ugly word has in reflecting a scaffolding not related to human problems.</P>
    <P>These are a few points I would like to raise in welcoming this Bill.  It was entirely appropriate that Senator John Connor should make a wide-ranging speech so that the concern he expressed, and which is shared by Senators from all parties, should be made clear.  I hope this House will have an opportunity within the next few months of another broad-ranging debate.  We can say to the Minister for Finance to keep smiling and keep paying up and when the Minister for State at the Department of Foreign Affairs comes in we will be able to say to him: &ldquo;Keep carrying on in maintaining a balanced programme, keep carrying on in your efforts to have that programme increased and, above all, keep up the good work you are doing in ensuring that every pound of Irish money that goes gets the best value for the people on the <Col N="806" /> ground&rdquo;.  This is a Bill which is welcome to all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the Bill and say a few words about it.  This is the second occasion on which it was my privilege to contribute to a debate which concerned itself with the arranging of an Irish contribution to the International Development Association.  The first occasion was in 1983 and on that occasion something of a crisis had arisen within the association because of the type of unilateral action on the part of the United States of America to which Senator Michael Higgins has already referred.</P>
      <P>In criticising the way in which the commitment of the US to this organisation has changed over the years it is important to put it in the context of the United States of America and other developed countries in the western bloc being much more willing and much more effective than the eastern bloc countries in giving development aid to countries that need it without political strings.  Most of the aid from the eastern bloc countries, in so far as it exists at all and indeed, it is of a very limited nature, is tied in very much with military and quasi-military decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decisions which are taken are taken purely on the basis of strategic examination or thought based on the maximisation of the eastern bloc military and other influence.  It is because I do not agree with that approach that I continue to ask our friends in the United States not to fall into the same trap.  Of course it is understandable that in a superpower like the USA a certain portion of their aid would be associated with their own foreign policy interests and I do not think we can reasonably complain about that. However, there should be an essential element of their foreign aid which is independent of their own individual foreign policy objectives.  In that way I think the contributions which they have been making, and which they still intend to make, to the International Development Association represent a very positive contribution to the establishment of a <Col N="807" /> more just world order.  In so far as these contributions are made or continue to be made they should have our support and the US should have our praise in that regard.</P>
    <P>However, it is well to point out that the original contribution of the United States to this fund when it was originally established was in the order of 42 per cent.  The amount of that contribution has been falling steadily.  That, of itself, is not altogether surprising because other countries, relative to the US, have become prosperous and other countries are in the position to make more substantial contributions on a percentage basis. However, by the time it had arrived at the sixth replenishment the amount of aid being provided by the United States, as a percentage of the total fund, had dropped to 27 per cent.  That represented a fairly fair assessment of the changed economic balance in the world, recognising that there were some oil-rich countries who were beginning to make a more substantial contribution.  That sort of substantial contribution was appropriate in view of the additional riches which they had got over the years as a result of the exploitation of their natural resources.</P>
    <P>However, by the time the sixth replenishment came about the United States contribution had dropped to 27 per cent. During the course of the execution of that a most extraordinary situation arose in which an agreement that was originally intended to last for three years was suddenly stretched to four years by a unilateral decision of the USA.  I would remind the House that the occasion of the 1983 Act &mdash; or Bill as it was at the time &mdash; which came before this House was in the context of Ireland making an exceptional contribution to enable some amount of work to be continued during the additional fourth year which had been created as a result of the unwillingness of the United States of America to fulfil its previous commitment in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is too simplistic to say that it is a lack of will on the part of the United States <Col N="808" /> Government or on the present administration there.  My experience, from discussing this matter with members of Congress is that there is a very fundamental disagreement about or a lack of understanding among members of Congress of the necessity for this kind of aid.  We must use all our powers, both by speaking in this House and outside it, to persuade the United States that ultimately it is in their interest to make contributions of this kind.</P>
    <P>Against that background it is disturbing to see that the United States contribution has fallen to 25 per cent but that is not as disturbing as the information which is given the Minister's speech here today that the total amount of the seventh replenishment is only going to be £9 billion which will be a 25 per cent decrease, in US dollar terms, on the £12 billion negotiated in the sixth replenishment. I take it &mdash; and the Minister will no doubt indicate if I am right &mdash; that it is intended that the £9 billion will cover a three-year period.  Effectively what has happened is that the original decision of the United States to make a reduction in the amount of the money available to the International Development Organisation from £12 billion over three years to £12 billion over four years &mdash; in other words from £4 billion to £3 billion a year &mdash; is being given approval by this smaller replenishment on this occasion.  The amount of money which is being made available reflects that problem.</P>
    <P>It is only right that recognition be given to the fact that there is a proposal by the Minister to make our contribution towards the Special Facility which will be used for aid in a specific area of the world. These <i>ad hoc</i> special arrangements are not really as satisfactory as the maintenance of the level of funding of the association itself at the £4 billion a year rather than the £3 billion a year which it now seems to be heading towards.  The Minister might explain to what extent the £9 billion over the three year period plus the suggested Special Facility for Sub-Saharan <Col N="809" /> Africa will fall short of the previous rate of £4 billion per year.  When we see that we will see the full extent of the reduction in the level of activity of this excellent organisation which has taken place as a result of the USA decision.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government are quite right in maintaining their contribution to this organisation at the highest possible level. They are also quite right in adding to that the additional contribution for the special funding arrangement.  However, during the course of the negotiations for the eighth replenishment which are now about to take place &mdash; and these are much more important than for the seventh which now has all the dies cast &mdash; the Minister should, in his capacity as the Irish governor of the International Development Association, make it clear that it would be the wish of this House, as I am sure it would be the wish of the Government itself and of the other House, that the level of funding in the International Development Association would revert from the £3 billion a year to at least £4 billion a year and that the eighth replenishment, when it is negotiated, should take into account that increased level of funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his capacity as a governor of the International Development Association can be assured of our support in that regard.  It is important that we, as a country which lately became a member of the first tier, so to speak of the International Development Association and as such has good friends and contracts among a wide range of nations who are members of that body at various levels, would be seen to support the high level of funding.  In that regard the Minister would have the support of all sides of this House in the work he is trying to do.  I certainly join in the support which is being given to the Bill and I am quite sure it will receive speedy consideration in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Members of the House who contributed to this debate which, if I may say so, has turned out to <Col N="810" /> be a great deal more than a debate on the specifics of the Bill that is before us but which I must honestly say I have found to be very useful indeed as a preparation and sounding out of the views of this House &mdash; which would represent progressive views in many places outside this House &mdash; a preparation for the input that we will be making to the argument about the next replenishment of the IDA and indeed to some of the work of the World Bank and some of our approaches to the debt problem.</P>
      <P>It is very clear from what Senators have said that not only is there a great deal of support in this House for the work of the IDA but that, far more important, there is a great deal of understanding here and a great deal of expertise to be offered by this House in the approach to the work that is being done and will be done in future by both the IDA and other agencies that are involved in the process of development.  I would like personally to thank the House very sincerely for that. I would like to make a few remarks in a moment about some of the suggestions that have been made and some of the topics that have been taken up.</P>
      <P>A thread running through all of the contributions there has been &mdash; and I quote Senator Lanigan &ldquo;disappointment and anger&rdquo; at the way the United States has played its part in relation both to the last replenishment and to the current one. I am glad, however, that Senator O'Leary put on the record quite specifically what actually happened.  The word &ldquo;default&rdquo; was used by one Member of the House.  I think that was going a bit too far.  Senator O'Leary has put the matter in its proper perspective which is that for the sixth replenishment a contribution which should have been made over three years was made over four years.  That, as Senator O'Leary said, appears then to have set a headline or framework for an approach to the seventh replenishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view of the House is indeed shared by all of the other donor countries without exception as far as the seventh replenishment is concerned.  For quite some time there was a reluctance to agree on <Col N="811" /> anything for as long as the donors felt that perhaps by continuing the negotiations some progress might have been made in changing the United States position. Eventually, we had to come to the conclusion, with great reluctance, that there was no point in dragging out the negotiations any further because there was no prospect of getting the kind of result that we needed.  As I said in my opening remarks, it was the feeling of all of the other donor countries that a replenishment of $12 billion was the minimum that was required in order to allow the IDA to make what we would regard as an adequate contribution.  In the earlier part of the discussions it was very clear that most of the donor countries, had they been given a little more freedom in the discussions, would have preferred a figure somewhat higher than $12 billion. Senator Lanigan asked what the stabilisation and adjustment programmes are, who makes judgments on them and if they are programmes which suit the disbursing country.  There are a few things which I would like to make clear in that context.</P>
    <P>In the case of IDA operations, first of all, Senator Lanigan seems to have overlooked the fact that no interest is charged on the loans.  There is effectively a moratorium on repayments for ten years: repayments do not commence until ten years after the loan operation is carried out.  The currency in which the loans are made out and the currency in which they are repaid is the special drawing rate.  That in fact, given the nature of the instrument itself, is a far more stable unit than the dollar.  In fact that is the very reason why it is used in these operations.</P>
    <P>I know that there are times when repayment commitments, taken on at the beginning of a project that seemed to be reasonable, can over a period of time, turn out to be very burdensome indeed because of appreciation of the currency in which they are denominated.  It was for that reason that it was decided that the operations of the IDA be carried out in SDRs.  I think I can give Senator Lanigan some little comfort on that point <Col N="812" /> in relation to the concerns that he expressed.  This, as Senator Dooge pointed out, is multilateral aid.  There is no direct connection between the donor country and the recipient so that the kind of operations about which Senator Lanigan seemed to be worried cannot by definition arise in relation to the operations of the IDA.</P>
    <P>The stabilisation and adjustment programmes which must be capable of being monitored are, in my view, a very necessary part of operations of this kind.  They are intended to ensure that aid that is given actually produces a net benefit to the recipient countries.  I would be the first to admit that there is room for discussion as to what specific type of programmes are needed.  I would also agree with the contention that Senator Michael D. Higgins and Senator Dooge would share that in many cases in the past such programmes have been excessively influenced by the points of view or traditions of the donors, in situations where the recipients did not themselves have either the administrative framework or the intellectual framework or the cultural framework to build programmes that would in fact be more suitable to their needs than the ones that were finally agreed.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of imposing a particular programme on a recipient country nor is it a question that any one or any group of the donor countries can determine without reference to anybody else what kind of programme should be implemented.  The programmes are discussed between the IDA and the recipient country.  In that regard many of the suggestions made by Senator Higgins are ones which should be taken up.  I must say I would welcome the emergence in recipient countries of a more appropriate framework for the construction of programmes than we seem to have had up to now.  I am quite sure that the board of the IDA would welcome such a development.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins may have intended to go a little further than that.  I am not going to be tempted too far down that path but I would like to make the point <Col N="813" /> that I agree with his basic contention that where the developing countries themselves can produce a better framework from their point of view for policies that would meet their needs, then it is up to the IDA and it is up to the donor countries to be informed by that and take account of it and wherever we can do so to help in the development of that framework.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor in a very wide-ranging contribution referred to the need for aid to be co-ordinated.  I agree with that as long as co-ordination does not mean that it must be all centralised into fewer and fewer agencies.  Given the range of operations that the IDA and indeed the World Bank are involved in, there is a need to ensure that each part of the programme is informed by other things that are going on.  It would be wrong if that meant that we develop some kind of a rigid idea of the balance between different kinds of programmes that should be adhered to in all circumstances.  I do not think that was what Senator Connor was suggesting.  I would certainly be very anxious to avoid it.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins referred to the present danger of politicisation of IDA's operations and, indeed on a wider scale, to that of aid operations in general.  He asked if I had a comment to make on it.  My comment would be that I agree entirely that these operations should not be politicised and certainly not in the way to which he referred.  I would object most violently to that.  In fact, the very nature of the judgement structure that we have for these programmes is designed to depoliticise it as much as possible and ensure that the aid programmes produce a net accretion of welfare to the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>The allegation of politicisation may go somewhat further than the facts would actually justify.  In relation to the situation in Nicaragua, one of the countries to which Senator Higgins referred, I should make the point that since the present administration took over in 1979 loans totalling over $100 million have been made by the International Development <Col N="814" /> Association and the World Bank. In 1981, Nicaragua exceeded the income eligibility threshold for loans from the International Development Association &mdash; $790 million limit to which I referred earlier on.  It is now not eligible for loans from the IDA because of the technical rules that are there; it has not been excluded because there has been a politicisation of the approach to that country. In addition, it is in arrears in repayments to the World Bank.  It is standard procedure in World Bank operating practice that disbursements are slowed down or suspended in the case of countries that have got into arrears.  Senator Higgins and I may not agree on the rest of this, but it seems to me to be a reasonably prudent practice, both for the borrower and for the lender, in a situation like that to stop further accretion of obligations.</P>
    <P>As far as Tanzania is concerned, to which Senator Higgins also referred, a total of $350 million worth of loans have been approved by the IDA for Tanzania since 1980.  World Bank loans to Tanzania have followed a different course over that period.  Tanzania is in arrears also and so disbursements have been suspended. It is not in a position to take on loans at the kind of rates that the World Bank must apply, which are market related rates.</P>
    <P>The reason for a situation which Senator Higgins interprets as politicisation is, in fact, one that results from the technical rules, which have good foundation in practice, as regards IDA and World Bank loans to those two countries. This does not take away from the fact that I agree with the basic concern that Senator Higgins has that we should at all costs avoid the politicisation of the operations of these aid agencies.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Senator Higgins had in mind when he suggested that we should now begin to think of a new form of debt relationship.  It might be indelicate or unwise of me to go further in speculating on what that might be, in case somebody else might think I had the same kind of idea myself.  Obviously, there is an area there dealing with the debt problem <Col N="815" /> where it is clear that we need, if not new solutions, then at least a new way of applying the classic solutions.  The recent emergence of what has come to be called the &ldquo;Baker initiative&rdquo; seems to me to hold out some hope for action in that regard.  It is a pity that such an initiative should have emerged following on the more unfortunate history of the last couple of years in relation to replenishment of the IDA.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins raised a number of issues with which we, and in particular the World Bank and the IDA, should be concerned and which are in fact matters of moment in both of those organisations. I will take a few examples from what he said &mdash; the fears that aid disbursements or loans through agencies like the IDA are used up in developing countries by urban elites, for example, by what Senator Higgins referred to as dangerous import practices, which is always a problem, or by new forms of consumption that do not do really anything for the mass of people in those countries or for their overall welfare.</P>
    <P>I agree that we need new ways of defining the means by which those deals are met.  I think that the comment of Senator Dooge to the effect that one of the mistakes of the past has been to think that there was a take-off point after which things suddenly began to happen by some magical process is very much to the point. I would have to say, rather ruefully, that that applies not only to the developing countries but to a great extent in the developed countries also.  It is a matter almost of record now that many governments of developing countries have an excessive urban bias.  This has created problems which they did not have to create for themselves in the process of development.  Indeed, they could probably fairly say that, to the extent that bias is there, it is a colonial hangover and in fact has not been spotted in time because those of us looking at it, also in the West, tend to have an excessively urban bias and would never have thought it at all remarkable that policies should follow that particular course.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> As Senator Dooge has said, we are not dropping back in relation to our progress towards the UN target; in fact, we are making very good progress.  In the period from 1970-1983 our performance in terms of the proportion of GNP made available has been to see roughly a sevenfold increase in the proportion from a very low base.  It exceeds the record of any other country in the OECD/DAC group and exceeds even the highest of them by a very respectable margin.  Had the other OECD/DAC countries produced the same kind of performance over that period instead of in 1983 making an average of 0.36 per cent of GNP available for aid, they would instead have been making available about 2.5 per cent of GNP.  Of course that is an impossible target, but that has been the scale of the increase that we have managed to bring about over that period and through some very difficult circumstances.  I will graciously decline Senator Dooge's invitation which he issued just after making that statement.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary made the point, which is a very pertinent one, that <i>ad hoc</i> special arrangements are not by any means as satisfactory as permanent ongoing structures.  I am not so sure if it is entirely appropriate to compare a replenishment of $12 million over three years, subsequently stretched out to four, with a replenishment of $9 billion over three years plus a Special Facility of $1 billion. It is very clear that over the period of this seventh replenishment both the absolute amount of assistance and indeed the real level of assistance will have declined for the period as a whole and for any year within it.  It is not a matter of the assistance being tranched out in a regular pattern year by year, because the assistance is drawn down as projects become available and are passed.  But there is no doubt that the real level of assistance through this mechanism has taken a severe denting between the sixth and the seventh replenishments and it is a matter of some considerable regret as I have said to all of the donor countries, with the exception of the United States.  I hope that in the very near future it will be seen as a matter <Col N="817" /> of some considerable regret in the United States and that a different and more constructive view will be taken of the eighth replenishment when negotiations begin in the near future.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on that note.  I want again to thank the House very sincerely for a very useful and constructive debate which I feel sure is going to lead to the passage of this Bill today, but which, as I said before, also provides me with the assurance that we have the support of the House for further progress in the work and the structures of the IDA and the IMF &mdash; I am glad that Senator Michael D. Higgins has come back &mdash; and with a far better nourished conceptual framework for my own approach to this work in the future.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Chester Beatty Library Bill, 1985: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham) Joseph Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out work on the maintenance, repair, upkeep, restoration and improvement of the Chester Beatty Library.</P>
      <P>The Chester Beatty Library, situated at Shrewsbury Road, Dublin, is a private collection of <i>objets d'art</i> bequeathed to a board of trustees for the use and enjoyment of the public by the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty on his death in 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The collection which by international standards is unique, includes treasures from European, Islamic and Oriental civilisations: ancient papyri and clay tablets, manuscripts, rare texts, minature <Col N="818" /> Arabic paintings, Chinese jade books and many other items.</P>
    <P>Mr. Beatty's legacy did not include any financial provision for the operating and maintenance costs of the library.  In view of the uniqueness of the collection the State has grant-aided the library since the establishment of the trust in 1968.  An amount representing between 80 and 90 per cent of the operating and maintenance cost is annually grant-aided to the trust.  This came to £167,000 in 1984.  As you can appreciate the proper maintenance and upkeep of the buildings which house the collection poses many problems. In order to ensure that many fragile and priceless objects do not depreciate it is essential to maintain variations in temperature, humidity and light within strict limits.  Because of this and of the need to maintain a high standard of upkeep of the buildings themselves the Government decided to entrust the maintenance and upkeep of the library to the Office of Public Works who have experience of dealing with similar problems over the years in the National Museum and Gallery.  Since, however, the buildings that house the Chester Beatty Collection are not public buildings, legislation is necessary to enable the commissioners to incur expenditure on the library and the Bill provides for this.</P>
    <P>It also contains a clause enabling the Minister for Finance to recoup to the trustees costs already incurred on certain works at the premises.  These works, already undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works and paid for by the trustees, include roof repairs and security measures.  The amount involved is approximately £50,000.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which will enable the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out certain necessary maintenance work at the Chester Beatty Library.  The library, as it will be evident from the Minister's speech, is a cultural treasure for which this nation will be for ever indebted to the late Sir Alfred Chester Beatty.  It was his grand gesture in giving his priceless collection of books <Col N="819" /> and objects to the Irish nation that gives rise to the Bill before us.  Successive Governments, it should be noted, have been generous in their support of the library.  We have, of course, a duty as a nation to ensure that the buildings where the library is housed are properly maintained and that the relevant level of security is at all times available.  The fulfilment of this duty means that public funds must be spent on the library to meet the recurring costs of maintenance, which again as the Minister has outlined in his speech, are particularly demanding in the case of this library.  It is of vital importance, obviously, that these priceless items continue to be preserved in good condition.  We must never let it happen that, through neglect on our part, any of these items might be damaged.</P>
      <P>The library is by now an important part of out heritage.  Its varied contents include some of the best collections of their kind in the world.  The cultural significance of the library is self-evident.  In addition however, the library is proving to be an important attraction to visitors from abroad, especially from Japan and China.  This is an added bonus.  Some of these visitors from the Far East are industrialists who are contemplating the establishment of industries in Ireland. The trustees of the library recently published a magnificent catalogue of Japanese prints contained in the library, which, I understand, the Industrial Development Authority will now present to potential industrial investors from Japan and elsewhere.  Here we see a practical example of a link between culture and industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the pleasure of visiting the Chester Beatty library with my wife and family in the recent past and I would urge others to do likewise.  I would like to pay a tribute to the courteous dedicated staff who went to considerable trouble to explain the various items to us and to all the other visitors to the library, so that our understanding would be the greater. The Board of Trustees also deserve considerable praise because they give voluntarily of their time and expertise to the <Col N="820" /> running of the library.  This work by the Trustees is a form of public service which deserves particular praise because without them, this important cultural institution would not adequately function.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to section 3 of the Bill, which says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may in his absolute discretion pay to the trustees an amount equal to the whole or any part of any money that is expended by the trustees in respect of work carried out on or after the 18th day of October, 1984, and before the passing of this Act in relation to the maintenance, upkeep, care, renovation or improvement of the premises.</P>
    <P>The Minister has of course referred to this outlay which has already been paid by the trustees.  As I understand, the trustees have been told that the Government will honour that sum in total, which the Minister has said is approximately £50,000.  Could I just ask the Minister to assure the House that, while the Minister for Finance may wish to retain absolute discretion in the matter, he will, in fact, refund the proceeds in full in respect of the payments they have made for work carried out on or after 18 October 1984? I warmly welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to take this opportunity to welcome the Chester Beatty Library Bill, 1985.  The purpose of the Bill, as has been stated by the Minister, is to enable the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland to carry out work for the maintenance, repair, upkeep, renovation and improvement of the Chester Beatty Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is particularly heartening at a time of deep economic recession that it is possible to devote some of the scarce public funds available to the arts and in particular to this special library which is so dear to the hearts of Irish people in general, Dubliners I suspect in particular and indeed to visitors who come to our shores.  It gives us too an opportunity in this House of the Oireachtas to dwell on the life and works of Sir Alfred Chester Beatty and of his library which he <Col N="821" /> bequeathed to the Irish people on his death in 1968.  The bringing together in Shrewsbury Road of this man's lifetime collection in the library which he built has enabled us to view in one place the history of civilisation from 2,700 BC to the present century and in geographical provenance this collection encircles the globe from Ireland here on the fringes of Western Europe to Sumatra and Japan and I would like your indulgence, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, to speak about Sir Alfred Chester Beatty and how this whole collection came about, the collection which we here today can enjoy and derive so much pleasure from.</P>
    <P>Sir Alfred Chester Beatty was born in New York on 7 February 1875 and he was the youngest of three sons of John Cuming Beatty and his wife, Hetty Bull. His mother was of old English colonial stock and his father's ancestry was Irish. Chester Beatty's paternal grandfather, Robert Beatty, was born in 1789 and died in 1850.  He was from Armagh city.  His paternal grandmother, Catherine Louisa Armstrong, was born in 1813 and died in 1891.  She was from Mountrath in Country Laois.  He was named after a distant relative, the Reverend Alfred Chester but since he disliked the name Alfred he was always known as Chester and gave his signature as A. Chester Beatty.  So even at that early stage he was a person of strong views and decided tastes which would be reflected in his collection at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Sadly Chester Beatty did not have his memoirs published but they do exist in a very brief and unpublished form and in them he tells us that the Reverend Alfred Chester, and I quote: &ldquo;had a mania for collecting minerals, curios, tiny chips of rock from the Pyramids, bits of wood supposed to come from Captain Cook's ship and samples of lead and copper ore ...and probably this fired my enthusiasm and of course, I was the usual collector of postage stamps like all the other boys at that time and the boys of today&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is true to say that from very small beginnings great collections can be amassed and those of us who are parents I think should temper whatever <Col N="822" /> urge we might have to disregard the precious treasures that are from time to time shoved under our noses or which we perhaps fall over as we go around our homes.</P>
    <P>While he was a pupil at Westminister School, Dobb's Ferry, near the Hudson River he enjoyed searching for mineral samples on the building site where a series of tunnels was being driven to carry water to the big Cruton Aqueduct in New York.  A friend of his parents, John C.F. Randolph, a mining engineer, encouraged the young boy to pursue his interest. Mr. Randolph was a graduate of Columbia University and Chester Beatty sat the entrance examination there on leaving school in 1893.  However he did not enter Columbia University directly.  He decided to accompany his friend and next-door-neighbour, Edward K. Mills, who was going there to study civil engineering at Princeton.  Chester Beatty always remembered this year with affection but as Princeton had no course in mine engineering at that time, he left to enrol at Columbia University School of Mines.  His academic excellence soon became clear and in 1898 he received his degree of Engineer of Mines with an average 91 per cent in his final examination.</P>
    <P>Though his family was quite well-to-do &mdash; his father was a banker and stockbroker &mdash; Beatty refused an allowance from his parents and headed west to Denver, Colorado with 200 dollars in his pocket and a one-way train ticket.  He tried to reassure his mother, who had heard many tales of the wild west, by showing her a letter of introduction from Mr. Randolph which he thought would guarantee him a job.  However, when he arrived in Denver he was disappointed to find that no job awaited him.  The only work available was that of &ldquo;mucker&rdquo; or labourer in a mine shovelling rock. Beatty quickly accepted this position from Mr. T.A. Rickard, later to be a leading mining historian and one of the founders of mining journalism, and began his career shovelling rock at the Kekionga Gold Mine in Boulder County, Colorado, receiving 25 cents an hour for a 10-hour day.  During the next few years <Col N="823" /> he gained valuable practical experience as he worked his way from &ldquo;mucker&rdquo; to foreman, supervisor to mine manager, mine owner to millionaire.</P>
    <P>I feel, as I relate this to you, that the whole story is intensely inspiring.  I think the quality and the calibre of the man comes through right from the earliest days and of course we all know that in those days and indeed now mining life was rough and dangerous but hard work and courage paid off handsomely.  Property was won by staking one's claim and profit was seen as just reward for enterprise. There was, of course, no income tax.  Beatty often travelled on horseback or by Wells Fargo stagecoach and always carried six-guns at his side and a Colt revolver tucked into his boot.  The mining engineer was constantly watching out for mines which had been &ldquo;salted&rdquo; in an effort to dupe the examiner.  However, a good mine was worth a fortune to the exploration companies and the engineer learned that mistakes were unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Beatty's reputation grew quickly and he soon came to the attention of John Hays Hammond, the foremost mining engineer of the time.  Hammond recounts in his autobiography that Beatty eagerly agreed to be his assistant and told him: &ldquo;I still have beer tastes though I hope to get to champagne some day.&rdquo;  Success came very swiftly indeed when in 1903 Hammond became chief engineer with the Guggenheim Exploration Company and Beatty was appointed his assistant chief engineer.  This important position secured Beatty a salary of $20,000 with lucrative investment possibilities and gave him the opportunity to travel throughout the United States of America, Mexico and Canada.  In 1905, he negotiated a deal with King Leopold II of the Belgians on behalf of the Guggenheim Exploration Company, a contract securing the mineral rights of a huge area of the then Congo Free State.</P>
    <P>In 1908, however, Beatty decided not to renew his five-year contract with the Guggenheims, even though they offered him Hammonds's job and asked him to name his salary.  Instead he chose to open <Col N="824" /> an office in New York at 71 Broadway under the title of &ldquo;A. Chester Beatty, Consulting Mining Engineer&rdquo;.  It took courage to refuse the Guggenheims' offer.  Nevertheless, it was more than likely that Beatty would succeed as an independent mining engineer as he had the necessary expertise, contacts and enterprise at that stage.  He then began to travel widely and his office business expanded with the help of a group of loyal assistant and associates, some of whom were to remain with him for 50 years.  This is another indication of the calibre and quality and the personality of this man that he could attract that type of dedicated loyal support from his associates.</P>
    <P>One of these men who was so loyal to Chester Beatty was Harold A. Titcomb, who was his best friend and classmate at Columbia University School of Mines. They went on many mine examinations together and Beatty loved to describe their adventures in Mexico as they tried to cope with snakes, bandits and the sweltering heat.  When Titcomb opened an office in London, Beatty decided to spend part of the year there also.  Soon he realised that London was an ideal centre for mining companies as it was the focus of the vast British Commonwealth.  While in London, he became acquainted with Herbert Hoover, later to be the 31st President of the United States of America. Together they developed mines in Burma and Russia.</P>
    <P>In 1911 Beatty's young wife, Grace Madeleine Rickard, whom he had married in 1900, died of typhoid fever, leaving him with two young children &mdash; a daughter Ninette, aged ten, and a son, Alfred Chester, Junior, aged four.  His own health was impaired after years in the mines and he suffered from silicosis. He was shocked to have an application for life insurance refused because he was considered unlikely to live more than a few years.</P>
    <P>Already at that stage a millionaire, he decided to leave the busy world of mining in the United States and in May 1912 he bought the magnificent Baroda House at 24 Kensington Palace Gardens, London, <Col N="825" /> the former residence of the Maharajah of the Province of Baroda in India.  He remarried the following year to Edith Dunn of New York and they settled in London.  In 1914, they visited Egypt where they were introduced to the world of the East.  Here they bought some beautiful Korans in the Bazaars.  The dry climate so attracted Chester Beatty that he bought a house near Cairo where he spent many winters over the following 25 years.  I suspect that from that time onwards there developed his enormous love of Islamic culture and tradition, particularly when he began his collection of Korans, which are a feature of the collection in the Chester Beatty Library.</P>
    <P>His period in Egypt enabled him to recuperate somewhat from his illnesses. His interest in the potential of the mining industry encouraged him to establish his own mining company to be called Selection Trust.  The company was launched in December 1914 with a total capital of £50,000, though the Great War of 1914-1918 delayed the expansion of the enterprise.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Beatty became ill again in 1917, suffering from a near-fatal attack of pneumonia and Spanish influenza.  His doctors advised him to go to a warm climate to recover and so, despite the Great War, he decided to take a world health cruise.  Accompanied by his wife and daughter he spent four months in Japan and travelled to China.  He had long been fascinated by certain oriental art objects and by 1914 he owned the superb collection of Chinese snuff bottles.  His interest in art was undoubtedly inspired by his boyhood fascination with the beauty of rock samples and thus he could admire snuff bottles made from semi-precious stones.  One can determine a gradual sophistication in Beatty's artistic taste, as his interest in Chinese snuff bottles, Japanese inro and netsuke and oriental rugs encouraged him to visit the East.  Beatty regarded the East as including all places from Moorish Spain to the north of Africa, all the way to Japan and Indonesia.  His travels in Egypt and the Far East fuelled his interest and he returned from every trip with beautiful <Col N="826" /> examples of oriental craftmanship.  He began to organise his art collection in a similar manner to the organisation of his mining activities; the subject was vetted by experts, examined for forgery, a price given, only the highest quality accepted and the final decision rested with Beatty himself.  He was supported by his wife Edith, a remarkable lady whose many interests included Western illuminated manuscripts, antique furniture, post-mid-19th century European painting, especially French Impressionists and, oddly enough, thoroughbred racehorses, which is out of tandem with the other items that I have mentioned, but requiring the same discernment and eye and taste which obviously both husband and wife developed together and which led to their mutual enjoyment.</P>

    <Title>Teachers' Conciliation and Arbitration: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government (a) to re-assert their commitment to the agreed procedures of Conciliation and Arbitration for teachers and (b) to enter into immediate discussions with the three teacher unions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The first part of this motion seeks the reassertion from the Government of their commitment to a system that has contributed much to good and orderly industrial relations since its introduction.  Over the years both Government parties, Fine Gael and Labour, have on numerous occasions outlined their desire for good industrial relations.  Many times, too, over the years both parties have reiterated their commitment to the principle of free collective bargaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Labour Party manifesto, which was issued prior to the 1982 General Election, there was a section headed <Col N="827" />&ldquo;Collective Bargaining&rdquo;.  This section stated:</P>
    <P>The trade union movement and the public service have faced unprecedented attacks from the Government on pay and on negotiating procedures. Labour's policy is:</P>
    <P>(i)  free collective bargaining between workers and employers linked to a democratic planning process;</P>
    <P>(ii)  opposition to statutory control of wages;</P>
    <P>(ii)  opposition to restrictions by the main parties on the negotiating rights of trade unions.</P>
    <P>The Government in their document <i>Building on Reality</i> state that:</P>
    <P>...no effort must be spared to ensure that our industrial relations institutions and procedures are the best possible.</P>
    <P>For almost 35 years the system that has been in existence for the determination of teachers' pay has been conciliation and arbitration.  This is the system that has been agreed and accepted over the years by the teachers' unions, the management bodies and successive Governments. Conciliation and arbitration has been an orderly system.  It has worked well.  It has ensured that for the past 35 years there has been industrial peace in our schools. Our teachers went about the job of teaching. Salary claims were negotiated in an orderly fashion and resolved.  Strike action was a weapon resorted to by others but not by teachers.  This has been the situation since the first scheme of conciliation and arbitration for teachers was agreed and signed on 24 February 1951. In that year there was an inter-Party Government in office and the Minister for Education of the day was the late General Richard Mulcahy.  the current scheme was agreed upon and signed in 1973 by the then Coalition Government. This scheme provided that, if agreement cannot be reached by the parties in the conciliation council, then disagreement is registered and the issue is submitted to <Col N="828" /> the teachers' arbitration board for determination. The public service arbitrator, who is appointed by the Government, is the chairman of the teachers' arbitration board.  Following the hearing of a claim it is his duty to decide the amount of the award, if any, to be made and to provide his recommendations in a report to the Government.</P>
    <P>The establishment and acceptance of these procedures has resulted in 35 years of industrial peace and the orderly resolution of teachers' salary claims.  For all these 35 years the arbitrator's recommendations have been regarded as binding on both sides and all arbitration reports have been implemented.  Now it would appear that the Government are prepared, and even determined, to undermine and even to dismantle this system.</P>
    <P>The public service arbitrator has not been reappointed and threats have been made by Government sources that the 10 per cent arbitration award to teachers will not be honoured.  Is it any wonder, therefore, that teachers are up in arms? Is it any wonder that they feel angry and frustrated?  Is it any wonder that they came in their thousands to Dublin last week to protest against what they see as the unilateral dismantling of existing conciliation and arbitration machinery and a very definite threat by the Government to repudiate, for the first time in 35 years, a public service arbitration finding?  For 35 years the teachers and their unions, the associations of school managers and successive Governments have supported the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  The alternative to conciliation and arbitration is confrontation and conflict.  The teachers know this, and this is why they are so determined to fight for and to retain their system of free collective bargaining, namely, the process of conciliation and independent arbitration.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of how they might try to fudge the issue, the Government are a party to the agreed conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers.  It is also important to remember that it was the present Government which appointed <Col N="829" /> the arbitrator whose award they are now seeking to repudiate.  Let us look for a moment at the history of this 10 per cent award.  The claim which resulted in the award in question was lodged in 1982. There were several meetings of the conciliation council at which the case was argued between the representatives of the teachers and the officials representing the Departments of Education and the public service.  No offer was made to the teachers side at council level, and disagreement was recorded.  The claim was then referred to arbitration.  The arbitrator, in arriving at his decision, took into account the case made by both parties. It is also important to remember that he took account of the state of the Exchequer finances in relation to the amount of the award which he recommended. His findings, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday, 21 October, contained the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>The state of the Exchequer finances is particularly relevant to this claim, having regard to the very high cost to the state of teachers' pay, and full regard is being had to the economic circumstances in these findings, but this cannot mean that the claim should be rejected irrespective of its merits as suggested by the official side.  Such an approach would constitute a quite unjustified discrimination against teachers as distinct from all other professional grades in the public service.</P>
    <P>From that paragraph it is obvious that it is blatantly untrue to suggest, as has been done, that the arbitrator made an award without any reference to the economic situation or the ability of the State to pay the award.  His report then went on to recommend:</P>
    <P>...that there be an increase of 10% in the salary allowances of all the claimants, such increase to take effect as to 50% thereof as and from 1st September 1985, and as to the balance as and from 1st March 1986.</P>
    <P>I have quoted from the report of the <Col N="830" /> findings of the arbitrator which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of monday, 21 October.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to certain events which occurred some months earlier, in August to be precise.  When the arbitrator had drawn up his draft report, copies of the unsigned draft report were supplied to the parties involved, namely, the teachers, the Government and management. This was in accordance with established practice.  However, contrary to established practice, some person or persons decided to leak the terms of the draft report to the media.  No one has yet denied the allegation that the leaks came from Government sources.  Anyway, as soon as details of the draft report were published in the media both the Minister for Education and the Minister for the Public Service and other Government spokespersons declared that the award would not be paid. the Minister, Deputy John Boland was quoted in <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 11 August as stating:</P>
    <P>Only those special pay awards which predated the national plan will be implemented during the life of the plan.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 12 August a Government spokesman was reported as stating:</P>
    <P>There will be no backing down on the Government's decision not to concede the special 10% teachers' award.</P>
    <P>On the RTE &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme of 20 August the Minister for Education Deputy Gemma Hussey, stated that payment of the teachers award would mean that the Government's public service pay policy would be &ldquo;seriously breached&rdquo; and that the award &ldquo;simply can't be paid&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The situation and the dispute was greatly exacerbated by the remarks of the Minister when she delivered her famous &ldquo;morality&rdquo; speech to a meeting of Young Fine Gael in O'Shea's Hotel in Bray on 19 August.  During the course of that speech the Minister is reported as stating:</P>
    <P>It is vital that all those organisations who publicly clamour for increases <Col N="831" /> should address themselves to the morality of what they are about.</P>
    <P>This statement caused great resentment among teachers throughout the country. There were two reasons for this.  First of all, it was blatantly offensive to teachers to suggest that they were publicly clamouring for increases.  The teachers' claim had been processed through the agreed machinery of conciliation and arbitration over a period of three years.  The teachers had abided by the recognised procedures. The use of an extravagant phrase such as &ldquo;publicly clamour&rdquo; was seen and was taken as a calculated insult to a profession which not only acted responsibly in the case of this particular salary claim but which has a record second to none in relation to the way in which it has conducted its industrial relations over the years. Secondly, the use of the term &ldquo;morality&rdquo; by the Minister caused widespread offence.  Was the Minister suggesting that it is immoral for any group to submit a claim to binding independent arbitration or is it only teachers or public servants who act immorally when they do so?  I sincerely hope that over the next number of weeks the Minister and the Government will address themselves to the morality of participating for three years in recognising agreed machinery for the orderly determination of a salary claim and at the end of the day seeking to renege on their obligations in relation to the outcome.</P>
    <P>It is this double-dealing on the part of the Government that has been responsible for the series of one-day strikes which have closed schools throughout the country over the past number of weeks.  It is this double-dealing by the Government that brought over 20,000 teachers to march through Dublin last week.</P>
    <P>The reason that those 20,000 teachers were on the streets of this city last Thursday was because they felt there was no other way by which they could bring home to the Government the extent of their anger and frustration.  They are angry that it has become necessary for <Col N="832" /> them to take industrial action.  They are angry because they feel that the Government have forced this action on them. They would much prefer to be in their classrooms than on the streets of Dublin. They regret the disruption of their schools and their classes.  They regret the inconvenience to parents and pupils. They are angry that the Government appear determined to discriminate against them.  They are angry at what they see as the threat to dismantle their machinery for free collective bargaining. Thursday's march was about more than the implementation of the arbitration award: it was about preserving peace in the education service.  It was about maintaining a consistent and high-quality education service.  It was about indicating to the Government that teachers expect and demand that the Government act responsibly. It was about indicating to the Government that teachers expect that the Government keep the rules and honour their obligations.</P>
    <P>The Government have a clear responsibility to the whole education service, to parents and to children and indeed to teachers, to bring this unfortunate episode of industrial unrest to an end.  They have a duty and an obligation to allow the schools to return to the normality under which they have operated for the past 35 years.  They can do so by announcing that they will implement the present arbitration award and that they will maintain the system of free collective bargaining through conciliation and arbitration which has existed for teachers for the past 35 years.</P>
    <P>The Government should immediately reappoint the service arbitrator as an indication of their commitment to the system of conciliation and arbitration.  This will make possible the holding of discussions on the 25th round of pay increases and other pay-related matters, other than awards already made.</P>
    <P>If the Government are anxious for changes in the conciliation and arbitration schemes for the public service, I see no reason why such discussions cannot take place after the public service <Col N="833" /> arbitrator has been reappointed.  In the meantime the present system should continue as before.</P>
    <P>The second part of this motion calls on the Government to enter into immediate discussions with the three teacher unions. On 28 November the Minister for Education was asked in the Dáil if she would agree to meet the teachers' unions for talks and she replied that she had not received any formal request to talks.  In col. 656 of the Dáil Official Report of 28 November 1985, she states:</P>
    <P>However, machinery exists in the Teachers' Conciliation Council for discussion of teachers' claims.  I am perfectly willing to arrange to have officials meet the unions in the council and I would hope that it would be possible to reach agreement on a package which would include the 25th round of pay increases and other pay-related matters, due account taken of the financial constraints on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I understand that since 28 November, when the Minister gave the reply I have just quoted, the general secretaries of the three unions have written to both the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Education requesting a meeting.  I strongly urge both Ministers to agree to such a meeting.  I fail to see why such a meeting cannot take place immediately.  There is little point in inviting the teachers back into the conciliation council to discuss an arbitration award that has already been granted.</P>
    <P>The only matter to be discussed in relation to that award is its implementation. To suggest that the teachers should go back to the conciliation council to discuss the arbitrator's award is like suggesting that a Christmas cake which has been taken out of the oven after baking should be put back into the oven and re-baked or, indeed, even be put back into the mixer to allow the process to start all over again.  Let us not forget that this cake has been in the oven for the past three years.  I am sure there are many matters the teachers are prepared <Col N="834" /> to discuss in the conciliation council and there is no reason why such discussions should not go ahead but in relation to the arbitrator's award of 10 per cent I would appeal to the Government to have separate and direct discussions with the teacher unions on this issue.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago it was reported that the Government were prepared to discuss the matter with the Public Services Committee of ICTU.  This, of course, was not acceptable to either the teacher unions or the public services committee of Congress.  I understand that it is established trade union practice that any Government discussions on a pay dispute must be held with the union or unions immediately concerned.  The Public Services Committee of Congress has not and never had at any time a mandate to discuss with the Government or with any other employer any award made by the arbitrator or by the Labour Court to an individual union or group of unions.  If, instead of trying to confuse the issue by suggesting such discussions, the Government had at that time entered into direct talks with the teacher unions, the massive protest march of Thursday last might never have taken place.  The Government still have time to prevent the dispute escalating. They have a duty and an obligation to do so.  The way in which they can do so is by meeting the teacher representatives for talks.</P>
    <P>Surely, after last Thursday, the Government must see that there is massive support from teachers for the campaign which the teacher unions have mounted.  The reason for that massive support is that the cause is so obviously just.  Teachers are not people who will down tools at the drop of a hat and head for Croke Park or O'Connell Street on a cold December day without just cause. The Government may have been under some illusion that the massive support for the campaign which was so evident on Thursday last did not exist.  It may be that they had begun to believe their own propaganda that the leaders of the teachers' unions did not have the support of the rank and file members.  The 20,000 teachers who travelled to Dublin from <Col N="835" /> north, south, east and west on Thursday last must surely have dispelled that myth for once and for all as far as the Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>By their actions to date the Government have been directly responsible for the series of strikes which have taken place.  Let them now prevent an escalation of the dispute by reasserting their commitment to the agreed procedure for conciliation and arbitration for teachers and by entering into immediate discussions with the three teacher unions.  It is unrealistic to suggest that these discussions should take the form of renegotiation. That is what the Government are asking when they seek to have the award discussed in the conciliation council.  The teacher unions are not prepared to renegotiate an existing arbitration award and rightly so.  This award is the outcome of the recognised and agreed negotiation machinery and is the result of an independent investigation of the claim.  During the course of that investigation all the arguments and the plea of financial difficulty were fully considered.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent award to teachers is not an award that gives teachers an advantage over other public service employees.  This award merely allows teachers to catch up with other employees.  It is based entirely on comparisons with similar groups and is fully justified on that basis.  Neither is this award an award to a group of people who are already well paid or who have wonderful conditions of service.  Teachers are not well paid.  I was talking to a teacher the other evening.  He and a friend of his both sat for the leaving certificate the same year.  He went on to university to qualify as a teacher.  His friend joined the Garda at the age of 18.  He got his first permanent job as a teacher at the age of 24.  His friend retired this year on full pension after 30 years' service.  He, the teacher, will not reach the maximum of the teachers' pay scale until next year and neither will be qualify for full pension until he has 40 years' service.  Incidentally, his friend's son, <Col N="836" /> who is now 25 years of age, is interested in politics.  If that young man had succeeded in being nominated as a candidate for the Minister's party in the last general election, and if he were elected, he might have been appointed a Minister of State or even a Cabinet Minister.  If he were appointed a Minister of State he would now be eligible for a pension of over £3,000 a year for the rest of his life.  If he were appointed a Minister, his pension entitlement would now be in excess of £5,000 for the rest of his life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the points that were made by that teacher as a response to those who would suggest that the proposed 10 per cent arbitration award is not justified or that teachers are very well paid and have wonderful conditions of service.</P>
      <P>Finally, I must say that I was amazed when I saw the amendment which has been put down by the Government side to our motion.  I could hardly believe my eyes.  As I pointed out already, the Government have not adhered to the provisions of the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for teachers.  Confidential documents were leaked to the media. Government Ministers and spokespersons have indicated that the independent arbitrator's award would not be honoured. In fact, all this happened long before the signed report was presented to the Government and even before the draft report was presented to the arbitration board.  Therefore, there were various breaches of the agreed procedures of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always until now been recognised and accepted that the findings of the chairman of the arbitration board are confidential and that no report from him should be published before its presentation to Dáil Éireann.  It is only Dáil Éireann and not the Government that can decide to reject, amend or defer an arbitration award.  To suggest, as the amendment does, that the Government have adhered to the agreed provisions of the scheme of conciliation and arbitration <Col N="837" /> for teachers can only be described as a further calculated provocation to the teacher unions and to the whole teaching profession.  I would hope that the sponsors of the amendment would decide, even at this late stage, to withdraw it.  If the amendment is not withdrawn, I would certainly hope that the teacher Senators on that side of the House would not support it.</P>
    <P>I must conclude by referring to a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Thursday, November 7.  The report is headed &ldquo;Teacher pay &mdash; Labour Backs Arbitration&rdquo; with the by-line &ldquo;John Walsh, education correspondent.&rdquo;  That report stated and I quote:</P>
    <P>The integrity of arbitration awards should be upheld, Labour Party representatives said yesterday after a meeting with teachers union leaders. An agreed statement indicated afterwards that, as the party had been responsible for setting up the conciliation and arbitration schemes within the public service the party would have to maintain them.</P>
    <P>If the Members of the Labour Party have not changed their minds since 7 November, then they should vote for the motion and reject the amendment.  I would appeal to all Senators to support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. The first part of the motion calls on the Government to re-assert their commitment to the agreed procedures of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers.  The conciliation and arbitration schemes generally have made an important contribution to industrial peace.  A study of strikes, which is being conducted in the Department of Industrial Relations in UCD with which I am associated, shows that in the 20 year period 1960 to 1979, nine organisations in the public sector, mostly State-sponsored bodies, accounted for 86 per cent of the working days lost in the public sector for that period.  I should point out straight away that none of these nine organisations was an employment where conciliation and <Col N="838" /> arbitration schemes applied.  This is not surprising when one considers the maturity and widespread acceptance of the various schemes of conciliation and arbitration.  The conciliation and arbitration system is noticeably different from the Labour Court system in that it has followed strict formality in agreements and meticulous attention to detail. The conciliation and arbitration system has strongly contributed to the non-strike culture in those areas of the public sector where the schemes apply and strike statistics accurately reflect what I have just said.</P>
      <P>The teachers, as Senator Mullooly has pointed out, have followed the agreed procedures for their conciliation and arbitration scheme meticulously.  They rightly expect the Government to do likewise. In the light of the order and stability that the conciliation and arbitration system has brought to industrial relations in those areas of the public sector to which the schemes apply, the Government should exercise great caution in their handling of the ongoing teachers dispute.  This dispute has been badly handled by the Government.  It has put the agreed procedures of the conciliation and arbitration scheme at risk and it has created widespread uncertainty among teachers who do not know where they stand in relation to the recent arbitrator's award.  Government inaction has damaged goodwill among teachers who, after all, are professional people who have no desire to be on strike.  Indeed, the absence of industrial action by teachers over many years proves the point that these professional people wish to continue their essential work uninterrupted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the fact that there are financial constraints on the Exchequer.  The reality is that public servants generally have fallen seriously behind on the pay front.  This reduction in real living standards has occurred at a time when taxation levels are running at record levels. Despite the excessive demands placed on public servants, including teachers, the Government have not achieved even one of their fiscal targets.  Belt tightening at a time of financial stringency has its place <Col N="839" /> but the teachers and, indeed the public at large, are entitled to get some tangible results from the pay restrictions of recent years and the penal levels of taxation they have had to endure.  These results have not been achieved by the Government so that teachers, having followed meticulously the conciliation and arbitration scheme to the letter, now want action on the arbitrator's award by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment says that &ldquo;steps are being taken to convene a meeting of the Teachers' Conciliation Council to discuss the 25th round of pay increases and other pay-related matters.&rdquo;  Let us look however at how the Government have handled the 25th round referred to in the amendment.  The first teachers' one-day strike took place on 15 October. Up to the previous Friday, 11 October, the public service as a whole was led to believe by the Government that there would be a total pay freeze after the expiry date of the 24th round.  The Department of the Public Service had instructed the management side in the public service, including management in the commercial State-sponsored bodies, that they could not open negotiations on the 25th round.  This obviously led to uncertainly in both management and trade unions in the public service.</P>
    <P>I am aware from my professional work of the sheer frustration felt by the management side in some of the State-sponsored bodies following this suspension, in effect, of free collective bargaining.  Here we had a situation where professional union and management negotiators who have in many cases developed trust and personal relationships in the industrial relations field over the years, were effectively told by the Department of the Public Service.  &ldquo;You cannot negotiate.&rdquo; In effect, the Government suspended free collective bargaining.  Then on the Friday before the teachers' one-day strike, on 11 October, the Minister for the Public Service convened a meeting with a view to opening negotiations on the 25th round, thereby suggesting that he was dissolving the freeze in one stroke. <Col N="840" /> His action was, of course, too late in the day.  His action was mistimed.  The union negotiators were not mandated to negotiate in the context put forward by the Minister.</P>
    <P>My net point is that the Government do not have a pay strategy.  Their approach, which says &ldquo;Now you have a pay freeze, now you do not&rdquo; is damaging in a number of respects.  It creates uncertainty among negotiators in the public service, management and trade union negotiators alike, so that they cannot plan or conduct their business with any confidence. More seriously, it can damage the fabric of industrial relations and this is in nobody's interest.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for the Department of the Public Service to formulate a realitic pay strategy which will be backed by the Government, so that the professional negotiators on both sides in the public service and indeed the many thousands of public service employees, including teachers, will know where they stand.  The &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; strategy of the Government undermines the credibility of the Government and merely invites more cynicism towards the establishment and towards politicians generally.  At the end of the day, this political posturing by the Government on the pay front can only undermine their own credibility and ultimately undermine democracy, and this means bad news all round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that, in keeping with the Government's adherence to the agreed provisions of the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers, steps are being taken to convene a meeting of the Teachers' Conciliation Council to discuss the 25th round of pay increases and other pay-related matters.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We note that, in keeping to the Government's adherence to the agreed provisions of the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for teachers, steps are <Col N="841" /> being taken to convene a meeting of the teachers Conciliation Council to discuss the 25th round of pay increases and other pay-related matters.  Contrary to the hopes and expectations of Senator Mullooly, I, as a former teacher, will stick with this amendment and I hope in the course of what I am saying to show the House that that is the right course of action.</P>
    <P>In everything that has been said so far in the debate &mdash; and, indeed, I have listened very carefully &mdash; one would think that relations between the Minister and the teachers had never been good, that no progress had been made on the education front and that in fact the whole area of relationships between Minister, Department and teachers was one of complete and total disaster.  Of course, there may be a temporary difficulty and I feel sure that is all it is.</P>
    <P>It is very important to consider the context in which we are speaking.  I propose in the course of my contribution to this debate to sketch in the context very clearly and firmly and ensure that it is on the record of this House.  We have in the Department of Education and, indeed, with us here tonight &mdash; an energetic and thinking Minister who has done more for the standard and stature of education in this country than any other Minister for years.  This fact is not one of political propaganda which I trot out in the course of this debate.  It is a fact which has been commented on by teachers themselves, by their organisations, by leader writers and by all people who have an interest in education, including parents and, indeed students themselves.  It is very important that we are fair and honest in our discussions in relation to this issue; and the backdrop against which this difficulty is arising is an important one that should certainly be considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister has always asked teachers to enter into dialogue with her.  She has always asked teachers for realism.  This she has done while making speeches and, indeed, in the media on radio and television. Of course, she has to look at the wider implications to the taxpayer because she is part of a Government <Col N="842" /> which is charged with responsibility for ensuring that the taxpayers get value for their money and that the economy is kept on an even keel.  That is not a particularly palatable task to have to do at a time when there are scarce resources and, indeed, competing wants.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that since 1982 there have been enormous and significant advances in education.  Those very advances, which so many people have praised, have only been made because there has been tremendous cooperation between the Ministers, management of schools and, indeed, teachers. This Minister has been the first Minister ever to attend all the teachers' union conferences.  She has done that not just one year but three years in a row, which must surely underline her commitment to teachers, her willingness to listen to them debate in their own fora and to take to heart what they are saying.  She has established dialogue, good relations, and, indeed, consultation with teachers through their various professional bodies.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we should remember that the Ages for Learning document has been published and that 2,000 extra teachers are to be employed as the extra year is phased in.  This has been welcomed by every interest, including all the teachers and their unions.</P>
    <P>Another important and very significant development has been the establishment of the Curriculum and Examinations Board.  There is tremendous work being done by this body with representations of all interests.  It is a big breakthrough for education and it has been awaited for a long time.  Another document just published &mdash; a discussion document &mdash; which has caused interest throughout the country has been the Green Paper Partners. It is a first class document and it is an invitation to participate in dialogue.  It is not, as has perhaps, been represented by some quarters, a diktat from the Department. It is, again, a consultative process and one which invites comment and dialogue from teachers and interested bodies to the Minister.  It has the capacity and <Col N="843" /> the capability for change and development and growth, which is something we all want to see on our education system. I say this by way of an indication of the dialogue, energy and enthusiasm with which this Minister in particular has approached her brief and the recognition that has been hers because of this very attitude.</P>
    <P>It is also important to stress that there is already under way important curriculum development and reform.  For example, this year for the first time ever something which many people have clamoured for a long time is finally about to happen in that this June there will be orals in modern languages in the schools certificate examinations.  Again, this has only come about because of the very good co-operation which the Minister has had from teachers and school management and in co-operation with the Department.</P>
    <P>It is also important to recognise that the context of this debate is one of enormous financial constraint.  There are major difficulties facing the Exchequer. While I listened intently to the comments of Senators Mullooly and Hillery, I must say in all honesty that they did not exactly address the issue.  They bemoaned the situation as is.  They were lyrical in their appreciation of the problem and the difficulties experienced by teachers.</P>

      <P>I feel very strongly that the preceding speakers, who proposed and seconded the motion, did not concretely <Col N="844" /> say how this award is to be paid. I know that it is not their function, although they might wish that it was their function.  Nevertheless, they failed to grasp the kernel of the issue.  That is the responsibility that rests with Government. These are the practical difficulties which Government are against in relation to this claim.</P>
      <P>The difficulties being faced by the Exchequer are clear.  Public spending increased by 40 per cent between 1977 and 1981.  Teachers got 28 per cent in 1980 and they got the general round every year.  This special award under consideration at the moment would be on top of the general round.  It is a time for consideration about moderation.  It is only natural, correct and proper that the Government should be cautious and considerate about the country's financial position. It is important that it should do so and I would fail to have faith in a Government that did not approach the taxpayers' hard earned money with that very proper and correct attitude.</P>
      <P>Now, to turn directly to the report of the teachers arbitration board on the claim for a special pay increase, it was received by the Minister for Education and the Minister for the Public Service on 5 November 1985.  It was presented by the Ministers to the Dáil and the Seanad on 5 December last.  The chairman of the arbitration board in his finding recommended an increase of 10 per cent in the salary and allowance of teachers, such increase to take effect as to 50 per cent thereof from 1 September 1985 and as to the balance from 1 March 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know now, because the figure is probably etched on our minds, that the annual cost of meeting such an award and implementing it is estimated at around £60 million.  We know that under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers the Government are required to adopt one of the following courses in relation to the arbitration report: within three months of the date of receipt of the report by the Ministers, that is 5 February, they must signify that they, the Government, propose to give immediate effect to the findings in full; <Col N="845" /> or, at the expiration of three months from the date of receipt of the report by the Ministers, or, if Dáil Éireann is not then sitting, on the first day of the next sitting, introduce a motion in the Dáil: (1) proposing rejection of the findings; or (2) proposing modification of the findings; or (3) proposing deferment of a final decision until the budget for the next following financial year is being framed and indicating to what extent, if any, they propose in the interval, without prejudice to the final decision, to give effect to the findings.</P>
    <P>In response to a parliamentary question by Deputy Mary O'Rourke on the 28 November asking if the Minister for Education would agree to meet the teachers unions, the Minister replied: &ldquo;I have not received any formal request from the teachers unions for talks.&rdquo;  That is a fact. No formal request had been received, though heavy propaganda was made out of the fact that the Minister had in some way refused to meet the teachers.  In fact, no request had been made and it is important that that should be very firmly on the record of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will come to that. The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>However, machinery exists in the Teachers' Conciliation Council for discussions on teachers' claims and I am perfectly willing to arrange to have officials meet the unions in the Council and I would hope that it would be possible to reach agreement on a package, which would include the 25th round of pay increases and other pay related matters, due account being taken of the financial constraints on the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>That, I would like to comment, was a very responsible factual reply to the question that was asked.  The reply went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 28 November an invitation was issued to the unions to a meeting of the Conciliation Council for Teachers for <Col N="846" /> the purpose indicated in the Minister's reply to the Parliamentary Question, the meeting was to be held at any time convenient to unions.  Following correspondence with the unions, a meeting of the Conciliation Council is now being arranged for Monday, 16 December.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;which indeed will be a fateful day, I would think.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the campaign of strikes which we have all witnessed over the last months.  I must say that it is always regrettable when a group of workers, any group of workers, particularly people in sensitive areas such as education, resort to industrial action.  As a teacher myself, I know that this action was not embarked on lightly.  But what concerns me, and I know concerns a great many people in the general public, is that in this case the teachers embarked on their campaign of strikes long before the normal industrial relations procedures had been exhausted, until the Government had taken their decision on the arbitrator's report.  Strike action while claims are in normal procedures can never be condoned and for that very reason the series of strikes which we have seen countrywide, culminating in the major one in Dublin on the 5 December, are a regrettable feature of this present difficulty.  I would refer to paragraph 7 of the Teachers Conciliation and Arbitration scheme, which provides that:</P>
    <P>...no formal public agitation shall be sponsored or resorted to by any of the parties to the scheme in furtherance of its case nor shall any of the parties move any outside body to make representations on its behalf.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it could be said that the teachers' campaign of industrial action, and indeed the parliamentary lobbying that accompanied it, were in breach of this provision which I have just read out to you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested <Col N="847" /> to hear Senators, when their turns come, comment on that point.</P>
      <P>The national plan, which.  I would remind Senators, was passed in this House not so very long ago &mdash; it was published over a year ago now &mdash; clearly stated that:</P>
      <P>...it was not possible to provide for any further special increases over the period of the plan.</P>
      <P>The policy applies to all claims for special increases across the board of the public service, with the exception of certain claims which were committed before publication of the plan.  It does not discriminate against teachers or any other group of public servants.  I would remind Senators that the plan was published.  It was debated in this House.  It was adopted by this House and indeed by the other place and the implications of the pay policy in the document should not have come as any surprise for any group of public servants with an outstanding claim for a special pay increase, because that policy affected them all.</P>
      <P>In all, there are some 60 arbitration findings or Labour Court recommendations affecting over 52,000 civil servants, teachers, local authority and health board staff, which have been processed since the publication of the plan and which are now debarred by the plan policy on special increases.  The full year cost of implementing these awards or findings would be almost £70 million.  There are also many other claims in the pipeline and the cost of implementing known findings, that is £70 million a year, in addition to settling other claims, including 25th rounds claims, must be examined in the cold light of economic realities.  I would be very interested to hear contributors to the motion talk about the cold light of economic realities in addition to talking about conciliation and arbitration and the integrity of it, which I contend the Government have not breached in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the famous morality <Col N="848" /> speech of the Minister, I think that has been taken entirely out of context.  Perhaps people in this country do not understand when one talks about morality in the area of pay, pay restraint and moderation. The Minister was not making any specific reference to the teachers.  She was talking in general terms.  We should all, if we are responsible citizens of this State, talk in general terms about pay restraint, about moderation and about morality in this area as in all other areas of life.  It is important to remember &mdash; and again back to economic realities &mdash; that the Government can only spend what it raises by taxation or borrowing. Everybody, including the proposers of this motion, agree that taxation is too high and that there are arguments against further increases in real rates of taxation.</P>
    <P>I would conclude by reiterating my support for the amendment to the motion and I look forward to hearing the remainder of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding the amendment, I want, first of all, to say that I would not disagree with Senator Mullooly in his presentation of the proposal itself, in respect of most of what he said. I would disagree with one aspect of it, and it is that he presumes in his comments that the Government in some way have not honoured their commitment.  I want to spell out exactly from the Labour Party's point of view our attitude to this problem.  I want to thank Senator Mullooly for reminding me of the Labour Party's stand on these issues, because our stand is well known, not alone on this issue but on many other issues, even when a Fianna Fáil Government postponed the public service pay increase for six months without discussion or negotiation. Our point of view was well known at that time, and that is not the political point.  The reality is that our party have been absolutely clear on where they want to go, and we are part of the setting up of this whole machinery for conciliation and arbitration.  In the first line of the Opposition motion we are asked to reassert our commitment.  In the first line of the amendment, the Government &mdash;<Col N="849" /> and the Labour Party &mdash; are availing of the opportunity to confirm our adherence to the agreed provisions of the scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  The Government are availing of the opportunity of confirming that they have taken steps to have discussions with the teachers conciliation council regarding the 25th round of pay increases, which is not an issue in this, and also to discuss other pay-related matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Mullooly stated that the only reason for discussions arising out of a finding from the arbitrator was to discuss its implementation.  That is true.  It is not the issue of what the arbitrator found; it is the implications of how the Government are to meet the finding.  There is and there never has been any suggestion from the Government that this award would not be honoured.  Discussions should take place on how the award would be implemented so that it could be honoured.</P>
      <P>I would be the first to accept in this House that the teachers have taken their present stance because individual Ministers have from time to time since last August made various statements.  This has been representation or misrepresentation, depending on your point of view. The Government have made no statement to date that they are not honouring this award.  Individual Ministers have given opinions that it could not be paid or that it should not be paid.  They are entitled to their opinions.  While the Labour Party are part of the Government it is what the Government say that concerns me as a Labour Party Senator when all the discussions and deliberations have taken place.  The cause of some of the upheaval that has taken place in the education system is probably the individual statements made, whether they have been represented correctly or misrepresented, as to whether there is morality involved in the teachers claim of otherwise. I will not deal with this question as it has already been dealt with and will be dealt with next week also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The controversy on public service pay arose from the statement issued by the <Col N="850" /> Government on 14 August.  The Government reiterated in that statement what was in the national plan regarding income developments and said the basis which determine conditions of pay and employment should be free collective bargaining. There is no deterioration in this, as the Labour Party have always fought for it.  The Government will continue to lay down certain parameters in regard to their responsibility as a Government. These must take into account the public interest, particularly in regard to employment requirements.</P>
    <P>The Government statement of 14 August has been misrepresented as a pay freeze.  The statement reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The National Plan provided that the Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill should not exceed £2,400 m. in 1985 and £2,525 m. in 1986.  Subsequent to the publication of the Plan the Government decided to implement the arbitrator's finding on the Civil Service 24th Round claim as widely as possible throughout the Public Service.  The revised 1985 Estimates provide for an Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill of £2.464 m. which exceeds the target in the plan.  Even without any further pay increases, the carryover cost of the 24th Round in 1986 and the cost of additional increments and committed special increases would lead to a significant increase in the public service pay bill in 1986.  In these circumstances, the Government conclude</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I emphasise the word &ldquo;conclude&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that, apart from existing commitments under the National Plan, there should be no pay increases in the Public Service for at least 12 months from the expiry date of the 24th Round.</P>
    <P>The Government used one very important word &mdash;&ldquo;should&rdquo;.  They said that the ideal position &ldquo;should&rdquo; be that there would be no pay increases.  The ideal is one thing: the Government have a responsibility to the Exchequer.  The reality is that there is not budgetary provision for special increases they will not <Col N="851" /> be taken into account afterwards.  The ideal would be that there should be no increases.  It is now clear that the Government accept that there should be some level of pay increase in the public service for the 25th round, which effectively means for 1986.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Public Service stated in October that he was prepared to make an offer on the 25th round and re-appoint the public service arbitrator provided that the unions were prepared to enter into discussions on the various methods of pay determination and on special increases.  If anybody wants a special pay increase, surely the sensible thing to do is to have discussions with the person who has to pay them as to how they will be paid and when they will be paid &mdash; not if they will be paid, assuming from the first line of the Government amendment, of which I am a signatory, that we are adhering to the agreed principles of conciliation and arbitration for teachers as well as everybody else.</P>
    <P>As regards the Government re-asserting their commitment to the agreed procedure for teachers, it should be crystal clear to all of us that the Government were not officially in receipt of the arbitrator's award in respect of teachers until the first week in November.  This means that the Government have until the first week in February to decide how they will deal with it.  As a trade unionist, I object to teachers unions' lobbying outside interests, including members of local authorities, to influence the situation, which basically is a trade union negotiating matter which has gone through conciliation and arbitration.  It is now with the Government, who have not said yet that they are going to pay it and are asserting here now that they are agreeing with the normal principles.  If we agree that the Government have until February 1986 to make up their mind, a lot of unnecessary disruptive action has taken place in the meantime.  I can understand why this happened: it was because of statements from certain people.  Those statements were either represented or <Col N="852" /> misrepresented &mdash; whichever way you like.  This is the reality of the situation.  I accept this.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion is a standing invitation by the Government to the public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to enter into discussions on any aspect of pay increases which have implications for the special award &mdash; not that it is being negotiated but as to how it will be implemented. In the private sector any firm would be disputing ability or inability to pay.  The Government are now in the situation that without budgetary provision I suppose they could say they are not in a position to pay, considering that this award alone will cost £60 million.  This can only be found by increasing taxation which the trade unions do not want&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The three areas of funding are not very palatable to any of us especially in a tough budgetary situation. Nevertheless, it should be possible to reach an agreement in discussions that would satisfy the Government, who have a responsibility to all of us, including the teachers, and the unions involved, who have a responsibility to the teachers and the taxpayers, for whom all of us must have consideration.  Surely the resulting formula must arrive at a reasonable 25th round increase for all public servants together with an agreed phasing in of all special increases, not just for teachers.  I remind our colleagues on the other side of the House that there are many other special pay increases in the public sector area and it is not just confined to teachers. The public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions should take up this offer and invitation from the Government immediately and enter into discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> The teachers are a special group of people; all our children are in their care and we are anxious that they would be dealt with properly and expeditiously. Under the public service conciliation and arbitration scheme we have the school inspectors' claim which has been settled in the sum of £74,000.  To pay the 40,000 teachers' claim at the end of this year would cost in the region of £10 million and £56 million for next year.  The agricultural inspectors have been awarded an increase amounting to 26 per cent. Senator Mullooly and myself are both members of the general council and are aware that as soon as that is conceded all the people in ACOT ambience including the agricultural instructors, will also have a parity claim then.  The engineering section, grade one and related grades, have a claim.  Also, the findings for the assistant principal and principal officers in the Civil Service could cost £2.4 million and the rates investigation officers of Dublin Corporation are in the same category, all having gone through this tedious machinery which the Labour Party were at pains to set up.</P>
    <P>None of us on this side of the House and certainly not the Labour Party, are questioning the actual results of that arbitration system.  We are questioning how they can be implemented and how awards can be paid.  We are asking the beneficiaries to come and meet the Ministers involved while the subject matter is being discussed by the Cabinet as a whole.  The Labour Party is part of this Cabinet.  It is imperative that everybody should know where the Labour Party stand in this particular issue.  We will fight for the principles of conciliation and arbitration.  We will also fight for the principle that the findings are final and should be accepted by both sides.  How they can be met is a matter that is the responsibility of the Government.  All of us who support the Government must keep a watching brief on how we are going to do this and what implications it will have for all other sectors of the community.  In that way we can reach a settlement of this problem, which none of us welcomed, which none of us wanted in the first place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> This is a word of warning to Ministers who make individual statements.  It is improper to give statements unless it is a Cabinet decision and then all of us have to live with it.  We may influence it in advance or live with it when it is made. The whole Cabinet should not be held responsible for individual Ministers' comments on how or where or when the Government can meet a particular award that comes through a procedure and machinery that the Labour Party particularly has defended all its political life. Our political life is longer than that of any other political party in this country especially with the trade union movement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChristyKirwan" hpid="Mr. Kirwan Mr. Kirwan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirwan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be brief.  The motion which is before the House has the signatures of some 18 Senators from the left side of the House and I hope that that was a geographic aberration rather than a manifestation of ideology.  Nevertheless, it is clear and distinct, it is explicit and it is definite in its terms.  It expresses a viewpoint without dubiety in that it calls on the Government to reassert its commitment to the conciliation and arbitration mechanisms and the conciliation and arbitration scheme which was set up to determine industrial relations matters in the service to which it is appropriate. I am not going to give the background to it because the historical resumé was more than adequately given by the mover of the motion but I want to stress for the benefit of everybody in this House that the conciliation and arbitration scheme was introduced into the industrial relations set-up by a Government which had a very substantial Labour element within it.  It was clearly recognised &mdash; and I do not profess to be an expert on it; I am learning every day &mdash; and anybody who knows anything at all about industrial relations will know that conciliation means exactly what Webster's dictionary would define it as, the two parties sitting down to draw the two ends to the middle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anything else was needed it could be described as a conciliation and mediation scheme but arbitration similarly means exactly what the dictionary says it should <Col N="855" /> mean.  It means that a referee steps in between the combatants, listens to the arguments from both sides and then determines the issue on the basis of a value judgment.  This was in the minds of the creators of this scheme.  Quite clearly any such scheme would be useless without the provision of an arbitrator or arbitration mechanism.  That is the key to the problem, because without an arbitrator there is absolutely no pressure on the employer to come to terms with the problem; without an arbitrator no moral pressure or judicial pressure or quasi-judicial pressure can be brought to bear to teach him what the actual situation is and he can be as obdurate as hell and decide not to do business with anybody.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind, because I am conversant with the policy of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and I have had consultations with the general secretaries of the three trade unions catering for the teaching profession, and they are quite sure that the Government are clearly in breach of the conciliation and arbitration procedures.  This in its own way is representative and symptomatic of the pressure which has been developing inexorably over the past two or three years in regard to the trade union movement generally.  It has been said that when the United Kingdom develops a cold we immediately contract pheumonia. Perhaps that is the fate of a small island off another island off the mainland but nevertheless there are all sorts of developments in the field of industrial relations which have as their genesis a recognition of the insecurity and fear that exists in most employments, not only of teachers.  This fear and this insecurity are being used to bring about settlements that would not normally be agreed in an open and free collective bargaining environment.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the refusal to recognise the set procedures with the conciliation and arbitration scheme represents one of these attempts to crush the only defensive mechanism that workers have in western democracies.  If that is a fact let me disabuse those who are practising <Col N="856" /> this philosophy because even though we may grow wealthy from time to time the trade union movement is like the phoenix; you can destroy it or seemingly destroy it but it will rise from the ashes. To decide that you can kill trade unionism is tantamount to saying that you can kill nationalism.  The answer is clear and apparent.  We have for example again a parallel with the teachers, the developing situation in CIE where the employment of a latter-day McGregor has produced a situation which is clearly in conflict &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChristyKirwan" hpid="Mr. Kirwan Mr. Kirwan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirwan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, it is symptomatic of the general malaise.  It warrants repetition.  The Government after all are the supreme body to set an example and if it can be seen that the Government can lightly disregard its obligations under agreed procedure then it is a simple and an easy matter for the ordinary employer to do likewise and point to the Government as the paragon of virtue in this regard to validate and sustain its actions.  The teachers' position is quite clear.  ICTU's position is quite clear.  If an arbitration award was made it was made on the basis of both parties freely going to the arbitrator and asking the arbitrator to exercise his judgment on the merits of the particular cases put to him.  In this instance he did just that and the teachers and the trade union movement take the view that once that arbitrator has issued his award, then there is an obligation on the Government to honour that award.</P>
      <P>I wish to talk briefly on the amendment. I am at a loss as to the purpose and the objective of the amendment.  It appears to me &mdash; and I do not wish to be unduly harsh &mdash; to be something that is primarily designed to obscure one's vision.  It is the use of the English language to produce something which appears to be correct but nevertheless meanders its way like a river into a dry hole and disappears, because I have not been able to make sense of the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard I would like to ask a few <Col N="857" /> specific questions and seek a few specific assurances.  The amendment to the resolution reads: &ldquo;notes that in keeping with the Government's adherence to the agreed provisions of the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for teachers&rdquo;.  i take that sentence and I add to it the statement made by my colleague, Senator Ferris, who said that the Labour Party, and indeed the Government, are wedded to the principals of conciliation and arbitration and to the obligation on both sides to accept and honour recommendations so made.  I would like to have an assurance that, in effect, this amendment means what is says &mdash; that, in effect, the Government are prepared, once they are direct participants, in the machinery, to accept the recommendations, whether they are to their advantage or not.  It is not enough at this stage to argue the overall perilous economic situation.  The Government knew that when they were going into this situation. That was part and parcel of the argument which was put before the arbitrator.  That was known in advance by both sides.  But, notwithstanding that prior knowledge, the arbitrator, in his wisdom or otherwise, decided that a certain level of increase was warranted in this instance. I would like an assurance from the Government that they accept that they participated in the machinery of their own volition and are wedded to the sacred concept of acceptance of independently rendered judgments on pay issues that go before them.</P>
    <P>The economy is another matter.  That will have to be tackled in another way.  It cannot be tackled on the backs of the teachers.  It cannot be tackled on the backs of public service workers.  It cannot be tackled on the backs of busmen.  It cannot be tackled on the backs of the labour force generally.  If there is machinery instituted to deal with industrial relations, then let it be used.  Our busmen are being told at this moment that there is a Labour Court recommendation which says that they should operate one-man buses.  I am now saying to the Government that there is an arbitrator's award <Col N="858" /> which demands that they recognise that the teachers are entitled to the increase in salaries recommended.  I would like that assurance from the Government side before I sit down.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is a dangerous element to this affair which demands that it be brought to a speedy and mutually acceptable conclusion.  There is the danger that the painfully built up process of dealing with industrial relations problems, the painfully contrived mechanism to enable both parties to come to an independent tribunal, an independent arbitrator, an independent agency, is now at risk.  The party putting it at risk is the Government in not honouring the mechanism which they helped to establish in respect of the teachers.</P>

      <P>I speak in support of this motion.  It is evident to me that there is utter frustration in the teaching profession at present.  It is more apparent in my own constituency than anywhere else. It is a fact that the teachers enjoyed industrial peace for nearly 40 years.  It is something of which they are very proud, even though in that period of time their profession has changed considerably. Ironically the 40 years of peace to which I refer was found after a long and bitter dispute over teachers salaries in 1946, a strike that lasted for seven months.  When I walked across the courtyard of Leinster House last Thursday I asked myself whether history is going to repeat itself in 1986.  I am not a member of the teaching profession but I am convinced that teachers are now united as never before, and it is thanks to the Minister for Education and the Minister for the Public Service. The teachers are the biggest single trade union group within the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, with over 40,000 members at present.  Arising from that dispute in 1946, which I referred to, the then <Col N="859" /> Coalition Government in 1948, through its Minister for Education, Mr. Mulcahy, announced that the Government had accepted the principle of a conciliation and arbitration scheme for determining teachers salaries.  The Minister of the time, Mr. Mulcahy, took the view that the bitterness of 1946 should not be allowed to repeat itself and that teachers' salary claims should be resolved in an orderly and fair manner and that teachers should be allowed to teach the children without the disruption of prolonged and unnecessary salary disputes.</P>
      <P>The first claim under the new scheme was made by the INTO in 1951.  The scheme was amended, I understand, in 1973 to establish a common conciliation and arbitration scheme for all primary and post-primary teachers.</P>

      <P>The item you have kindly ruled as in order to raise on the Adjournment raises a very fundamental issue.  It is a matter which I think has caused a great deal of public disquiet. Indeed, the wording I used to place it before this House was:</P>
      <P>In view of the public disquiet following media reports of the guidelines circulated to members of the Catholic Managers Association the need for the Minister for Education to confirm that these guidelines which restrict appointments to practising Roman Catholics are not the ones which will prevail in the making of appointments as National Teachers and that professional qualifications and competence as a potential teacher will be the criteria that the Department of Education will require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said I believed the matter is of the most serious import.  I was in Belfast when I read <i>The Irish Times</i> report of Tuesday, 19 November.  Before the ink <Col N="860" /> was dry on the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, page one of <i>The Irish Times</i> contained the headline &ldquo;National Schools to employ only practising Catholics&rdquo;. That report, credited to Christina Murphy, was a matter that had been raised previously by the education correspondent of the <i>Irish Independent</i> Mr. John Walsh, and it referred to guidelines that had been circulated and interviews that had been given by the secretary of the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association, which they said represented a clarification in policy, a clarification of the existing situation.  They quote Rev. Gerard Walsh, on page one of <i>The Irish Times</i> of that day, as saying.  &ldquo;It has always been the policy of the schools to hire only practising Catholics&rdquo;; and later: &ldquo;As a result, I issued a series of about 50 criteria to the boards which they might consider including.  It was obvious that the requirement to be a practising Catholic should be one of them.&rdquo;  These criteria had been issued after what I believe was an admirable development from the Minister for Education, for which I congratulate her.  She had been discussing for some time, in her Department &mdash; and I as a member of the Women's Rights Committee had participated in discussions &mdash; the elimination of sexism in interviewing techniques.  The request for clarification drew forth a printed document, which of course we would have welcomed had it dealt with sexism, but it dealt with a number of other guidelines. I have asked this question and I want to put it absolutely clearly.  I have absolute respect for the right of any organisation or association in Ireland to hold views but my question to the Minister and the questions that will ensue from it are not the ones that were put to her in the other House.  I am not asking her specifically to comment on the 51 items one of which is: Are you a practising Catholic?  or &ldquo;Are you committed to handing on the faith?&rdquo; I am asking the Minister for Education to give an assurance to the public that the criteria for the appointment, the promotion, the reappointment of a teacher will be based on professional qualifications, experience and competence as a <Col N="861" /> teacher and those criteria only, and that the criteria which may be in the possession of any other interviewer present will not be used to frustrate what would be sound, adequate criteria for the hiring of somebody to teach in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I felt aghast when I read the report because here we had been, on the one hand, invited into a pluralist conception, I believe, in which the two islands might grow together, which when people spoke of the undoing of the prejudices and fears which communities in Northern Ireland held towards each other, people spoke about the effects of separate education and about the two sides of the community being educated abroad and then this document appears.  I have found myself not being moved by the more humorous aspects on which some commentators have commented and they are indeed curious.  What does the phrase &ldquo;practising Catholic&rdquo; mean?  Maybe the Minister would feel impelled to give us a definition, although probably she will decide not to.  Is it to be determined rather like the social welfare contributions, a governing number of contributions in a year?  Is it to be so many Mass attendances? Is it to be so many evening devotions with combinations of broken service on Sundays or whatever?  There are, to my mind, as somebody who studied the sociology of religion 20 years ago, some incredible lengths to which you could bring such a notion.  Is it to deal with inner spirituality, for example, or outward expressed religious fervour?  Can you beat the hell out of your wife at home, practice like mad and become an excellent teacher?  What does all this mean?  One could go on and ask other things which are raised because the guidelines are supposed to be a clarification and apply only to new applicants.  There is an excellent letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 11 December on page 11.  The author of the letter is Des Derwin from Comyn Place in Drumcondra.  He makes a point concerning the redundant teacher.  If the numbers go down and you become redundant and you need a new job as a teacher do you discover the faith again to get your new job only to lapse again when <Col N="862" /> the numbers go up and then rediscover yourself again when the numbers go down and so on?  One could go on and bring all of these points to the limit of absurdity.  I do not want to be offensive in that regard.  I respect people who believe in their religion; I respect people who believe in religions of several different kinds and I respect people who have a moral and spiritual view of the world that is not locked into either of the competing denominations I have described.</P>
    <P>Des Derwin's letter contains the phrase &ldquo;Catholic teachers&rdquo;.  It quotes how the Catholic and Protestant school managers came together and they decided how necessary it was to defend the denominational ethos of their schools.  This is referred to explicitly in <i>The Irish Times</i> report of November 19. It states that Father Walsh, the secretary of the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association said: &ldquo;that the national school system was a denominational one and that the managers of both the Catholic and Protestant national schools at a meeting last year had agreed that it was of vital importance that the religious ethos of their schools should be maintained&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to raise a question that arises fundamentally on the Constitution and direct some questions for answer by the Minister.  How does she purport to balance the rights of an individual under the Irish Constitution to be treated with justice and fairness &mdash; and I am relying on the Supreme Court's more recent practice of interpreting the Constitution as a total document; how is she going to balance that right against these practices should they prevail and which would probably be justified under Article 42 of the Constitution.  I will put it another way.  Does the fact that the rights of parents as they are reflected in Article 42 of the Constitution in particular &mdash; and in John White's book <i>Church and State in Modern Ireland</i> which, on page 52 in a comment on Article 42, says:</P>
    <P>Article 42, on Education, succinctly summarises Catholic teaching on the prior rights of the parents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> It then quotes Article 42.1 of the Constitution:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the primary national educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable rights and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children.</P>
    <P>Later on in John White's book when somebody had drawn a comparison between the mother and child controversy and education, the now distinguished Bishop James Kavanagh, then Father James Kavanagh, wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 April 1951:</P>
    <P>Dr. Browne says in his memorandum that the State, in his health scheme, is providing facilities for parents just as the State provides facilities for primary education.  A little reflection will help us to see that there is little parity between the two.  In primary education the State rightly assists parents, but it does not control education. It gives grants, and very generous grants, towards the building of schools; it provides the money for the payment of teachers, but the ownership of the schools is not vested in the State.  So anxious has been the Irish State always in regard to parental responsibility in the domain of education that it does not give the full cost of the erection of a school &mdash; the people have contributed throughout the various parishes of the land some portion of the cost, so that they know the schools are not State schools but theirs.</P>
    <P>Now I as a parent with four children attending what I believed were State funded primary schools find them referred to by different people by different names.  Officials in the Minister's Department following in continuity from the times of the British legislation in honesty sometimes call them national schools.  Those under the control of the Catholic School Managers' Association <Col N="864" /> are called Catholic schools, Church of Ireland schools are sometimes called parochial schools and sometimes other kinds of named schools.  Nobody uses the phrase &lsquo;State primary schools&rsquo; even though they are funded by the State.  The salaries are being funded by the State and many people who believe in a pluralist conception in this island want to get beyond denominational faction fighting and want their children to be reared in a pluralist way.</P>
    <P>I have a proposition to put to the Minister for which I require an answer because many of my constituents have asked me to seek it.  It is this.  Can she explain to me how, if I take Article 42 which creates a certain kind of parental right in education, parents managed to transfer that right to a body who can exercise it in their name?  What was the mechanism by which the Catholic School Managers' Association acquired the right to speak for the Catholic parents of this country? Was there some national consultation that I did not hear of or are you to tell me that internally an organisation can set up mechanisms of minimal consultation and then purport to exercise the constitutional rights of the parents in the Constitution? Can I say that I am going out tonight to look for a Bahai and then come in tomorrow morning and say: &ldquo;I now represent the community of Bahai parents in this country and I want school education facilities for them&rdquo;.  What were the procedures and how is that right exercised and if I followed on Father Kavanagh that I quoted &mdash; and I believe he was interesting in many ways &mdash; is there no change now between the feelings of parents in the 1950s and parents in the 1980s?  If citizens all over Ireland begin organising themselves and say they want pluralist education North and South, and suppose we had organisations &mdash; and I hope they spring up in every parish &mdash; called citizens and parents for a pluralist education, people who believe in the importance of the transcendent character of spirituality and who want religion to be studied in a cross-cultural comparative perspective, if they write to the Minister will she then write back and say: &ldquo;I am <Col N="865" /> sending the inspectors down to decide on a site for your school?  What are your numbers?  How many teachers will you want?  What about the text book provision, the heating allowances?&rdquo; But perhaps the letter might come back: &ldquo;Provision exists for the needs in your area&rdquo;.  But then I come back to my question: &ldquo;I used to drive my children to what I thought was the State primary school but I have been told now it is in fact a Catholic school and that the teachers who will teach there may be asked questions as to whether they are practising Catholics and whether in fact they are committed to handing on the faith&rdquo;.  You cannot have it both ways.  You either have pluralist single stream education at primary level or you have State education and you have denominational education.  I see, with a great deal of heaviness in my heart, all this ugly stuff appearing in the papers. The papers are correct to print it, but the manner in which people are locking themselves into their denominations bodes no good for the future.</P>
    <P>Is there no protection in the Constitution for pluralism or for people who want pluralist education?  I know that what will be quoted back at me is that any child can be removed from a school, educated at home, and so on.  I am not interested in the freedom to remove your child from a closed denominational setting. I am interested in the State's responsibilities, laid down in the article, to make provision &mdash; I am not talking about setting up those of us who believe in pluralism as deviants &mdash; for us in relation to the spending on education.  Therefore, the old case that the State makes provision and therefore the control can be exercised elsewhere simply will not do.  Do you, for example, make provision for people who hold this conception or do you keep excepting them from the system?</P>
    <P>The next point I would like to make is in relation to the relative weight to be given to different groups.  At present parents are excluded comprehensively from education.  I know that at the Minister's heart is in the idea of parental involvement, and I compliment her for <Col N="866" /> that, but I must say there are not adequate mechanisms for asking the views of parents on education in this country.  Let us suppose that in the future a situation developed North and South, in which parents decided that they wanted a particular form of education, is it acceptable in 1985 for us to take the Constitution in its thirties version and to say that you can manage all the new changes you want for your child through the denominational sections of the Constitution, for this is a denominational Constitution? How can you then go up to Belfast and sit down with that kind of an interpretation on education?</P>
    <P>It is not Unionist children or Unionist parents who find all of this objectionable and offensive.  I am a parent who has four children attending primary school.  One school has a manager who is a member of the Church of Ireland, the other school is managed by an order of people who are within the Catholic denomination.  I have three children there.  The one thing I know about looking at it all is that I would wish there was a school system in which people who believed in Islam and people who believed in Christianity and people who believed in the Jewish religion and people who believed in a form of spirituality that was not located or people who believed in nothing but being human towards each other could meet in the school setting.  I take objection to this and I certainly want the people upon whom my taxes are spent in paying their salaries not to be asked sectarian, ugly, narrow questions.  How will it ever be judged, to end where I nearly began, about the practising Catholic?</P>

      <P>I suppose it will be like the old days of the GAA and the vigilante committees who went to the soccer matches and did not watch the scores but watched the GAA members in case they were present and enjoying the soccer match.  Who will watch the teachers?  I must say, as someone who <Col N="867" /> founded a trade union section among university teachers, I am amazed at the silence in all of this.  Those of us who are trained to teach deserve the right to protect our dignity, to relate to the emerging child, male and female and to relate to the parents.  I am sick to death of this idea that the great ugly State is waiting to move in to take the rights off parents.</P>
      <P>The organisation which has spoken in my name without any right is the Catholic School Managers' Association.  It does not ask those questions in the name of Catholic parents in this country.  Where is their mandate?  It is they who have abused the Constitution and done so disgracefully &mdash; anybody who comes before them and submits themselves to this process of questioning.  It is far more than the division of this country we are talking about.  It is about the abuse of the interview relationship.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we can manage in reason to deal with it all.  Let us have, if we want to, Catholic schools in this country and Church of Ireland schools, but I am asking the Minister now to begin to ask the Minister for Finance to make provision for those of us who want to follow the Taoiseach's crusade, who want to implement the Anglo-Irish Agreement, who have said we will not be divided by denominations, who want to live in a pluralistic way, and those of us too who are republicans who want to believe in rights.  There will be people who will attend the new schools who will want to go up the road to the Catholic school for some preparations and others who will want to go carol signing with the Church of Ireland.  Off they go, but let us have the right as parents in Article 42 of the Constitution to be involved in the education of our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot have it every way.  The Minister cannot say to me that there is justification for denominational education under Articles 42 and 44 of the Constitution.  My answer to the Minister is yes, but there is the protection of the individual in the Constitution and the <Col N="868" /> protection of the individual teacher in this case in not having to answer questions. Let us take a case.  A teacher, worthy in every other respect, superior, impresses the board and chooses not to lie and says: &ldquo;I believe I was a Roman Catholic for a long time and I am beginning to think perhaps my faith is changing&rdquo;. That person, for example, is not appointed.  What are the rights of that person?  Are they totally gone in relation to Articles 42 and 44?  If that is the case we have reached a black day in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is also the technical questions in relation to how the parents' rights are exercised and the assumption that they can be exercised indirectly.  Remember, there has been case law in all of this which argued, in the case of one decision, that the State could not intervene to provide education more than the minimum that the parent could provide.  What we are asking for is a minimum.  Those of us who want non-denominational education are asking the Minister to exercise the Constitution on our behalf to provide us with a pluralistic concept of education.  She can do it two ways: establish a new stream of education to answer our rights under the Constitution, or she can knock this whole question of there being a group of people who have a right &mdash; close to being to divine right, as they would see it &mdash; to exercise and control education on our behalf.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seek the opinion of the Attorney General on this rather than to wait for case law.  In the meantime let us hope that there will be no casualties and let us hope, too, that all the people involved in education will discover their tongues and their courage and speak out. I can assure you that I am not the only parent who feels offended by what we have read.  I am not the only person who was looking forward to a time when both sides of this island could relate to each other, when we could begin to transform ourselves and to have it all suspended.  It is not just a matter of reading something in <i>The Irish Times</i> in November and imagining it will blow away.  What we were looking at was the lid of our coffin. <Col N="869" /> I demand the right as a citizen of this country to have my children reared without these constraining bigotries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is important at the outset of this debate to establish the precise facts of the matter to which the Senator refers. This can only be done by reference to the nature of the national school system and to my responsibilities as Minister for Education in respect of that system.  The majority of schools of this country, as the Senator well knows, are set up on a denominational basis.  On this basis there are schools which are conducted by the authorities of the various denominations, that is, Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Methodist and Jewish.  There are in existence multidenominational schools and special schools conducted by lay patrons and management boards.  All of these schools are in receipt of State aid on the condition that they are conducted in accordance with the Rules for National Schools.  The system of national schools is then a State-aided as distinct from a State-owned and administered system, a distinction which derives from Article 42 of the Constitution of Ireland which states that &ldquo;the State shall provide for free Primary Education&rdquo;. The significance of &ldquo;providing for&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;providing&rdquo; has been upheld in the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The preface to the published Rules for National Schools sets out the rights and duties of citizens of the State in the matter of education as contained in Articles 42, and 44 of the Constitution of Ireland.  I believe that in order to view the motion in context it is necessary for us to have regard to these articles.</P>
      <P>The preface goes on to say that in pursuance of the provisions of these Articles the State provides for free primary education for children in national schools and gives explicit recognition to the denominational character of these schools.</P>
      <P>The explicit recognition is also a reflection of the historical evolution of the national school system and of the actual organisation of national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> As the Roman Catholic religion is the predominant religion of the majority of pupils and their parents in this country, it follows that the preponderance of national schools are conducted under the patronage and management of the Roman Catholic Church.</P>
    <P>The explicit recognition accorded to the denomination character of the schools is further reinforced in the rules themselves.  Rule 2 for example states that:</P>
    <P>These Rules do not discriminate between schools under the management of different religious denominations nor may they be construed so as to affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a national school without attending religious instruction at that school.</P>
    <P>and Rule 3 which states that:</P>
    <P>State aid for the establishment of a new national school may be granted on application by the representatives of a religious denomination where the number of pupils of that denomination in a particular area is sufficient to warrant the establishment and continuance of such schools.</P>
    <P>In dealing with applications for the establishment of national schools my Department is scrupulous in ensuring that representatives of all denominations and school promoting bodies which are not denominationally affiliated are treated on similar terms and their applications assessed in accordance with the criteria laid down in the rules.</P>
    <P>The close affiliation of the national school system with the religious upbringing and formation of the pupils and again the denominational character of the system is further reflected in the Rules for National Schools:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rule 68.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Of all the parts of a school curriculum Religious Instruction is by far the most important, as its subject-matter, God's honour and service, includes the proper use of all man's faculties, and affords the most powerful inducements <Col N="871" /> to their proper use.  Religious Instruction is, therefore, a fundamental part of the school course, and a religious spirit should inform and vivify the whole work of the school.  The teacher should constantly inculcate the practice of charity, justice, truth, purity, patience, temperance, obedience to lawful authority, and all the other moral virtues.  In this way he will fulfil the primary duty of an educator, the moulding to perfect form of his pupils' character, habituating them to observe, in their relations with God and with their neighbour, the laws which God, both directly through the dictates of natural reason and through Revelation, and indirectly through the ordinance of lawful authority, imposes on mankind.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rule 69.</i>
    </P>
    <P>(2) (a) No pupil shall receive, or be present at, any religious instruction of which his parents or guardian disapproves.</P>
    <P>(b) The periods of formal religious instruction shall be fixed so as to facilitate the withdrawal of pupils to whom paragraph (a) of this section applies.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where such religious instruction as their parents or guardians approve is not provided in the school for any section of the pupils, such pupils must, should their parents or guardians so desire, be allowed to absent themselves from school, at reasonable times, for the purpose of receiving that instruction elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Senator will therefore appreciate that the system of national education envisages the schools and the teachers giving religious as well as secular instruction.</P>
    <P>I come then to the matter of the rules governing the appointment of teachers and to the procedures envisaged in these rules.  The Rules for National Schools, Chapter IX and amending circular cover the qualifications for the appointment of principal, vice-principal and assistant <Col N="872" /> teachers in national schools.  These rules deal solely with the academic and professional qualifications of teachers and with specific requirements of experience attaching to the principal and vice-principal posts.  It is a condition of all whole time appointments in national schools that the teachers must be qualified in accordance with the rules and my Department will not approve appointments for the purposes of the payment of salary unless these rules are observed.  The Senator may, therefore, rest assured that my function as Minister in setting down minimum standards, is exercised to the full in respect of the appointment of teachers.</P>
    <P>The procedure for the appointment of teachers and the means of selecting qualified candidates for appointment to posts in National Schools is, of course, an entirely different matter.  Following consultations with the patrons, boards of management were established in national schools in 1975, to replace individual managers in the carrying out of the functions vested in local management. Among these functions is the appointment of teachers.  I would point out to the Senators that parents on boards of managements and parent representatives are members of the Catholic Primary Managers' Association.  There are two parents elected from the school to every board.  There is a parents' association in almost every school.  So there is a very definite and laid out role for parents in these functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already stated teachers are neither appointed by nor contracted to my Department but rather to the management of the national school at local level.  This has been the practice since the inception of the national school system.  When the boards of management were established in 1975 their procedures were set down in a document, &ldquo;Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure&rdquo;. This was a document agreed <Col N="873" /> in discussion with representatives of the patrons and the teachers.  In accordance with the procedures set out in this document, selection boards of stated composition are set up to select applicants for teaching posts and to propose suitable candidates to the boards of management for appointment.  The &ldquo;Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedure&rdquo; come up for review recently and following discussion amendments were agreed between the parties which would ensure that there would be no discrimination against candidates on grounds of sex or marital status and that boards would have due regard to the provisions of the Employment Equality Act (1977) and the Code of Practice of the Employment Equality Agency (1983).  This and certain other procedural matters include a requirement for selection boards to:</P>
      <P>establish criteria for the assessment of applications, having regard to the Rules for National Schools and the requirements of the particular post and decide upon the applicants to be called to interview.</P>
      <P>Records of the criteria of assessment of applications and of the interviews shall be kept by the Chairperson of the Selection Board.</P>
      <P>The requirement was agreed by all parties as a necessary inclusion to ensure, <i>inter alia</i>, that boards of management would be properly equipped to deal with court cases under the Employment Equality Act.  My Department was not involved in the setting out of criteria of assessment, which were at all stages considered to be a matter appropriate to the employing authority that is the boards of management of the individual schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the guidelines to which the Senator refers, which were issued by the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association for the guidance of its own members.  The association in question is a voluntary association but one which is recognised by my Department as representing the interests of management of schools which are under Roman Catholic patronage.  There are similar recognised <Col N="874" /> representative management associations in respect of other denominations.  Following the change which was agreed in &ldquo;the Constitution of Boards and Rules of Procedures&rdquo;, the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association in its bulletin &ldquo;Solas&rdquo; of February last set out to explain in detail to its members the import of the new selection procedures and this included a set of memoranda which in the opinion of CPSMA would be helpful to its members in meeting the requirements of the revised regulations. Included in these memoranda were suggested criteria for the assessment of applications for posts as principal and as assistant teacher in schools which were affiliated to the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association.  These criteria dealt extensively with personal and professional qualities which might be looked for in applicants to ensure that they could properly fulfil the duties of the posts. Among the personal qualities listed in the case of a principal teacher was that of &ldquo;being exemplary in carrying out religious duties&rdquo; and in the case of an assistant teacher that of being &ldquo;a practising Catholic&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I return now to the Rules for National Schools and I must emphasise that my Department exercises no function in respect of selection as between qualified candidates nor do the rules lay down religious qualifications <i>per se</i> for teachers.</P>
      <P>It is only in the case of appointments from the panel of redundant teachers that my Department can insist on the appointment of a particular teacher to a particular post and even then the rules in recognition of the denominational character of schools provide for the right of management to refuse to accept a particular person on grounds of faith or morals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the circumstances as outlined by me, I would repeat that <Col N="875" /> the criteria for the assessment of applicants for posts in national schools, as long as they have due regard to the Rules for National Schools are a matter for the management authorities of these schools. I do not consider it in any way surprising or unusual that these authorities which conduct schools on a denominational basis, for children who themselves and their parents are members of the particular denomination and where the teaching of religion and the formation of young people within a particular religious tenet is an integral part of the teaching function in the schools, should seek teachers who are capable of performing this function.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>If this requires the teachers to be members of that particular denomination, this is a judgment in the matter of religion in which I would claim neither authority nor competence.  I wish to state however, that parents generally, whatever their denomination, are concerned about the religious and moral upbringing of their children and the contribution which is made to this during <Col N="876" /> their formal education.  The arrangements under the Rules for National Schools have served the parents of all denominations well in this regard.  In particular they provide the guarantees to minorities as well as majorities, which are considered necessary to the continuance of their faith and their way of life. The system, as I have explained, is sufficiently flexible to cater also for multidenominational schools and for special schools.</P>
      <P>I have given a full answer to the Seanad and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on this matter.  I believe that the public disquiet to which the Senator has referred earlier arises from the focus on a particular criterion without due regard to the context of the situation, the Constitution, the Rules for National Schools and the full communication issued to its members by the Catholic Primary School Managers' Association.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 December 1985.</P>
