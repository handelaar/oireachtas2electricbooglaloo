      <P>On the Order of Business, when is it intended to take the second report of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies on Irish Shipping Limited?  It is essential that this matter come before the House as soon as possible.  The liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited was a major event in the history of this country and it has had serious repercussions not alone here but abroad.  A number of so-called commercial reasons were put forward by the Government when they suggested that this company should be put into liquidation, but now it appears that the liquidation will cost a lot more than would have kept this company going over the next number of years.</P>

      <P>This is a normal provision in recent Bills in relation to the date when the Act will come into operation. Would the Minister of State indicate the Government's intention in this regard?  We have had examples of legislation which has been passed by both Houses and then many months, sometimes even a year, elapsed before the Act was brought into operation by order.  It would be helpful to the House if we had some idea of the Government's intention in this regard.</P>

      <P>There is no <Col N="335" /> difference in the Government's intention for this and other legislation.  It is possible that the Senator is referring to the Dentists Act, where the Minister made an order to bring a necessary part of the Act into operation.  The remainder of the Dentists Act will come into operation next month.  I presume a portion of this Bill will not be different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1) (d) (ix), line 31, before &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;trainee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to facilitate many of the student nurses.  The Minister has gone out of his way to facilitate nurses in that out of 27 members on the board there is a total of 17 nurses.  The Bill is providing for the registration, control and education of nurses.  In the various universities the boards of management on the governing bodies have representatives from student unions and it would be a very fine gesture if the Minister could have a student nurse on this board.  This is something I feel quite strongly about. It was suggested also on the Dentist's Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Fallon pointed out, the effect of the amendment would be to provide that the Minister of the day would appoint a student nurse instead of a nurse to the board.  I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.  The reason is that the nature of the board's role and their functions do not lend themselves to the <Col N="336" /> appointment of a student nurse as such. During the Second Stage debate here I said that I would welcome and very positively favour student representation on the boards of hospitals.  These boards manage the services which the students play a major part in providing.  However, the national Nursing Board, An Bord Altranais, are not involved in any way in the formal management of nursing services. Their purpose is the registration of nurses after they have qualified, generally deciding on examination procedures, the educational curricula and the control by way of the fitness to practise procedures of the profession.</P>
      <P>To enable the board to fulfil that distinct role, the members of the board should, in the first instance, be persons who have qualified as nurses who have basic experience both in the teaching area &mdash; as teachers they would be involved in the drawing up of curricula &mdash; and in the setting of examinations.  They would also have to have experience in the clinical area in order to do basic examination work and basic fitness to practice assessment. Of course, they would have to have experience in the administrative area, for example, as chief nursing officers, matrons and so on.  On that basis, I would not consider it appropriate that there should be formal student-nurse representation.</P>
      <P>I have authority, under the Bill, to appoint one nominee of the Minister.  I am of the view that the nominee should, as far as possible, be a nurse and not a student nurse.  As the House knows the extent of ministerial nomination is extremely limited because it is overwhelmingly an elected panel of persons from each of the areas of the profession. It is on that basis that we will have the appointments made.  If I may draw the analogy, it is rather like having students on the boards of universities.  On the examination authorities they are not formally represented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 9 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately because I had to move the adjournment of the debate I was unable to deliver the remainder of my Second Stage speech, but the Minister seems to be of the opinion that I was going to take him to pieces in my speech.  That was not my intention.</P>
      <P>We are now on Committee Stage. Under section 9 of the Bill nurses working in special hospitals are banned from election to An Bord Altranais, that is, orthopaedic, cancer, geriatric etc.  Also, paediatric hospital nurses have only one opportunity to be elected &mdash; under 9 (1) (a) &mdash; and they feel that they should have been included in (b) and (c).  The Minister gave an assurance to the INO that he would nominate one nurse adviser.  The nurses feel quite strongly about section 9 (1).  They feel that the same provision should be in 9 (b) and 9 (c).</P>
      <P>Regarding the composition of the Board, in his opening address on Second Stage, the Minister talked about the flexibility and the power, by regulation, to vary the composition of the membership of An Bord Altranais.  That means that perhaps at a later stage the original composition could be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the general point that we have 29 members on the board and 17 of those will be elected nurses.  If we were to expand the board any further and bring in all the various specialities&mdash;quite a number of specialist areas have approached me about being included &mdash; the situation would become totally unworkable.  If I were to include further specialisation in the other areas, both the teaching area and the general <Col N="338" /> administrative area, we would never finish expanding the board.</P>
      <P>The provision in section 9 (3) is a standard one for this type of health legislation and it is an important element to include in relation to a board of this nature.  The purpose of section 9 (3) is to ensure that the composition of the board can be changed to reflect the nursing needs of the day in future years.  This new Bord Altranais will stand for quite a number of years but, undoubtedly, in the years ahead there will be further developments in medical and nursing education, in practices and in procedures.  The board will be the first to come back to the Minister for the day, to point out the need for change as it may arise in the composition of the board.  My only intention in section 9 (3), is to give power to amend the Act by regulation after consultation with the board.  That is the important issue.  It will not cause any great alarm.  I want to get this Bill as definitively decided as possible but the parliamentary draftsman advises that, rather than having a whole new Act, it is better to put in a regulatory provision in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of a replacement on the board, assuming somebody goes off to another job, or dies, or something like that, how will the vacancy on the board be filled?  Will it be the next highest person in the election? Is it the Minister's role, or is it the board's role?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In paragraph 6 of the Second Schedule there is a specific provision for the filling of casual vacancies. The casual vacancy is there.  It is a very clearcut procedure.  Section 6 (b) of the Second Schedule provides that whenever a casual vacancy occurs among members of the board appointed by election the board shall co-opt a person who is eligible for election to fill such a vacancy and any person so co-opted shall serve as a member of the board for the unexpired period of the term of office.  It is a standard procedure.  The Minister fills the vacancy following consultation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in relation to subsection (3) that he is empowered by regulation to vary the provisions of subsection (1) which constitutes the board and specifies the sections of the nursing profession and of society generally from which the members shall be drawn.  The Minister does not like to tie his hands behind his back, but I ask him with tongue in cheek if, in the line of Senator Fallon's amendment which has now been disposed of, he could give an undertaking to the effect that one of the two members, two persons representative of the interests of the general public, will represent the student interests on the board.  It seems that the board as constituted could end up as an elderly board constituted of experienced nursing politicians.  I do not mean that in a party sense but within the nursing, medical and paramedical professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could give the assurance because already the Minister's powers of appointment are extremely limited and he would be span-celling himself.  At the moment the Minister will be appointing very few people to the board.  I would be more disposed to giving an assurance that I will look at the composition of the elected board.  There may be specialities, for example in the paediatric or geriatric areas, where nobody would be elected, and then to bring a balance to the board one would try to fill in some area.  There may be, for example, major developments in cardiology and one might seek a nomination <Col N="340" /> in that regard.  Regarding the public representatives, I have given one broad assurance &mdash; because so many trade unions are directly involved in the nursing area &mdash; that I would consult with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to seek their views on who best would fill those vacancies, but that is as far as I would go at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me bring that a little further.  I know the willingness of Ministers to consult with interested bodies such as the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Let me ask the Minister in line with that thinking to consult also with the bodies who represent the trainee student interests. That is one interest which should be represented on the board.  I appreciate and applaud the Minister's openness in saying he will consult the unions' interests but that should also be done in relation to the students.  If you do not do that and if you ignore the possibility of student representation on this board then you are going to end up with a well heeled, articulate middle aged board who will not represent the broadest possible nursing interest.  The Minister's past statements in relation to many issues have suggested that he would favour broad representation on a body such as this board and I ask him to give the same undertaking in relation to student interests as he has in relation to labour interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings us back to the problem of the Bill.  I have had great difficulty in explaining this issue to student nurses, of whom there are 6,500 in the country, that it would be inappropriate for them to be members of An Bord Altranais.  For example, if an issue arose in relation to fitness to practise and a registered nurse was to be taken off the register because of very serious complaint, it would be inappropriate that a trainee student nurse should be a member of the fitness to practise committee of the profession, and he or she if a member of the board would automatically become a member of the fitness to practise committee. There is no preclusion as such and there could not be.  Therefore, he or she <Col N="341" /> would adjudicate in a legal statutory manner on the fitness to practise of a registered nurse.</P>
      <P>Equally a trainee nurse could be elected to the board, serve a full term of office on the board, never pass his or her examinations or qualify as a registered nurse and still be a member of An Bord Altranais.  The outcry from the nursing profession in those circumstances would be, to say the least, very considerable.  I do not have pressures from the student nurses for formal representation on An Bord Altranais.  Any approaches on that line have been marginally exploratory in terms of an explanation of what it is all about.  Consultation with the particular interest would be a question of consulting with the trade unions concerned.  They are affiliated to the ICTU and they come back to me on that basis.  It would be inappropriate that student trainee nurses should be on An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 10 to 12, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (3), lines 35 and 36, after &ldquo;section&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;, other than the Committee referred to in subsection (2) of this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put down these amendments, taking the second one first, to tidy up the overall section.  Reading through the Bill as it stands one does not really know what the fitness to practise committee is until one reaches Part V of the Bill.  There is a broad definition in section 2 but that simply leads one to section 5.  Section 13, which has a direct relevance to the fitness to practise committee, should include amendment No. 3 which I am putting before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the fitness to practise committee should have within it somebody who is not a member of the nursing <Col N="342" /> board, who is not a nurse.  The idea of lay participation should be within it.  It is interesting at this time that we are debating the issue of a Garda complaints procedure and disciplinary procedures within the Law Society, the body who control solicitors.  Within the latter body there is an acceptance that there should be lay participation within their disciplinary procedures, and there is now an acceptance across the board political spectrum that there should be lay participation within the Garda disciplinary procedures. The same should apply in relation to the fitness to practise committee of the Nursing Board.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that there may be people on that committee who come within section 9 (1) (d) who might not be nurses, but there is no necessity, no obligation on either the board or the Minister to ensure that that is the case.  In the interests of the nursing profession and also of the public there should be a guaranteed right of lay participation on the fitness to practise committee.  When I say &ldquo;lay participation&rdquo; I mean responsible lay participation, in that very important committee.  If that is done you are protecting the nursing profession in that you are not leaving them open to the kind of abuse that may be levelled against them by an aggrieved member of the public who may say that members of the fitness to practise committee all come from within that board.  You do not want to have a vested interest in one sense or another.  It can be argued that the nursing board do not consist entirely of nurses, but generally the weight is in favour of nurses.  I move these amendments to ensure first that there is within that fitness to practise committee somebody who is not a member of the nursing board and who has not, as it were, an inside vested interest.  This is also protecting the public in that it gives the public an assurance that it is not all an internal nursing board procedure.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that one can appeal to the health board against decisions of the fitness to practise committee, but in the <Col N="343" /> initial stages there should be the kind of openess within that board that is desirable, and that is not there.  I ask the Minister either to accept my amendments in this regard or, if he considers the idea further, to bring in a ministerial amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's concern in proposing these two amendments.  I share his concern to ensure that the members of this very important statutory committee will be seen by the public to act in a totally unbiased manner in carrying out their functions under the Act.  However, there are adequate safeguards from a public point of view which are of quite different composition from those of the Incorporated Law Society, for example, who have been alluded to and I share the Senator's views there.</P>
      <P>However, section 13 (6) provides that: &ldquo; . . . at least one-third of the members of that committee shall be persons other than persons who have been appointed by election to the Board.&rdquo;  Therefore, we have one-third.  There is no guarantee that they will come forward from the one-third, but among the 12 appointed members will be two representatives of the interests of the general public, together with at least seven other persons who will not be nurses.  For example, four of these will be neither doctors not nurses.  On that basis these four will come from the areas of health board management, from the management of the voluntary hospitals sector, from the Department of Health and from the Department of Education as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These board members are eligible to serve on the fitness to practise committee. If they never got on to the fitness to practise committee they would still have a very strong opportunity to influence the decisions on how the board should act and report back to the fitness to practise committee.  Therefore, I am reluctant to provide specifically for a person who is not a board member to be included on the fitness to practise committee.  The reason for my reluctance is that I have a <Col N="344" /> difficult Bill to get through, already within the framework of the legislation relating to the medical profession, and one relating to the dental profession, which also is a very difficult enactment. I have not such an outside involvement in the fitness to practise committee and I am dubious, with no fewer than 12 non-nursing people on the board, about any great benefit or advantage to the public accruing from the amendments as proposed. These are my basic reasons, but I can indicate to Senator Durcan that in setting up the board I would prefer to request the board, not in a statutory way, to make quite sure that at least one of the public interest members appointed is put on the fitness to practise committee, and we could review the situation after that.  At present I regret that I am not disposed to accept the amendments as framed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that he has to get through a very difficult Bill and I compliment him on the way in which he is receiving our amendments here today.  The problem is that some of us, and I include myself in this, are extremely happy with the Minister's handling of the Department of Health, but there are people out there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously Senator Honan was not listening to me.  Some are not so gifted as others with appreciation of good administration.  We have no assurance that people like Senator Honan and others may not some day play a role in displacing the Minister and installing somebody else in whom we might not have the same confidence.  Whereas we can take ministerial assurances on this point, unfortunately our job here is to enact legislation which will guide the nursing profession through and give them a legal basis for the next half century, we hope.  Bearing that in mind, I take up the Minister's suggestion in relation to section 9 (1) (d) (x) that &ldquo;two shall be persons representative of the interest of the general public&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister <Col N="345" /> between now and Report Stage to consider an amendment for insertion in section 13 or in Part V of the Bill which will provide legislatively that one of these people will be on the fitness to practise committee.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point which he made by implication that this Bill in one sense parallels the Dentists Bill.  That is true, but we get experience as we go along, and our job should be to produce the best legislation possible, not necessarily an exact model of what was produced in these Houses even 12 months ago.  There is a need to have on the fitness to practise committee an element of independence, an element which can look in from the outside, as it were, and give the public an assurance that the complaints they are making are not being adjudicated purely from within.</P>
      <P>If I may draw an analogy, one of the complaints frequently made about the old Land Commissioners who adjudicated on the taking of land from farmers in the west was that the commissioners were in effect Land Commission officials. Frequently I heard legal colleagues saying of that old procedure that it was a little like going to law with the devil and the court being in hell.  The same could be said about a complaint to the Nursing Board; it is a little like going to law with the devil and the court being in hell.  Once again the people who will be dealing with a complaint are all members of the nursing board.  What the Minister said &mdash; very eloquently and I am not suggesting that he is trying to mislead the House &mdash; about the 12 people not necessarily being nurses is not true.  Of the 12 people appointed by him under section 9 (1) (d) the majority could very well be nurses.  &ldquo;One person representative of the management of health boards&rdquo; could be a nurse.  Even the two who represent the interests of the general public possibly could also be nurses.  It is not spelled into the Bill apart from the phrase &ldquo;qualified nurses&rdquo;.  It is not specifically exclusionary in that respect.</P>

    <P>I feel strongly on this point.  To protect the public and above all to protect the nursing profession, this Bill is intended <Col N="346" /> to provide for the nursing profession as such and to provide for the establishment of the Nursing Board for their registration, control and education.  The best protection the Minister can give them is to create a situation where no member of the public can ever say in relation to a complaint about nurses that it is being dealt with purely from the inside.  The best protection and the best guarantee we can give them against unfair complaint is to allow it to be said that on their fitness to practise committee there is a fair proportion of independence and something for somebody from outside the Nursing Board.</P>
    <P>I accept the point the Minister made but I ask him to look at this point very seriously between now and Report Stage. I make that point in the light that the nursing profession will increasingly come under pressure from the public in relation to allegations of negligence, allegations of misconduct and allegations of breach of professional practice.  These allegations will not necessarily have any sound basis, but the move by the public towards professional interest is increasingly one of complaint.  I am simply asking the Minister to protect the nursing profession against unfair complaint or, indeed, against unfair adjudication by the public of their fitness to practise procedure.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with Senator Durcan.  He seems to think that by the inclusion of a person from outside the nursing profession, that person because he or she may not be a nurse will look after all our problems on the fitness to practise committee.  I would have much more confidence in the composition of that committee and in the new members regardless of whether or not they were nurses.  With due respect to Senator Durcan, he thinks that by just putting one person who is not a nurse on the fitness to practise committee we will have a person who may think differently and look after all our needs, but the committee from day one will be doing that.  This is where I disagree with Senator Durcan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can partly understand his concern <Col N="347" /> that the person elected may not know anything about nursing but will stand back and see things in a different light just as in the case made a while ago for a student nurse on the board.  I would have much more confidence in the nurses who will be on this committee.  I see no need for this person who never participated in their world at all to protect our interests.  I totally agree with Senator Durcan on the importance of this legislation and the importance of this Bill, but I do not hold his views.  I am not just disagreeing with Senator Durcan on party lines.  I absolutely believe what I say.  I do not share the concern of Senator Durcan about having an outsider put on to the fitness to practise committee to ensure that the nurses do what is right for all of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow through the point Senator Honan made, I made my point because I am aware first, that in the public mind in relation to the Law Society &mdash; a body of which I am a professional member &mdash; there is a belief that their procedure in dealing with complaints is unfair because the committees who deal with them are entirely composed of members. Secondly, I am aware that under the current Garda Síochána disciplinary regulations when a member of the Garda is brought before a disciplinary board &mdash; I have defended a dozen or more of them in a professional capacity before their own disciplinary tribunals &mdash; there is always the belief on the part of the member who is charged that he is not getting fair play even within his own professional body and there is also a belief on the part of the public who may lodge a complaint against a garda that they will not get fair play or that the matter will not be adjudicated properly because the board who deal with the complaint are entirely an inside board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree with many of the points which Senator Honan made I put down this amendment by way of protection of the nursing profession.  I have discussed this with many nurses and their initial response is: &ldquo;No, we do not want outside <Col N="348" /> participation within our disciplinary procedure&rdquo; but when it is explained why they should have outside participation most nurses accept that it is for their own protection.</P>

      <P>I make the broad point that there will be 12 persons appointed after the Minister has consulted with such bodies or organisations as he considers suitable.  He will appoint 12 members other than the 17 elected nurses.  The only commitment among the 12 is that one of them shall be a nurse. That commitment was put in in a very specific way largely to assess the specialities that would not be elected or would fail to be elected onto An Bord Altranais. That was the main purpose I had in mind in relation to that section but if one considers the other 11, one must be a general medical consultant in a training hospital, one must be a consultant psychiatric doctor in an approved hospital for the training of psychiatric nurses and one must be a registered medical practitioner at consultant level so far as I am concerned in the obstetrics area.</P>
      <P>They are not nurses but no doubt they will become involved in fitness to practise issues which will arise, particularly in the light of their specialist knowledge.  One shall be a member representative of the management of health boards.  It is highly unlikely that I would be appointing a nurse in that area when we are talking about a large number of measures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be at that level generally and one should be representative of management of hospitals, other than hospitals administered by health boards.  There are a large number of board members of hospitals, secretary managers of hospitals and so on.  It is <Col N="349" /> unlikely that there would be nurses and so on down the field.  There is every prospect that of the 11 non-nursing personnel &mdash; it is not spelt out that they be non-nurses &mdash; out of the 29, a number will finish up on fitness to practise disciplinary committees.</P>
      <P>I share the Senator's concern about the situation in the Law Society.  The present Council of the Law Society are composed as we know entirely of solicitors and these solicitors are an entirely self-statutory disciplinary committee.  An analogy cannot be drawn with An Bord Altranais because, although the Law Society have expressed their willingness to have lay participation on the disciplinary committee, they have not accepted that there should be any lay participation on the council as such which is very different from An Board Altranais where there is substantial lay participation.  Indeed, the Restrictive Practices Commission have recommended the inclusion of lay people on the council and I understand that the Department of Justice are considering making appropriate provision in the amending legislation for the Solicitors Act so I think the Senator's wishes will be fulfilled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The practise area is a very defined area and I appreciate that undoubtedly in the years ahead there will be more litigation surrounding medical care &mdash; nursing practice, medical practice and dental practice.  There is bound to be more and more litigation. That is a growing phenomenon in all European countries, including Ireland. We have gone a long way in reforming An Bord Altranais to make sure that it is as broadly based as possible.  The fitness to practise provisions are adequately covered.  It is the public interest we are talking about.  It is a counter-balancing interest: the rights of nurses versus the rights of patients and the public generally. There will be at least nine non-nursing personnel on the board.  Regarding the third level educational establishment, <Col N="350" /> the third level appointee is not specifically spelt out in this but that person will probably be a nurse because there are some very senior nursing personnel involved in third level education and training establishments. A representative of that area could be a nurse.  Of the two representatives from the Department of Health one would be a nurse, I should think.  There will be nine others out of 29 who will not be nurses so far as I am concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an unfair construction. They do not necessarily have to be people who are not nurses.  It is possible that some of the nine could be nurses.

      <P>I can assure the Senator that when I would be contacting the various bodies I would be very reluctant and very unlikely in the light of 17 elected members and the definite likelihood of another three from the nursing profession &mdash; 20 out of 29 &mdash; to accept in my consultations with the health boards and the hospitals that the person representing the management of health boards should not be a nurse.  There is a large body of persons other than nurses who could be nominated.  The same goes for the management of hospitals.  If the name of a chief nursing officer is put before me by way of representation from those with whom I would consult I would be very ill-disposed to accepting that nomination. One would have enough with 20 out of 29 to keep a balance and the balance will be struck on that basis.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), line 15, after &ldquo;order,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after consultation with the Board,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section and this amendment are important.  If the members refuse to carry out their functions, this section provides that the Minister may by order direct the board to discharge the function and for that purpose to do such other matters or things ancillary or incidental thereto that may be specified in the order.  It would be far better if the Minister carried out this work after having consultations with the board and finding out what misdemeanours were present.  It would be a reflection on the board to leave this section as it is drafted.  It would be preferable if he accepts this amendment.  That would be a fair way of dealing with this question and it would be a way of providing confidence in the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read this amendment first I was disposed towards it but the point is frequently overlooked that the section deals with the functions assigned to the board under the Act.  This section has been unfairly construed by interests in the country who have suggested that the Minister might use power unfairly to deal with the Nursing Board. It is reasonable that the Minister should have power to remove the board from office if the board neglect, refuse or fail to perform the functions assigned to them under the Act.  It does not deal with anything else that the board have to do.  On the point being made by Senator Fallon I do not think any board should be removed from office by a Minister in the exercise of his statutory powers unless they are given an opportunity of exercising that which they have failed to do up <Col N="352" /> to that point in time.  An assurance should be given to the effect that before the powers under section 15 would be exercised the board would be given notice that unless they perform their statutory functions the Minister would exercise his powers under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can give that assurance but it would be very difficult to formally write the assurance into the Bill. The power given to the Minister of the day is entirely discretionary.  Where 17 members are elected and 12 appointed in addition, then where a board refuse to perform or neglect to perform any functions specifically assigned to them under the Act, the Minister of the day should have power to remove them from office. That is a reasonable provision.  It is highly unlikely that the Minister would indulge in such an action unless he took a number of steps.  He would be in constant communication with the board prior to any such thing developing.  To remove a board from office would require the Minister to bring the matter before the Government by way of a memorandum so that he would have the support of his Government colleagues.  Failure on the part of the board to perform functions assigned to them under the Act would be a matter of public notoriety long before they would be removed from office.  That would have hit the fan, so to speak, in a big way before the Minister by order would direct the board to discharge the function concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would need to be on very good ground because he would have to put the order before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He could hardly act in a capricious or malicious manner because every order under the section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and if a resolution annulling the order is passed within 21 sitting days, then it shall be annulled accordingly.  So there will be a full scale public debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas before a Minister would finally have got away with it, so to speak, if he wanted to act in a precipitous manner towards the board.  For these <Col N="353" /> reasons I am reluctant to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>It stems largely from the fact that nursing legislation has not been changed in the country for 35 years.  Then suddenly the profession and bodies associated with the profession do not realise that over the past 35 years our body of law has given the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Government and the Minister of the day certain basic statutory powers.  If you give this authority to a board, on the other hand, there must be circumstances where you take it away.  This has become a huge issue among people who had very little conception of legislation relating to the profession, very little awareness of the basic fundamentals of drafting a Bill and people wonder how can any Minister dare get rid of a board, that that is unthinkable.</P>
    <P>Of course, if you give functions to a board and if the board fail to discharge their functions the Houses of the Oireachtas must have power to take the board out of existence.  It is a logical sequence of statutory power.  Section 15, therefore, is framed in that way and there is the double barrelled safeguard in section 15 (5) that every Member of this House could spend a long time debating it if a Minister dared to act in a foolish manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose a situation did arise where the Minister would have to disband the board, would it not be much more advantageous from his point of view to be able to say to the Dáil at that time that he has had discussions and consultations with the board and if that is the case, would it not be as well to insert it in the Bill at this time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying because the inevitable outcome would be that if any Minister came before the Dáil and said that he had abolished An Bord Altranais and removed the members of the board from office, the first question he would have to answer would be what consultations he had had, what basic argument he had, if there had been exchanges of correspondence with the board, and all that would come out in <Col N="354" /> the wash.  Otherwise, no Minister would dare to do it.  For that reason it is necessary to have it inserted formally.  If a Minister failed to consult on this, he would be thrown out.

      <P>I would like to make a point on section 16 (3).  In the knowledge that the board and the nurses generally are going to fund the chief executive's salary, why then should there be an intrusion from time to time on the part of the Minister?  Does the Minister think that this is necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to envisage a situation arising, particularly where there are 29 people involved, where a board so fail, neglect or refuse.  It is difficult to imagine a situation where a board would become so obdurate that they would just refuse to carry out any function assigned to them under the Act. The functions of An Bord Altranais are very, very specific under the Act and it has to be one of those functions and no other function.  The board will have their own legal advisers.  They have power to <Col N="356" /> engage their own legal advisers.  They will be advising the board versus the Minister of the day as to whether they were acting in a totally obdurate manner towards the Minister of the day.  But then if he is satisfied, having consulted &mdash; as I would have to &mdash; with the law agent of the Department of Health, he would draw up an order formally directing the board to implement their functions under section X of the Act and on failure to carry out that order within 21 days then dissolve the board by making another order. The Minister would have to put both orders before the Houses of the Oireachtas. At that stage the Minister would want to be on very, very firm ground and the board would want to have been taken over by a unique blend of people before you would get 29 persons with that kind of total conflict, before the situation would deteriorate to that extent.  The section as framed is fair and reasonable.  It has a double indemnity, if I may use those words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that it would be unlikely that you would get 29 people on a board who would, after consultation with their law agent, make the kind of decisions which would necessitate the abolition of the board. Why then is it necessary to have, right through the Bill, this almost conditioning process of doubt, as it were, as to the capacity of the board to carry out their functions?  Would it not be better to allow them some greater freedom rather than have them hamstrung with these controls, which would appear to be very tight, having regard to the numbers that are on the board?  I agree with the Minister that it is extremely unlikely, with all the representative interests that are involved, that these situations would arise.  In other words, why is the Minister anticipating these difficulties in that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would argue, largely because of the very large number of people concerned, namely, the thousands of registered nurses and the impact they have on the health services and their work and the seriousness of the issues involved, <Col N="357" /> particularly fitness to practise with regard to education and training, that they are of such major importance that one has to have fairly tightly framed legislation similar to that of the medical and dental professions.  Questions of professional misconduct arise, very serious issues involving the livelihoods of persons, their public integrity and their professional competence.  For example, on one of the fitness to practise issues, alleged unfitness to practise such practice by reason of physical or mental disability, very major questions have to be decided.</P>
      <P>In that light it is essential that it be very finely balanced legislation and that the board have their powers, but that the Minister for Health of the day should equally have, in a balanced way, the opportunity of representing the public interest with the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Government of the day. There seems to be a general concern that the Minister would have too many powers under this section.  I would stress that section 15, in the light of 35 years of enactment of statutes through the Houses here, contains a standard provision.  This is the standard provision and it is not exclusive to this Bill of itself.  When I pointed out to a number of people that section 15 was simply a re-enactment of section 23 of the Nurses' Act, 1950, they were surprised, but we were going along perfectly happy for 35 years under this provision.  It goes without saying that, before any order would be made under section 15, any Minister for Health would have to consult with the board to get their views.  Indeed, it might be expected that the board would come to the Minister if they had reached such a stage of difficulty and said that they had an appalling problem, we would seek advice and guidance on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have excellent relations with An Bord Altranais and down through the years relationships have been extremely good. I know of no good reason at the moment why, with the new board being set up &mdash; and it is hoped to have the new board set up in the very immediate future &mdash; these <Col N="358" /> excellent relationships should not continue.</P>

      <P>A point was raised previously, perhaps by Senator Smith, regarding the unnecessary power, if you like, that the Minister has taken upon himself in this section not being wanted, in this section at least.  Certainly, I accept there has to be ministerial control on many occasions and in many Bills but I am wondering if it is necessary to have the consent of the Minister from time to time as outlined in section 17 (1).  To repeat myself, the use of ministerial power in this section is again unnecessary.</P>

      <P>The payments outlined in section 17 (3) have to have the approval of the Minister for Health.  I paid very close attention to the Dentists Bill when it went through this House and there we had to have the approval of the Minister for the Public Service also, if I recall. Perhaps the Minister would tell me if I am wrong.  Do we have to have the approval of two Ministers here?  We are going to need the approval of four Ministers in regard to the National Development Corporation.  Are we really talking about the approval of two Ministers in section 17, or is it only the approval of one Minister?  I support Senator Fallon on the power of the Minister, but I have to be careful about using those words.  Is there a Minister involved in the working of section 17 other than the Minister for Health?  If I recall correctly in a certain section of the Dentists Bill, the Minister for the Public Service as well as the Minister for Health was involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point Senator Fallon made in relation to subsection (4) of section 17 of this Bill.  It is unreasonable that the Minister should retain statutorily the power that he retains under subsection (4).  That is the power which provides that the board or the chief executive should not appoint certain officers or officials of the board if the Minister is not happy with them.  That is a very unreasonable power, bearing in mind that we are trying to establish an independent nursing board, with certain safeguards which I have been speaking about here all day, but not getting very far.  The most important safeguard of all is the safeguard conferred by section 15. That gives the Minister very substantial powers to remove the board if they fail, neglect or refuse to perform their statutory functions.  That should be sufficient control over the nursing board.  We are establishing an independent body to do an independent job and to do it in a professional manner on a proper statutory basis.  If they do not do the job, the Minister can, under section 15, order them to do it and if they neglect, refuse or fail he can then remove them from <Col N="360" /> office.  But to add in the additional power which is provided for in subsection (4) of section 17 is, to say the least, absolutely unreasonable.  It is unreasonable that the board should be subject to such ministerial control in relation to the appointment of a chief executive officer or, indeed, to the appointment of other officers or employees of the board.  It is a totally unreasonable power and it is something which I would ask the Minister to consider seriously between now and Report Stage.  If he can abide by what appear to be the wishes of three Members of this House, then I would ask him to consider introducing an amendment to delete subsection (4).  There may be good reasons for this subsection and I would like to hear the Minister on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister why he has this worry, as Minister for Health, that he has to take this kind of power?  Here &mdash; without being at all political &mdash; I would be as concerned about the Minister's successor or successors as himself.  Why is the Minister seeking this type of power?  Our only chance with this serious legislation, as Senator Durcan said, is to absolutely trust the new Bord Altranais from its inception. Section 15 affords a good deal of power to the Minister.  Therefore does the Minister really have to have this power over their heads?  There is very strong language in section 17 (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the chief reasons is to give basic protection, not just to the Minister of the day, but also to the chief executive officer, remembering that the chief executive officer is appointed by the board and shall hold office on such terms and conditions as laid down by the board with the consent of the Minister, as the board determines. We have known of many situations in which chief executive officers are in grievous conflict with the board of a particular body.  This can be an appalling problem &mdash; where civil war breaks out between a CEO and the board who have appointed him.  The prospects of arbitration or of influencing the course of events are nil <Col N="361" /> unless the Minister has authority.  This country has become a very introverted society where everybody watches their perennial rights in a very personalised way.  It is essential, if a Minister is to exercise or influence the course of events, that he should have authority to declare that any power conferred on the board by this section shall be exercisable with the consent of the Minister only or that, whenever such declaration is enforced, that it be given only with his consent.  He should have authority to do that.  It is as much a protective mechanism as the influencing of the role of a board.  It is a standard provision.  The powers are not that wide ranging.  In the Dáil I did amend subsection (5).  We have changed it quite considerably from the original head of the Bill, as envisaged, and the all-embracing power that it gave both to the Department of the Public Service and to the Minister.  It has been carefully amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also make a broad point here about An Bord Altranais.  There is no interference in the day to day operation of An Bord Altranais by the Department of Health.  We have a very close relationship. When a board is set up it is given authority to go ahead and do its job.  We have a very small Department, employing approximately 360 people, specialist public servants.  The section looking after the day to day operations of An Bord Altranais is a very small one.  That is why we devolve on the board as much power as possible.  But, in the heel of the hunt, if a bad row develops, there must be Ministerial statutory authority to become reinvolved.  There is a difficulty here in that we have not had amending legislation since 1950.  Therefore this provision is very much a standard statutory provision.  There is nothing exceptional about it.  I do not think that the current chief executive officer of An Bord Altranais would be unduly perturbed about it.  It also gives him protection.  He can appeal to the Minister of the day if he is in glorious conflict with his board. He has the opportunity of saying to the Minister &ldquo;Look, I must be protected&rdquo;&mdash; and the Minister, of course has the power <Col N="362" /> of intervention.  That is essential and is not draconian in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said.  He clarified the situation in relation to a problem which may exist within a board where a chief executive officer may get into difficulties with his board, when the board may want one thing and the chief executive officer may want another.  In relation to the appointment of officers or servants to the board under section 17, I can see that.  Am I right in saying that the power can go beyond that?  Can it also be used where a Minister or his officials, for any number of reasons which might not have anything to do with any differences of opinion as between a CEO and a board, may decide that a particular appointment is unwise? Am I not right in saying then that the Minister may then completely overrule the views of the board and of the chief executive officer, go ahead under subsection (4) and refuse to appoint, unless with his consent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, yes; there is still a residual authority devolved on the Minister.  I do not think we have reached a stage of bureaucracy here in which the Minister is going to finish up running An Bord Altranais.  After all, with 17 elected members and 12 additional members appointed, the board will do its day to day work.  It will present the Minister with an annual report and accounts, and liaise with the departmental staff on a regular administrative basis. But I can assure Senators that a Minister for Health and Social Welfare has more onerous ongoing policy obligations devolving on him every day without prying into the day to day operations of a particular board.  A Minister would need to become a total egomaniac if he were to try to take over the running of every board under the Department of Health.  There are so many of them that one loses track of them now and again. The provision is very much a matter of advice and guidance by the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A situation can arise in which a CEO <Col N="363" /> is at total loggerheads with the board.  On the other hand, the Department may be at loggerheads with the CEO and the board itself.  In those circumstances the Minister has to declare that the power will be exercisable only with the consent of the Minister.  That very difficult situation can develop.  For example, it could develop in terms of public service pay. Some boards might decide to pay a CEO a particular salary scale which would be unacceptable to the Minister because he would have the overall remit of consultation with the Minister for the Public Service about setting the conditions of pay, salary and expenses.  They may decide to do something quite unusual.  It is not unknown.  I see it happen every day of the week when these anomalies suddenly emerge.  I have very little hair on the top of my head but what little I have stands up when I see some of the decisions of some boards in that regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 12, to delete lines 41 to 50 and in page 13 to delete lines 1 to 8 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;20.&mdash;(1) Where a person who is either an officer or servant of the Board is&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  nominated as a member of <Col N="364" /> Seanad Éireann or as a candidate for election to Dáil Éireann or to the Assembly of the European Communities,</P>
    <P>(b)  elected as a member of Seanad Éireann, or</P>
    <P>(c)  regarded pursuant to section 15 (inserted by the European Assembly Elections, Act, 1984) of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977, as having been elected to the Assembly of the European Communities to fill a vacancy,</P>
    <P>he shall stand seconded from employment by the Board and shall not be paid by, or be entitled to receive from, the Board any remuneration or allowances&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in case he is nominated as a member of, or elected to Seanad Éireann or is so elected to the Assembly of the European Communities, in respect of the period commencing on such nomination or election to Seanad Éireann or such election to the Assembly of the European Communities, as the case may be, and ending when he ceases to be a member of Seanad Éireann or that Assembly,</P>
    <P>(ii)  in case he is nominated as a candidate for election to Dáil Éireann or to the Assembly of the European Communities, in respect of the period commencing on his nomination and ending when he ceases to be a member of Dáil Éireann or that Assembly, as the case may be, or fails to be elected or withdraws his candidature, as may be appropriate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to bring the Nurses Bill, 1984 into line in so far as this matter is concerned with the Dentists Act.  On reading through the Bill, as presented to the Dáil, and as subsequently passed by the Dáil after much debate, I was surprised to note that section 20 had not been amended and the parliamentary draftsman had, willy-nilly, <Col N="365" /> followed the wording of the section, which was originally inserted in the best of spirits, when it came before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Dentists Bill was initiated in this House.  Senator Dooge moved an amendment to that Bill principally for the purpose of removing the difficulty which persons who are nominated to the Seanad can encounter in relation to situations of this nature.</P>
    <P>I might quote from the Official Report of 27 June 1984, volume 104, column 532, where Senator Dooge stated:</P>
    <P>It is the view both of Ministers who have spoken here in the House and of Senators that this is a general matter and should be tackled by the amendment of the Seanad Electoral Acts.  It appears to me that a simple amendment of section 27 subsection (2) (c) of the Seanad Electoral Panel Members Act, 1947, would remove this matter from the debate of this House forever, rather than having it as something that recurs every two or three months.</P>
    <P>We have put forward this amendment because it is now the view of all groups in this House that the Seanad cannot continue merely to raise this matter and then receive assurances of Ministers and then have the matters sink back into neglect again.</P>
    <P>The matter is one that can arise when people, without their prior consent, are nominated to contest Seanad elections. Indeed, as Senator Dooge pointed out when moving the amendment to the Dentists Bill, the matter was highlighted in the case of Deputy Taylor-Quinn who found herself nominated by the Irish Dental Association, subsequently sought an Oireachtas nomination and found, following a decision of the judicial referee, that she was not able to withdraw from the outside body nomination.  In other words, somebody could be nominated, without their consent, and be caught in such a situation.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Dentists Bill the Minister in the course of his remarks contained in the Official Report, volume 104, column 535 had this to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> I can confirm that the matter has been raised and discussed in some detail at Government.  It was agreed on an informal basis at Government that the Minister for the Environment and the other appropriate Ministers should review the question of members of boards and officers and &mdash; if I may use the out-dated term &mdash; servants of boards, being barred on nomination for election to the Seanad even though the nomination is without their consent. Admittedly, the amendment now offered is relatively restrictive.  However, it is acceptable to me.  It is time that we created a precedent.</P>
    <P>Those were the Minister's words in this House when he agreed to an amendment proposing &mdash; to the Dentists Bill.  I would ask the Minister fo follow the precedent here today to which he referred in this House on 27 June 1984.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to examine the amendment.  I would ask for some time between now and Report Stage as to how best we might come to grips with this because we are referring to both members and staff involved.  I gather the purpose of the amendment is to protect the employment of an officer or servant of the board who is nominated as a candidate for election to Seanad Éireann.  It is correct to say, as the Senator has already pointed out, that there is the reality that the Dentists Act now has the force of the amendment proposed because I did accept that amendment in this House previously.  However, I should like to examine the exact text, as proposed by the Senator, and consult with him prior to Report Stage with a view to dealing with the matter.  I have a difficulty in that once again it would have to go back to the Dáil if amended here and we would have to find an opportunity in the Dáil to deal with the matter.  As the Senator is aware, this Bill has been with the Houses of the Oireachtas for approximately 17 to 18 months.  It was during the course of that period that the Dentists <Col N="367" /> Bill came up.  Finally, the Senator's concern is in general related to board members, not staff members of boards.  The Bord Altranais provision relates to staff only.  I should like to have a look at the matter between now and Report Stage and consult with the Senator in the interim.  I would be obliged also to consult with the Minister for the Public Service because it would mean amending the Bill as originally approved by Government and as approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says and on that basis I will withdraw the amendment on the understanding that I shall have an opportunity of putting down a similar amendment, or a satisfactory one proposed by the Minister, on Report Stage.  I do not want to use a word as harsh as &ldquo;resent&rdquo; but the fact that this Bill has to go back to the Dáil should not constitute an excuse.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas have equal standing constitutionally. The fact that the Dáil does not find defects in legislation, accepted previously by both Houses is no reason why something should not go back to the Dáil to be corrected.  I would be surprised if that was advanced as the reason this amendment would not be accepted.  I feel sure Senators on all sides of the House would share my view on that.</P>
      <P>I proposed the amendment for the purpose of making this legislation the best possible legislation to be produced by the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister was very open in accepting amendments to the Dentists Bill, when we had the best parliamentary debate I experienced in my 2½ years here.  I hope the Minister will be equally open in accepting this amendment to this Bill even though it necessitates the inconvenience of having to go back to the other House.</P>

The only matter which concerned me there was the consequential delay in the holding of elections to the new board <Col N="368" /> because we are moving towards the end of the year and it is a matter of trying to find an appropriate slot for electoral purposes.  This is the only reason.  I can assure the Senator there was no other intention in my mind.</P>

      <P>In page 14, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Whenever it may be found necessary by the board to increase a fee under this section such increase shall not exceed the percentage increase in nurses' salaries in the preceding year or years (as the case may be) to which the increase is made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Many nurses I have spoken to are concerned and have expressed the view that in a few years time they will be paying 20 per cent or more of their salary in fees to the Nursing Board.  This amendment is fair because it will ensure that there will be a control on any increase in the annual retention fee and that that percentage fee shall be as the amendment states.  It is a very fair and reasonable amendment.  It will ease the worries of many nurses and I ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the amendment and in relation to the section one of the comments made by many nurses who spoke to me about this Bill showed their apparent resentment at having to pay a fee for the various matters specified in this section.  I want to put on the record what I said to those nurses, namely, that it is reasonable that members of any profession should be charged a fee for the matters specified in this section so I do not agree with the points which many nurses have made.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment, I do not altogether agree that you can relate a registration increase strictly to the salaries of nurses because salaries of nurses, under certain circumstances, may differ. They are not all in the public sector. Some are employed outside the public sector and it would be very difficult to relate registration increases.</P>
      <P>I would be more concerned about the nature of the register that is maintained. The information I have suggests that there is in existence simply a register of all nurses who qualified, going back to the legislation of the early part of this century.  I do not know if that is correct but that is the impression I garnered from the nurses I have spoken to and from the many representations I have received in relation to this Bill.  In other words, the point has been made to me that there is no live register of practising nurses.  If that is the case then I ask the Minister, within the ambit of this Bill, by regulation of ministerial order, or in the exercise of one of the many powers which we are told by various people that he has under this Act, to regulate and to ensure that a live register is maintained of all nurses currently in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly I would like the Minister to ensure that the register is divided into the various types of nursing practices, in other words, that a nurse could deem herself to be registered under the heading of a public health nurse, a psychiatric nurse, or as a nurse in one of various other types of activity, when I say that the register should give a particular specification to a nurse as to her preferred type of practice or her operational type <Col N="370" /> of practice.  I do not think any additional fees should be charged in respect of an individual who would be on more than one nursing register.  There should be a particular categorisation for all nurses and there should be a live register.  If that is not done it will be extremely difficult to maintain control over the nursing profession and it will be very difficult for the public to maintain a check and balance in relation to the profession.  The existence of a live register is of paramount importance and I would like the Minister to assure the House that such a live register can be brought into existence at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody was too clear on this section when it was passed in the Dáil, with due respect to everybody there.  I understand there are many fees.  The nurses are not objecting to a fee but they are worried &mdash; and they have reason to be &mdash; that we might recommend a fee of £5 or £10 now and a fee per qualification plus an increase in the said fees per qualification so that nurses in a few years time &mdash; and the Minister has put much emphasis on the years ahead &mdash; could find themselves paying a registration fee of something colossal like £100.  It is hoped, whether it is paid annually or less frequently, that it could be kept to a realistic figure and to a percentage &mdash; not more than a percentage &mdash; of the increase in salaries of nurses during the previous year.</P>
      <P>At one stage section 25, where these fees are dealt with, was unacceptable.  The maintenance of the live register should be a function of the board and there should be sufficient moneys available from other fees to maintain the live register. The main worry, according to the nurses I have talked to, is about a fee per qualification.  They are not objecting to paying a fee.  They have good reason to be worried about the level of fees in the years ahead as a result of this legislation and as a result of recent charges in other places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of a registration fee where professions gain further <Col N="371" /> control in the management of their own affairs is not disputed.  It is quite a healthy development and obtains in a number of other professions.  However, I would like to make the point to the Minister that, as he well knows, as a result of the cutbacks in the health services a considerable number of part time nurses have lost their opportunity of employment.  Therefore, a number of people in the nursing profession do not have the opportunity to work.  Obviously they would want to remain registered in order to avail of employment opportunities that might arise.  Has the Minister given any consideration to having a somewhat easier regime for people who find themselves in those categories?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I support and endorse what was said by the two previous contributors, Senator Smith and Senator Honan. Nurses are not well paid.  Employment for nurses fluctuates and, as has been pointed out, many nurses are part time because of their commitment to the home.  It would be very wise to introduce an amendment stating that the fee should not be increased by more than the percentage increase in a nurse's salary.  Consideration should also be given to part time or unemployed nurses.  It might be tied up with some obligation in regard to refresher course activity at the point of re-entry or, in the case of the part time nurse, a certain obligation to participate in refresher courses every so often.  We understand that one of the points about registration is to ensure that standards are maintained and that those who are responsible to see that they are maintained have the resources with which to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be quite wrong, particularly at this time of runaway inflation, to imagine that it would be possible to keep the registration fee in control unless some amending clause, along the lines proposed, is brought into the body of the Bill.  I, therefore, conclude by mentioning that there seem to be three categories, the nurse who is in full time employment, the nurse who is in part time employment <Col N="372" /> and the nurse who is unemployed.  We should consider the registration fee in relation to the three categories and we might tie up, for the purposes of our own protection, the problem of the unemployed and indeed the part time nurse through obligatory refresher courses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  I accept, nevertheless, that control must be exercised in determining the levels of fees to be struck, that is, the level for each type of fee chargeable under this section and, of course, provision must be made for increasing these fees when necessary.  On a general basis the consent of the Minister for Health is called for in the initial fee to be determined and any later increase proposed will have to be subject to the approval of the National Prices Commission.  In addition, it will have to be subject to the consent of the Minister for Health of the day.  These two conditions, the NPC and the sanction of effectively the Department and the Minister for Health apply to all fees that may be charged by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unlikely that exhorbitant charges will be imposed on nurses.  For example, the fee for the final exam at the moment is £55 and that for the post graduate exam is £55.  They are pretty minimal and it is no imposition on any nurse to pay those fees.  The registration of a student fee is only £10 which, in terms of the profession being really serious about its educational and professional standards, is a bit of a joke.  My ambition is to meet the wishes of nurses.  They want on the one hand a self regulatory profession which would be self disciplining and self developing in terms of educational post graduate work and so on but, at the same time &mdash; it is the old story of contradiction and self contradiction in Ireland and we are past masters at it &mdash; nobody wants to pay for the resources to provide that particular enhancement of the profession.  It is endemic in our society that somebody else must pay.  I am very pleased that Senator Fallon accepts the principle of a fee for the retention of person's name on the register.  This is a new enabling <Col N="373" /> provision without which it would be quite difficult to imagine any kind of a live register.  The current nurse register is a joke.  Ask any CEO taking on the employment of a nurse.  He has to plough through the register to find out where that person is by virtue of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He has to pay people a substantial £X per hour to do it and that is taxpayers' money as well.  We have a current register which is neither dead nor alive.  It is a register of thousands of names.  People have ceased to practise as nurses, have emigrated or died and there are out of date addresses.  I marvel at the tolerance and capacity of An Bord Altranais in dealing with that situation.</P>
      <P>Having a series of fees, for example, for the retention of the name of a person on the register is very basic.  Any trade union member or any other profession would normally pay an annual fee to keep his name live on the register.  That is essential and when it comes into force it will be of considerable importance.  An Bord Altranais should provide above all more training opportunities for nurses who are already qualified and, despite the outstanding calibre of Irish nursing staffs, post registration training opportunities are minimal.  It is questionable whether the skills have been retained in many instances with the high degree of immobility within our nursing structures whereby a nurse frequently stays in one hospital for a long number of years and her capacity does not expand.  Above all, when so many persons either aspire to become nurses or are nurses, we have virtually no data on &mdash; if I may use the sexist term for want of a better one &mdash; manpower planning.  These moneys will go in that direction to develop it and equally the money will go towards streamlining the selection procedures of students.  It will streamline the current examination system and overall will give a higher professional standing.  I am pleased that the House generally accepts the principle of a retention fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> I assure Senators that there will be no question of major impositions and changes of fees without in the first instance the reference to the National Prices Commission which covers those charges.  That is not in the Bill but it comes under the statutes relating to the National Prices Commission and of course it will have to be subject to the consent of the Minister for Health who is not likely to bring the wrath of the nurses on his head in regard to approving exceptional increases.</P>
    <P>Equally as regards part-time and unemployed nurses, I assure Senators that there is power devolved on the board to, for example, agree that a person could come off the register for a specific period and go back on without charging a fee. Very considerable power devolves on the board to structure their fees in that way. During the course of the debate in Dáil Éireann I assured Deputies &mdash; and I want to repeat the assurance to Senators &mdash; that I will be asking An Bord Altranais to make that kind of flexible arrangement for part time nurses.  A nurse might decide to give up nursing for three or four years.  She would be kept on the register and would not be charged a fee during that period.  The board have power to do this and I would encourage that reasonable development in terms of registration. That is the overall import of the matters raised by Senators at this stage.</P>

      <P>I want to understand the Minister perfectly on the question of unemployed nurses.  I know he referred to nurses who may opt in and out of the service because of their own situation.  I would be more worried about people who do not have the option, who really want to be employed and who do not have the opportunity.  Am I to understand that they could be on the register without paying a fee?</P>

      <P>The first line of section 25 says that the board may charge such fees for the registration of a person in the register.  That is so flexible that I am assured by the board and the Department &mdash; and it certainly appears to me and the parliamentary draftsman &mdash; that the contingency which the Senator raised is included in the fee.  It could be the registration of a person for a specific period or the non-registration up to a particular period.  If a nurse is not engaged in the practice of nursing she may not have to pay.  The board is happy enough with it as it stands.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (5), line 17, to delete &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;High Court&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is reasonable to have an amendment of this type inserted in this section.  It is a Department of Health Bill and the input of the Minister for Health is all too obvious.  Because of the Minister's involvement in it, that he has nominees on the board and obviously he will be <i>au fait</i> with the development of the nursing board and so on, he will be in touch with them and will be meeting them from time <Col N="376" /> to time, I would feel happier if any appeals were to be made that they should be made to a High Court or a court at some level and not to the Minister.  For that reason we have submitted this amendment.  It is one that the nursing profession would welcome because the section as it reads says:</P>
    <P>A hospital or an institution of which the Board has refused to approve may apply to the Minister to direct the Board to approve of it and if the Minister, after consideration of the facts of the case, gives the direction, the Board shall approve of the hospital or institution.</P>
    <P>Simply because of the obvious intervention and control that the Minister has in regard to many of the sections of the Bill it would seem fairer that any appeals of this kind should be made to somebody other than the Minister and the obvious area would be the High Court.  That is an amendment that should be agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised both in Dáil Éireann and to an extent in this House at the reaction there has been to this subsection.  The whole section, with the exception of subsection (3), is a reenactment of section 35 of the Nurses Act, 1950.  That Act has stood the test of time and has not caused any embarrassment whatsoever to An Bord Altranais in all those years.  I know that the board sets down quite stringent stipulations and standards for training schools and I stress this to our colleagues here.  This is where an application is made by a hospital or an institution for acceptance as a training school in the first instance and where approval is being sought from the board for acceptance of the hospital or institution for such training.  The hospitals either meet those standards and are accepted as training schools or they do not meet them and are then rejected as training schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a hospital makes such an application and where An Bord Altranais spell out to the hospital what they consider to be deficiencies in that hospital in terms of its prospects of being recognised as <Col N="377" /> a training school, they are usually very specific in terms of the deficiencies and the hospital is left in no doubt whatsoever about its shortcomings in terms of prospective acceptance as a training school. Either it corrects those shortcomings if possible, or it accepts that it is just not able to come up to the standards of a training school.</P>
    <P>There is included under the old legislation a provision in the interest of an appeal.  There must be some system of appeal and I have included a right of appeal to the Minister for Health in the event of the hospital or institution feeling that it has been dealt with very unfairly by the board.  That provision is there because within the Department of Health, and outside the Department of Health, the Minister may call upon independent hospital nursing experts to assist him in considering whether there is merit in an appeal or whether the board were justified in refusing to approve a hospital as a training school.  The Minister may go back to the board.  The board may subsequently decide to either accept that the hospital has improved its standards or that its original assessment was wrong. There has to be in all of our legislation a system of appeal.</P>
    <P>Finally, I do not think there is a real need for the amendment.  After it has been turned down by the board and the Minister for Health any hospital may decide to appeal to the courts anyway in the interest of natural justice and fair play and in the interest of getting accepted as a training school.  It would still have that residual right.  That right is not enshrined in the legislation but it is there as part of the natural process of appeal.  What is proposed in the amendment is not in practice precluded.  Presumably an appeal could be made to the court if the appeal to the Minister for Health failed to secure reversal of the board's decision.</P>
    <P>However, I stress that in respect of new applications if An Bord Altranais say to a hospital that the level of its nurse training prospects are so bad there is no way they could give it approval as a training school, or the level of competence of nurse tutors is so abysmally poor that they could not <Col N="378" /> give approval then most hospitals would run 1,000 miles rather than become involved in a major controversy of that nature.  They would work might and main to improve their standards in order to get approval.  That is basically the situation. There is not, therefore, a need for the High Court.  It is difficult to know what the High Court could do in any event because they could only call in a panel of nurse educational tutors and experts to see whether the assessment originally made by the professional body was fair and reasonable.  There are circumstances where one could envisage that situation developing, particularly where people set up their own hospitals, where they wished to develop their own empire, to get it approved as a major hospital and have their own training system inside and so on.  These people might try to cajole An Bord Altranais to be registered as an approved training school.  However, care is taken in section 34 not to permit that kind of situation.</P>

      <P>In page 17, subsection (2), line 26, after &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;,but the training schools shall select their own candidates for Nurses Training.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has caused some <Col N="379" /> controversy with the nursing profession and with the training schools in particular. The section reads:</P>
    <P>The Board may, if it so determines, establish a central applications bureau to process applications from persons wishing to undertake training as a nurse.</P>
    <P>In this section the formation of a central applications bureau seems to be reasonable and fair and something I would not quibble about.  Having said that, I would also make the point that in regard to the Central Applications Bureau in the area of the university education there are many young men and women who cannot be very happy with the outcome of their deliberations from that area this year having regard to the leaving certificate results.  Many people have been given positions they would prefer not to be given and they may find themselves in future occupations they have no flair for or in which they have no desire to be engaged.  That is the way it is and there is some element of concern in that regard.</P>
    <P>Here we are talking about a central applications bureau where each nursing applicant will apply to the bureau and it would seem the training school will not have the right to select.  Here the trainee nurse will basically be an employee and the training school will be an employer. Because that employee-employer situation is totally different from the student situation I referred to earlier, it is important that there should be some level of input on the part of the training schools into the selection of the trainee nurses. It is wrong that trainee nurses should be sent to training schools without the training schools having some input or some opportunity to discuss with the trainee nurse their attitude to nursing and their attitude to the career generally.</P>
    <P>Of all the professions nursing is one where interviews and discussions are necessary because you could have a situation where a young girl with excellent certificate results may wish to be a nurse but has no flair for the job.  On the <Col N="380" /> other hand, somebody with less favourable examination results might come across better in an interview with the appropriate authority.  It is only right that this section should be discussed.  We pride ourselves that our nurses are so excellent, so concerned and so good with patients generally, in all areas whether psychiatric, geriatric or whatever.  That level of expertise has come about because the training schools themselves decided whom they should take into their training schools, they decided who would be best suitable to be trainee nurses and subsequently to be nurses.  Because our training schools have had the input in the past, the level of expertise in the nursing profession is really excellent and this has been recognised.</P>
    <P>This amendment is important.  It is right that the training schools should have a major input into the selection of the trainee nurses and I think this amendment is one that the training schools would welcome.  I hope the Minister will agree with my views on this matter.  Past experience in the area of nursing and trainee nursing generally has been so excellent because of the manner in which it was handled.  I see no reason to change the system whereby the training schools shall not have an input and shall not select their own candidates for nursing training.</P>

      <P>The central applications bureau seems to be generally accepted by everybody.  I ask why change something that has given us service, that has turned out nurses whom we praise and boast about when it suits us?  I believe that the central applications bureau is to be accepted by the majority of my colleagues. I do not accept that the individual hospitals and their top team or their personnel would not have an input and could not dictate in some way to the nurses they would take into their hospitals. Certainly, there have been some persons who should never have gone into hospitals but there are people who should never have come in here and there are people who should never have become <Col N="381" /> teachers and we all know the results of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Smith is aware of that.  If the majority of my colleagues here, and in the other House, and the Minister for Health, want a central applications bureau why change a system that has worked well?  The panels which have interviewed nurses down the years have given us the nurses who are in the wards this evening.  I can accept that one worry the Minister may have and all elected persons have it, is about the hassle of a woman or man in our mental hospitals applying to five hospitals for a place but that is the reality of the nonsense that is going on.  Hospitals must have a say in who they want to train and let into their wards.</P>
      <P>This provision could have a far greater consequences than we think.  We could finish up with the wrong people doing the interviewing and deciding who should be trained.  I hope I will be proved wrong but certainly some very good nurses, with no political ties, have asked that the selection should be the exclusive function of the individual training school.  This has worked well and I wonder why this was changed &mdash; God knows we are doing a lot of changing these days &mdash; when it has stood the nation well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the hassle and the cost involved where unfortunate students apply to five places and I accept that the Minister is trying to protect those young leaving certificate students from that cost but the individual training schools and hospitals should be allowed to decide who they take into their wards.  I will name the hospitals if anybody wants me to &mdash; I do not pull any punches &mdash; and we will see how they stand.  Some of the big hospitals in Dublin, and the majority of <Col N="382" /> nurses working in wards in them as we put this legislation through here, are evidence of how the old system worked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time I have advocated decentralisation programmes, not just the transfer of personnel to different parts of the country, but also the decision-making process as far as possible. I shudder at the way Government systems over the years are being cluttered up.  With the best will in the world on the part of civil servants and, indeed, Ministers, too many minute proposals reach a Minister's desk from time to time for a decision instead of him having a broader opportunity to deal with major policy matters.</P>
      <P>For that reason I am extremely reluctant to support a centrally controlled bureau for recruitment of nurses.  I am reluctant to support further centralised management but I have to admit, however, that appalling senseless trucking goes on with individuals, many of whom cannot afford it, getting trains or trying to arrange transport to interviews all over the country.  Some applying to as many as nine or ten hospitals.  We need to see an end to that and to the extent that a central applications bureau will eliminate some of that it has to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I support Senator Honan and Senator Fallon, who are trying to ensure that a significant input is maintained by the individual hospitals.  I do that because far too often we seem to want to apply, right across the country in a lot of the systems, the same kind of notion even though different regions have different problems.  Each hospital has its own personality and this should always be expressed in the staffing and in the way they manage their affairs.  It would be difficult to twin the two and have the best of both worlds but it is not beyond the capacity of the Minister, and his staff, who exercise so much control and power in the Bill, to come up with a solution which provides us with a central applications bureau and at the same time ensure that there is a continuing and significant input from the hospitals as far as <Col N="383" /> recruitment of trainee nurses is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the points that have been made by other Senators in relation to this section.  There are just two points I should like to make. Firstly, the idea of a central applications bureau to process applications for persons wishing to train as nurses is a good idea.  I agree with Senator Smith that the traipsing around the country of many people desiring to gain admission to the nursing profession is appalling.  Not only is it expensive but it is also degrading. The fact that a central applications bureau may be established does not necessarily suggest to me centralisation as opposed to decentralisation.  I see the central applications bureau, if it is established, operating on the basis whereby they would interview candidates right around the country at, say, county head locations.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside that general point what worries me is the actual section.  Subsection (1) says that the board may determine the minimum educational requirements and subsection (2) says that the board may, if it so determines, establish a central applications bureau.  There is no obligation on the board to do any of those things.  The powers which this section confer are absolutely discretionary and I am led to ask myself is this section, as drafted or as it appears in the Bill before us, necessary.  Does it improve the Bill? I am compelled to feel that it does not.  I do not think that the position would be any worse if this section was not here by virtue of the fact that the functions which it suggests are discretionary.  The section, in so far as subsections (1) and (2) are concerned, would be made much stronger if the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and if the discretionary powers were made mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to indicate, at the risk of provoking the House, that I would not be averse to a mandatory provision in <Col N="384" /> relation to section 35 because I feel so strongly about this question.  On the other hand, irrespective of my personal views, if the nursing profession is to be self-regulatory, a self-disciplining body laying down the criteria of status for itself, the provision in section 35 should be enabling.  We are enabling the board to have a central applications bureau established in three specific areas.  The board may determine under section 35 the minimum educational requirements necessary for entry into training.  Secondly, the board may establish a CAB to process applications.  That is a discretionary enabling provision.  Thirdly, the board, if it goes through those two processes &mdash; I have no doubt but that it is the wish of the present board to do so &mdash; a hospital or an institution approved by the board shall not without the consent of the board accept for training any person who is not approved of and recommended by the board.  It is fairly rigorous at that stage but it is still very global.  It has to be because it will enable the board, having set down the basic educational criteria, having established the CAB to send to a hospital where there may be 20 student vacancies a list of 60 or 100 qualified applicants, but they will be people who in the first instance will have minimum educational qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be no back door entry into nursing, no local preferences and no specialised representations from anybody on behalf of an individual.  I hope the central applications bureau will operate with absolute objectivity, absolute equity as between one applicant and another and absolute fairness in terms of assessment, be it psychological or examination-wise or otherwise in terms of drawing up an approved list of candidates for a particular area.  It may decide to regionalise the candidates coming before it.  It may decide to individualise them in terms of particular hospitals and then forward prospective lists of student nurses.  That is a discretionary and enabling aspect. There may be 20 vacancies and it may only forward 20 names.  That will be the privilege of the CAB.  On the one hand <Col N="385" /> there may be 30 vacancies and it may forward 100 names.</P>
    <P>In the framework of this legislation I do not think I should lay down an all-embracing structure because once An Bord Altranais have power to set up a central applications bureau they should go ahead and do it, assessing as best they can with the information available to them, the manpower data available and the future needs of nurse student training in the country assessed and available. The Department of Health, and the Minister of the day, should not do for An Bord Altranais what they are obliged to do on an enabling basis for themselves.</P>
    <P>I am adamant about the need for this provision and it has met opposition.  I have been left in no doubt about the opposition to the concept of central selection. I should point out to the administrators of some hospitals who were opposed to this, the board members of some hospitals and some members of the nursing profession who are opposed to it, that the working party on general nursing recommended it.  It is not some Machiavellian dream of an obdurate controversial Minister for Health who has every misinterpretation heaped upon his head. It was a respected body of matrons, educationalists and medical profession representatives and departmental representatives &mdash; 25 people were at one time on that working body and they were all expert within the professional area &mdash; who unanimously recommended the central applications bureau in this framework. When is comes to putting this into operation some of the Opposition &mdash; to use a derogatory phrase which I should not use but it crawls out from the woodwork &mdash; say special privilege is being taken on by this selection process.</P>
    <P>I would stress to the hospitals concerned that they are not being asked to hand over the selection process to some kind of bureaucratic statutory inanimate Bord Altranais.  They would be asked at the worst to accept that their peers, medical consultants &mdash; there are only three of them out of 29 &mdash; a large number of senior tutors, administrators, hospital representatives at the highest level, a <Col N="386" /> total of 17 elected members, should set up the system.  A lot of them would be from nursing training schools and they would be as well qualified as some of the matrons who sit in a back room meeting streams of student applicants, some with letters from politicians, some with letters from their brother-in-law who is a parish priest or a good reference signed by a Senator or Deputy, or a Minister which would probably kill her prospects of being accepted.  Of course, those letters are no longer written in the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Each school would retain a circumscribed right to determine the suitability for employment of the applicants and it would be quite different from the criticism levelled by Senator Fallon in relation to the university central applications bureau system.  There has been criticism of the university CAO.  It is a great deal better than it was in the fifties when I had the privilege of being accepted as a student.  Being the son of a trade union official there was consternation in the academic body at the idea of such an inmate being permitted into the hallowed institution in Cork.  We got over that and that is one of the reasons why I feel very strongly about this kind of development at statute level.  Under the central applications bureau in our universities it is true that students finish up in courses leading to professions for which they may not be particularly suited but that is because of the generality of application for university training.  The CAB proposed by us relates to nursing only and the arguments about the defects of the university CAO is not relevant.</P>
    <P>It is contradictory to suggest that people enter walks of life not particularly suited to them.  If we want to improve and develop the system we must bring in an effective system of selection for student nursing particularly these days when the nursing profession is a matter of enormous educational aspiration for many people, a matter of substantial professional standing within our community and a matter of major employment. There is very little unemployment in the profession.  The nonsense that 2,700 <Col N="387" /> people are unemployed is pure mythology. If one looks at the advertisements in the newspapers and rings the hospitals afterwards to see how many people applied for the jobs, one is told by hospital administrators that while many people want to become student nurses, and there is a limitation to the numbers of nurses we need in the country, the number of nurses particularly in the specialised area, available for employment is extremely limited.</P>
    <P>The general level of social acceptance of student nursing or nursing generally is extremely high and for these reasons, and they are good reasons, and if only for those reasons, there should be a fair and equitable system of personal assessment to go into training, to remain in training and to emerge with a qualification.  This goes down the road a long way and I hope it will come into operation.  I have every confidence in the capacity of the current chief executive officer of An Bord Altranais, Mr. Daly, to bring in a system in consultation with the newly elected and the newly appointed members in 1986.  It can be done.  It should be done. It will mark a milestone of reform in our training of nurses.  I have no doubt that it will be a practical demonstration of the merits of this Bill in future.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides that the training schools shall select their own candidates for nurse training.  There is no point in this if they are going to finish up doing all the selection as effectively the whole thing would be nullified and it would not be worth a candle in that regard.  On that basis I strongly recommend that the amendment should not be accepted by the House.  I am unable to accept both amendments as proposed at this stage.</P>

      <P>When the central bureau is set up anybody can become a nurse. The Minister's thinking there is wrong because some of the best nurses in top appointments in some of our hospitals are not the sons and daughters of &ldquo;big shots&rdquo;.  The Minister seems to think that now there will not be political influence and that there will not be TDs' or Senators' letters being sent in on behalf of candidates to secure an interview or to be shortlisted.  I have made representations for students in the mid-western region, but I did not get anywhere.  Maybe myself and the CEO are not on the best of terms. If I thought that this central applications bureau, without input or consultation with the training hospitals, would say who went into their corridors to qualify, I would go the whole way with the Minister. When the Minister gets something into his head, that is that.  It is not so, and the Minister is wrong to think that the places in all the training hospitals, before this legislation, were held for a certain section of the community.  It frightens me to find that the Minister knows so little about the personnel manning the hospitals.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Fallon's amendment. If I have broken the rules, so has the Minister, and it is not the first time we have broken them and it will not be the last time either.  The Minister seems to think that it is from now on that everybody will get a chance, and that up to this evening it was only a certain section of the people who were accepted into nurse training.  That would want to be made clear here.  Obviously I know more about the nursing personnel than the Minister.</P>

      <P>What one is doing surely is contrasting the position that would happen in the event of Senator Fallon's amendment being passed as distinct from the position that will be brought about if it is not passed.  If the amendment we are discussing is passed subsections (2) and (3) would be deleted and a proviso put in that training schools shall select their own candidates for nurse training.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, that amendment having been made there would still be one very fundamental charge coming about, a fundamental change of which we must take note, that is the proposal that, with Senator Fallon's amendment, the position would be that minimum educational qualifications could be laid down.  The Minister would be doing less than justice to Senator Fallon's point of view if he did not recognise that that is probably the greatest change that could be brought about as a result of all this process, that the laying down of minimum educational qualifications would in itself be a very desirable thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter which Senator Fallon's amendment proposes is that three would be a central applications bureau and that, of corse, would also be a significant change, but Senator Fallon is then proposing that the power of that central applications bureau would be strictly limited to a processing, mechanical or clerical role and that the actual selection would remain at hospital level. Senator Fallon is going too far in his amendment but at the same time the Minister is over-reacting to what the Senator said.  I have no ready solution to the problem but there is some merit in the point of view that if what we are talking about is a central applications <Col N="390" /> bureau, if Senator Fallon's amendment, or some amendment, is not made it will not really be a central applications breau at all it will be a central selection process, and that is what we would call it.  We should not call it an applications bureau and thereby equate it to the system in universities.  The Minister will be aware that at university level each college establishes its own educational or entry requirements and the applications bureau merely works within that framework. What is proposed here is more fundamental. It is supposed to be a central selection process.  Senator Fallon is going a bit too far when highlighting the problem by saying that there should be no say at central level other than in relation to minimum educational requirements. There is room for compromise here with regard to the way in which this process should work in the future.</P>
    <P>I foresee problems and I understand the privilege to which the Minister refers and I agree that it is important to eliminate it.  The Minister should also recognise that there could be a substantial problem with a selection process on a national basis which would of necessity have to select people strictly on the order of merit irrespective of where they lived.  There could be a massive movement of students from one part of the country to another because the process would not have recognised where they lived.  That is a criterion which needs to be taken into consideration also, for the purpose of establishing whether a person should be recruited for a certain teaching hospital.</P>
    <P>It is not realistic to suggest that the 19 people on the board will take part in the selection process.  They will establish the guidelines but they could not possibly take part in the process because of the number of applications and the number of places where decisions will be taken. The members of the board will not have an executive function in that regard and nated to somebody else.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach is acceptable without the amendment because the amendment is very much a straitjacket.  It says only that local people decide.  At <Col N="391" /> least the Minister's suggestion gives the possibility that a flexible system would be implemented where a board, which would be representative of the central applications bureau and local people, might have a function to play.  The way in which section 35 is drafted allowed for that possibility.  In considering Senator Fallon's amendment the Minister should also consider whether some more clear criteria should not be laid down for the board to help in drawing up these schemes so that they could overcome the may be selected for the job purely on the basis of, for example, their leaving certificate results.  That is not a very sensible way in which to select people for the nursing profession.  I cannot support Senator Fallon's amendment because it is unnecessarily simplistic, but he has highlighted a problem and the desirable objectives which the Minister has set would be better met in the long run if he expanded further within the confines of this Bill the criteria which should be used in selecting people on a regional basis for individual training establishments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has gone a little far in the way he has addressed this question.  I support Senator Honan in that I do not believe that the nursing profession has been the domain of the elite and I speak for the mid-west region. Many nurses would look aghast at the Minister's view in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter how one tries to assess candidates for a job and no matter how independent the board are, there are instances where independent decision produced disastrous results.  There is not enough evidence to suggest that a central processing board are incapable of making mistakes or that they are better than any other method of selection.  A few weeks ago I had an opportunity to sit on an interview panel.  On that occasion one candidate who was adjudicated to be in second place had an excellent interview. About a month later that same candidate appeared before the same panel for <Col N="392" /> another job and her interview was disastrous and I would have made an entirely different decision on the second day from the one I would have made on the first interview so I do not attribute blame for various decisions.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that the hospitals have some say in the appointments.  I do not disagree with Senator Fallon, but I am not sure that I would be a clear and significant input by the different components in our hospitals system in regard to the kind of personnel they wish to recruit from time to time.  If the Minister was managing an institution or a factory or providing a service he would not accept that he could have no say and practically no input into the type of individuals that he would have to manage from time to time.  If it is left entirely to the central applications bureau to the central Donegal, for instance, will get a job in Cork and <i>vice versa.</i> What we are trying to do at this stage is to establish beyond all shadow of doubt that the process involves a significant input from the various training hospitals into the recruitment of their trainees.  It is not fair of the Minister to accuse people putting that point forward of wanting to maintain privilege.  It is less than honest of the Minister to try to impute that to individuals who are making their best efforts to improve this Bill and be as fair as possible to the numbers of people who will want to join the nursing profession.  It does not do anything for this House to suggest that in this effort we are making, we want to ensure that only privileged classes will join the nursing profession.  That has not been the case up to now.  Many of us would fight that as strongly as the Minister or anybody else.  Therefore, the Minister, even if he does not find it possible to go the whole way with this amendment, which I recognise present difficulties, should travel down some distance of that road or indicate to us fairly positively significant input into the recruitment of their training nurses.</P>

      <P>The lack of domestic bathroom and toilet facilities is a great problem in rural areas.  About one quarter of rural houses are still without a toilet, 30 per cent have no fixed bath or shower and 20 per cent are without internal piped water.  The lack of these basic facilities in rural Ireland, when we are a mere 14 years away from the 21st century must be regarded as highly unsatisfactory, and we must ask if the existing grant schemes are equal to solving this problem.  More State support will be needed in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the 250,000 dwellings over 60 years old, there is a connection between the low level of grant support for <Col N="394" /> housing renovation and the urban decay and dereliction we see around us.  We are totally out of line with the rest of Europe in the emphasis we place on the renovation and maintenance of our existing building stock.  The results of this neglect are plainly visible.  Our older urban buildings are situated in or around our town and city centres.  Overseas visitors must be shocked at the level of urban decay here.  To the visitor, the identity of a town or a city is determined by its centre and not by its modern suburbs.  Until recently we have failed as a nation to seriously come to terms with the decline in our urban population.  We have allowed houses to decay and encouraged people to move to vast suburban housing estates taking up much good agricultural land.  I refer in particular to County Meath. Some of this development is inevitable in view of the welcome population growth we have enjoyed over recent years.  However, we have failed to focus on the housing possibilities in our inner cities and towns which have schools, shops and business premises, not to mention developed roads and sanitary services. To reverse the tide of decline in our older urban areas, we must develop a system of support for the renovation and maintenance of our older housing.  As has already been explained, when a house reaches 60 years, it needs extensive refurbishment to restore its usefulness as a dwelling.</P>
    <P>The cost of renovating an older house can be considerable but it is not as high as the cost of building a new house.  The problem is that many older houses are in socially deprived areas and are inhabited by people of modest means and the elderly. The problem is compounded by and very much a result of the continuous haemorrhage of residents from these areas over the last 20 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>The burden of restoring life to these areas has fallen uniquely on the local authorities.  For example, Dublin Corporation have provided many fine inner city houses.  However, the cost is over £50,000 per house.  These houses are available only to qualifying local authority tenants.  In the interests of restoring <Col N="395" /> a balanced social mix to these areas and encouraging young home buyers to look positively at the advantages of living in inner urban areas a scheme of generous home improvement grants is needed. Such a scheme, apart from giving existing residents the opportunity of renewing their houses, would encourage young people to buy houses in these areas and restore them.  When young people are brought back into inner urban areas, life and business return there also.  With a good social mix the potential for crime and vandalism is reduced.  I am not talking about Dublin alone.  The same process of urban decline is under way in all our cities and towns at present.  It has even spread to the smallest towns in rural Ireland.  Other countries have seen an improvement in this regard.  The restoration of these areas requires an overall strategy, the central component of which must be the renovation and maintenance of our existing housing stock.  A system of grants to encourage the renovation and maintenance of our older private dwellings would encourage householders to put their money into this very necessary work and stimulate activity and employment by small construction firms.  It would also help to restore a pleasant living environment.  However, qualifying work under such a home improvement scheme should be confined to registered contractors.  The black economy in construction is very extensive and it should be reinforced by the use of State moneys.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we look at the schemes in operation in Britain at present.  The pattern of home ownership is similar to here although the average age of the housing stock is probably older in Britain. The same type of dwelling &mdash; single housing units rather than flats or apartments &mdash; is the norm there as it is here.  Two rates of grants are available in Britain, one, for greater London and the other for the rest of Britain.  I would like to quote the rates for the rest of Britain, which are expressed in sterling.  I am not suggesting that we should have identical schemes here but they could serve as a model.  The first type of grant in Britain <Col N="396" /> is the improvement grant.  The first improvement grant category is the priority case which applies to houses in particularly bad condition which lack standard amenities and are in need of standard structural repair.  This designation also applies to houses in housing action areas and the improvement of a dwelling for a disabled occupant.  The maximum qualifying expenditure is £10,200 and the maximum grant is 75 per cent.  The non-priority case designation of improvement grant is for the general improvement of older houses.  Here the maximum qualifying expenditure is £6,000 with a maximum grant of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The intermediate grant is designed to help to meet the cost of putting in missing standard amenities, such as fixed bath, shower, washhand basin and indoor toilet.  The maximum qualifying expenditure here is £2,275 and the grant is 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The repairs grant is designed to assist substantial and structural repairs to pre-1919 houses.  The expenditure limit is £4,800 and the maximum grant is 50 per cent.  This grant applies to repairs only and not to improvements.</P>
    <P>There are several variations of these grant schemes, perhaps too many.  However, support on a similar scale is required here if we are to make a meaningful impact in preserving our older houses.  There has been a drop in house improvements and in the payment of house improvement grants.  The present grant scheme, with its requirement of a prior inspection has had a detrimental effect on many applicants who through ignorance had not contacted their local county council or notified the Department on time and had started work and even dug a foundation.  The inspector calls and he must tell the applicant that once work has started the authority are powerless to allocate a grant.  Somebody who decides to build a bathroom or provide the bare essentials, water or sewerage, does not do so except because of necessity.  The intention was to ensure that the grant scheme as initiated by the Government would operate from the <Col N="397" /> time of its implementation and that people would not get grant money for work which had been done six months or a year beforehand.  However, many people who were relying on what seemed to be a fairly generous grant discovered that, having given a contract to a builder, they could not pursue the work.  The Minister should look at this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to put on record at the outset my support for the amendment put forward by Senators Ferris and Dooge. When this Government took office in 1981 I was very much involved in the introduction of the house improvement scheme and I would, of course, be fully committed to any necessary review of the scheme should circumstances so warrant. The Minister has already touched on the question of a review in his contribution to the debate.  I do not propose to dwell further on that aspect now but I can assure Senators that I have always been committed &mdash; and I still am &mdash; to the need for worthwhile incentives to ensure the maintenance of our housing stock in good condition and equipped with the amenities which are essential in present-day circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will confine my comments to certain of the matters mentioned in the earlier stages of the debate.  Firstly, in proposing the motion Senator Fitzsimons raised the question of the essential repairs grant scheme and he was critical that it did not extend to urban areas.  Since its introduction back in 1963, this scheme has been confined to houses located in county health districts, and it was never intended to cover repairs to the generality of houses.  What we are talking about is a restricted scheme to enable county councils to give assistance for necessary repairs to prolong the lives of houses which are in poor condition and which are not capable of being made fully fit for habitation at a reasonable cost.  Typically, these grants are given to elderly persons so that they can continue to <Col N="398" /> reside in their houses in reasonable comfort for the remainder of their lives.  As we all know, many elderly people are naturally reluctant to move from neighbourhoods and the houses in which they have lived for most of their lives.  The reason down the years for confining this scheme to rural areas was that there would not be a continuing need for many of the houses involved after the lifetime of the occupants.  Clearly it would be uneconomical to invest large amounts in extensive repairs to such houses.  The same considerations do not apply in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Reference was made during the debate to the special scheme of housing aid for the elderly.  This scheme is administered by a task force which includes representatives of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and ALONE.  It was set up under the aegis of my Department and is operated at local level by the health boards, who, I might add, are doing an excellent job. In addition, I also have to acknowledge the very worthwhile contribution AnCO are making to this scheme in practically all health board areas.  This scheme is meeting a real demand and there is no doubt that a very valuable service for elderly people is being provided countrywide at the lowest possible cost.  Elderly persons who are in need are being assisted by the carrying out of necessary repairs and the provision of basic amenities in their dwellings.  The scheme is flexible and informal in its operation and I know from personal experience that it has alleviated the hardship which many elderly people in poor circumstances would otherwise have to suffer.  The national plan contained a commitment that the scheme would be maintained in 1986 and 1987.  So far about 4,000 cases have been dealt with under the scheme. With a scheme like this it is inevitable that the total demand may not be met in any year, but I am gratified that there is a commitment now to continue it for at least two further years, so enabling many of the cases not yet dealt with to be accommodated.</P>
    <P>I think that the plea made by Senator Fitzsimons in relation to thatched houses <Col N="399" /> deserves a response.  I understand that there have been some cases involving re-thatching which qualified for grants under the category of works relating to repairs to the basic fabric of a house.  I accept that some owners of houses with thatched roofs may not be aware that, within the normal terms of the scheme, the expenditure incurred on roofing repairs such as re-thatching can qualify for grant assistance. This is something that might well receive wider publicity and I understand that the Department are currently considering how best this might be arranged.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate, comparisons were drawn between the levels of grants now and expenditure on improvement schemes in earlier years, particularly in 1979 and 1980-81.  However, I should point out that the unusually high expenditure in these earlier years was attributable to quite exceptional circumstances. Firstly, the solid fuel scheme, on which nearly £14 million was paid out in about eight months in 1979-80, gave rise to a once-for-all jump in expenditure and, secondly, the way in which the earlier improvement grant scheme was terminated resulted in over 40,000 applications being received in the course of a fortnight at the beginning of 1980.  To put it mildly, I do not think much credit can be claimed for a short term boost in expenditure that is the direct result of a decision to terminate the grants scheme altogether.</P>
    <P>I was interested to note that in the course of the debate considerable concern was expressed at the operation of the black economy in the construction industry generally and, in particular, in the carrying out of works under the grants schemes.  The Government have been seriously concerned for some time about the operation of the black economy in construction.  My Department have been anxious to ensure that so far as possible the black economy does not operate on construction contracts operated by or on behalf of local authorities and certain measures have been implemented to deal with the problem.  The tax clearance certification procedures drawn up in consultation with the Department of Finance <Col N="400" /> and the Revenue Commissioners are being strictly implemented by all local authorities.</P>
    <P>In addition, local authorities have been alerted to the need to ensure that the provisions of clause 39 of the Approved Conditions of Contract for building works, and clause 34 of Conditions of Contract for civil engineering works, are adhered to.  They have been requested to carry out regular site inspections to ensure that appropriate rates of wages, hours of labour and conditions of employment, including membership of the Construction Federation Pension-Sick Pay Schemes are being implemented in all building and civil engineering contracts in which they are either directly or indirectly involved.</P>
    <P>Much more may need to be done to deal with this problem which has become so pervasive and so difficult to eradicate. The stage is now being reached at which radical measures may have to be taken to deal with this problem in areas of private sector activity that are grant-aided.  I know the Government are looking at this problem.  The issues involved are difficult but I am confident that if the situation is seen to warrant it, they will not be slow to take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch commented on decay in the big urban areas and in the smaller urban areas, too.  There are problems particularly in the older urban areas.  It is important also to realise that local authorities were given the facilities of a revolving scheme whereby they can buy old houses, renovate them and sell them. That was done with a view to improving existing housing stock.  The joint venture schemes are operating now and they allow local authorities to make sites available in particular urban areas.</P>
    <P>There is one typical example off Clanbrassil Street in Dublin and the same applies to other areas.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that this is something I am always very concerned about and that I would look at any proposals that might come up.  Certain action is being taken in that area.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch referred to the smaller towns.  It is my happy experience to <Col N="401" /> notice in the past 20 years the dramatic improvement in a lot of towns throughout the country, particularly since the Tidy Towns competitions began.  The general fabric of these towns has improved.  It is great to see that.  We should commend the people who become so involved in this area but we have problems with regard to older areas and there are things we obviously have to look at to see if we can effect improvements.  These must be taken into consideration in terms of the resources we have.  We are always looking at ways of improving grant schemes, particularly in relation to older dwellings. That is important with regard to bathrooms and toilets.  The Senator indicated the number of houses that were without these facilities.  That is something we all regret but I am happy to say that there is some assistance there by way of grant aid.  We should always have an active mind particularly in regard to our older cities and towns, that they do not fall into disrepair because once they go it is very hard to restore any real life to them.  I accept what the Senator has said.  I have taken it on board but the picture is not as bleak as one might paint it.  There are things to be done and we hope that in the fullness of time and when the economy picks up, many of these things can be taken on board and accelerated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and call on the Government to revise drastically the house improvement grant scheme.  The grant scheme as it operates at the moment provides for £200 for the provision of a water supply, £200 for sewerage facilities, £600 for the building of a chimney, £600 for the provision of a bathroom, a further £600 for a scheme which would help to relieve overcrowding in a house and another £600 is available to improve the actual fabric of a house. If you accept and take each of these programmes and examine them one by one, you would have to conclude that at this point they are totally insufficient compared with what would be the overall contract for the work in hand.  In many cases I would have to suggest that these <Col N="402" /> grants are very often not even enough to get the scheme under way.</P>
      <P>The provision of planning, the provision of maps and the actual administration work that goes into the preparation of getting a grant is not even sufficient with the grants that are now on offer, that is not even to mention digging one hole in the ground by way of a foundation. Grants are grossly inadequate and need revision.</P>
      <P>What I think has to be said is that we as a nation like to own our own houses. This has been a feature of our life for as long as we can remember.  There are many cases where people have old houses and where, by getting a home improvement loan plus worthwhile grants they would do a particularly nice job and restore a house to proper habitable conditions. If the grants were attractive enough more people would be encouraged to go out and seek the rest of the finance with a view to improving their houses.  The grants are not adequate.  If the grant scheme is improved it should be for people who need the money most. It was a mistake in the past that if a grant was available, for example, for the provision of windows and if the windows were in any way defective, the grant was applicable.  The fact that it was available encouraged people to seek the grant.  In many cases the windows were quite good enough for a further two, three or five years but by virtue of the grant being available naturally the people concerned completed their application, were approved for a grant and had the old windows removed and new ones installed.  I am not saying that was an abuse but there should have been some form of means test in relation to those grants.  For the future, if there is to be any improvement in any grant scheme it should be for the people who are less well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going back to those programmes, for example, the £200 for the provision of a water supply, we all know that the cost of boring a well today is grossly in excess of that amount.  The cost of any degree of plumbing would be much higher than <Col N="403" /> £200 so that amount is totally inadequate. In the case of sewerage facilities or of the £600 for overcrowding, those amounts would represent only a fraction of the overall cost.</P>
    <P>It is well established that the building trade is in a very serious situation.  We know that unemployment, morale and work in that area have reached an all time low.  I read recently that in the private housing sector for the past year house starts were reduced by over 17 per cent on last year.  Obviously, this being the case, the sales of all the other ancillary trades, such as hardware and so on, were reduced accordingly.  The volume of Irish Cement sales fell by 5½ per cent compared with last year.  This reduction in the number of starts of new houses has had a very damaging effect on the whole building industry.  The introduction of a better grant scheme would bring some relief to an already decaying building industry.</P>
    <P>In any new scheme the question of duplication must arise.  That is why I would prefer that if a new grant scheme were devised, there should be decentralisation. In Westmeath, some years ago, we had a scheme where all applications were dealt with through Westmeath County Council.  I think I am right in saying that Meath has a similar scheme. That is much more helpful and preferable because the opportunity is there for the man in the street to go into his local authority, or lift the telephone, and find out how his grant is going rather than having to ring the Department in Dublin or get TDs or Senators to find out what progress is being made in regard to his grant.  Apart from that matters are simplified generally.  Engineers from local authorities spend much of their time on the road going to various towns and villages within their local electoral area. They can bring with them files relating to grants and find out what has happened, what progress is being made, whether the work has started and so on, rather than having somebody being paid to travel from Dublin or from some other distant part with that information.  Therefore this <Col N="404" /> duplication would help to speed up matters and would provide a more efficient and less costly service.</P>
    <P>One of the features of the present grant scheme and one which I find many people are not happy with is the date of commencement clause.  There is room for a change here.  Many people unfortunately have been left without their grant because they were not aware of what should be done regarding the commencement of the scheme and therefore were caught very badly in that respect.</P>
    <P>The disabled grant area is one that should be examined, too.  We all know that the cost of adapting a house to suit a disabled person can be very expensive. The grant at the moment in that respect is something in the region of £4,000.  That is not adequate.  The essential repair grant of £600 is not adequate either.  Basically we should endeavour to have a new scheme which is adequate to attract people to carry out work that is necessary and that scheme should be for the people who need it most.  This is an area one could speak on at length but I understand there are other speakers and I do not wish to prolong the debate unduly.</P>
    <P>A worthwhile grant scheme, well organised, well controlled with obviously increased benefits would be utilised by the people for whom it should be intended and not for people who are well off and can afford to pay for any repairs to their homes.  If such a scheme were available many people in houses which are at present in disrepair would find that the future for them would be brighter than they find it at the moment.  We should agree to this proposal which is to revise this important home improvements scheme.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the amendment which reads:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>noting that a scheme of house improvement grants was introduced <Col N="405" /> by the previous Coalition Government in October, 1981, following termination of the earlier schemes by a previous Government in February, 1980, welcomes the investments in home improvement work which has resulted from the current scheme and calls on the Minister for the Environment to keep the terms of this scheme under constant review with a view to its enhancement when circumstances warrant it.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the Minister's contribution and to compliment him on the continuing work he is doing in this regard.  I, like other speakers, believe it is important that every effort be made to retain our housing stock.  The older houses add a great touch of character to many of our towns and villages.</P>
    <P>There are a few points that should be made.  Other speakers have mentioned them and I should like to support those views.  For instance, the essential repairs grant should be more liberally granted, especially for roofs, with particular regard to thatched roofs.  The crib I have with the reconstruction grant is that if any of the work has started the inspector says he is just powerless to do anything. I believe that particular provision is necessary for good planning but if somebody has a thatched house and it needs repairs then whenever the person can start on the work he should be able to do so.  There is certainly no difficulty in the inspector assessing the amount or the extent of the repairs necessary.  This aspect should be much more flexible.  I should like the Minister to pay particular attention to that condition.</P>
    <P>I would like to see also the decentralisation of the administration of grants and perhaps there could be a tie-up with the planning offices at county level so that the planning officer, on reviewing the plans or carrying out an inspection, could possibly at that stage as an agent of the Department give the go ahead for work to start.  That would be a help.  In the reconstruction or house improvements grant there must be a stronger element of conservation and I hope that in any <Col N="406" /> review that the Minister might make that element would come out more strongly and perhaps for houses in certain age category that house grants would be made available in order to conserve that category of buildings and to repair the roofs.</P>
    <P>In most other countries in Europe, or even in the UK, there is not the same percentage of new houses and bungalows across the country as one sees here in the Republic.  That people invest so heavily in new homes is a compliment to them. Nevertheless, it ties down so many young people to heavy mortgage repayments &mdash; which I am glad to see have come down in the last year.  If it were fashionable for people to spend more money on conserving and making their older houses more comfortable and perhaps finding ways of damp-proofing walls 100 or 150 years old and if the Government grants were aimed at that, it would make many of our villages much more interesting.  Indeed, thatched houses have become quite scarce across the country now and I hope that if the Minister gets an opportunity of introducing new regulations he will give considerable thought to embarking on conservation policy, with enhanced grants to enable people to maintain thatched houses, which cost more to maintain that perhaps modern buildings.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Government and the Department are doing a substantial job. The inspectorate, certainly as far as our constitutency is concerned, have a lot of work to do and I am confident that they do their best.  Nevertheless, there is a backlog of applications to be dealt with. I would hope, as our amendment states, that our Department would keep in mind this important problem.  It is essential not only that people have comfortable homes but also that they be assisted and encouraged to provide them at the most economic cost.  I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution to this debate but before I address myself to the motion I want to take up a point made by the Minister when he spoke a <Col N="407" /> few minutes ago.  He stated that local authorities have been given facilities to buy houses and to renovate, let or sell them off.  As I understand the situation, if a local authority buys an existing or an old local authority house &mdash; that is, a house that was originally built by a local authority, even though the local authority may have subsequently disposed of that house under the house purchase scheme, no subsidy is given to that local authority. A local authority should be empowered to purchase a modern or an old local authority house if such a house is suitable to their needs.  Roscommon County Council, of which I have the honour to be chairman, submitted a resolution to the Department some time ago asking that this regulation be changed and that the subsidy be paid to the local authority in a situation where the local authority would buy an old local authority house or one originally built as a local authority house.  I would ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to that.</P>
      <P>I support the motion calling on the Minister for the Environment to revise, as a matter of urgency, the house improvement scheme.  I do not think anybody can deny that the existing grant scheme is urgently in need of revision. The level of grants which are available is far too low.  Certain works have no grants available for them.  The only works which qualify for ordinary house improvement grants are the provision of a water supply, the installation of sewerage facilities, the building of a chimney and the provision of a fireplace in a house without a chimney, the provision of a bathroom where none exists, the building of one extra bedroom to relieve overcrowding and major necessary works to the basic fabric of the house, mainly roofs, walls and floors.  Works which do not qualify for a grant include internal alterations, kitchen extensions, or the extension of living accommodation, window and door replacements, porches, rewiring, attic insulation, decoration, maintenance, the replacement of seriously defective plumbing or fittings, or the installation of a heating system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> The grants which are available are so low that they are totally unrealistic.  They bear no relationship to the actual cost of the materials or the labour involved in carrying out the work in question.  The grant for the provision of a water supply is £200.  If such work involves the boring of a well, the provision of an electric pump and the installation of the plumbing for that supply, then £200 is very meagre. In fact, it is totally useless in relation to the total cost of providing a water supply. The £200 grant for the installation of sewerage facility is also very low when one considers the cost of digging for and installing the septic tank, providing the piping and doing all the plumbing involved.  Even the £600 grant for the provision of a bathroom, and the £600 grant for the provision of an extra bedroom, as Senator Fallon has already said, are totally unrealistic when one considers the cost involved in the building, the purchase of materials and the fittings and plumbing.  You will have a very modest bathroom for anything less than £2,000. In fact, I do not think it is possible to provide a bathroom for less than that. The combined maximum grant is £1,000 for the provision of both a bathroom and an extra bedroom where the provision of an extra bedroom is approved.</P>
    <P>All the previous speakers mentioned the level of the existing grants.  They are so low that they are of little use to a person undertaking a house improvements job.  Previous speakers and also the Minister in his speech referred to the second scheme.  The introduction to the explanatory memorandum of the housing application form states that it is an absolute condition of eligibility under the house improvement grant scheme that work be not commenced before the Department's inspector visits the house. Applicants are advised not to start work immediately after the inspection but to wait until they receive the certificate of approval showing the amount of grant which they will obtain for the work.  I do not totally disagree with the condition of prior inspection but it should apply only to the carrying out of the actual improvement work or building involved and there <Col N="409" /> should be some flexibility in relation to the preparatory work which could be carried out in advance of the inspector's visit.  For instance, if a person has to bore a well in order to provide a water supply it may be that a well-drilling contractor may be working in that person's area and may be moving out of the area before the housing inspector calls.  If the person can have the well bored while the contractor is operating in the area, then the work will be done at a lesser cost than if the contractor has to be brought back into the area specifically to bore that well. That is one situation where there should be flexibility.</P>
    <P>In the same way there should be flexibility in relation to prior inspection in the case of the digging of a septic tank or of foundations because most of that work is done by machinery nowadays.  In some instances a machine operator may be working in the area and the householder who proposes to carry out the house improvement work can get him to do the work in connection with the septic tanks when he is in the area.  In this way the work could be carried out more cheaply than if he has to wait until the Department's inspector calls and approves the work.  In situations such as this there should be some flexibility in relation to the prior inspection condition.</P>
    <P>Time will not permit me to deal with every aspect of the existing housing grants scheme.  Therefore I have to confine myself to a comment on those sections of the scheme which are most urgently in need of revision.  It is a major flaw in the scheme that there is not a grant available for the replacement of windows and external doors.  As I understand the situation, the purpose and objective of the house improvement scheme is the preservation and improvement of the existing housing stock, thereby reducing the demand on local authorities for houses, with a resultant saving to the Exchequer.  If we are serious about the preservation of existing houses, there should be a scheme of grants available for the replacement of windows and external doors because a house with seriously deteriorated windows and doors <Col N="410" /> will quickly become dilapidated and unfit for habitation.  The grant which is available for major works to the building fabric of a house specifically excludes the replacement of windows and external doors and in all cases the cost of such replacement can be pretty considerable.'</P>
    <P>As a public representative I recently came across the case of a widow in poor health with two school-going children. She has no income other than her widow's pension and the windows and doors in her house are in urgent need of replacement. She applied for a house improvement grant and was told that she was not eligible for such grant because that was the only work that needed to be done to her house.  She was advised to apply for an essential repairs grant.  She applied to the county council for an essential repairs grant but was told that she was not eligible for that grant because she had two young children living in the house.  She was in poor health so she was advised to apply for a disabled person's grant, but apparently her medical condition was not sufficiently serious to entitle her to that grant and again because she has her two children living with her she is not entitled to assistance under the special housing aid for the elderly.  So she is in the unfortunate position that she simply will not be able to carry out the work that is vitally necessary as far as preservation of her house is concerned.  The windows and external doors in her house have seriously deteriorated and since she is not in a financial position to replace them, the house will very soon come to the stage where it will no longer be fit for habitation. She will then apply to the local authority and the local authority, at considerable expense to the Exchequer and the taxpayer, will provide a house for her.  For that reason, it is a flaw in the scheme that there is no grant for the replacement of windows and external doors.</P>
    <P>I will move on to the disabled person's grant now.  Under this scheme a grant may be paid by a local authority for the provision of additional accommodation or for the carrying out of other structural works that in the opinion of the authority <Col N="411" /> are necessary for the proper accommodation of the physically disabled, or severely mentally handicapped, or severely mentally ill person.  I understand that in order to qualify for a disabled person's grant the person in respect of whom the work is being carried out must be substantially and permanently handicapped. This scheme, I assume in all cases, is implemented by the local authority and the local authority in order to assess the eligibility of the handicapped person for a disabled person's grant seeks a report from the director of community care.  I have known of cases where persons such as those suffering from arthritis applied for the disabled person's housing grant and even though their medical condition was deteriorating progressively, at the time they applied they were not considered by the director of community care to be sufficiently substantially handicapped to qualify for the disabled person's grant.  As time went on, they did reach that stage and some years later they were considered to be eligible for the disabled person's grant but during the years in which their medical condition was reaching the stage at which they were considered eligible for the grant they suffered considerable inconvenience in living in houses without facilities.  In a situation where a person has a physical disability which is progressively deteriorating there should be quite a considerable degree of flexibility in the interpretation of the medical conditions in respect of the disabled person's grant.</P>
    <P>The grant for essential repairs is paid, as the Minister said, only in rural areas and where the house cannot be made fit for habitation in all respects at a reasonable cost and the repairs are necessary in order to prolong the life of the house. The local authority have some discretion in relation to the amount of the essential repairs.</P>

      <P>I shall finish now.  I would suggest to the Minister that the <Col N="412" /> essential repairs grant scheme should be expanded to include the provision of sanitary facilities.  The building industry is going through a severe recession at present with thousands of building workers unemployed.  A revision of the housing grants scheme would result in increased activity in the building industry and would generate employment for many of the small building contractors and workers who are unemployed.  For those reasons I would ask the House to accept the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few brief points in favour of the amendment.  It has taken a measure of temerity on the part of Opposition Senators to introduce this motion.  The point has been made before, and I wish to make it again, that in 1980 the Fianna Fáil Government abolished all house reconstruction grants.  That was a major retrograde step.  For the previous 64 years, in the history of our independence throughout more bad times than good times the State was able to afford house reconstruction grants.  That retrograde step was taken by Fianna Fáil.  It would appear it was taken as part of Deputy Haughey's seeing of the light when he became Taoiseach late in 1979. We might argue that he was not seeing very much light when he initiated that measure.  His sight of that light did not seem to continue for very long, but that is another point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was particularly regrettable that the grants should have been abolished at that time when there was massive interest in the scheme.  I do not have the exact figures of the number of applications that were coming in for 1979 but, up to that time, they had been at an all time high. We might look at the relevant figures given by the Minister in his speech a fortnight ago.  At that time there was a total of 38,000 houses in the State that had no water supply at all.  There were a further 49,000 houses that had an external water supply only.  There were 43,000 houses that had external sewerage facilities only; that is in addition to the figures I have already given for water supply.  I take it that external sewerage facilities <Col N="413" /> meant something like only having an outside toilet.  In addition to this there was a further 98,000 houses that lacked any sewerage facility or connection of any type.  That was the situation in 1979 when those grants were abolished.  Those figures speak very eloquently for the retention of the grants.</P>
    <P>The first Coalition assuming office in 1981 reintroduced the grants very quickly, it having been an election promise in October 1981.  No scheme is absolutely perfect.  But that scheme was particularly imaginative in that it gave grant aid for a whole range of categories of house improvements a householder might want to carry out.  There was the £600 grant for the provision of an extra bedroom where the need arose on account of family size or whatever, a separate grant for the provision of water, a separate grant for the provision of sewerage, a grant for the provision of a chimney where a chimney did not exist. That existed in many cases because of the rather foolish, almost asinine, policy which was pursued in the 1960s &mdash; when we had cheap oil &mdash; of building houses without any chimney at all.</P>
    <P>This scheme has the inbuilt flexibility of allowing householders to use it in a phased way if, say, a household budget only allowed it to be done that way.  For economic reasons a person might be able to construct only a bathroom this year, an extra bedroom the following year and so on.  This scheme provides that within a three-year period a householder can undertake a major reconstruction of his or her house.  That kind of flexibility did not exist in the previous scheme.  That is another reason why I describe it as being imaginative.</P>
    <P>The maximum amount of money available for the whole range of improvements that one can carry out under the present reconstruction grants scheme is £2,400.  I would love to see it increased, to see it doubled, but I recognise the financial constraints within which the Government have to operate.  We agree about its inadequacies but, in real terms, it is greater than anything offered before.  Because of the recession in the building industry <Col N="414" /> house prices have not greatly increased. In real terms therefore the grant can buy almost as much today as it did in 1983. The regrettable aspect is that very often a recession leads to a freezing of prices and very often a downward trend in prices.  But houses can be built today for as much, or as little &mdash; depending on how one views it &mdash; as they could be built in 1982 and 1983.  A house costing £25,000 in 1983 can be built for around the same sum of money today.  The same thing goes for reconstruction.  Therefore one can argue that the grant assistance given then has almost held its value to date.</P>
    <P>Speakers on the Opposition side have made great play of the recession in the building industry.  Undoubtedly there is a major recession in the industry, but things are not that bad.  I reinforce that argument by putting forward these figures.  If we take just the house reconstruction grant applications, 700 extra grants were paid out in 1984 as opposed to 1983.  Eleven thousand, five hundred grants were approved and paid out in 1983 and in 1984, 12,200, an increase of 700.  All the indications show that there will be a 20 per cent increase in 1985 because it is expected that the number of applications approved and grant-aided by the end of this financial year will be in excess of 15,000.  I submit that that is as a result of a growth in the building industry and a lifting of the recession as it affects that industry.  One must compliment the Government on having provided the extra resources to provide in excess of an extra 3,000 reconstruction grants this year as opposed to last year.</P>
    <P>In the new house area things are not that bad.  For the years 1983 and 1984 the number of house grants approved was somewhere in the region of 11,500 over each year.  Granted there was no growth in grants between 1983 and 1984; possibly there was a slight decline.  By the end of this year there may be 12,000 new house grants paid from State funds.  That indicates an improvement in the situation.  In addition to this the Government have by their anti-inflationary measures effected a major impact on the house mortgage situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> Since we took office a householder with a loan of £20,000 will have saved £90 per month on his mortgage repayments.  That is an incentive to the building industry and to a person buying or building a house.  A £20,000 loan might be taken as the average.  The saving to such a householder is something of the order of £70 per month, constituting another major contribution toward an improvement in the building industry.  These measures have emanated directly as a result of courageous policies pursued by the Government.  What we got in 1983 and 1984 were the knock-on effects of high inflation coming to us from 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1981.  These things take a long time to filter through to the ordinary builder or consumer.  Much of the then recession was occasioned by the enormous cost of mortgages, of money borrowed from banks, building societies and so on.  Happily, as a result of our measures, the trend now is very much in the other direction.</P>
    <P>There is also the other measure we introduced and announced in the national plan, that is, the incentive to local authority tenants to vacate their houses and return them to the national pool of local authority houses.  People participating in that scheme are given an extra £5,000 to build or buy a new house.  There is another major fillip given by the Government to the building industry.  Of course that will have its effect next year, the year after and, no doubt, is having its effect this year.</P>
    <P>I would agree with many of the speakers across the House in regard to the inflexibility of the rules for reconstruction grants.  We are all public representatives. We have all had dozens of people come to us who genuinely were caught by starting their house improvement works without having the prior approval of the Department's inspector.  I would submit to the Minister that most people who were caught in that situation were caught for genuine reasons.  The tradition was that one could proceed with one's work and then inform the Department, fill out one's application, when it would be <Col N="416" /> accepted.  The precedent applies to date even in respect of new houses.  One can build a new house and live in it for almost a year before one needs to apply for a new house grant.  That is the kind of thing that leads many people into making the mistake of not applying for their reconstruction grant in time.  Like my colleague, Senator Mullooly, I can agree with the principle of the need for a prior inspection.  But I would suggest that in cases where planning permission has been sought &mdash; the first thing most people know they have to do &mdash; a local authority engineer visits the site, and sees the house, its shape and size before any work is undertaken.  A certificate from such an official or engineer should be accepted as proof that the work described by the applicant in his application form is the work that has been undertaken.  That is reasonable and I would ask the Minister to take it on board.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in supporting the amendment to the motion.  I am proud of a Government that have done so much in the past three years to assist the building industry, which we found, on assuming office, to be in the very depths of a deep recession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the motion calling on the Minister for the Environment to revise, as a matter of urgency, the house improvements grant scheme.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this.  There appears to be some misunderstanding in connection with the number of applications.  Senator Connor mentioned the number of people who received grants.  That was not accurate. Here I might quote from what the Minister for the Environment had to say in this House, as reported in the Offical Report, volume 109.  No. 3 at column 313:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the real test of any house improvement grants scheme is the level of response generally by the public.  In the case of the present scheme total applications received amounted to 11,500 in 1983 and increased further to just under 12,200 in 1984.  Further growth is taking place this year and the <Col N="417" /> indications are that applications this year will exceed 15,000.  It is heartening to be able to put on record this increased interest in the scheme, especially as in my view it illustrates the relevance of the scheme to people's needs.  As is the case with most schemes of this nature, there is always scope for review; but in the present circumstances the cost factor, as Members will appreciate, must be of vital consideration, especially when the Exchequer is also providing about £50 million overall in housing grants and mortgage subsidy.</P>
    <P>These were the applications, of course, that were submitted.  But there is no indication from the Minister or the Minister of State present what has been paid out. My difficulty &mdash; something mentioned here by several speakers &mdash; is how to go about getting a grant.  First one must await the arrival of an inspector once one's application is received in Dublin.  It is then sent to the local engineer.  It takes weeks, months and in some cases years in my area before an engineer appears on site or any inspection takes place.  I have evidence to prove this.  In some cases over 12 months have elapsed before an engineer arrives on the site.  Until he issues his approval indicating on paper that a grant is available, there is no way one can start building to qualify for a grant.</P>

      <P>I am quoting from the Minister's figures.  I understand there was much criticism of the termination of the grants during our time in office.  That was a tidying-up operation.  It was necessary to tidy up the reconstruction grants at that point.  A new scheme was in the <Col N="418" /> offing but then we did not remain long enough in Government to implement it. In 1975, when the Coalition were in Government they paid £2.4 million.  In 1976 they paid £2.8 million which figure reverted to £2.4 million in 1977.  That was during the three years of Coalition Government.  In 1978 the figures rose to £6.4 million and continued to rise to £16 million in 1979 and to £18.5 million in 1980.  In 1981 the relevant figure was £19.4 million.  Therefore in the three Coalition years there was a drop from £19.4 million in 1981 to only £4.4 million paid in 1982.  That was a drop of £12 million.  In 1983 it fluctuated again to £6.4 million and in 1984 to £6.7 million.  The graph from 1975 to 1977 and from 1982 to 1984 indicates that in our term of office we gave substantial grants for reconstruction purposes and the building of new houses.  The kernel here is the attractiveness of the grant and there is a need and urgency for reconstruction because we have roughly 250,000 houses over 60 years old, one-quarter of our housing stock.  It is clear that a substantial house improvement grant must be made available to maintain and to reconstruct the 250,000 houses where necessary.  If the grant is left at the same level as it has been over the last three years &mdash; if inflation has not hit Roscommon it definitely has hit the rest of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There was an increase of 5 per cent in VAT on materials.  The Minister for the Environment increased new house grants from £1,000 to £2,000 when that was introduced, but there was no question of increasing grants for <Col N="419" /> reconstruction, essential repairs, the disability grant or any of these grants.</P>

The cheapest method of providing housing is to ensure that the existing stock is kept at a very high level of reconstruction and that new stock is of the highest possible reconstruction standards.  The recurring expenditure will be kept to the minimum if one builds a good, solid type house that will stand the test of time.  The recurring maintenance on a good type conventional house will stand the test of time but that can be achieved only by giving reasonable grants to people who wish to choose their own sites and to build houses of their own design in their own locations.  Any encouragement that can be given should be given to these family units, whether by loan or by grant and one way of relieving pressure on the Government would be by the provision of houses by local authorities. If applicants were given a substantial grant, they would go about their own business and build their own houses.  That is what we must encourage and the standard will be very high because they will ensure that they get the best work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more houses that are built and the bigger the stock of houses, the greater will be the number of houses, coming on stream for maintenance and if we continue to increase our housing &mdash; we have a good record for providing new houses &mdash; the maintenance and reconstruction grants must also be increased.  That has not been done.  As 250,000 of them are over 60 years old we should provide a fairly substantial grant with the minimum amount of harassment to the applicant. Contractors or handymen have to be booked to do the reconstruction and it is not easy to engage them as soon as the engineer decides to approve the project. It is unfair of the Department to reject people who have not even started digging their foundation but who have merely had excavation work done.  I know of several cases of shortsighted decisions by <Col N="420" /> engineers on sites.  It is very unjust that genuine people who wished to go ahead with building had to stop because they had not sufficient finances to go ahead.</P>
    <P>There is positive proof from the applications that there is need for review.  I am asking the Minister to match that with the introduction of a new scheme to show the need for grants to be paid and which would also indicate the sincerity of the Government in tackling the problem. The building industry is in a critical condition and many of the firms who supply building materials, furniture and so on, are no longer in a position to give employment. New houses are not being built and for that reason I ask the Minister to review existing grants.  I do not want to be parrot-like talking about £200 for water and £200 for sewerage; it is only a pittance today.  It would not be a down payment to any supplier for the amount of equipment that is needed for the installation of water and sewerage and indeed might not be accepted for the installation of water and sewerage.  Nobody could build an extra room for £600; that is no incentive to reconstruct the windows and doors in any house at present day prices.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister in his wisdom &mdash; I know he is caught financially &mdash; to review the whole system as soon as possible. People by their applications have indicated that they are willing to take on the job if sufficient finances are provided for them.  I appeal to the Minister to put this in train right away, taking into account the cost of material and to cut out the red tape involved in trying to secure a grant for reconstruction or installation of water and sewerage facilities.</P>
    <P>In case anybody might misinterpret me, I know there are islands off the coast that have not seen an engineer and may not see him next year if the weather is not fine.  There should not be any discontinuation of grants.  People have been waiting and have experienced hardship trying to carry materials to the islands. They need to plan ahead more than the people on the mainland and I appeal to the Minister to give special consideration <Col N="421" /> to people living on islands.  I also appeal to him to give increased grants and to ensure that engineers visit the islands, carry out inspections and give the go-ahead to the applicants.  There is a large stock of old houses on many of these islands which are in need of repair.  I would ask the Minister to give special <Col N="422" /> consideration to island dwellers off our coasts who have more than double the hardship of people living on the mainland. The Minister must review the situation and grants must be increased.</P>
