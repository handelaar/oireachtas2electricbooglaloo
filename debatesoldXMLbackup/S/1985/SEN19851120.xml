      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Lynch that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The deteriorating conditions of the Garda barracks in Oldcastle, County Meath, and the need to have the necessary renovation carried out as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>
      <P>I do not think we will have any more problems from Oldcastle after that.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order for today Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and I might indicate that it is proposed that the House should sit tommorrow in order to take Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 7.  In view of the fact that it is proposed to devote the whole time next week to the dicussion on the Anglo-Irish Agreement that was signed at Hillsborough last week, it would be inappropriate to start on item No. 2 unless it is reached before 4.30 p.m. today, because otherwise we would have a half an hour or three quarters of an hour of a discussion and then an adjournment for a fortnight.  If, as I anticipate, there are sufficient speakers, most of the afternoon will be taken up with the discussion of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill.  In that connection I <Col N="3" /> would indicate that, in view of the nature of the Bill, it would be hoped that the Committee Stage could be taken as well as the Second Stage since there are very few net points to be taken on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Yes, I would like to assure Senator Lynch that the intention is to take a single debate on Nos. 6 and 7.  Also it is proposed to suspend the sitting from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  However, if No. 1 concludes any time between 4.30 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. the proposal would be to adjourn then at the conclusion of No. 1.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a brief contribution to welcome this Bill. It has positive and negative aspects but the positive aspects far outweigh the negative ones.  We should concentrate on the positive aspects.  Traditionally we have had a long relationship with Spain and Portugal as regards culture, religion, trade and in many other ways.  It is only proper that we should welcome the accession of Spain and Portugal on 1 January 1986 to the European Communities. In the other House the Minister was congratulated on his work in helping to bring about these arrangements.  It is proper that I, too, should acknowledge the hard work done by the Minister in arriving at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when he spoke in this House on 26 June this year, gave a very good summary of the historical background of the EC.  He pointed out that the Treaty of Rome, on which the Community is based, is largely concerned with <Col N="4" /> economic, commercial and related matters. He said much of the impulse towards this unity was based on economic reasons.  This is as true today as it was then.  He emphasised that from the outset the founding fathers of the Community were motivated by aspirations that went beyond purely economic or social matters. It is only logical that the accession of the Iberian peninsula would be a consequence of this motivation.  It is right and proper that this enlargement should come about.  Any body must be a living, growing organisation rather than remaining static.  In addition to ideological and cultural aspects the physical enlargement of the Community is most important.  The Taoiseach also on that occasion spoke about the financial aid we received from the Community.  He said that over the period since our accession the accumulated net inflow of non-repayable moneys is £3.8 billion, which, expressed in 1985 money terms, amounts to no less than £6.8 billion.  That is a considerable amount of money.  There are those who say that we could have benefited more. Like other Members I do not believe in the begging bowl syndrome or the béal bocht.  We are getting what we are entitled to.  It would be wrong if, because of some inaction on our part, we did not benefit as much as we should.  It has been stated by many people who are more knowledgeable in this area than I that we have not benefited as much as we should from the Regional Fund.  We have not been able to take advantage of all the finance that is available because, apparently, the State finds it is unable to put up moneys to match the finance available from the EC.</P>
    <P>Looking at the positive aspects of the accession, the EC will in the new year have 12 member states.  I understand that the population of Spain and Portugal is around 60 million so that the population of the Community as a trading unit will be in the region of 300 million, which gives great scope in many areas.  Spain will have 60 seats and Portugal will have 24 seats in the European Parliament.  The numbers of members of the Commission will be increased from 14 to 17 to include <Col N="5" /> two Spanish nationals and one Portuguese. Spain's vote within the Council will be weighted at eight and Portugal's at five bringing the total of weighted votes in the council to 76 instead of the present 63.  I do not think I should go into much detail in this regard because the Minister has covered all of these areas in his speech.  I found the note for information of Senators very helpful.  Indeed, one could quote from it and use it for a considerable amount of time, but most of the details have already been referred to.</P>
    <P>One of the areas that we are rightly very concerned about is agriculture, because it is very vulnerable area and it is the area which is of primary importance as far as this country is concerned. Also under this heading we must consider horticulture, which is not developed here at this time to the extent that it should.  I feel that perhaps with the accession of Spain and Portugal more scope will be given to us in this regard.</P>
    <P>The accession period extends for seven years in general.  I believe in the agricultural sector it extends over ten years. There will be a monitoring system for products.  As Members have stated previously the CAP should not be interfered with because I think it came under considerable pressure.  It has been of enormous benefit to this country and it is in our interest to make sure that there is no interference or watering down in this area.  As far as this country is concerned, farmers and the outlets for farmers are of great importance.  When I speak of farmers I also want to mention farm labourers.  I have worked as a farm labourer. I feel this is a section that has been, by and large, neglected or not given the credit that it should have been.  In the area of farming, as I have said before, there is no such thing as an unskilled labourer.  Every aspect of farming requires great skills.  This is an area with which we are primarily concerned and which we hope will not be interfered with by the enlargement of the Community.</P>
    <P>Tourism is another area which has not been developed to the extent that it should be.  We have a relatively short tourism season from the point of view <Col N="6" /> of climate.  Indoor activities and indoor sports are not catered for in the tourism area to the extent that they should be on account of our indifferent weather.  To take advantage of the possibilities which will be open to us because of this enlargement grants should be made available on a generous scale to ensure that no opportunity is lost for the provision of these amenities.</P>
    <P>Fisheries is another area about which we are greatly concerned and which means quite a lot to this country.  We are an island country and one would have thought that, being an island country, we would have developed our fisheries on a greater scale.  The integration of Spain and Portugal over the period of accession will be geared to expiry of the present policy in the year 2002 which seems reasonable enough until we consider the details.  The Spanish fleet is composed of approximately 17,500 vessels with a capacity of 75,000 tons and our equivalent is only 1,600 vessels with a capacity of 3,600 tons.  The Spanish fleet will represent 75 per cent of the entire EC fleet. This is staggering &mdash; with the accession of Spain and Portugal the Spanish fleet will amount to 75 per cent of the entire EC fleet.  I believe they could deploy 500 vessels to fish in our area and those ships are powered by engines displacing 700 horse power.  Our equivalent would be 20 horse power at maximum and normally around 15 or 16.  Having regard to the fact that Spanish ships have on very many occasions been responsible for breaking the regulations and fishing within waters that were out of bounds to them, I sincerely hope that with the accession and the implementation of the full arrangements adequate steps will be taken to supervise the vessels and ensure that there will be no interference with our rights inside the agreed limits.</P>
    <P>Forestry is another area which we must consider with this accession.  I believe Portugal is the only country, and will be the only country, in the EC which will have a surplus for export, so that it is not going to interfere with our plans.  We covered this matter of forestry last week in great detail and I do not think there is <Col N="7" /> any necessity to go into it any further, simply to say it is most important for the country and that I welcome the loan of £29 million which was announced last weekend from the EC towards the development of forestry here.  It is something we must all welcome.  We went, in great detail, into the areas where progress could be made and should have been made in forestry.  Even though this may overall be an insignificant amount, nevertheless it does help.  Any help in this area, from whatever source it comes, must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the movement called Move the Mountain which at present is trying to get some of the food surplus in the EC to be used in Third World countires.  Perhaps with the accession of Spain and Portugal in the new year this surplus will increase.  While I understand and those who are organising this campaign understand the problems about using this surplus in the Third World countries, nevertheless it is something with which we should all be generally in agreement because it is unbelievable and it is unacceptable that in this day and age we have this surplus and people are dying yearly by the million.  It seems morally wrong that so much money is being spent on star wars, defence and offence and that sufficient money cannot be used for the advantage of those countries who up until now have been exploited.  The situation is that they have been exploited by the wealthy countries. It is time some amends were made. We would all urge that something should be done about utilisation of this surplus of food for the underdeveloped and starving Third World countries.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is something that may not be improved with the accession of Spain and Portugal.  Unfortunately, since we joined the EEC things have disimproved.  In 1973 there were 2.5 million unemployed in the Community. Now this has risen to 14 million or will be 14 million on 1 January 1986 according to the forecasts.  There are three million Spaniards unemployed and half a million <Col N="8" /> Portuguese.  These will add to the problem. As the time of accession Ireland had 65,000 unemployed.  Today that is 240,000, not taking into consideration the considerable number of people who have emigrated.  Technology has to some extent been responsible for this state of affairs.  The development of technology has lessened the opportunities in the employment area.  With the accession of Spain and Portugal more progress might perhaps be made here in the area of technology.</P>
    <P>During 1984 Irish contractors from the private, public and the higher education sectors, assisted by the National Board for Science and Technology, secured project approvals to the value of £8 million. There are many people who feel that, having regard to our low base and having regard to the leeway that has to be made up by us, much more could be done in this area.  I would urge that greater advantage should be taken of the research and development programmes with the accession of Spain and Portugal and with the enlargement of this Community to 300 million.  There are many areas that we could develop but they have already been covered.  The accession of Spain and Portugal seems a logical sequence in the development of the EC.  As I said, there are positive and negative aspects, but the positive aspects far outweigh the negative ones.  As a people who had a continuing relationship with Spain and Portugal in all the areas that I mentioned, I think it is only fair, proper and right that we should concentrate on the positive aspects and welcome the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make a brief intervention in this debate.  At the beginning of the debate Senator McDonald welcomed the Bill, welcomed the accession of Spain and Portugal on behalf of the Fine Gael group, but in view of my interest in things European I thought it as well that I should speak in case anyone would misinterpret my failure to do so as indicating that I was in any way lukewarm <Col N="9" /> in regard to this development in the history of the Community or had any reservations in regard to the conditions of the accession itself.</P>
      <P>I intend my intervention to be brief because I think many of the salient points, all of the points that really need to be considered by this House of the Oireachtas in agreeing to this Bill, have already been touched on in the debate.  I would like, as Senator Fitzsimons has done, to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the very informative introductory speech which he made in connection with this Bill.  He covered the ground, the negotiations, the long six year history of the negotiations between the Community and Spain and Portugal and he described clearly the situation which will exist following the accession on 1 January next.  I would like indeed not only to congratulate the Minister on this but to be somewhat more general.  I think I speak for all Senators when I say that I think the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs both show this House a good deal of honour in the thoroughness with which they prepare their material when coming into the House, by the assiduous way in which they attend debates and listen to these debates.  The fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is not here this afternoon is because he is heavily engaged in another place but also because it was thought appropriate that since fisheries had loomed largely in the debate the replies to the Second Stage debate on behalf of the Government should be given by the Minister responsible for Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at what is happening now we are, of course, passing into a new phase of Community action, passing into a new stage of the history of our European Community.  It is always dangerous to use metaphors in this sense but I think we can say that with the accession of Spain and Portugal we will be coming to the end of Act II &mdash; I do not know whether it is a drama or an opera &mdash; but with the accession of two more southern European countries it <Col N="10" /> probably will be more in the nature of an opera than a drama from now on.  In what we might call Act I we had a prolonged overture.  We had, from the end of the Second World War, a number of moves, a number of attempts to move to European Union in one form or other.  In 1948 we had the establishment of the Council of Europe and the establishment of the OEC, later to become the OECD.  This was rather in the nature of an overture.</P>
    <P>We had in Act I the original Community of the Six.  We had very extensive development during that phase, a movement towards a common market and a movement towards the development of common aims and common objectives outside the strict limits of the Treaty itself. Then we ourselves did not appear except in the form of the noises off in this Act I.  Then we had Act II when we had the Community moving from a Community of Six to a Community of Nine, then to a Community of Ten, now to become a Community of Twelve.  The stage we are reaching now is something that is a culmination of a development of 40 years.</P>
    <P>While there may be a tendency on the one hand, to say perhaps this is the limit of expansion; on the other hand, there may be a tendency to look around and ask who is going to be next?  This was touched on by Senator McDonald.  What will happen as we go into the third Act. And we do not know how many more acts there are to be.  I think we have not seen the end of the expansion of the Community but neither do I anticipate that any further expansion will occur for some time.  We are talking now about the end of a development that stretches back over 40 years.  Who could possibly predict what will be the developments in Europe over the next 40 years, even over the next 20 years?  If we attempted to prophecy even for a decade, I think we would be liable to get a number of things wrong. For me, as somebody who believes in a Europe that is not merely a Europe of the Ten or the Twelve, there must be the hope that in 20 years' time the situation of Europe and the world will be so transformed that we will be able to look not <Col N="11" /> merely to the countries that are our colleagues in the Council of Europe or in the OECD but not in the Community, but, I would hope, across the divide that cuts historic Europe in two.</P>
    <P>After all, we look back to the beginning of this process.  We look back to the discussion at the time of Marshall Aid and the formation of the OEC, in connection with the administration of that aid.  For a long time it looked as if Poland and Czechoslovakia might be part of that process until the imperial edict came forth which prevented them from so being. We cannot tell what will be the further development.  All we can do is look to the immediate consequences of the change brought about by the Treaty of last June which we are incorporating in our domestic legislation.</P>
    <P>There are going to be difficulties following this expansion.  There was a considerable degree of difficulty which persisted following the expansion of Europe from six members to nine and some additional difficulty in the expansion from nine to ten.  These difficulties will make even more urgent the necessity that the structures and the institutional arrangements of the Community should be reformed without delay because they have proved inadequate for the Europe of the Nine and the Ten; they probably would, at this stage, have been inadequate even if Europe had remained a Europe of the Six.  They certainly will be inadequate in a Community of Twelve. However, what we must realise is, while we must take account of these increased difficulties and must learn to cope with them, that the accession of Spain and Portugal increases greatly the potentiality of the European Community, potentiality to benefit all its members through co-operation.  We should not be afraid of the challenge that faces us in giving a realisation to that potentiality. Europe will be strengthened fundamentally by the accession of Spain and Portuagal and the greater strength that Europe will have when it becomes a Europe of the Twelve makes it well worthwhile to face the difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="12" /> There will be particular difficulties for this country.  It is only right that these should be discussed during this debate. There will be problems for our fisheries, for agriculture and to a lesser extent problems for our industry.  I think it is only proper that the Minister here today should be congratulated on what he managed to achieve during the fishery negotiations. Of course, he did not achieve everything we would have liked him to achieve; he did not achieve everything he would have liked to achieve himself, but negotiations are negotiations.  In getting the essential recognition for the Irish box, I think he achieved something which many of us would hardly have hoped for at certain stages in these negotiations. No sense of disappointment that more was not obtained should be allowed to cloud this very substantial achievement that was made.  The Minister, in replying to the debate, will be able to answer in detail the particular comments that were raised.  I only want in my contribution to congratulate him on a job well done.</P>
    <P>There will be difficulties in regard to agriculture because the balance of agriculture within the Community will be substantially changed as a result of the accession of Spain and Portugal.  Following expansion Mediterranean agriculture will loom very much larger in the Common Agriculture Policy and we will find that it will not be only dairy products and meat that will be at the heart of the annual price review but olive oil and fruit will be in there to an extent they never were before.  The concentration of Mediterranean agriculture now in the Community will, in regard to the products of northern European agriculture, create a much more difficult task for our negotiators. This task will be rendered even more difficult because most of the countries of the Community that will be concerned with these northern products do not have the same structure in agriculture that we have.  A number of them will be looking at these products from the point of view of agri-business, from the point of view of a type of factory farming unknown to us in Ireland to any extent <Col N="13" /> and it will be difficult to defend the very legitimate interests of family farming in the northern European agricultural products context.</P>
    <P>I am heartened to a great extent by the degree to which our agricultural organisations have approached the problem of the changing nature of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We have been well served by our national farming organisations by the extent to which they have kept in touch to a remarkable degree, not merely with day to day developments in regard to agriculture in Europe but in regard to likely developments to come. They have anticipated the trend; they have been ready for the changes; and it is only fair to say that in many respects they have shown a degree of forward-planning in this regard which has not been echoed to the same extent by the national organisations on the industrial side, with a few exceptions.</P>
    <P>There will be difficulties for Europe in the new, enlarged Community.  There will be difficulties for Ireland in the new, enlarged Community; but it will be a Community.  As has emerged from this debate, most people are worried about the fisheries problem.  They are worried that the difficulties we have had with sections of the Spanish fishing fleet will be intensified after enlargement of the Community.  But these will be problems that can be brought up within a Community context.  As I have said many times in this House, the importance for a small open economy like ourselves of the existence of the European Community is that we who would be powerless in the jungle of international competition are protected under the rules of the Community because there are rules and because there is a referee.  While there may be difficulties in regard to the depredations of certain sections of the Spanish fleet, I believe the Minister will find these easier to handle within the Community than hitherto when Spain was not a member of the Community.</P>
    <P>Finally, in all the negotiations in regard to the accession of Spain and Portugal there has been a remarkable degree of <Col N="14" /> understanding on behalf of our negotiators regarding the problems of Spain and Portugal.  On the other hand, there has been quite a remarkable degree of understanding on the part of the reprepresentatives of Spain and Portugal on the particular problems of Ireland.  This may well be a reflection of the fact that for many, many years there has been a resident Irish Ambassador both in Madrid and Lisbon and that there have been resident Spanish and Portuguese Ambassadors here in Dublin.  The interests of all three countries have been well served by, not only this level of diplomatic representation, but by those who have served.  We have been particularly lucky that the Ambassadors of Spain and Portugal who have served here in recent years have been men of ability and understanding who did a great deal to promote understanding between our countries, an understanding that will serve us well when we become colleagues after 1 January.</P>
    <P>I give my full support to this Bill.  I welcome heartily the entry of Spain and Portugal into our Community and I am confident, not that there will be no problems between us as Community members, but that these problems will be overcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>We all would hope that the accession of Spain and Portugal will make an important impact on the Community generally.  We all know Spain and Portugal are famous for their very warm climate, a place in the sun perhaps for a holiday.  Spain is also famous for its bull fighting.  In the sporting area we are aware of Real Madrid and Benfica and last year we can recall our own John Treacy being beaten in the marathon by the famous Portuguese runner, Carlos Lopez.  These are things we readily know about Spain and Portugal but we must now look at them in a very different context.  We must have a more aggressive attitude towards them if you like, because in many ways they will be our competitors and, therefore, we must look on them with a different attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Spain and Portugal are becoming <Col N="15" /> members of the Community at a very critical time.  It is a time of very high unemployment in the Community; it is a time of world recession, and it is true to say that non-EC countries such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Austria and Switzerland have come through the recent world recession in a much healtheir state than the countries who are members of the EC.  A comparison on this aspect of the debate is well worth considering at this point.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure recently of being on a private visit to Switzerland to attend the Ireland <i>versus</i> Switzerland game in the World Cup, and naturally I was looking at the scene in Switzerland with great interest.  I accept that in many respects Switzerland and Ireland are different but many people to whom I spoke in hotels, restaurants, pubs and in various businesses certainly led me to believe that Switzerland will not be one of the countries to become members of a further enlarged EC.  What I saw was a happy people, a leisurely people, a wealthy people whose level of unemployment is less that 1 per cent.  Inflation is at a very low rate.  The good jobs were there for the Swiss and the less attractive jobs were there for perhaps the Yugoslavs and people from other countries.  So when we talk about an enlarged Community, if ever that happens, I believe Switzerland will be very slow to participate in it.</P>
    <P>When we talk about this scene many people will ask: &ldquo;Would we be better off out of the EC?&rdquo; I am sure this has been asked of everybody in this Chamber from time to time.  But I think whatever disadvantages there are in being in the EC we would be worse off if we were on our own.  So we must ask at this point where the Community is going and where an enlarged Community is going?  What have been the failures and can we learn from these failures?  Is this the time for a new Treaty?  How has the EC progressed along the road to achieving the fundamental aims of the Community?  Is it time for a reappraisal of the importance of the EC?</P>
    <P>When we talk of the EC, I think in the <Col N="16" /> main we talk about three particular areas. One is the Social Fund, and we know that we are doing reasonably well from that fund.  That would be my own opinion because I see that many young people are getting an education from the money available from the European Social Fund; there are many retraining and training programmes.  Perhaps we could do better but nonetheless it is something about which I am not too unhappy.  Obviously the most important area for all of us is the Common Agricultural Policy and the Fisheries Policy.  We know that in the years from the beginning of the EC the farming community had very good days. The Common Agricultural Policy served this country well in the early days.  Now, it is true to say that this situation is in some way under threat.  We are told that farmers' income will be reduced over the next five years by up to 20 per cent.  I think that we must protect, in so far as we can, the interests generally of the entire agricultural community.</P>
    <P>For the Irish farmer a more serious threat is lurking in the suggestion or proposal to dismantle the existing price support systems.  This is a threat to the future of Irish agriculture at a time when the economic recession and widespread unemployment are making it necessary to retain as many people as possible in agricultural employment.  In my opinion we should certainly endeavour to resist more effectively and with greater effort the implementation of policies which would be a major setback to our economy.</P>
    <P>As we know Spain and Portugal are agricultural countries.  Their projects will not be, as it were, in direct competition with the Irish farmer, theirs being concerned with citrus fruits and the wine industry and ours being dairy produce and beef production.  At least we should say that we have Spain and Portugal as potential customers and that, hopefully, they will take our produce.  We should welcome them and encourage them and do all we can to request them to deal with us for our farming produce.  Having said that, I should sound a note of caution perhaps because it is very much a fact of <Col N="17" /> life that in a situation like this the stronger nations tend to do better than the smaller countries for obvious reasons.</P>
    <P>As far as our fishing industry is concerned &mdash; and I confess I would not be the best judge in the world of that and I am glad that the Minister for Fisheries is present for this aspect of the debate &mdash; from what I know, it is something that we will have to watch and show our concern about.  We will have to become very carefull about this and at times be the watchdog for our fishermen.  We know that one of the main conditions of this accession is that for the first ten years from 1986 to 1996 Spanish vessels will not be allowed within a 50 mile zone of the Irish coast. This might sound sufficient on paper but we know that a regular feature of life is a number of Spanish vessels being arrested around our coasts.  Over 100 Spanish vessels were brought to Irish ports for breach of a previous agreement and in the knowledge that we have some 1,500 vessels and in the knowledge that the Spanish have 17,000 vessels, obviously it is an area in which we must show our concern and our extreme caution and be very careful that our fishermen are not losing out.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Regional Fund.  I happened to be at a meeting yesterday in Roscommon of the General Council of County Councils, the regional grouping, and much concern was expressed regarding the Regional Fund and how the roads of Ireland and so on were being neglected, particularly in the west of Ireland.  This particular region includes Clare, Roscommon, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Longford, Westmeath.  Many of the Members expressed their concern. They felt that we should be tackling the Regional Fund in a much more dynamic way to ensure more finance for that particular region.  The very fact that Spain and Portugal are now coming into the EC means that the population of the weakest regions will practically be doubled.  We are now bringing into the Community a vast area with a <i>per capita</i> income which is the lowest of the poorest regions of the existing Community.  This, obviously, will put increased demands on the regional policy, which will be some way <Col N="18" /> detrimental to the Irish case.  It will, effectively, reduce our share of the Regional Fund.  Obviously, we have to guard against this.</P>
    <P>With the accession of Spain and Portugal, the whole question of regional policy brings new problems.  As we know, up to now the arrangement was for the Government to send a list of particular projects to Brussels.  In time, money was paid to the national Exchequer.  It has been suggested many times that Governments over the years, in some way or other, have regarded the European Regional Fund as a source of revenue rather than for development of the particular region.  An enlarged Common Market, as we know now, with an extra 50 million people, will certainly put extra demands on this country.  Regrettably, from our point of view, the larger powers tend to do better in this situation.  I have no doubt that Germany, France, and Britain will be endeavouring to secure the greatest benefits for themselves.  They are large and have a greater capacity to exploit new markets.  In my opinion they will almost certainly exploit the two new markets to the very best advantage for their own economies.</P>
    <P>However, these are the problems that have been expressed right across the board.  The previous speaker, Senator Dooge, referred to them.  I agree that there will be difficulties for Europe and for Ireland.  We have a duty to support our Government in order to ensure in an enlarged Community that we, in this country, will receive our fair share of whatever gains are to be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief on this Bill. It would be remiss of me not to welcome the Bill which provides for the accession of Spain and Portugal.  This Bill actually amends the European Communities Act of 1972, and will bring into effect the accession of our two neighbours.  We have been in very close contact with Spain and Portugal during the period of discussions and have much in common with these two countries.  They are both now infant democracies.  I am proud of the part that the socialist groups played in <Col N="19" /> bringing about a democratic process in both countries.  This year, coincidentally, is the tenth anniversary of the death of Franco.  If he were still in control of Spain, there is no doubt in my mind that he would not be looking for accession to the European Community.  He would want to be dictating his own philosophy on that great peninsula as he did for four decades before that.  It is vital that two countries which have achieved the status that they now have internationally should apply to be active members of the Community.</P>
      <P>I know that Ireland, small as she may be, is influential in many areas.  We were part of the procedure that led up to the actual Treaty which gave effect to the accession of Spain and Portugal.  In the debate at the time of our accession Ireland fought for the principle of membership. Such membership ensured new markets and guaranteed prices for our products, which is enshrined in the CAP. We can only welcome the fact that other nations who aspire to the same ideals are following the same road.  Having brought our plans to fruition we now have to look at our position as existing members of the Community and see what the consequences will be, particularly, when we realise that we are net beneficiaries from the Community and particularly from the CAP.  We anticipate that Spain and Portugal will also want to benefit from CAP, even though in respect of different products.</P>
      <P>Most of our benefits can be confined to areas like the CAP and the benefits from the Social and Regional Funds. These benefits were achieved at a major price, as we all know, because of the consequences on our existing industries. We entered a vastly advanced technological Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits of joining that we have enjoyed in some areas were certainly offset in other areas.  I am wondering if, in fact, anybody has whispered in the ears of Spain and Portugal that all is not going to be rosy when they join the Community, as we have found to our cost. <Col N="20" /> Things continually change.  They sometimes change for the better.  We have had to fight every inch of the way as a member of the Community to try to ensure that, as a nation on the periphery &mdash; as Spain and Portugal will also be because of their peninsular position &mdash; and as an island, we would benefit from our accession to a central power bloc.  The consequences for Spain and Portugal are likely to be significant.</P>
    <P>I am wondering if there is any necessity to whisper in their ears that all will not be rosy?  Many of us would have liked to increase the Community because of the solidarity that a common policy in marketing can bring and the opening up of a common policy which creates additional markets.  We have to look at the positive side of the accession of such a large area as the Iberian peninsula.  A large, increased population will provide a challenge to our marketing, and particularly as we are major exporters of agricultural products.  We now have on our doorstep a whole new market.  It is up to us to ensure that we can compete in that market.</P>
    <P>Likewise, it is open to Spain and Portugal to take advantage of the Irish market. They certainly have taken advantage of the Irish tourist market.  Spain has been one of the most popular resorts for many Irish people because of the value of holidays in Spain and the fact that one was almost guaranteed sunshine there.  There is no doubt now that once they join the Community the day of the cheap holiday in Spain will be over.  They will immediately amend their prices.  They will find that by being members of the Community everything changes.  Their currency is likely to change, not in name but certainly in value.  Their prices will also change. This is a challenge that every open democracy has to face.  Every democracy that is part of a common community policy must pursue the markets.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but that the Irish agricultural scene is ready for this.  Most Senators referred to the area of fisheries. We are fortunate in that we have the Minister, Deputy O'Toole, present for the debate.  It is appropriate that we <Col N="21" /> should commend him for the tremendous efforts he made to ensure that our fisheries are protected.  We have had problems, particularly with Spain, in the area of fisheries.  Let us hope that when they join the Community they will keep the rules of the Community.  We in Ireland have been too good in obeying the rules of the Community.  We should ensure that other member states also obey the rules.  Once Spain becomes a full and active member of the Community she is more likely to abide by the rules, because the penalties will be much greater.  For that reason I hope that because of the deal negotiated by the Minister for Fisheries, combined with the regulations of the Community, which will be enforced by a very powerful power bloc, the Spaniards will be forced to obey the rules and regulations.  Our fishermen would particularly welcome that.  It has been a source of concern to them over a long period.  The likelihood of the Spanish fishermen getting inside our waters is much greater because of the size of their fleet.</P>
    <P>We welcomed recently the fact that the Community increased the budget to take account of the accession of Spain and Portugal.  We hope that this additional allocation will take into account the fact that there is obviously going to be much greater demand in a whole lot of areas because of the structure, nature and soil and climatic conditions of Spain and Portugal. It is obvious that they will make greater demands on the Regional and Social Funds.  We must be conscious of the fact that they will.  If there is not a commitment to increase those funds, then it is obvious to everybody that Ireland's share would be much less than it is now.  All of us would contend that we have never benefitted from the Regional and Social funds.  Recently, there have been signs, particularly in the area of infrastructure, road developments and the western drainage package, that we have just begun to benefit from deals negotiated over a number of years. It is obvious, with the changing structure of CAP, that there will be greater demands made by Ireland on the <Col N="22" /> Regional and Social Funds.  It is imperative to ensure, as existing members, that additional allocations are made available to take account of the two extra countries who will be looking for allocations out of this section of the Community funds.</P>
    <P>One other positive note on the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community that cannot be quantified easily in terms of money &mdash; and all of us are obsessed with the monetary impact of additional countries in the Community &mdash;is in the area of what they can offer the Community by way of their tremendous culture.  Spain and Portugal will make a major contribution to the European Community in the area of culture.  They have tremendous heritage of language and music.  Indeed since their foundation they have always been inspired with a spirit of adventure which goes back to the great voyages of discovery.  Their influence is visible throughout the world, resulting from their forebearers landing in various countries and influencing them. Their language is spoken throughout a great part of the world because the people of Spain and Portugal were eager to explore the whole world.  Their culture will make a tremendous impact on all member states of the Community. Ireland's membership has had a similar effect.  Our culture, our heritage, our language and our music have made a major impact on the Community.  This has been proven by the impact Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, with song and dance, have made on continentals who never had access to that kind of culture in the past.  I am sure Spain and Portugal will do likewise.  I hope sincerely that the Spaniards and the Portuguese will meet the challenge that comes from membership of the Community.  Because they are new democracies they will be anxious to protect democracy.  By joining the Community they can ensure that that democracy is protected.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge also said the people living within the Eastern bloc, had they been given the opportunity earlier to become part of the European Community, would now be living in a freer society than they are at present.  They <Col N="23" /> would have benefitted much more from their membership by way of not alone political union, which many Europeans want, but from the market relationship with other &ldquo;customers&rdquo;, so to speak.  Our agricultural industry has met this challenge as well as, if not better than, many others.  We have done so from a very poor start.  Many of the farmers in other agricultural communities were already factory farmers, using all sorts of techniques that were alien to us.  It has taken us some time to catch up.  Unfortunately, when we were in the process of doing that we were suddenly faced with the problems associated with quotas.  That had a dampening effect on our agricultural producers.  Increasing Community markets with the accession of Spain and Portugal will assist our agriculture, provided we are prepared to meet the challenge.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation to allow Spain and Portugal to join the Community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill.  I will be brief.  Ireland has many historic links with Spain and Portugal.  It is only right and proper that we would be allies of those two countries and support their accession to the Community.  In the long term the enlargement of the Community will be for the betterment of all of us.  We will have a large market for our produce.  There are many other advantages which we will be able to exploit over the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that Spain and Portugal are probably going into the EEC now with the expectations which we had 12 years ago when we joined.  Looking back on those 12 years or thereabouts, we can all agree that the country, in general, has benefitted by our entry into the EEC, particularly the farming sector.  We all know that the Common Agricultural Policy is the cornerstone of the European Community.  It is the policy from which the economy of this country benefits most.  Large sums of money have been paid to our farmers, the agricultural sector and to food processors over those <Col N="24" /> years.  In fact, last year, I believe, under the various FEOGA schemes £650 million was paid out to us.  That must be a great advantage to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>We know that everything is not as we would like it.  We know, in spite of all the funds available to our farmers and to the agricultural sector, that farmers' incomes are still falling.  It is predicted that they will fall more over the next five years. Nevertheless, we have the opportunities. We have a market of millions of people that we did not have before we joined the EEC.  Then we were dependent solely on the British market for our agricultural exports.  Now we are sending cattle and beef to the far ends of Europe and to North Africa.  That is a development which we should all welcome.  That has been brought about mainly as a result of our entry into the EEC.  I know that there are still many opportunities that can be exploited by our farmers, our meat processors and our exporters in general. I know that they will try to capture as much of that market as they possibly can.  By so doing they are adding to the national funds and putting more money into our farmers' pockets.</P>
    <P>There are disadvantages, of course. We have all seen the disadvantages over the last few years with the advent of the super-levy when many of our farmers were geared for more milk production. Particularly in the west of Ireland our small farmers, who have been behind in that area over the years because they were not traditionally dairy farmers, were just getting themselves organised on a good sound footing when this super-levy came along.  It is tragic, because we realise that the production of milk is the best source of income for the small farmer.  Unfortunately, it is not possible now to expand because of the super-levy. As well as that, we have the milk cessation scheme which was introduced during the year and which, again, is the great threat to our dairy industry, especially if our quotas are sold to the EC.  It is a loss to the country in general. I would be very worried about that scheme.  I hope that our Government will <Col N="25" /> come up with a scheme to match it so that those quotas will not be lost to our country.  The disadvantaged areas, too, are a problem which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to generalise as much as I can.  I am trying to highlight the advantages and disadvantages for our country.  I have already stated I am sure that Spain and Portugal will meet those advantages and disadvantages, too, over the next few years.  I believe that by working together the entry of those two countries can be to our advantage.  Their entry can be to the advantage of this country because it is giving us an additional market for our produce.  Spain and Portugal are known for their production of fruit and wine.  Even though there is a surplus of wine on the market at present, it is not going to affect our agricultural output here.  We do not produce wine as such, and we do not grow oranges or grapes.  In that way their entry is not going to affect us very much.  The countries that their entry will affect, such as Italy and Germany, have already welcomed Spain and Portugal into the community and I think they are to be congratulated on that.  The accession of Spain and Portugal will, naturally enough, upset the people who are producing wine in those countries, as well as grapes and fruit of all kinds.  Nevertheless, they have welcomed those two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the big disappointments over the years in the Community is the way the unemployment figures have risen.  When we went into the EEC our unemployment figures amounted to about 65,000.  Today they stand at about 250,000.  In the Community at large the figure at present is something in the region of 14 million. That is a big disappointment, because our young people looked forward to the European Community and to the enlargement of the Community as an <Col N="26" /> opportunity for them to exploit the situation and create new opportunities. Unfortunately, that has not happened.  It is one of the big tragedies of our time that more has not been done to tackle that unemployment situation.  A figure of 14 million in the Community at present is very frightening.  Of course, we also have to consider the fact that Spain at present has about two million people unemployed and Portugal has about 500,000.  Again, if the unemployment problem has not been solved for the existing members of the Community, I am afraid it is very discouraging for Spain and Portugal.  I would hope that the brains of the Community would get together and try to reduce that figure of 14 million and to create some kind of hope in the hearts of our young people.  They must assume then that the governments of those countries are concerned about them and that they are prepared to get down and work to try to create the jobs that are so necessary for young people at present.</P>
    <P>We have our own problems here at home, as I have said, but they are only very small in comparison with the problems in Europe.  The same can be said about the &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; we hear about every day &mdash; the butter mountains, the milk lakes, the beef mountains and so on. When one sees the terrible starving and suffering that exist at present in certain parts of the world, it is beyond me why some schemes could not be devised to try to get rid of the mountains of milk, butter, beef and cereals that we have stored up in ships and in storage rooms all over Europe.  I can never understand why something cannot be done to eliminate that and to ship more of that feed and grain to the starving millions.</P>
    <P>The bureaucrats in Europe could take a little advice from Bob Geldof who visited Brussels recently and asked them to get rid of some of the red tape that is so prevalent there at present.  At a time like this they could get rid of that red tape and could ship some of those millions of tons of grain, beef and butter and whatever else they have in cold storage all over Europe.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I hope that the <Col N="27" /> entry of Spain and Portugal will be to the advantage of all the Community and that we can work as a group in harmony with one another for the betterment of Europe in general.</P>

      <P>Is fada an lá ó tháinig an Spáinn chun cabhrú linn sa tír seo agus tá tagairt déanta cheana do Cholumbus nuair a chuaigh sé trasna an Aigéin Atlantach cé nach raibh a fhios go raibh se ag dul go dtí Meiriceá.  Shrois sé an tír sin agus anois tá a lán de shíol Gael ansin agus nach iontach an rud é gur féidir leo £500 milliún a thabhairt dúinn chun cabhrú sa Tuaisceart.  Muna raibh an Spáinn toilteanach teacht i gcabhair ar Cholumbus is dócha nach mbeadh an seans sin ann. Freisin, thíos i gCionn tSáile i dtús na seachtú aoise déag bhí siad toilteanach dul isteach sa troid ar ár son agus cé nár éirigh leo an bua a fháil ansin, bhí siad ann agus is maith an rud é go bhfuil seans againne teacht i gcabhair orthu.  Ó thaobh na Portaingéile de is dócha nuair a bhí mise óg bhí buidéal port le fáil i ngach teach i gContae an Chláir pé scéal é ach táimíd níos &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo; anois.  Tá gin agus vodka le fáil i ngach teach.  Ní raibh a fhios ag na daoine go raibh an Phortaingéil ag teacht i gcabhair orainn chun fíon a thabhairt dúinn.</P>
      <P>When I mention wine, I suppose I think of the problem that wine created for the entry of Spain and Portugal.  It did not upset many of the farmers in Carlow I know and it did not upset many people in Ireland.  It was a major problem for the actual accession of Spain and Portugal.  I am glad for their sake it is fixed.  After all with the wine scandal that is going on in Europe anything concerned with wine is nearly a worry at this stage and there is a lot to be said for drinking orange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of the unity of Europe is what concerns the EC.  I think it is a very natural process that Spain and Portugal should become part of the defensive bloc of Europe, the political unit of Europe, because it has been sticking its neck out in Europe as a peninsula since the world was formed; sticking your neck out is always a dangerous game and <Col N="28" /> it will be nice to have the body of Europe supporting it as it will on January 1986. It is right that the whole of Europe should become a unit and it makes political sense to have these two countries joining us.</P>
    <P>We probably have our own worries in Ireland as has been mentioned by several speakers.  There are the questions of agriculture and fishing.  With the Minister responsible for fishing here I should be very careful in what I say, coming from an inland country that is not directly involved but because of marriage I am very much involved in the fishing industry and I know the fears our fishermen have.  I too believe that perhaps by having the Spaniards in Europe we may be able to do something about them because they seem to be running slightly amok on the fishing grounds around our country. While they have been held at bay, from 1986 until 1996 when a certain number of vessels will be allowed into the Irish box I have certain worries, because of the practices they have set up for themselves, that in actual fact it might not be so easy to keep them under control. However, the EC rules are there and our Minister is there to rap somebody on the knuckles in an official way if they do not do what they should do.  Our fishing industry is a very important one and while those of us who are inland may feel it only concerns the coast it is a natural asset we have that we must protect and while we cannot be greedy we must make sure that there is no abuse of our fishing grounds and that our own fishermen get every opportunity of dealing with the problems and benefiting from that asset.</P>
    <P>I know the arrival of Spain and Portugal may not cause a major problem as regards the production of goods and we have access to them for dairy products, meat and veal and so on, but the way we are going in Europe at the moment I am not sure how our farmers will finish up because we have got to the quota stage in everything now.  We are always asking farmers to produce more.  They are being caught in that situation and indeed the modern style of Europe whereby they are anxious to buy up the milk quotas to encourage farmers to get out is something <Col N="29" /> that worries me very much.  It should be opposed.  If our young farmers who will be supplying Europe and competing with Spain and Portugal to a certain extent &mdash; our young farmers who are trained so well in farming methods and are trying to get involved in what we used to teach in school, the scientific methods of Holland, Belgium and Denmark &mdash; have no markets and no facility for using their skills, we are not doing them a great service.  There should either be a tax incentive or disincentive for the selling of these milk quotas and while people who sell do not like to have any obstacle in their way those who sell to younger farmers should be given a tax concession rather than those who sell back to the EC because we must keep market quotas available because a good young farmer coming up is the kind of person we want.  If an older farmer who wants to get out of dairy farming sells a quota to the EC it is a market closed.  We have another problem for these young farmers as well where we are linking the milk quotas to the land.  The young farmers cannot afford to buy land in order to get the quota.  It is something that we should look in to because we have to give scope to our young farmers and if we do not we are doing them a disservice.  I hope we will consider this at a future date.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have gained markets in Spain and Portugal may not be a tremendous advantage to us because in the very warm weather out in Spain and Portugal they will not be eating huge dinners and lunches of beef.  At least in Ireland we lose our appetite when we get an odd fine summer.  The fact that tariffs are being reduced by over 50 per cent in two years in both countries will open the place to some of our goods and will obviously provide a market for us.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that our Government played such a leading role in speeding up the process of getting Spain and Portugal into the EC.  They started back in 1978 and early 1979 and under our Presidency a lot of the problems were sorted out.  I would like to thank our Ministers for working so hard and creating such a good image for Ireland.  I know they had to <Col N="30" /> look after the interest of Ireland as well but they have done so and I hope, now that we have got a natural unit of geographical land put together to form a proper barrier, that Spain and Portugal will benefit from their link-up with Europe and that we also will gain from the extra markets that they leave open to us.  I welcome the Bill and hope that the 1 January accession date will be met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome very much the accession of Spain and Portugal as members of the European Economic Community.  If we were to be totally insular and narrow-minded, from an economic and other points of view, we might not as a country have taken the stance we took and the position we adopted. One has to be very objective in this sort of matter.  No doubt Spain and Portugal, as members of the EC, will automatically present certain difficulties and certain problems for us as a country, as it does present and will present for other countries.</P>
      <P>The products that we are keenest at producing and most competitive in the production of &mdash; milk, cereals and beef &mdash; are products in regard to which the Portugese and the Spanish are not at the top of the league.  It is countries like France and Italy, which are producing Mediterranean products, that have most to fear economically from the inclusion of Spain and Portugal as part of the Twelve. There will be certain drawbacks here and there, but we have added to our market an additional 48 million people.  At present Spain is a very significant importer of our produce, roughly £94 million being the latest figure for Spanish imports from Ireland.  The Portuguese import figure would be of little consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make the point that we and our marketing people should look in depth at the requirements of Spain and Portugal in an enlarged Community that we could supply.  In this area we have a long distance to go.  We have always tended to produce a product and then go out and try to sell that product.  We have failed too often to investigate the market possibilities in the first instance and then go <Col N="31" /> out and produce a product fulfilling the needs of the market place.  We should aim at having a definite policy of producing for the requirements of the market place.</P>
    <P>We know that the coffers of the EC are strained with the VAT level of 1 per cent.  We are also aware, in accordance with the agreement, that the upper level will be increased 1.4 per cent from 1 January 1986 and provision made for tentatively increasing that to 1.6 per cent in 1988.  That level of VAT may or may not be sufficient for us to do within the Community the sort of thing that we ought to do.  Personally, I figure that it may well fall short of the requirement of the EC from the point of view of supplying funds in adequate amounts for the Regional and Social Funds as well as for the very important Common Agricultural Policy.  It has been stated already in this discussion on the accession of Spain and Portugal that we are at a crossroads <i>vis-a-vis</i> our Common Agricultural Policy. One could not but agree very fully with that.  The inclusion of Spain and Portugal will do nothing to solve that problem.  It will, if anything, aggravate it to a certain degree.  We, as a country must insist on and continue to get concessions that are appropriate to a small island on the periphery of the mainland of Europe.  Taking into account our distance from the market place, in no way can we be compared to countries like France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Holland &mdash;and many of these countries had many years to develop their economies.  For that reason we must, without apology to anybody, make certain that we get special concessions in the various areas in which we require them, be it in the agricultural sector in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy or in the area of the Regional and Social Funds and their distribution and allocation.</P>
    <P>In the context of the super-levy on milk we succeeded in establishing without any question a strong precedent where in 1984 our Minister for Agriculture and other members of the Government headed by the Taoiseach got a fine <Col N="32" /> exemption or derrogation for our Irish dairying industry, where we got a base line of 1981 as against the other countries base line of 1983.  On top of that we were given the green light to move forward to the extent of 4.6 per cent.  This in total would give us, in the context of the super-levy, an increase of 20 per cent approximately. When one adds the difference between the 1981 production level and the 1983 production level, which was our base year as against the base years for the other countries, it gives us an advantage of 20 per cent as against a cutting back situation for the other members of the EC.  That was important for the dairying industry, and it continues to be important.  I mention it this afternoon in the context of our insisting in the future on getting special concessions as we will require them.</P>
    <P>With the present economic situation, we are not in a position to compete on an even basis with the economies of France, Germany and these other countries to which I made reference already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the point that Spain and Portugal, not unlike our own country, are disadvantaged countries. They will be given certain concessions in the years ahead.  What I am saying is that our country must get concessions appropriate to its needs.  It would be very inappropriate if we were to discuss the accession of Spain and Portugal without taking cognisance of the position within our own country.  For that reason I feel it very relevant to put a strong emphasis on the situation within our own shores and to make sure that the Government and Governments of the future will keep to the fore the position of our own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Spain and Portugal, we see a situation where their dependence on agriculture is quite considerable. About 27 per cent of the population of <Col N="33" /> Portugal is engaged in agriculture.  The equivalent figure for Spain is something like 18 per cent.  Obviously, therefore, the dependence of these countries on agriculture is far higher than any country at present within the Community with the exception, perhaps, of Greece, the most recent entrant.  Quite frankly, while there are problems, to which I alluded in regard to the entry of Spain and Portugal into the Community, I feel that if we view the matter in a positive fashion we can gain a lot of advantage from their membership and as members of the European Community they can be very important to us.</P>
    <P>We must remember that membership of the EC, while it is by its very name an economic community, has other dimensions as well.  There are political dimensions to it and these are of great consequence.  For that reason we welcome the entry of Spain and Portugal into the European Community.  One would like to think that as time progresses, further enlargements may occur which would consolidate still further this political dimension.  One has in mind, in particular, the position <i>vis-a-vis</i> Turkey, whose membership would bring great advantage to the European Community.</P>
    <P>There will be a transition period for Spain and Portugal.  In this seven-year period, when trade barriers are being dismantled, we can, as I indicated earlier, gain from that situation.  One important thing the accession of Spain and Portugal will do is to reduce significantly the Community's negative trade balance in agriculture. It will be reduced by approximately one quarter and that is a very significant development.</P>
    <P>This country has many similarities with Spain and Portugal.  It is in that context that we should refer to the situation in Ireland and what we like to see happen in the Community.  As Senator Hussey pointed out a few moments ago, unemployment in the EC stands at 14 million people or thereabouts and in our own country exceeds 200,000.  That is a very disappointing feature.  I believe that with a more vigorous approach at European <Col N="34" /> level we can have this undesirable situation improved; and I would say that within the Irish scene it is important that no effort be spared to reduce that level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>We have been very positive net beneficiaries of the European Community; but, in common with our new partners, Spain and Portugal, we must get special concessions in the areas of the Regional and Social Funds.  I have already talked about the Common Agricultural Policy and the need for special considerations there.  In regard to the Regional and Social Funds, I believe it behoves the entire Community to view this island here in a very special light.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would just like to say that, in common with those Senators who have spoken already, I welcome very warmly and very positively the joining of Spain and Portugal with the other ten countries in the EC and I hope and I believe that their membership can in the long term, when the problems have been sorted out, be of considerable advantage to us economically, politically and in other ways as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. P. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, first of all, like to express my thanks to the House for the expeditious way in which it has dealt with this matter of the accession of Spain and Portugal.  As always, this debate indicated the genuine interest of the Members of this House in this matter, which is of great importance to us.</P>
      <P>In replying to the debate, I propose to address myself directly to the issues of the accession of Spain and Portugal rather than give any kind of general dissertation on the general issues relating to the Community.  In the debate Senators asked that, in view of the enlargement, was it not appropriate that we would at this time draw up a balance sheet of the pros and cons of our membership of the Community, seeing that we are there now for the past 12 years and that in doing so this kind of assessment would influence our attitudes to the Community itself and our behaviour therein in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that there is a need, first <Col N="35" /> of all, for such a balance sheet.  We have had substantial benefits from our membership of the Community.  They have been considerable since day one; and we have also, of course, invariably taken stock of our position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Community and there is an ongoing assessment by the Government and its agencies as to where we stand on any issue from day to day within the context of the EC. There is no question of stopping at a particular point and assessing where you stand.</P>
    <P>This is an ongoing process and because of its nature, and because we are talking about a community of nations, there is all the time an evolving situation where things are changing, some things making progress, some things not making progress. There is change all the time and the Community and its members at all levels must ensure in so far as it can that, despite the so-called massive bureaucracy there, the Community itself responds to the changes that go on within its membership and, indeed, in relation to third countries also with whom it has very close relations all over the world. Therefore, unless we as members are prepared to play our part in the overall approach of the Community to these changes and try to achieve some dynamic response to many of the things happening, both within the Community and outside the Community and in third countries with whom we have close economic, social and cultural relations, then we are failing in our function as a member of the Community.  There is no time for a static approach.</P>
    <P>This is my first day participating in the debate.  Senator Fitzsimons mentioned the begging bowl concept and said he was not in favour of promoting that idea. We have responsibilities to live up to as members.  There are also benefits accruing to us from our membership but we should not overdo or oversell ourselves as all the time looking for something and trying to exploit our membership of the EC.  We have an obligation to see to it that we get justice and fair play and that we get our entitlements as members of <Col N="36" /> the EC but not to the detriment of others. That is the important point.  I am glad that Senators saw that point.</P>
    <P>One area that is very relevant in relation to evolvement and the need for its ongoing assessment is the Common Agricultural Policy.  CAP has been the subject of long and tedious debates on where it stands, what its past history has been and what its future will be.  Senators referred to the Commission's Green Paper and have expressed concern at some of the proposals outlined in that Green Paper and concern that the basic principles on which CAP is based might be undermined by some of the proposals enshrined in the Green Paper.  As Senators know the Green Paper is a discussion document setting out sets of possibilities and options for the future in a broad framework within which CAP might operate in the future given the food surpluses we have.</P>
    <P>Will regard to the mountains of beef, butter and cereals and the lakes of milk, I am sure the Senators would agree that it is time to sit down and discuss what we should do in this kind of situation in which we subsidise the production of these commodities; we then have to pay for their storage and at the end of the day the markets are not sufficient to absorb the volume of these commodities on hand. There is something wrong in that kind of equation.</P>
    <P>That having been said, Senators have been quite correct in expressing concern about the Green Paper and its contents. In the case of Ireland we entered the EC largely on the basis of the benefits that would accrue to us and that we expected to accrue to us from our agriculture.  The Minister, Deputy Deasy, has also expressed concern at the content of some of the proposals in the Green Paper.  He has pointed out very vehemently in European forums the importance of the agricultural sector in Ireland and that its centrality to our whole way of life must be recognised by our European partners. Our traditional rural lifestyle is based on agriculture.  The social consequences of any diminution of that recognition that agriculture must get in the context of the <Col N="37" /> EC must be looked at very carefully. My colleague in Agriculture is very much aware of the importance of this aspect of the economy.</P>
    <P>Senators have expressed views and disappointments in relation to the Regional Policy.  I would go along with the view expressed that the policy and the concept underlying it has not achieved its primary objective.  The primary aim of the Regional Policy when it was set up in 1975 was to eliminate the economic disparities and the imbalances that exist between the favoured and the less favoured areas in the Community.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs dealt with this area in detail.  I do not propose to repeat what he said except that I would endorse the disappointment expressed with the lack of progress since the establishment of the fund in 1975 when it represented 4.8 per cent of the Community budget.  Ten years later, in 1985, it represents a mere 7.3 per cent of that same budget.</P>
    <P>One would have expected that the determination and enthusiasm there was in 1975 for the levelling out of the disparities and imbalances would have carried us on to ensure a greater level of funding but while the enthusiasm was there I am afraid the funding did not keep pace with the ideas that existed in 1975.  We still have major differences in economic and social levels between different areas within the Community.  There is a direct ratio between the success of efforts in that respect and the level of funding made available to ensure that success.  Unless the funding is made available the economic convergence which was sought through the establishment of the fund which has been very elusive in the past will continue to be elusive in the future.</P>
    <P>Some Members of this House said that the accession of Spain and Portugal will probably worsen that imbalance simply because it will draw more on that fund resulting in a reduced fund for those people who have been beneficiaries up to now.  Ireland has been one of the major beneficiaries on a <i>per capita</i> basis not in the overall lump sum in volume terms.  I would not go along with the idea that the <Col N="38" /> accession of Spain and Portugal will have a totally damaging effect.  I can see some beneficial results from the accession of our colleagues in Spain and Portugal.</P>
    <P>In the normal day-to-day bargaining that goes on at European level you find lobbies forming.  From my experience in dealing with my own area small countries tend to stick together and help one another out in relation to many issues and I feel that we will have now a very strong lobby in relation to the Regional Fund and its capacity to do the job it was put there to do.  Spain and Portugal will now be a part of that lobby as they would fall into the category of the less developed areas.  Extra pressure will be brought on the powers that be to introduce forceful policies with adequate funding for the purposes of eliminating the imbalances and the disequilibriums there are within the confines of the Community.  I can assure you that the Government look forward to pressing ahead, with the assistance now of Spain and Portugal, to provide what we regard as adequate funding for that area of activity.</P>
    <P>Several Senators referred to the problem of unemployment which is a major problem within the Community and within specific member states including our own.  I think we will have to recognise the fact that not only is unemployment a problem in the peripheral area where one might expect severe difficulties but we have now reached the stage in recent years where in the very industrial heartland of Europe it is also a major problem. Recent European Councils have discussed this problem and our Taoiseach has been very much to the forefront in seeking concerted action on this major problem within the Community.  While national governments can introduce specific schemes to alleviate the problem within their own territories, our Taoiseach &mdash; and I would concur fully with him &mdash; has stated repeatedly that in his opinion, and he has gained support for this among his Council colleagues, the only really effective way to do this is at Community level, that it is really a Community problem and that individual states have not the capacity to deal with <Col N="39" /> this problem on their own.  It is really a problem that must be faced on a Community basis and the funding, the ideas and the schemes must be Community based.</P>
    <P>One of the primary areas concerning the accession of Spain and Portugal is one with which I had direct involvement. That is the area of fisheries and fisheries policy.  This particular chapter of negotiations was left to the very end of the accession negotiations, not because it was deemed to be unimportant but because it was deemed to be so intricate: it was felt that it would create so many problems that it would take some time.  There were difficulties with commodities like olive oil, fruit and wine, but everybody regarded fish as being of crucial importance and of great delicacy.  It was left until the end and it was only in March last that the real down-to-earth discussions took place in relation to this chapter of negotiations.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I can say that in my honest opinion, having been involved directly in this, we got what I regard as the best deal possible in relation to our fisheries involvement.  Indeed, when one considers the enormous pressure there was on Spain itself as an acceding state and on Portugal to fight every inch of the way for what they could get at this early stage, knowing that if they did not get it then things tend to become tablets of stone as time goes on in EC terms, one cannot but say that we have been very successful in getting the best deal possible. Spain sought, as did Portugal, immediate and full integration into the Common Fisheries Policy.  When one considers that what we have done and the concessions we have succeeded in holding on to despite their accession next January, one must realise that we have succeeded in getting a good deal.  We have succeeded in getting the total exclusion of Spain inside the 50 miles box for a ten year period up to 1996; and that is the best known, I suppose, of the positive elements which we succeeded in holding on to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> There are other positive aspects also. Of the basic list of 300 vessels authorised to fish in Community waters only 150 of 700 horsepower are on a periodic list and will at any one time be allowed fish in Community waters simultaneously.  In other words, of the 300, 150 will be allowed to fish simultaneously.  Of this 150, 93 vessels will be allowed into our 50 to 200 mile limit.  That particular element of the agreement will continue for the ten years transitional period.</P>
    <P>Senators inquired what number of boats we had of that calibre.  We have 40 boats which would have that kind of capacity.  I got the impression at some stage during the debate that some Senators might have thought that this is 93 extra boats in for the first time on 1 January to our 50 to 200 mile limit.  That is not the case.  There are in existence for some years agreements with third countries in relation to fisheries policy and Spain obviously up to now has been regarded as a third country.  Under the Community/Spain framework agreement Spanish boats have been licensed to fish in that area for a number of years; and this year, for example, 65 Spanish boats of that calibre are fishing already and have been for some time in that band of sea.  Basically we are talking about west of and south of this country.  We are not talking here of 93 additional boats. The 65 are there under licence, the 93 will be there by right under accession terms.  So you are talking about an additional 28.  Positive elements of accession would also include in our case, for example &mdash; we were discussing this only last week in Brussels&mdash;larger quotas in species such as hake, monkfish and megrim.  As my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, mentioned, there is an opportunity here for us to avail of the enormous Spanish market for fish.  The species I have mentioned are basically fresh fish for the fresh fish market.  That is a big market in Spain and it is a question of our exploiting that market.</P>
    <P>People might get the impression that the Spanish fleet will descend on us overnight, but 60 per cent of the current Spanish fleet of 17,000 vessels operate in <Col N="41" /> the waters of third countries with whom they have bilateral agreements.  In fact, the vast bulk of the fleet operate in these waters &mdash; the South Atlantic, off Madagascar, west Africa and so on.  The reason they are not operating here is very simple: they are in more lucrative waters and they will probably stay there.  They have bilaterial agreements with third countries and it will now become part of the function of the Community to renegotiate these third country agreements which will be handed over by Spain on the last day of this year.</P>
    <P>Senators have expressed concern about our ability to control the fishery and ensure that Spain stays within the regulations governing membership.  The fears expressed are understandable in the light of our past experience on the issue of controls.  In fact, we have been quite successful here.  In 1984 we did succeed.  One must remember that we are operating with limited resources in this area.  I would like to pay tribute to our Naval Service for what they have done with these resources in apprehending Spanish vessels fishing illegally, that is fishing without having licences, or, if they have licences, fishing the wrong species or, if not, fishing within the 50-mile limit.  In 1984, for example, fines imposed amounted to a total of £.9 million and so far this year we have imposed fines of about £1 million on Spanish trawlers found fishing illegally.</P>
    <P>We must realise that as and from 1 January next year Spain will be a full member of the EC.  As a full member we expect that we will get full co-operation from Spain; and, indeed, their Minister for Fisheries, Senor Romero, gave this undertaking a few weeks ago at a meeting in Brussels at which he was present as an observer.  After the accession of Spain the Spanish vessels will be subject to Common Fishery Policy controls and regulations, and I would agree with the views expressed today by some Senators that possibly it will be somewhat easier to control the situation once Spain is within the EC simply because we will be able to draw on the resources within the EC.  There is a monitoring facility and an <Col N="42" /> inspectorate there that have powers to inspect and indeed take remedial action if after inspection something has been found to be wrong.  At the moment we have a licensing system under which 65 Spanish trawlers operating off our west coast invariably discharge their cargoes of fish in their home ports or on to bigger vessels which then discharge them.  The transfer takes place either at sea or at a Spanish port where, as of now, we have no powers to inspect.  On their assuming membership our inspectors will be able to go into La Coruna, Vigo and the major fishing ports just as they go to Killybegs or Castletownbere today, inspect their catches, establish where these catches have taken place and see whether they have followed the regulations or not.  If they have not, they will have broken the law and they will be fined for that.  There is probably a better chance of controlling the problem of the Spanish as a member than there is otherwise.  There is strict monitoring in relation to the 150 boats on the provisional list.  They will have to report on entering the fishery and on leaving the fishery.  They will also have to report their catches in volume and in species terms.  This is applying the same concept as there is in the Shetland box which is already part of the European Common Fisheries Policy.  Also, we have a new box created for the purpose of conserving mackerel &mdash; the mackerel box in the English Channel.  The same concept will apply here where they report on arrival and on exit showing their catch for inspection.</P>
    <P>The question of maritime surveillance has been discussed specifically in the context of the accession of Spain and Portugal. There was a Council declaration made at that time on foot of a proposal by the Commission and introduced at the behest of this Government.  It was that, on the accession of Spain and Portugal and because of the increased surveillance needed, the whole area of our capacity to carry out maritime surveillance would be looked at.  It was at our request that this Council declaration was introduced. I am glad to have played a part in that because, while our Naval Service are <Col N="43" /> doing a fine job, they have limited resources; and when you are talking about a band of sea of about 150 miles in length or in width you are talking about a big area for surveillance purposes. Obviously, much of it will have to be done by air, so we will need help to do that job properly.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald complained about the slow progress in relation to a comprehensive transport policy.  I agree that the progress has been slow, but one must realise that we are talking here about different economic and geographic conditions, taking the EC as a whole, and that is resulting in different transport networks; and co-ordination of these networks is not easy because of different legal requirements and different networks. The Treaty of Rome provided for a common policy in relation to transport and the Community looks on a common transport policy as a very important element in the European Community context.  Work is being done on that and the Community is pursuing the establishment of a framework to achieve that aim. Much has been done and, despite what one might think, some progress has been made.  For example, there has been the harmonisation of social legislation in relation to road haulage and that is one step along the road &mdash; if one excuses the pun.  There is also in course of preparation a master plan whose elements include such important sectors as the planning of infrastructure access of Community interest, transit and cross-Border problems, organisation of the transport market and transport safety.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald also mentioned the appointment of new commissioners, and the individuals nominated for offices on the accession of Spain and Portugal. Senor Marin has been nominated by the Spanish Government as one of its commissioners. It has not yet named the second commissioner to which it is entitled.  The man nominated is very familiar with community affairs and I am quite sure he will make a positive impact in the Commission when he assumes <Col N="44" /> office on 1 January.  The Portuguese for their part have yet to nominate the one commissioner that has been allocated to them.  Senator McDonald also inquired about the allocation of portfolios within the Commission.  That is a matter for the President of the Commission when he has his team presented to him.  The allocation of portfolios is strictly a matter for him.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins referred to problems in relation to the disadvantaged areas and the underdeveloped areas of the west. In relation to that, could I say that the Government undertook reclassification proposals and submitted them to the Commission who accepted them in total. The Senator also referred to areas in France which on the face of it got special treatment from the agricultural development point of view, despite the fact that they did not come within the criteria for mountain areas.  They did, however, fall within the ambit of other criteria which would have made them eligible anyway and brought them into line with assistance which this country is getting.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge gave a very clear expression of his view and where he stands in relation to Europe and we all know his track record on that.  He is a European.  He also mentioned, of course the difficulties.  Very briefly he gave us a resume of what the European concept is and he gave us the background to that whole concept.  I would like to thank him for that and also for his kind words in relation to the fishery negotiations.  As he has said &mdash; and I would be with him on the idea &mdash; it will probably be easier for us to control the fisheries policy with Spain as a member.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon mentioned the Regional Fund.  I referred to that already. He did make the point, which I think is worth mentioning, that he saw himself as a Member of this House, as being obliged to support the efforts of this Government or of any Government within the context of the EC.  I thank him for that expression.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris mentioned Spain and Portugal as being infant democracies. That is true and I am quite sure that if they had not been democracies in the <Col N="45" /> first place they would not be coming into membership of the European Community. I suppose they will expect, as we did, great benefits to flow to them from membership and we have had many advantages accruing to us, as the Senator said, at a price.  I think it is fair to say that for any benefits one gets one pays a price.  It is a question of the price you pay.  Some people might think the price is too high.  Personally, I do not.  I think that one of the things we can be proud of is that the people of this country overwhelmingly saw fit to join the Community and, having joined it, they have lived up to their expectations of being able to compete albeit in some cases in a rather ragged way.  But I think we are learning quickly and ten or 12 years in the life of a Community like the EC is a very short period.  There are areas in which we have yet to get our act together but slowly but surely it is dawning on us that nobody owes us a living, that we must go out there and, first of all, be conscious of quality, go into the market-place and compete with people who are operating within much more affluent economies than ours and be able to compete with them successfully.  Slowly but surely that is dawning on us and we must take that positive approach.</P>
    <P>As Senator Ferris said, a formula was adopted at the time of negotiation of the accession of Spain and Portugal to deal with the Regional and Social Funds. While it might not be to the satisfaction of everybody, there was an undertaking given by the Commission that beneficiaries from these funds would not be victims of the accession of Spain and Portugal, in that adequate funds would be provided to look after them and their demands specifically.  Some of the cynics would say &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo;.  We are waiting and seeing what will happen to that.</P>
    <P>Going back to the idea of the begging bowl, Spain and Portugal will be major drawers on these funds but we have experience of 12 years within the EC. We have benefited enormously from that experience both in social and economic terms and I think in political terms also despite the fact that we are not talking <Col N="46" /> about a political entity.  We have come to know how political systems work elsewhere in our neighbouring democracies. We are able to sit down with our Western European colleagues week after week and council after council and discuss common problems logically and sensibly with them.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to mention this to any great extent but I think that the debate taking place at the moment in the Oireachtas must also be put into that context. I feel that that debate is taking place in the Dáil in the knowledge that many people participating have had experience of dealing directly with others in democratic forums, for the past 12 years &mdash; which is no harm at all.  I think it will be to our benefit and the level of debate in the House reflects that experience over the past 12 years.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris also mentioned the enormous cultural importance of Spain and Portugal.  We are aware of this.  We all know of the long historical ties there are between those countries and ourselves, that their wealth and richness of culture will be reflected within the Community and that it will be the beneficiary in time to come.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey expressed the view that the accession of Spain and Portugal would create new markets, particularly in the area of the Common Agricultural Policy.  This is correct.  He also made the point that should not be lost sight of: that, while we had to fight our corner in relation to fisheries, we were not the only country that had reservations about how the accession of Spain and Portugal would affect them.  Particularly, there are the wine producing countries, France and Italy.  They saw enormous problems with the accession of Spain and Portugal for their respective economies.  Yet, while they went in there and fought their corners, at the end of the day there was a generosity to be seen: these were neighbours who were naturally part of the European land mass and whose rightful place was within the Community.  In that spirit of generosity they felt, rightly, prepared to take on these two additional countries and to negotiate with them <Col N="47" /> once they were inside the Community. The Spirit of generosity and of challenge is there.  The only area where it affected us to any great extent was fisheries.</P>
    <P>The problem of unemployment was also mentioned by Senator Hussey.  I have referred to it already.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Seanadóir Browne, thosaigh sé as Gaeilge, agus dúirt sé go raibh an-bhaint againn leis an Spáinn leis na céadta bliain anuas.  D'ólamar a gcuid fíona ar feadh na mblianta.  Go deimhin, mar a dúirt sé agus is rud suimiúil é seo, tá tairiscint againn ó Mheiriceá faoi láthair go mbeidh cúpla céad milliún dollar ag teacht chuig Tuaisceart na tíre seo ó Mheiriceá agus chuir sé an cheist, an mbeadh sé sin amhlaidh mura mbeadh na Spáinnigh ann agus mura mbeadh na Spáinnigh sásta breathnú amach agus dul amach na céadta bliain ó shin agus tíortha eile a bhunú.  Tá sé sin déanta acu agus táimid ag fáil fiúntais as a bhfuil déanta ag na Spáinnigh.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne said that the accession of Spain and Portugal makes political sense.  It also makes geographical sense in that they are part of the land mass and in close proximity to the centre of European affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan, also in the spirit of generosity, said that it was not the time for insularity, that we should be objective and that the addition of 48 million people to the Community was a beneficial factor which would be of advantage to us.  He made the point, which is correct, that the funding of the EC, with the new countries having acceded, even at the increased rate of 1.4 per cent to the own resources system, will not be sufficient to meet the demands of the enlarged Community.  As the House is aware, getting the figure from 1.0 to 1.4 per cent involved a lot of discussion and debate and the people directly involved in this &mdash; and indeed the people who were causing some problems &mdash; must have known that even agreement on the 1.4 per cent level would not be sufficient to meet the demands of even the existing Community at the time, never mind an increased membership. We are not in a position to affect this to <Col N="48" /> any extent except to pay our share as good Europeans, which we have been doing.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan also made the point that the accession of Spain and Portugal would reduce the negative trade balance with these countries.  He sees this as one of the benefits accruing to us.  This is correct, and I fully agree with him.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Hourigan and the Senators whom I have heard speak in the House, I welcome the accession of Spain and Portugal.  When on 1 January 1986 they join the European Community of 320 million people that Community will be enriched by two new members who are culturally, historically and geographically part of Europe and without whom the European Community would be incomplete. The challenges which face us are increased by the accession of Spain and Portugal.  This is not the time for lying down and calling &ldquo;foul&rdquo;.  From the very beginning we agreed to the accession of these two countries because we felt that it was, as one might say, their natural home.  From 1 January we will be sitting down in council with them, discussing their problems and fighting our corner at the same time to ensure that their accession will not unduly upset the delicate balance within the Community in relation to the different funds from which we benefit.</P>
    <P>It is essential to make the Community more relevant to the solution of the real problem of our time, which is unemployment. It is the Government's view, and the Taoiseach has reiterated it time and again, that the problem of unemployment must be confronted squarely at Community level.  Of course, national governments must also make every effort within their jurisdictions to create imaginative policies that will absorb the unemployed into gainful employment. The overall problem must be dealt with at Community level.</P>
    <P>We must use the opportunity of enlargement to recharge the Community with the vitality that inspired its founders, who were very far-seeing people, not only so that we can make the enlargement a success but through it to give a new <Col N="49" /> impetus to the further development of the Community as a whole.</P>

      <P>This section seeks to add two paragraphs to the European Communities Act, 1972.  I should like to bring the attention of the House to sub-paragraph (n) which refers to the decision on 11 June 1985 of the Council of the European Communities relating to the accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Coal and Steel Community.  I can understand that Treaty being something which is quite capable, which is referred to in the previous sub-paragraph, of being looked up; but with regard to the question of a decision, is there only one decision taken on that day to which this could possibly refer?  Was the only matter covered by that decision, that is the question of the accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the Community?  Lastly, where is that decision definitively recorded?  This decision will be part of our domestic law. What we are proposing to do is to make that decision part of our law.  I understand that a treaty can become part of the law and you can go into any library and look <Col N="50" /> up the treaty.  I wonder is the decision as formal a thing as the treaty.  Is it as readily available?  It would be no harm, if it is readily available, if the Minister would put on record where it is available.  Will it be published, for example, in <i>Iris Oifigiúil?</i> Will it be available as part of the domestic law for anybody who in the future might need to refer to it in relation to any matter which might fall to be discussed or to be decided either outside the courts or within the courts?</P>

    <Title>Report on Prison Reform: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the enlightened and practical prison reforms proposed in the Whitaker Committee report, and calls on the Government to implement the report as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I am privileged to move this motion on behalf of the Labour Party, noting the report of the Whitaker Committee.  I want to put on record the gratitude, not only of Members of the House but of all those interested over the years in prison reform, to Dr. Whitaker and members of the committee and to those who contributed to the information appendices to the main body of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall the establishment of the Whitaker Committee.  On that occasion I recall, as a member of the MacBride Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System in Ireland, criticising the narrowness of the terms of reference particularly the omission from the terms of reference of the causes of crime.  The Minister, when replying, said he felt that we had a difference of opinion and that investigation of the causes of crime in Britain, one Royal Commission after another, had not been conclusive.  My reply to him on that occasion was that this was not necessarily so and that we had begun to learn a great deal more about crime.  I am pleased to see that the Minister's injunction to the new members of the committee on that occasion, that they should interpret the terms of reference generously, was taken up by the members of the committee.  What we have before <Col N="52" /> us is a very important document.  It was produced very quickly by the committee. I would also like to pay tribute to the secretariat who worked with Dr. Whitaker and the committee.</P>
    <P>If I have a quibble with the report &mdash; in the popular press reports reference was made to its length, its 360 pages complete with bibliography &mdash; it is that in some places it had to compress literature that is very large into a rather short space.  I have some sympathy for the committee in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the fact that the committee went about their work at a time that was a very difficult.  We were in the middle of what I can only describe as a crime panic.  I do not want to weary the Seanad by repeating arguments that I have placed on the record previously, but there is a distinction between two things &mdash; the real rate of crime and the perceived rate of crime.  Intervening between the real rate of crime and the perceived rate of crime are all the different influences that affect public perception.  Thus, for example, if there is too much sensational coverage given to attacks on the elderly it creates a sense of fear among the elderly who previously were not afraid.  One has to draw a distinction.  This is not to say that attacks on the elderly should not be reported or indeed that the punishment of those involved in such despicable crimes should not be reported.  However, there is a distinction between what the public perceives to be the crime rate and what the real rate is.</P>
    <P>The beginning of the report adverts to the problem of assessing the rate of crime.  The rate of crime has increased.  The report was probably drawing on the very valuable experience that Dr. David Rothman of the Economic and Social Research Institute brought to the committee.  The major changes in crime in the 1960s are probably that it shifted from being a rural to an urban phenomenon, that the pattern of violence in murder has changed and that there has been an increase in property-related crimes.  Of course, there is more property, there are more motor vehicles and there is an increase in population in the <Col N="53" /> urban areas.  Therefore, when one is talking about crime waves one has to allow for all of these factors.</P>
    <P>The atmosphere in which the committee began their work &mdash; and the Labour Party welcome the report of the committee and urge the Government to implement their report &mdash; is well summed up in an <i>Irish Independent</i> leader of 9 August 1985.  It begins:</P>
    <P>The first whispers of the conclusions of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System have begun circulating. They are bound to fuel the debate, which is always live, about the purpose of prisons and penal systems.</P>
    <P>The information available suggests that the system should concentrate more on finding alternative forms of punishment for people convicted in courts &mdash; such as community service for example.  Remission should be increased from a quarter to one-third of the sentence.  New prisons would cost a fortune to build so let's spend the money on the alternative forms. And the parties involved in the row between the P.O.A. and the Department of Justice should sort themselves out.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the public's eye will be caught by the suggestions that what seems to be a milder regime for prisoners should be encouraged.  And this is where the sparks will fly.</P>
    <P>A public which feels itself threatened by violence and which is also sickened by it will always want some form of punishment for the offenders.  The Committee apparently believes that community service would fit the crime in many instances.  The public &mdash; or a large part of it &mdash; may well argue that this is a very soft reply to men and women who have broken the law, is no encouragement to Gardaí to catch criminals and is certainly no deterrent to people who have taken to crime as a way of life.</P>
    <P>Encapsulated in that leader is the view that was readily being created and disseminated in this country at the time the Whitaker Committee began their work. <Col N="54" /> It had a number of forms &mdash; distort the true rate of crime, sensationalise crime and continually build and build more moral panic and fear in the community so as to make the case for the harsh option in relation to responding to crime rather then the softer option.</P>
    <P>I want to challenge an assumption that the <i>Irish Independent</i> makes on behalf of all of us.  A public which feels itself threatened by violence, and which is also sickened by it, will always want some form of punishment for the offenders.  Is that not the nub of the matter?  When I was serving on the MacBride Commission, we debated this issue of the purpose of prison.  Many want people sent to prison for different reasons.  Should it be a matter of punishment or retribution? Should it be revenge?  Should it be rehabilitation?  Interviewers frequently ask the victims of crimes and their near relatives &ldquo;what would you like to happen to this person&rdquo;?  The person in an emotional moment might say something and it is carried in the papers, and so on. What is the motivation one might ask?  I object to a newspaper suggesting that there is in the public this ungenerous attitude towards people who commit crimes.  I think it can be created.  I think it can be whipped up; it can be fanned.</P>
    <P>Imprisonment is a very difficult concept to understand when you look back at the Irish history of the prison system. The Irish prison system is relatively short in history.  Like many of our other problems, deportation was available for a long time, so we did not have prisons.  People were either executed, mutilated or deported.  Indeed, many of the buildings which the Whitaker Committee describe in a very interesting set of photographs, which are in the report from page 148 to 178, show the kind of institution that they had to review.  It looks at toilets in Mountjoy Prison on page 149; it looks at other modern ones in page 150.  Basically, in those 30 pages you get an impression of the institutional provision that was inherited by this State and which is totally inadequate.  It was one of the terms of <Col N="55" /> reference that they look at the conditions. They have done us a service in drawing attention to them.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, as a preliminary to the recommendations of the Labour Party, that for the record, the Labour Party have an old association with prison reform.  It was in the Thirties that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions asked the Parliamentary Labour Party to establish a group to look at conditions in prisons. That group was appointed, with young Jim Larkin serving as secretary.  They presented their first report on prisons in Ireland in the modern period, prisons and prisoners.  What is very important to bear in mind is that there have been difficulties in looking at the prison service up to now. It has been bedevilled by secrecy.  It has been very difficult to conduct proper research on prisons.  That is my personal view.  It has been very difficult to conduct research on prisoners.  The argument for that is that you were invading their constitutional rights if you, in fact, interviewed them after they left prison.  It has been very difficult to assemble case histories of the experience of prison.  It has been very difficult altogether to put together life histories of the effects of prison.</P>
    <P>I was worried by some of the newspaper reactions.  I only quoted one newspaper, although there was another newspaper, <i>The Irish Times</i>, which welcomed the Whitaker report.  I think it was right to do that.  Of course, the Whitaker report was welcomed by the Prison Officers' Association, the Prisoners' Rights Association, with some reservations, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and members of the Probation and Welfare Service.  A number of bodies welcomed it.  The people to whom the editorial I quoted refer are people who have very little conception of what prison is about.  The deprivation of liberty is the main effect of imprisonment: one is not free to take decisions.</P>
    <P>The history of prisons all over the world, as the historians of prisons tell us, shows that, first of all, the prisoner's time <Col N="56" /> is not controlled by himself, his access to space is not controlled by himself and his body is not controlled by himself.  That was the purpose originally of convict uniforms. It is the purpose for the retention of basic elementary potting out ceremonies in prisons long after other reforms have been introduced.  The prisoner loses the right to make basic decisions in freedom. He loses certain rights to make certain decisions in relation to his essential privacy and in relation to the integrity of his person.  The very fact of imprisonment is in itself something that has to be faced by society as to whether it is an appropriate response or not.</P>
    <P>I hold the personal opinion that imprisonment is an incredibly inhuman response to problems in many ways and is very much in the short term something of a last resort.  I welcome the recommendation in the Whitaker Committee's report that prison sentences should be shortened if possible, that non-custodial alternatives should be developed to the maximum and that, where possible, there should be a review of sentences when they go over a certain period.  I think that these proposals are all welcome and I think that they will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I would like to say more about the world of prison.  I visited a prisoner who was mentioning to me the basic aspects of being in prison, of not knowing the changes in the seasons of the year and the limited space to which you had access. There is one last contextual reference I will make.  When Pentonville was opened the industrialists of Britain gathered for the official opening.  They marvelled that, at the pull of a lever, so many doors could be opened and that there could be so much control of so many human beings. It was almost like clockwork.</P>
    <P>The question that faces us in the end is: what is the purpose of prison?  There is a debate going on in this country.  It needs to be quashed right now.  Many of the people who end up in prison have already been very bruised by society in terms of their background.  I want to draw a distinction immediately here.  An illogical proposition has been put up every time in the last 12 years I have been in <Col N="57" /> public life when I have spoken on the subject of penal reform.  I have said that when you take the unemployment rate and the rate of social deprivation in different areas you will notice a correspondence between them and the rate of imprisonment.  I have never said that one's background makes one a criminal. There is a connection between the two rates &mdash; in other words, between the rate of the predisposing factors and of the actual crime rate itself.  Of course, individuals make the choice about what they will do between the incidents of crime.  It never gets clarified.  People always turn around and say to me &ldquo;I suppose it was his background that made him do that&rdquo;. But background is important.</P>
    <P>One of the most challenging findings that is coming out of this report, as of others, is the close predictive ability between those who are in institutions for juveniles, for example, who have been offenders and those who have been non-offenders. The mere fact of institutionalisation, which itself is related to unemployment, homelessness and poor backgrounds in many cases, is as good a predictive factor in the non-criminal setting as it is a fact of the criminal setting. One has to look at it like that.</P>
    <P>There are a number of important questions that arise immediately.  I think one of the most important chapters in the report is chapter 3, &ldquo;Society and Crime&rdquo;, which invites us to debate how society views crime.  There is a Durkheimian notion at one stage in the report where it more or less argues about the causes of crime and states that the purpose of society is more or less to reproduce itself and that society must deal with its offenders in a particular way.  I am not sure that that is the project of people like myself.  It certainly is not to reproduce the existing society uncritically the way it is.</P>
    <P>That raises another question.  The hysteria in that group of newspapers to which I referred earlier is entirely directed at the control of society.  It is not directed at understanding society.  I have spent nearly 20 years lecturing in the area of criminology and the one division I would <Col N="58" /> make between the literature on the subject has been that there are those who set out to understand the causes and nature of crime and imprisonment and there are those who want, in fact, effective techniques of control &mdash;&ldquo;control-ology&rdquo; if you like.  I believe that we have to move beyond the notion of imagining that we have an enormously greater crime crisis than we have and of developing short term hysterical reactions based on fear, demanding even more stringent measures of control, towards a more patient understanding of the complexity of the causes of crime.  I argue in favour of that.</P>
    <P>In one of the early chapters the report came down in favour of factors that could be used to prevent the rate of crime. It spoke in favour of the restriction of penalties to keep people out of prison and to reduce the length of time in prison. It spoke about the reduction of the term of imprisonment.  I think that running through this report too is this question of recidivism.  Why do people keep coming back again and again and again to prison? The question that arises from the extreme right &mdash; and I hate using these terms but let us say from the people who are the harshest in their response to the crime wave &mdash; would be this: let us make it so unattractive for them in prison that they will never want to go back there again. They speak of colour television sets that they themselves have not.  We all listen to this kind of stuff.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about what happens in prisonisation, or going to prison.  First of all, there are three separate things happening.  There is the psychological adjustment that is going on in the person who perceives that he is going to prison. I have to take the flow chart for example that is in the information appendix to this report.  I think it is in Dr. Rottman's paper.  You will see that those who go to prison are in fact, a very small proportion of those who ever commit offences.  From the moment that they have been apprehended right to the moment they surrender their clothes and their items are listed, they are having an adjustment in themselves as to the kind of person they are.  There is surely a change of identity <Col N="59" /> going on.  When they enter prison itself there is an atmosphere in which they can, for example, decide to be isolates or they can decide to mix with other prisoners who are parts of some kind of criminal sub-culture; or they may decide to try to make a fist of it by working out some way of managing the experience of prison itself.  One way or another that process goes on.  As well as that, their social links to society have now been disrupted.  Skills which the rest of us take for granted in relation to education, work and human and other skills are now disrupted and shrunk, even in regard to relating to people of the opposite sex.</P>
    <P>Then we come on to the other setting altogether, and that is when they come out of prison.  These people have diminished skills and disrupted social relationships. They have equally the problem that society still has not made up its mind whether the slate is wiped clean because everybody has a record.  Many particularly the juvenile offenders, go back into an environment of overcrowded housing, high rates of unemployment, extreme poverty and to other people, for example, who now have something to share, that is, experience of having been in prison.  Therefore inter-generationally and intra-generationally, there is the exchange of the experience of prison.  I found, as I read the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System, a humane emphasis on this.  I think that every little humane gesture that has been made so far, historically, has been supported in the report.  It speaks correctly of the advantages of the juvenile liaison system.  They warn about the excesses of &ldquo;controlology&rdquo;, if you like, rather than understanding the nature of crime.  They tell us in chapter 7 of the business of prison regimes and prison rules.</P>
    <P>It is one thing to look at prison rules as they are on paper.  It is another thing to look at them as they are experienced by people who are in prison.  I recall evidence being given to the MacBride Commission, when I was a member of it, <Col N="60" /> of rules being invented by those in charge of particular sections of a prison indicating that one prisoner, for example, could not hand a library book to another prisoner, or the way that the prisoner could get his hair done.  There was a whole series of informal rules in prisons.  I look forward to the day &mdash; and I place it on the record for about the fifth time in my ten years in both Houses &mdash; when we will be able to get into the Irish prisons to do the research that we were able to do when I was working in the United States where the prisons were far more open and where people could do some work on prisons, their background and conditions.  In that respect the Whitaker report has broken ground and all of us working in the area of criminology must welcome it.</P>
    <P>It think the report in relation to the general movement of the establishment of a separate board or institution to look after prisons is to be welcomed, even though I share the reservation of the Prisoners' Rights Organisation about the fact that the Department of Justice will still be left with control.  This is less than the recommendation we made in the MacBride Commission.  I am in favour of severing the connection with the Department of Justice, but I welcome the report as far as it has gone in relation to this question of setting up an independent board and an independent chief officer.</P>
    <P>What the report says about women's prisons bears out what many of us have been saying.  For example, in 1983 some 40 per cent of women offenders committed to custody under sentence were 21 years of age or less.  This is stated on page 73 of the report.  Some 80 per cent had been convicted of offences which did not involve personal violence.  Apart from a very few people, there is no case for having women in prison in Ireland.  There is no justification for it, historically or any other way.</P>
    <P>In relation to the personal development of prisoners and on education, page 97 of the report warns against a certain tendency.  I quote:</P>
    <P>...Over the past two years educational provision has not kept pace <Col N="61" /> with the greatly increased numbers entering prisons nor is it likely to do so unless there is a formal policy decision in this regard.</P>
    <P>I would urge that more and more provision be made for the education of prisoners and for the kind of education which provides a range of choices suitable to prisoners' needs.  Of course, the cynics, again commenting, said that the real reason for having less prisons and shorter time in prison was the quotation on page 147:</P>
    <P>...for every 100 fewer new prisoners there will be a saving to public funds of:</P>
    <P>Capital outlay &mdash; £12.7m</P>
    <P>Annual cost &mdash; £3.8m</P>
    <P>Therefore, they said it would be less expensive to have non-custodial measures.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by saying this, because many Senators will want to speak and contribute to the debate on this motion. I would invite them to look in particular at the section on pages 248 and 249 which gives a description of the prison regime:</P>
    <P>The daily routine in all the institutions is fairly standard.  It is based on a time-table which allows for work or education activities in the mornings and afternoons and recreation in the evenings (outdoor during the summer).  During winter one hour's outdoor recreation each day (weather permitting) must be given.  The main features of the routine are the long lock-up time (about 16 hours and the short time available for work or education activities (about 4 hours).  A typical time-table is:</P>
    <P>8.00-8.15 a.m. morning call, unlock</P>
    <P>8.30 a.m. Breakfast and lock-up</P>
    <P>9.30 a.m. Unlock.  Work/Education</P>
    <P>12.30 p.m. Dinner and lock-up</P>
    <P>2.15 p.m. Unlock.  Work/Education</P>
    <P>4.30 p.m. Tea and lock-up</P>
    <P>5.15 p.m. Unlock and recreation</P>
    <P>7.00 p.m. Supper</P>
    <P>7.30-8.00 p.m. Lock-up</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> Do all those who feel that those of us who are in favour of reforming the prisons are simply soft or liberal hear the word &ldquo;lock&rdquo; so often in that quotation that I have read?  The deprivation of freedom itself is a sufficient invasion into the life of an individual to ask the question: &ldquo;what have we done in our society to make it so necessary that so many people have to suffer a regime like this?&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, of course, so many other recommendations in the report that the speakers can tease out. Could I just say this in the end?  There is the suggestion, for example, that we change the method of appointing these visiting committees and that we allow prisoners access to the Office of the Ombudsman.  We need proper, practical visiting committees, who in the short term are interested in improving the lot of people in prison.</P>
      <P>I am left with the image again of prison. What was the purpose of prison initially? Has it achieved its aim of being a deterrent?  Was it ever allowed or attempted?  Even the Quakers have abandoned the purpose for prison of rehabilitation. Is prison not really more the expression of the fears of a public that has not even begun to understand their own society?</P>
      <P>I move this motion on behalf of Labour Party.  I strongly urge the Government to go further than the Minister for Justice's welcome.  He said he generally welcomed the report.  I urge them to prepare a time scale for the implementation of its main proposals in the short term in the interest of those in prison.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make my contribution to this <Col N="63" /> debate.  The report is a very comprehensive one of 360 pages.  I feel there is no way that all the matters dealt with could be covered in a contribution of 15 minutes.  I propose to take some the points in the report and make my comments on them.  I would hope that all the recommendations of the report would be taken care of by the Minister within a reasonable time scale, as Senator Michael D. Higgins has said.</P>
      <P>I am not very knowledgable in the area of prison reform.  I am interested in it. More precisely I am interested in the human beings, the people who are in the prisons.  A decent standard should be available to them.  Their dignity should be considered.  I recall in the late fifties when occasionally I went on the weekend retreat in Rathfarnham to the Jesuits. It was a wonderful experience in many ways.  The food was good.  There was central heating.  Very comfortable beds.  A psychiatrist to advise people who wanted advice.  When people were leaving on the Monday morning an envelope was left on a breakfast plate so that people who took part could make some contribution.  If they did not feel like it, they might not make a contribution.  I recall sometime afterwards the late Brendan Behan writing that he was in a very bad way until he discovered the Jesuit retreat house at Rathfarnham and he could have a luxury week end for nothing.</P>
      <P>None of us would want to get that kind of set up in the prisons &mdash; to make it that attractive.  But I feel that a reasonable standard should be provided.  That is something that is dealt with in this report and which I hope to comment on.  I would like to quote from page 26, paragraph 2.73.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee shares the Government's obvious concern that the upward trend in the cost of the prison system be curbed and has indicated in Chapter 143 the unacceptable addition to capital and current costs which could arise unless a policy of limiting prisoner <Col N="64" /> numbers by such means as fewer committals, shorter sentences and shorter periods in custody is put into operation. The effect of the Committee's recommendations in relation to these critical factors has been assessed in Chapter 13 and is substantial.  Further raising of the standard remission would give scope for increased curtailment of present numbers.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2.74 states:</P>
    <P>The proper yardstick for measuring the financial implications of adopting recommendations and policies which would obviate an increase in prisoner numbers is that, for every 100 fewer new prisoners there will be a saving to public funds of a capital outlay of £12.7 million and an annual running cost of £3.8 million at (1985 prices).</P>
    <P>I know that cost is a serious consideration, but it is not the only consideration. We are dealing here with tragedies in human lives.  Obviously, any improvement as regards having fewer people in our prisons would be a benefit to society.</P>
    <P>I also wonder if prison and imprisonment changes anyone for the better.  I am sure there must be some survey that would give this information.  Like Senator M.D. Higgins, I would ask if it is an appropriate response.  He feels it is an incredibly inhuman response and that only those very bruised by society are committed to prisons.  We know that many people are vulnerable at different stages in their lives and, perhaps, a little help at some time would assist people in this area of crime.  There was a saying that we were taught in our school days: &ldquo;There but for the grace of God go I&rdquo;. There is good in all those people.  I am wondering is imprisonment the proper response.  Does it change people for the better?  I am sure that there are some inherently evil people that it may be difficult to change and in some of the crime that is committed at the present time we can see this.  Recently in County Meath three young thugs broke into a bungalow, set it on fire and then attempted to set the lady on fire.  They also threatened to cut off her fingers if <Col N="65" /> they could not get the rings on her hands. There must be something inherently evil in that situation.  I could understand there being one lunatic, one such criminal, but three of them together is difficult to understand.  For the majority of people I believe that there is something good in all of us.</P>
    <P>The committee's terms of reference were very wide.  They are mentioned in the report.  They are abbreviated on page 8.  It states:</P>
    <P>2.1 The Committee's terms of reference may reasonably be interpreted to mean that a solution is being sought to the following major problems:</P>
    <P>(1)  The growth in crime and the demand for prison accommodation;</P>
    <P>(2)  The shortcomings in the facilities and services for prisoners;</P>
    <P>(3)  The inadequacy and unsuitability of much of the present prison accommodation;</P>
    <P>(4)  Unsatisfactory relations between Department, prison managements and staff;</P>
    <P>(5)  The escalating cost of providing and maintaining prisons and places of detention.</P>
    <P>In Chapter 2 the report deals with the growth in crime and in demand for prison accommodation.  It points out the serious situation which should be deplored that there has been a pronounced growth of crime in recent decades.  Much of this was in the form of offences against property such as burglaries and thefts of motor vehicles.  Although property crimes not involving violence have predominated, serious crimes resulting in personal injury and even in killings have escalated alarmingly. That is something with which we must all be concerned.  This is stated categorically in the report.  I assume it must be correct and that it was researched and the figures must be there to bear this out. These serious crimes include robbery, rape and attacks on elderly people.  The growth of crime has been overwhelmingly an urban phenomenon and crime is <Col N="66" /> becoming increasingly a full time, organised affair.  It goes on to state that:</P>
    <P>The growth in crime and in the demand for prison accommodation can be dealt with effectively only by: preventing and curbing crime; confining the penalty of imprisonment to more appropriate cases and reducing the length of stay in prison.</P>
    <P>These are three ways that any reasonable person would understand and would come to mind immediately when considering the situation.  With regard to prevention and curbing of crime, it states:</P>
    <P>There is need for continuous research into the causes of crime.</P>
    <P>This is something I think that should not need to be emphasised.  In every area and in every profession one of the most important considerations is keeping abreast of developments and continuous research.  In most professions it is important to spend the equivalent of half a day reading up to keep abreast of developments. This is something that would have been done, should have been done and must have been done in many areas. There has undoubtedly been a widespread lowering of behavioural standards, which is something I am sure we would all deplore.  It is stated without qualification in the report that: &ldquo;Not all crime can be attributed to social deprivation or disadvantage, however, nor can social conditions be regarded as according a licence for wrong-doing.&rdquo;  These are two very important statements.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not all crime can be attributed to social deprivation&rdquo;: This is true and there are many people who have come through life in very deprived circumstances and have not resorted to crime.  On the other hand, I am sure we would all agree that social conditions should not be regarded as according a licence for wrong-doing.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to alcohol which is covered very comprehensively in this report.  Alcoholism is the <Col N="67" /> source of many crimes.  I am not against alcohol.  Alcohol can play an important part in its proper place.  Alcohol solves no problem but brings about many other problems.  Alcohol is and has been the curse of this country.  I would like to have the opportunity of reading the parts of the report which deal with alcohol and drugs, but as my time has run out I will conclude on that note.  I thank the committee for such a comprehensive and full report.  I hope that the recommendations will be incorporated by the Minister within a comparatively short time.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this motion:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the enlightened and practical prison reforms proposed in the Whitaker Committee Report, and calls on the Government to implement the Report as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>While I do not go along with the entire wording of the report and while in my limited experience I would not readily welcome all the recommendations in the report nevertheless I think that the work that our former colleague, Mr. Whitaker, and his committee have put into this indepth study merits the attention of all of us who have the opportunity of making an input in this very important if difficult area of public administration.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to compliment the Minister and the Department for the continuing improvement to the regimes in the business at present.  It is difficult to know in these changing times what roles the prisons should have.  The question has already been posed: do prison or custodial sentences change people?  That is a pertinent question. We have an obligation to protect the public from offenders, especially from people who are now given to committing the most outrageous crimes, especially crimes not only against property but against persons themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an excellent report.  It reflects a huge amount of study.  In forming this review committee on the penal system, <Col N="68" /> the Minister set out very clear terms of reference.  The committee was asked:</P>
    <P>(a)  to examine the law in regard to imprisonment and related areas with a view to establishing whether (i) a reduction in the number of persons being committed and (ii) a shortening of the periods of committal generally and/or the periods served can be achieved.</P>
    <P>(b)  to evaluate the adequacy, capacity and range of the existing accommodation for prisoners particularly for female prisoners and juvenile detainees and the planned additions and improvements to it,</P>
    <P>(c)  to examine all aspects of the regimes observed in the institutions and the facilities available to prisoners and detainees on their release from custody,</P>
    <P>(i)  the number and deployment of prison service staff,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the management structure relating to the operation of institutions,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the recruitment and training of Prison Service staff,</P>
    <P>(iv)  staff management relations in the prison system</P>
    <P>(d)  to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly heavy workload and it is very appropriate that it should have been carried out, more especially when we look at the physical prisons we have.  In the main they were provided by Queen Victoria; at least the one in Portlaoise must have been provided at that time and it is in fairly good order as it is but at the same time it is an old building.  While it is secure, it is still perhaps a hundred years old and so the Minister has a difficulty there.</P>
    <P>The first thing that I should like to see the Government providing the Minister with is adequate finance in order to enable him to improve, construct, or remodel the existing prison facilities.  I think that is a matter of urgency.  There <Col N="69" /> is not much use in anyone coming into the House and telling the Minister what to do unless there is a demand that adequate finance should be provided and I think it should be provided as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>We have had over the last couple of years a great increase in the number of people committed to custodial prison terms.  From 1972 to 1982 the prison population, perhaps, was static or in the main only rose by a couple of hundred, roughly around 1,000 in the early seventies to 1,200 in 1982, but from 1982 to this year the figures have gone from 1,200 to approximately 2,000 and that sharp increase in a short time must surely put additional strains on the facilities available.</P>
    <P>The genial rogue who is caught and has to serve a prison sentence is a thing of the past and the people who break the law now are, in the main, people who show very little humanity when they are committing those crimes and, in addition, many of these people have drugs and are on drugs related offences.  There is a necessity to convert a safe place for custodial sentences for to deal specifically with drug offenders or people who have drug problems.  It is something that the Minister should try to take on board as a matter of great urgency.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is a tendency in our country, especially where the media are concerned, to show great humanity and consideration for the prisoners.  While, in most cases, the unfortunate victims make the headlines when the crime is committed, once the excitement dies down everybody wants to see these poor prisoners treated with kid gloves, as if they were not serving sentences which were imposed as a direct result of their irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>Let me just make a few remarks about Portlaoise prison with which I am relatively familiar being a visitor to that institution. I think that if you are to go by media coverage over the last number of years you would be inclined to write off the prison officers and the prison staff as people who were not doing a good job or who were truculent or were creating <Col N="70" /> problems or whatever.  I come from a county that has traditionally been the recruiting ground for a high percentage of people who opted to work out their lives in the prison service and from my personal experience I can say that the prison officers I meet &mdash; and we have about 300 in the Portlaoise area &mdash; are just an ordinary cross-section of run of the mill people.  The people I see working when I go into the jail are courteous and do an excellent job.  They are dedicated and I think they carry out their duties with a tremendous amount of humanity.  They do a difficult job under difficult circumstances and they deserve a fair amount of recognition for that.</P>
    <P>We have a couple of main problems down there and the report itself, if it lacks, certainly lacks in the area that while it mentions the difficult situation in Portlaoise specifically, it does not really appreciate the difficulties that the staff, the Minister and the Department have in their work in the interest of the security of the State where Portlaoise is concerned. In many of the recommendations, whether there is sex discrimination or not in relation to the appointment of staff or whatever, a clear exception should be made.  If there was complete disregard for sex discrimination in a place like Portlaoise I do not think it would last overnight.  We are dealing with a different kind of prisoner there and the Minister must retain for himself the responsibility and the obligation for ensuring the security of an institution where there are subversive prisoners.</P>
    <P>The report deals with recruitment, and Chapter 2.59 deals with the appointment to governor and assistant governor grades.  The recommendation is that these should be brought in from outside the service.  That would be a pity because in the service the number of prison officers at about 1,500 or 2,000 people is not very high and unless there is a definite ladder of promotion where people can aspire to a job at or near the top there is not much incentive.  We would do the prison service a great disservice if we started bringing in people at the top from the outside.  That is one recommendation <Col N="71" /> I would not like to see followed through. That does not mean that the Department, and the Minister, should not extend to people who are deserving of promotion the training that is prescribed for the people who are promoted from chief to assistant governor.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of mentioning Baladde House, a building that looks very well in Portlaoise on the main road.  It has excellent accommodation and I suggest to the Minister that he might consider at this stage converting that for short-term prisoners, first offenders or those in for traffic convictions or something like that.  I do not think it would cost that much to convert that place and make it relatively safe. That could be done by putting something on the windows, replacing some internal doors and putting a wall or a protective fence around it.  In addition, it should be part of the Portlaoise complex so that it could be complementary to the general prison in Portlaoise.  It is the fastest way that I can see of easing the prison population problem.</P>
    <P>Another very pressing problem is the need for a small psychiatric unit in Portlaoise. Right across the road is St. Fintans and there would not be any great difficulty in staffing it from there.  It would certainly keep a safe service within the prison.  In addition we need a few beds for ordinary medical cases because it is just not on for high security prisoners to be put in the general hospital in Portlaoise. It is not in the interests of patients or visitors to the general hospital to have heavily armed police or soldiers in the corridors, on the roof or surrounding areas of the hospital.  It puts everybody on edge and it is most unfair to the population of County Laois to have that continue. In addition the cost this year so far of security for the few prisoners that have been in the general hospital has gone into six figures.  I would appeal to the Minister to provide appropriate facilities within the prison complex in Portlaoise as a matter of urgency.  Indeed it would actually save the Department money.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that we should be discussing this report on a day when there has been a lot of controversy about activities in prisons and in particular the manner in which a prisoner was allowed to leave Mountjoy.  It is suggested that rather than being thrown on to the streets of Dublin he should have been sent for care and attention to a hospital outside the prison system.  It has been suggested today that a prisoner who has a very severe physical problem was allowed on to the streets of Dublin without any care or attention being given to what would happen to him when he went out, that he got no help from the people who were in charge of his welfare in the prison, from the medical system in the prison, and it is suggested that he could now be a danger to his own health and equally he could create problems for other people because of his physical condition. It has been suggested that there was a breakdown in the policy of the prisons towards those whom they are releasing into society again.  It has been suggested that a person who is severely ill was not given the type of help that anybody would need, whether they were leaving a prison, a boarding school or their home.  In this instance a person who was in prison for committing a very serious offence and who had a serious illness did not get the type of help that one would expect in the situation which arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Whitaker Committee is very welcome and it comes at a time when we have many problems in Irish society.  When there is an increase in crime it is often the war cry of people that the offenders should be locked up and the keys thrown away.  Unfortunately locking up people and throwing away the keys does nothing to help the people who have been involved in particular crimes nor does it help the society in which they have been living and in which they have been trying to survive.  The report addresses itself quite rightly to the problems we have which in the end put people into prison.  The problems of society in general are reflected in the size of our prison population.  I am not too sure who initially decided that by imprisoning <Col N="73" /> people one would get a better society but I am sure the idea behind imprisonment is a long way from the current situation where prison seems to be the only answer.</P>
    <P>It is very hard for anybody who has never been in prison to understand what imprisonment means.  We should all lock ourselves into a room occasionally and have somebody throw away the key for 24 or 48 hours so that we could get some idea what it is like to lose one's freedom.</P>
    <P>The lack of freedom is probably the greatest punishment a person can suffer. Once a person is locked up and has to live with a regime which is enforced on him by the organisation of the unit he is in, all his freedoms go, fredom of thought, freedom of action and so on. Too often prisons, just like hospitals, are run so that the organisation of the day-to-day feeding and bedding down is done in an orderly manner.  That is possibly one of the things that creates the most problems.  I would not like to have to stay in a locked room.  I would always like to have access to a door in a house or in a building.  I can see why a number of people who are imprisoned can, when released, have major psychological problems which are not being addressed.  The problem of the imprisonment and the problems associated with release are not being looked at.  This report is a policy for prisons and looks at the system and why we have a growth in the crime rate, the shortcomings in facilities and the inadequacy of the physical prisons, but there is not enough in this report about the psychological overhauls that have to take place.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years we have had a growth in the crime rate.  I heard somebody on the radio say this morning that crimes, generally speaking, are committed by people from the lower social strata.  Of course he was talking about particular crimes.  He was talking about crimes of violence, crimes which leave people physically abused rather than crimes which mentally abuse people. What we would like to see is an analysis of the people who are in prison, and I suppose the person who was speaking on <Col N="74" /> the radio would be proven right in saying that 95 per cent of the people who are in prisons would be from the socially deprived areas, whereas I suppose 60 per cent of the crimes would be committed by people who would not be from the lower order in terms of access to means. District justices and judges tend to send people from a working class or unemployed background to jail whereas they do not address themselves in the same manner to people who are not of the working or unemployed class.  It does seem that on too many occasions people who go to court who have come from &lsquo;good&rsquo; backgrounds are not sent to jail. It has been suggested that the fact of appearing in court is enough to stop them from doing anything untoward in the future.  But in fact that is not what happens. People from reasonably well off families have gone into court again and again just as people from deprived backgrounds have gone to court again and again and there is no way that a district justice or a judge in 20 minutes or an hour in a court could assess psychologically what a particular defendant would do if he got away with the crime he had committed or if he was put on probation rather than put in jail.</P>
    <P>The growth in crime generally speaking has been against property.  I do not think that crimes against the person are on the increase.  I suppose it is reasonable for somebody who has no property not to think very much of the property of somebody else.  I am not suggesting that they should feel that way but I am suggesting that it is an attitude that could be taken by somebody who has nothing.  He may feel that he should take from somebody who, he feels, has a lot.</P>
    <P>There have been horrific crimes against the person, but I would not suggest they are on the increase.  Crimes against property are.  As long as there is inequity in the distribution of property one will always have crimes against property.  I suppose that is a term that one should not really use because there should be no such thing as a crime against property; I suppose one should say that it is a crime against the owner of property.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> In this report there is too much emphasis being placed on the cost of keeping people in jail.  It is suggested that it costs £29,000 per annum to keep a person in jail at present and that this money could be better used in trying to rehabilitate or trying to change the system so that you would not have as many people in jail. Apparently there are 1,865 people in jail at present and it is costing £42.6 million to keep them there.  That is a lot of money.  A sum of £42.6 million invested in rehabilitation of people who have been in trouble would be a very small amount of money, but £42.6 million to keep 1,865 people incarcerated in inhumane overcrowded and archaic conditions should not be on in the Ireland of 1985.  Our jails are overcrowded.  There is an absolutely minimal attempt to rehabilitate people who go to jail.  There is not nearly sufficient provision for education in our prisons, not is there anything like a humane attitude towards prisoners.  If somebody goes to jail, why should his wife and children be tarred with the same brush? Why should they not have rights to go into prison or to have some area where they could meet and talk?  This does not mean that there are not people who should be incarcerated but they should be incarcerated in areas where they would have help.  They should have psychiatric help, they should have medical help and they should be helped to readjust themselves in society when they get out.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Senator McDonald that the prison officers are in a very difficult situation.  They work under conditions which are not conducive to normal life for themselves or for the people they are supposed to help.  We must look at the situation particularly in Portlaoise where there is a tripartite operation going on, where there are prison officers inside, and then the Garda and the Army are also involved.</P>

I welcome the report.  It is the first step in an attempt to highlight the problems in the prison service and I sincerely hope that some of the proposals will be put into effect as soon as possible.  I would sincerely hope that in 12 months' time we will have far fewer people in the type of prison we have and that a better effort will be made to help those who get into trouble whether it is because they were born in the wrong place at the wrong time or because of their association with people with whom they should not be involved.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will have regard to everything in this report and I am quite confident that he will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report and I voice my appreciation of the competence of the people involved in this.  Of course, this could not be realised without a very good back-up service and I extend my thanks to them also.</P>
      <P>The report itself shows great compassion towards those affected by the penal system, those who have to give effect to it and those who work within it. It also shows great understanding of the needs of the penal system itself and it does so having regard to the many changes in society which we have witnessed in recent years.  Not only does it have regard to the many changes in society but it looks at it in the sense of taking stock of the transformation of Irish society over recent decades.  In its terms of reference it had regard to the widespread deterioration in behavioural patterns and it came up with suggestions and ideas which are under examination now. There is an acknowledgment in it that the accommodation in prisons is inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of prison accommodation is dealt with in the context of examining the possibility of preventing and curbing crime, confining the penalty of imprisonment to more appropriate cases and reducing the length of stay in prisons.  It is <Col N="77" /> good to see the committee's suggestions regarding the length of stay in prisons because the Minister has been subjected to a great deal of criticism &mdash; wrongly applied, in my view, over the question of early release.  The Minister has explained this matter in the other House.  He is vindicated somewhat by the committee on the question of early release.  On the other hand, the Minister acknowledged the need for more prison space by opening Spike Island.  I suppose the Minister had in mind that the crime rate would increase somewhat and that the crime detection rate would increase following the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act.  The Prisoners Rights Organisation backed that view.  I do not know whether the committee were correct in their forecast that the crime rate would double over the next two years.  They say it has increased by 40 per cent since 1982.  I am not in a position to challenge this.  The opening of Spike Island is indicative of the fact that the Minister recognised the problem of prison space.  He has also taken some other action regarding conditions in prisons but I will not go into that now.</P>
    <P>On the question of overcrowding, St. Patrick's Institution in Cork which has a capacity for 120 prisoners had 320, according to the records I looked up.  St. Patrick's Institution in Dublin, with a capacity for 229 prisoners, had 242; Mountjoy Prison, with a capacity for 420 prisoners, had 519; Arbour Hill, with a capacity for 99 prisoners, had 123.  There is clear evidence of the need for more prison space.  The committee, in bringing in the report, have had regard to this, not only in the sense of recommending development in the area of prisons but in the sense of dealing with the question of non-serious crimes in a different light and applying different types of punishment.</P>
    <P>The total cost to the taxpayer for the battle against crime is £300 million.  The prisons system cannot be taken in isolation; it has to be examined in the overall context.  There is the argument that it costs £29,000 to keep a prisoner for a year.  This is a substantial sum of money. The figures are difficult to relate to each <Col N="78" /> other.  The report makes recommendations that would not only assist in the problem of prison accommodation but would also assist in dealing with the overall problem of crime.</P>
    <P>The report of the National Economic and Social Council on crime and vandalism is another interesting one.  We, in the Labour Party have been argued against because we have made the claim that there is a relationship between, crime, unemployment and participation in education. Not everybody accepted our view, but at least the NESC report accepted it.  The report analysed the 1981 figures and pointed to the two main characteristics of persons brought before the criminal justice system that year.  For example, one in four was 16 years or less, one in three was 17 years to 20 years and only 42 per cent were 21 years of age or older.  In each age group the majority were unemployed, unskilled or semi-skilled labourers.  On the second point in this context the NESC report stated that only 37 per cent of those aged 17 years or less were still in school, while 54 per cent in that age group were listed as unemployed; eight in every ten persons in the 17-20 age group were unemployed; the remainder were either in unskilled or semi-skilled manual work.  Similarily in the 21 age group 76 per cent were listed as unemployed.</P>
    <P>The picture becomes even more bleak when the analysis is confined to the inner city offenders.  The syndrome of unemployment and early school leaving is very pronounced.  This is not new.  As one who was born and reared in the north inner city, I know this is not new.  It is a different type of crime and the emphasis is different; but the idea of crime being related to unemployment and lack of education is not new.  In the inner city there are in the region of 700 relapse offenders who continually come back through the criminal justice system.  There is a correlation and we should not bury our heads in the sand in regard to this situation.</P>
    <P>There are in the region of 250,000 unemployed.  Over 50 per cent of the population are under 30 years of age.  We must realise that it is a serious situation. <Col N="79" /> Where the committee make recommendations to make this problem less acute the Minister should grasp them with both hands.  While he may not be able to do anything immediately about the unemployment situation, we trust that the initiative taken in relation to grants and so on may lead to some alleviation of it. Development in the inner cities has been undertaken by the various corporations to make these areas more lived in.  If the fear of employers to set up industries in the inner cities could be overcome, then I think we could deal with that problem</P>
    <P>I do not want to go on too long but just in the last minute or so, I want to say that a question here that we should not overlook when we are dealing with this report is the detection of crime.  As I understand it, between 1974 and 1983 according to the report on crime by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to the Minister for Justice, there was a drop in the detection rate of crime between those years.  I do not know what the situation is now and it would not be fair for me to just leave it at that.  I would like the Minister to let us know if that situation has changed.</P>
    <P>I would like to wind up by saying that my remarks should not be taken as criticising the Minister on the ground that the drop in the detection rate is due to the cutback in overtime.  That is not the position as the Minister has provided money in the <i>Building on Reality</i> programme for overtime for the Garda.  That is not an argument and I would not like to hear it coming back as an argument.  Detection of crime has to be associated with other things.  We are talking about a cost of £300 million to the taxpayer; we are talking about people who are deprived; we are talking about a system that is generally causing havoc in our society.  Generally speaking, if we look at the report, there is a great deal in it that can make us advance very quickly indeed.  The Minister welcomed the report.  In his capacity as Minister he probably has to be a little cautious about it, but my own view is that it deserves more than just a welcome.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I also thank the Minister of State who is present here tonight.  I will be brief on this issue.</P>
      <P>I want to bring to the attention of the Minister the extremely bad condition of Oldcastle Garda station and the urgent need to carry out necessary structural repairs to alleviate the problem and to allow the Garda to carry out their duties in a more healthy and improved environment. Oldcastle Garda station was erected in 1882.  It was then used as a station for the old Royal Irish Constabulary. After the Treaty and during the Civil War the barracks was in possession of and manned by the Free State police.  Its history is very interesting. On the 15 September 1922 the barracks was attacked by the IRA.  Two huge bombs were placed at the barracks, one at the front entrance and one at the back entrance.  I believe only one of the bombs exploded and it caused severe structural damage and roof damage.  I believe the much larger bomb was at the back entrance and it failed to explode.  Had it exploded it would have blown half of the town of Oldcastle up or down, whichever way you like to put it.  After this episode the station was vacated for 12 months to allow the necessary repairs to be carried out.  It was then repossessed and has continued as a barracks since then.  At that time 24 hour duty was being performed at the station which has been in continuous operation since the Garda Force was established and the building itself is constructed from limestone.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> It is a two-storey building which comprises a day room, size 13' 8&rdquo; by 13' 4&rdquo; which contains files, records, and lockers for the Garda sergeant and three gardaí who are on duty there.  There is a small hall at the rear of the barracks.  There is a small toilet and that is the only station accommodation available at the present time.  The remainder of the barracks was previously used as living accommodation for the sergeant in charge of the Garda station.  The vacant space, as proposed accommodation for the future, comprises a kitchen and sitting room downstairs. Upstairs there are four rooms and a toilet.  When the building is renovated it will provide accommodation for the Garda sergeant's office, locker room and other much needed storage space.  It should be noted that at present the station has not even got a cell to hold a prisoner should the need arise.</P>
    <P>The entire station reeks with dampness. There is fungus growing on the walls between the stone floors and the wooden presses there.  Paint is falling off the walls and grey mortar is exposed.  I believe this is a very poor environment for the gardaí to work in and carry out their duties. Worse still it is a poor introduction for the general public upon entering the station. The hallway and toilets are in a dreadful condition.  This is the area where members have their personal lockers and hang up their coats, hats etc. upon taking up duty.  In general this station presents a very poor image and many comments to this effect have been voiced by the general public upon entering the station. I believe that the patience of the gardaí must surely be exhausted by this time. The barracks is an embarrassment to the gardaí who are stationed there.  I honestly believe that no other State employed sector would have tolerated this situation for so long.  I understand that plans have been approved for renovation of the barracks and in fact I believe that money has been sanctioned for the project.  The Board of Works have approved the plans for conversion of the old married quarters for station accommodation and a sum of £23,000, I understand has been approved and sanctioned.</P>

      <Col N="82" /> I am calling on the Minister here tonight to use his good offices to have the work carried out at Oldcastle Garda station to alleviate these deplorable conditions which I have just described.  We will agree that we are living at a time when the public must depend on a good, strong and well-equipped Garda force. We are lucky in that the Garda station in Oldcastle has always been well received and respected by the citizens of that area and the Garda have given tremendous service down through the years.</P>
    <P>I might also add that Oldcastle is one of the most crime-free towns in Ireland today and I am very proud of that fact. There has always been tremendous liaison between the gardaí and the people in that area.  That, in no small way, has contributed to the good crime situation. I would like to place on record my appreciation and that of the people in the area of the tremendous service the gardaí have given down through the years.  I am sure that the Minister will appreciate that if the service I have mentioned is to continue at the same level, it is not alone desirable but most essential that the gardaí be allowed to work in a proper environment in order to carry out their duties most effectively.  I would greatly appreciate it if the Minister would use his good offices to have this matter rectified in the immediate future.  I thank him very much for coming here tonight.  I was not sure if it would be taken by the Department of Justice or by the Minister of State or the Department of the Environment. I am told that this issue of renovation of Garda stations can be tossed about from the Department of Finance to the Department of Justice to the Board of Works and back again and at the end of the day nobody seems to know who is responsible.  But I understand the Minister will probably be keen to take a personal interest in this issue and have the work carried out.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that we have no gardaí permanently stationed in Oldcastle and I remember the time, not so very long ago, when the Garda sergeant lived in the barracks &mdash; under very poor conditions, I might add &mdash; and reared his family <Col N="83" /> there.  Each garda in the town of Oldcastle provided his own accommodation or rented it.  At the present time we have not got one Garda member stationed in Oldcastle in permanent residence there. It is a matter of concern to me.  While it is a crime-free town, outside elements create havoc when they come to a place like Oldcastle, especially at Christmas time when premises are well stocked. They throw a stone through a window and rob and plunder.  People are defenceless.</P>
    <P>That is an issue which ought to be brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice.  Members of the Garda should have permanent residence in rural towns such as Oldcastle.  Our immediate problem is the condition of the station in Oldcastle. I am not blaming the Minister of State or the Minister for Justice.  This should have been done long ago.  Plans are in progress to alleviate the problem. I would ask the Minister to remedy the situation.</P>

      <P>I preface my remarks by saying that I sympathise with the gardaí who have lived in such conditions since 1922.  I accept that the accommodation is inadequate for the needs of the gardaí.  I am pleased to be able to say that the Office of Public Works have prepared a modernisation <Col N="84" /> scheme for this station which has been accepted by the Department of Justice and the necessary funds have been allocated to it.  The scheme involves the amalgamation of married quarters and the station proper and will provide (1) sergeant's office, (2) an interview room, (3) a doctor's room, (4) a cell, (5) a kitchen, (6) toilet and accommodation, (7) storage, (8) improved electrical and heating services and (9) complete internal and external redecoration.  I claim with some pride that this is the first time any improvements have been made to Oldcastle Garda station since 1922.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works expect to place a contract for the scheme early in 1986 and complete it by August or September of next year.  Regrettably, the planning of the scheme was delayed due to the shortage of architectural staff.  The money has been allocated.  The contract will be placed early in the new year and it is hoped it will be finished by August or September.</P>
