      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 23.  It is proposed to adjourn for a tea break from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ordered Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 23. No. 23 is a Private Members' motion.  Only one Private Members' motion can be taken at a time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression, from my communications with the Seanad Office, that the item on divorce was to be taken today.  Indeed, I put this motion down specifically for this reason this week, under a certain amount of pressure.  I was told it would certainly be taken this week and that this was agreed to by all parties.  I do not understand why it is not being taken today.</P>

      <P>As a member of the <Col N="944" /> Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, which is mentioned for discussion in this particular independent group motion, I would be unhappy if this motion were taken outside Government time because the net effect would be to ensure that Senators who wished to contribute &mdash; I imagine there would be a great number of them &mdash; would be restricted in their contributions to the debate to a period of 15 minutes.  Senator Ross&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Much as I dislike interrupting you, I cannot allow you to make a speech at this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not dream of making a speech or in any way upsetting you.  Referring back to a Seanad debate on Thursday, 23 May 1985, volume No. 108, column 731, in answer to a question on this matter from Senator Ross, Senator Dooge stated that the Government motion had been put down to ensure that there would be unrestricted debate on this matter.  There would be no limitation on the time of speeches or on the total time of the debate.  He went on to state that he anticipated that this would be taken some time during June.  I cannot understand why the bona fides of the Leader of the House could not have been taken as such by Senator Ross and why he wished to truncate the debate to stifle the freedom of expression on what is a most important issue.</P>
      <P>How could we possibly, in the space of 15 minutes, hope to do justice to the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown which took almost two years to compile and which engaged the energies and commitment of so many Members of the House?  We would be doing a disservice to the whole question of marriage breakdown in our community.  We would be ensuring that the debate would be a very abbreviated one and would not in any way further the issue, which I am sure we all care about deeply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose as an amendment to the Order of Business that we take item No. 4 today.  I propose this specifically because there is an absolute breach <Col N="945" /> of the rules of this House.  It is quite extraordinary that No. 23 should be proposed for today because Senator McGuinness is not in the House.  Senator McGuinness will not be able to be present, as far as I know, this evening at any time.  The agreement of this House is that the Independents' time is taken this evening.  I want to answer Senator Bulbulia's statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now going into debate.  This is what I asked Senator Bulbulia not to do.  I cannot have this chat across the House when I am still trying to clear the Order of Business.  If you could state precisely your amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That No. 4 be taken at 6.30 p.m. and that, to facilitate what is being said, it be made an open-ended debate. The reason why I put this motion down for today was that Senator Dooge had said that he had anticipated taking that motion in June.  I tend not to take the anticipations of politicians on the other side of the House terribly seriously.  That is not a commitment.  That is an anticipation. I want the issue of divorce debated in this House now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>To stay strictly within your guidelines on the Order of Business, I should like to say that personally I am in favour of item No. 10 rather than item No. 4.  I feel it would help matters if the Deputy Leader of the House in replying to this exchange on the Order of Business indicated a time for item No. 10.  I want to concur, without straying from what is strictly relevant to this exchange, with some of the points made by Senator Bulbulia. I would only like to make this point, lest we have a division on the Order of Business, that, as Chairman of the Labour Party, I can say that we have no difficulty whatsoever in relation to calling for a referendum without delay on the subject of the removal of the constitutional ban on divorce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, thank you for recalling me.  The second principle we have to decide is the timing and the circumstances of this discussion.  A discussion limited to 15 minutes would certainly be less effective than one which would be open-ended.  Senator Bulbulia has a point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business &mdash; and I do not intend to say much on this &mdash; Senator Ross said there was an agreement on all sides of the House that No. 4 be taken.  On this side of the House we had no indication at all that No. 4 was on the Order of Business.  We were dealing with Private Members' motions today and there was no motion of this nature on the Order of Business when we got it.  Under no circumstances should it be construed that we want to curtail debate on this very important issue.  This debate is too important to have it allowed to be taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to.  All I am saying is that I do not think it is appropriate that this debate should take place with the consent of a 15 minute limit on speakers.  It would not do justice to the subject which is of paramount importance to everybody in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to ask the Deputy Leader of the House one or two questions.  First, Independent Senators have time allocated to them; does motion 23 fall into that category?  If not, what exactly is the precise position in regard to Independent Senators' motions?  The second point I would make is that I feel that what both Senator Bulbulia and Senator M. Higgins said is very important. It was confirmed by Senator Lanigan that this is a matter of great concern, not only to people inside this Chamber but to the people of Ireland.  We do want to have a very full and extensive debate.  I <Col N="947" /> would like to ask as my second question to the Leader of the House, is it his intention to have this debate shortly or not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, my understanding is that it is unlikely that the House will be sitting during the next fortnight.  If that is the case, is it likely that we would be able to have a debate on this matter in the month of June?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the Order of Business as proposed and to agree with the Senators who have pointed out very clearly the importance of the discussion the House should have on the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown and that there certainly should be no curtailment of the debate on that very important topic.  Senator Robb raised the question, and I would just like to say that it is my experience that the House itself decides on the Order of Business and on all procedures in the House.  From that point of view the House can easily change its mind as it has done in the past several times during a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I can stick to the Order of Business.  I would just like to make one point clear.  It is a question of trust and understanding of the position regarding Independent Members' rights. I do not know where that all-round agreement came from.  As Whip of the Labour Party, I was not involved in coming to any arrangement that this item would be taken today.  Now that is the procedural position.  In that sense, I do not see myself breaking trust with the Private Members. The other thing is that I would be prepared to support the proposal that the fuller motion should be on the Order Paper for the next sitting day and I am sure that will take place before the end of June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of questions related to the amendment that I would like to ask.  The first is: does the Deputy Leader of the House have the permission of Senator McGuinness to introduce item 23?  The second is: how does a motion which is seconded by a member of the Labour Party become Independent Members' time?  The third is, why, if it was not anticipated that it should be taken there is a Government amendment to the motion from the Independent Senators?  I would suggest that failing an amendment as proposed by Senator Ross what the Government parties have done is decide for themselves what Independent Members are allowed to have discussed in this House which, of course, makes an entire mockery of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We thought we had a motion down on a specific issue, it appears to me now that the Government have decided what we are going to discuss in Private Members' time which, of course, is a complete shanghai-ing of the traditional rights of Members to have whatever issue they wish discussed in this House when they wish, however inappropriate other Members of the House might regard that.  It is not for anybody else to judge.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, perhaps Senator Ferris could tell us when it is proposed to have the Land Tax Bill in the House.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire the Senator's enthusiasm.  It is my prerogative to put amendments down in the name of the Government at any time to any motion. It does not necessarily mean that I had agreed to take the motion.  I am proposing the Order of Business and it is a matter for this House to decide on it.  In case there should be any confusion in <Col N="950" /> Senators minds, apart from the problem of 15 minutes which was suggested there is a problem that a Private Member's motion is confined to three hours.  There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that three hours is not enough time to debate this important motion or, indeed, the Government motion No. 10.  The committee spent two years discussing it and there are people in this House, apart from the Independents, who want to express their views one way or another on this issue and within three hours that might not happen.  That is one of the reasons I wanted to ensure that we would take No. 10 at the appropriate time.  I would propose now, in response to my colleague, Senator Michael Higgins, to ask the Leader of the House to order &mdash; or, if he is not acting on that day, I would order &mdash; No. 10 for 26 June which would give the opportunity then to the Independents to put an amendment down if they consider that No. 10 is not sufficient for them.  They can amend that in any way they like including some of the requirements that they have written into motion No. 4.  It is not unreasonable to propose No. 23 which in itself refers to very important social legislation.  I am quite sure that many people on both sides of the House would like to know it and Senator Catherine McGuinness is the leader of the Independent group&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="952" /> Question again proposed:  &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to add to my contribution of the last day here.  I mentioned the position regarding old graveyards and that in some of these there was a custom to have yew trees or trees which would be poisonous to animals.  In that situation farmers ensured that there would be no trespass on the graveyard.  This Bill does nothing for that situation.  Since then I have been told of a very old cemetery, Cruicetown, which is of national importance because it is connected with the Cruises, particularly Bridget Cruise who had close association with Turlough O'Carroll and the last of the bards.  I believe that cattle have broken into that old cemetery and they have broken down some of the tombstones and monuments.  There is a very important 12th century cross there which, fortunately, has not been interfered with.  I know of other cases where cattle have broken into old cemeteries. Section 2 deals with straying on the public road.  It is a pity a Bill of this kind does not take into consideration the position regarding old cemeteries and old monuments.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion also I mentioned, with regard to coursing and people who are opposed to coursing, that it seemed strange that muzzles were never suggested for greyhounds.  Indeed, I could say the same for fox hunting.  There are many people opposed to fox hunting.  If muzzles were provided for the hounds the killing of the animal, which is what most people object to, would be prevented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the fox population, I thought it was very unfair that what might be called modern methods of enticing the fox to be trapped were used until recently.  Tapes were played to reproduce sounds which brought the fox to a particular place to be caught.  However, the fox population does not seem to be in danger of extinction.  A few weeks back when <Col N="953" /> I was travelling home, just inside the Phoenix Park, about 200 yards in from the city, a fox ran across the road.  It was fairly close to the Zoo.  Possibly it was one of the inmates on a midnight stroll or maybe another animal who had been taking a stroll to the Zoo.  It is sad to see the number of badgers killed on our roads.  These seem to be increasing in the recent past.  Finally, I would like to say how reprehensible it is that the alleged sport or pastime of badger baiting has been carried on in some parts of the country because we are all very concerned about kindness to animals.</P>
    <P>This Bill which has been welcomed by everybody, with some reservations, is very short and has one section which deals with dogs.  Like many other people I think it is a pity that a separate Bill was not prepared to deal with the problems which we have with dogs.  At present there is considerable damage being done by dogs and dogs are a considerable danger in many situations.  We were told that up to 75 per cent of the dog population remains unlicensed.  It seems that this is a situation which needs attention and we could have a self-financing position here.  It seems untidy to bring in this one section to deal with that problem.  I believe it is not right to shoot a dog and farmers who find themselves in a position where dogs are worrying their sheep are not entitled to shoot a dog.  I am not ever sure if they are entitled to capture or detain the dog.  It seems to me from reading through the old Acts that they are not entitled to do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 2 and liability for negligence &mdash; I referred to this on the last occasion &mdash; it seems that the position at present is that if an animal wanders on to a public road and is the cause of an accident the owner of that animal, if the animal is killed, is entitled to compensation for the animal.  Through this Bill the position is being reversed.  In a situation where a farmer could prove that the animals got out through no fault of his, for example if he had a gate locked and the lock was broken or damaged to let the animals out on the road, surely then the farmer would not be liable.  It seems that <Col N="954" /> a situation which is now more or less clear-cut through this Bill will be made not so if a farmer can prove that he was not negligent in letting the cattle wander on the road.  It seems that the Bill will be the cause of costly litigation.</P>
    <P>Finally, regarding animals which trespass, I mentioned on the last occasion that one morning about 30 big bullocks broke into my garden from another garden.  Somebody who has been in that position realises that there is no time to think what is best to be done.  These huge, strong animals do not wait around looking for orders.  There will not be much time for somebody in that position to consult the Animals Bill, 1985.  In this situation where animals break into a person's property, is the property owner entitled to put them out on the road? Does this impose a serious obligation on somebody?  If animals break into a garden, plot or site, does this impose an obligation on the owner and has the owner the right to drive them on to the road?  I understand from the reply that has been given that the owner is entitled to put them out on the road provided that in doing so they do not cause an accident or they do not interfere with somebody. Strictly speaking, has he a right to put them on to a public road?  In this area I could see some sense in strict liability because if an accident occurred through putting them out on the road &mdash; and they do not go out in a very orderly way &mdash; it seems unfair to blame the man who owns the garden or plot or site and surely the liability should revert to the owner? Again I can see that in this situation the result could be costly ligitation.  I agree that in any Bill it is not possible to cater for every contingency and every situation. Nevertheless I believe this should be taken care of to a greater extent in the Bill.  I have some comments to make and some questions to ask on Committee Stage.  With those few remarks I also welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the main sentiments in the Bill.  While there are certain aspects of the present legislation that change we hope that in the practicalities <Col N="955" /> of the Bill the working of it will actually change on the ground.  What appears in the Statute Book and what actually happens on the ground, in my belief, all too often are completely different things. Heretofore when a person reported wandering animals, he was frequently sent from Billy to Jack.  The Garda would not take responsibility in some instances and neither would the local authority take responsibility in the majority of cases.  If action was taken and the stray animals were rounded up and impounded that is when the farce started.</P>
      <P>The facilities most local authorities have for impounding animals are negligible. Indeed, having succeeded in impounding them, the farce continued even further in so far as if a sale resulted and if the owner showed up and made an offer, no matter how ridiculous, he got the animals back.  On occasion the owner is pleased to have the animals rounded up.  Certainly this is the case in my own county where travelling people own substantial numbers of horses which wander great distances.  The owner is eventually notified that they are in a certain pound and that a sale is taking place.  All the owner has to do is to turn up at the pound. For a nominal bid at an auction or a recovery fee he gets the animals back. No sooner are they released from the pound than they are allowed to stray as before.  It serves no purpose other than a herding exercise for the owner.</P>
      <P>The facilities now existing within local authorities cannot change dramatically for the purpose of this Bill until there is an absolute obligation on the local authorities to provide very substantially improved impounding facilities.  I would ask the Minister when he is replying to tell us whether local authorities will be compelled to provide adequate and proper facilities for impounding animals. If it has been in the past the obligation of local authorities to do so they have failed miserably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the fine from 50p to £150 is substantial.  I hope it will act as a deterrent.  In most cases people say that <Col N="956" /> deterrents do not work, but such a substantial fine, particularly if it were repeated, would amount to the value of the animals themselves.  If the fine has to be paid it will mean that people will take better care of their animals and prevent them from wandering.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with a developer who has a partially completed development seems harsh.  In normal circumstances it would take several months or one year for site developments to be completed. It is inevitable, therefore, that if there were stray animals in the area they would wander into this area.  If the developer is living off-site or does not provide a caretaker, in all probability animals would rest in those areas rather than in the more populated areas or areas of high activity.  This section is a bit harsh on the developer who might find that animals had caused damage on the site and he becomes the owner as proposed in the Bill.  It is rather harsh.  That damage might take place during the night when work would not be in progress on the site.  The provisions in that section are very harsh on many people who would be developing sites for houses or industrial purposes adjacent to towns where very often travellers camp.  These are the areas which attract temporary camping.  It is rather harsh that the developer would become responsible for the animals who would wander on to that site.</P>
    <P>In the past, the tracing of owners has been very carelessly carried out by the authorities.  Cattle, in particular, can be readily identified by the herd number on their tags.  There certainly has been a notable lack of co-operation in the speedy provision of information to the Garda or to private individuals when they sought information from district veterinary offices.  They were slow in forthcoming with the information.  I would hope that under the provisions of this Bill the co-operation, when sought, by private individuals or by the gardaí, would be far more speedily and readily available than it has been heretofore.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with dogs seems to have drastic changes in it, probably severe changes in some instances.  It was <Col N="957" /> recognised that every dog was entitled to a first bite.  That no longer seems to be the case.  A dog may be provoked by children playing in densely populated areas.  He may be cornered and become vicious in certain circumstances.  There could be a rash of very costly court proceedings. There is nothing as bad as to see mongrel dogs savaging young children. One particular case was highlighted in the media within the past year when a child was probably maimed for life and there seems to be no real recourse to the child or the parents to get satisfaction from any source.</P>
    <P>At the other extreme, provocation can take place and it is very difficult to prove that a dog was vicious.  It all boils down to the fact that many local authorities, particularly outside the urban areas, have been very careless and have been found wanting in the provision of proper facilities for the collection and control of stray animals.  I would ask the Minister to see that orders are made that every local authority should have within their jurisdiction some facility for impounding stray dogs.  At various times during the year we see that wandering dogs have caused very substantial damage and losses to farmers, mainly adjacent to urban areas but like crime in general it is no longer a case of just being adjacent to urban areas. The problem has gone right out into the countryside.  Dogs have tended to wander very great distances in pursuit of sheep and cause great destruction.  I would ask the Minister to build into the Bill the safeguard that he would have the authority to direct local authorities to establish proper pound facilities for stray animals.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general provisions of the Bill.  I believe, however, that it will be very difficult to implement them unless there is a far greater effort by the authorities to implement them and greater co-operation between the local authorities and the Garda which was not, I must say in my experience, forthcoming heretofore. There was no co-operation and one was passing it to the next.  One group said they had not the power to do anything and the other said they had not the facilities <Col N="958" /> to do anything.  It is time to call a halt to that and to make sure that if this legislation becomes law the facilities necessary for the people to implement the law will be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome this Bill which, for the first time, covers this whole area of wandering animals, whether they are horses, dogs or any other large animal likely to cause damage to property and to beings.  It has taken a long time to get all this set down in legislation.  It is something that many of us at local authority level have been talking about for many years.  I welcome the fact that the Minister and his advisers have applied themselves to the problem of wandering animals.  In built-up areas, in the Minister's own constituency in Limerick and, indeed, in the town of Tipperary and in many other large towns and centres of population extraordinary damage has been done by large animals, particularly horses, the owners of which, as Senator Burke said, are difficult to identify.  In this regard I want to compliment the Garda.  In spite of the difficulties associated with identifying the owners of wandering horses, without proper legislation to assist them, they have been very vigilant in areas where widespread damage has been caused.  The Garda are also extremely vigilant in tracing lost, stolen or wandering animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of the best efforts of the experts in the Department in designing ear tags, there is no doubt that quite a lot of tag switching still goes on.  In the absence of proper ear punching it is quite difficult to trace the ownership of some of these animals.  In spite of that, I am aware of the efforts that the Garda have made in trying to ascertain the ownership of animals through a system of application of tags to animals ears and the issue of tags to veterinary surgeons in particular sequences.  The Department of Agriculture are aware which tags were issued to certain veterinary surgeons.  In that regard they usually can trace through a veterinary surgeon a particular tag sequence, even if that tag was initially attached by the vet to another animal. <Col N="959" /> The Department of Agriculture officials are to be complimented for their efforts to overcome tag switching.  It is still very difficult to come up with a tamper proof tag which would make all our efforts in disease eradication much easier and would indeed make the efforts of those responsible of the maintenance of order in large animal movements on roads and into people's property much easier.</P>
    <P>This is quite an emotive subject in urban areas.  In spite of that, this legislation has created some cause for concern in the minds of rural dwellers, the owners of livestock, who to the best of their ability, always try to keep thim in safe custody.  In spite of that there are times when for various reasons, large animals wander on to the public road at night. They constitute a death trap for motorists. They can do a great deal of damage both to life and to property.</P>
    <P>The various sections should be explained in the Minister's reply to this Second Stage debate and they will probably be teased out further on Committee Stage.  The Minister would want to reassure people that normal accidental wandering of animals will not become a common law liability.  Section 2 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>So much of the rules of the common law relating to liability for negligence as excludes or restricts the duty which a person might owe to others to take such care as is reasonable to see that damage is not caused by an animal straying on to a public road is hereby abolished.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to deal with other subsections of that section.  This is an area that needs to be explained to people.</P>
    <P>There are so many things that happen in a rural area which the landowner and stockowner does not welcome.  There are outbreaks of certain diseases, like grass tetanus, which is a magnesium deficiency. It leaves the animals without control over what they are doing.  They are actually crazy animals at a certain stage of the disease.  They will break down anything from a gate to a stone wall.  They will burst out on to the public roadway at any <Col N="960" /> hour of the day or night when they are afflicted with this deficiency disease.  It is in areas like this, where the landowner or the stockowner could exercise no control whatsoever, that I would be worried that he might be penalised by the legislation. I would not deny anybody's right in common law to try these matters in the court.  I am sure the court would have to make a judgment on whether the owner was negligent in not having the animals under proper control or, indeed, if his fences were deficient in any way.  It is an area that needed to be tided up a lot because people have lost their lives and a lot of damage has been done to property.</P>
    <P>The area of marauding dogs is one that concerns all of us.  The Animal Health Council have set up a special sub-committee to advise the Minister for Agriculture in this area.  I do not think that either increasing the licence fee or trying to apply a proper licensing system for dogs is the answer to the problem.  One of the answers to the problem is addressed in this Bill, putting the liability on the owner of the dog.  Section 3 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>The owner of a dog shall be liable in damages for damage caused in an attack on any person by the dog and for injury done by it to any cattle; and it shall not be necessary for the person seeking such damages to show a previous mischievous propensity in the dog, or the owner's knowledge of such previous propensity, or to show that such injury or damage was attributable to neglect on the part of the owner.</P>
    <P>The media have rightly portrayed the widespread damage that has been caused to flock owners throughout the country. In mountainous areas, in lowland areas, in my area, in Wicklow and in many other areas widespread damage is caused by marauding dogs without the owner either being aware of the risks that his dogs have created for livestock, sheep and lambs, but would almost deny that his dogs could be associated with that kind of happening.  We all know that dogs tend to travel in packs.  I suppose normal quiet, efficient farmhouse dogs could probably be misled into joining a pack.  They have <Col N="961" /> been known to cause tremendous damage.  The section in this Bill will put the legal liability on the owner of the dogs to ensure that they are kept in proper custody, particularly at night.</P>
    <P>It amazes one, when canvassing &mdash; as we all are nowadays at every possible moment &mdash; to notice the number of dogs in the country.  It is unbelievable.  I wish every dog had a vote and then the electorate would be extremely plentiful.  There are probably more dogs than people now. I have seen and heard many dogs and have been threatened by many dogs over the past three weeks.  I am glad the electorate are not quite as vociferous.  The dogs are quite dangerous.  In every farmyard or house, even in urban areas, the number of dogs is frightening.  There are six and seven dogs in a yard.</P>
    <P>I hope that this legislation will do something to ensure that this whole area of responsibility for these kinds of animals will rest with the owners.  If people are given that responsibility they will ensure that any animals under their control are properly looked after.  My voice seems to have suffered because of the campaign.  I cannot even bark back at the dogs any more.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill as making a good effort at tidying up this whole area of responsibility of wandering animals, whether they are dogs or larger animals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the opportunity which the House is getting to review the law as it relates to animals in this Animals Bill.  I think that the Minister in his Second Stage speech set the stage on the background to this legislation and the need for it.  Some Members have gone into detail with regard to different aspects of the Bill, what is in the Bill and what is not in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my case I would like to pay particular attention to a section of the Bill &mdash; which is one of the shortest sections in it &mdash; which has the most far-reaching effects on the relationships between the farming community and the motoring community in particular.  The Minister correctly identified <Col N="962" /> the fact that the House was indebted to the Law Reform Commission for their report on Civil Liability for Animals, 1982.  It was published in May 1982 and forms the background to this review of the legislation.  It is very helpful indeed to have it when considering this legislation. It is very handy, indeed, for the Members of the House to have the objective and independent advice of the Law Reform Commission on these matters.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that the Minister is correct in not assuming that their recommendations must automatically be followed and in subjecting those recommendations to the kind of examination necessary to see whether in any way they fall short of the practical criteria which should apply in new legislation.  In this area, in the report to which I have already referred, the Law Reform Commission dealt with the matter under chapter 2 of their report.  That chapter is headed &ldquo;Liability for Damage caused by Animals straying on to the Highway&rdquo;.  In order to understand the report in detail one would have to revert to the Working Paper No. 3, of the Law Reform Commission, on which this report was based.  In chapter 2 (1) of the report, the Law Reform Commission made the following statement:</P>
    <P>In Working Paper No. 3 the immunity from liability given to the keepers of animals which stray on to the highway was criticised as anomalous.  It is out of step with modern legal developments, current conceptions of responsibility and, in particular, present-day traffic conditions.</P>
    <P>And it goes on to say that:</P>
    <P>No compelling argument, against the abolition of this immunity have been advanced to the Commission.</P>
    <P>Now, in order that the records should be set straight, it is only right to say that the degree of immunity which the keepers of animals have at present is extraordinary. It certainly does not reflect the reality of a country in which farming is an activity which is pursued to the edges of very busy highways.</P>
    <P>At present the law is that it is virtually <Col N="963" /> impossible for an owner of an animal to be held responsible for that animal causing damage to passing traffic.  This immunity extends even to cases where the farmer inadequately fences his property and where he overstocks his property, bearing in mind the fencing arrangements which he has.  It is true to say that the only situation in which the owner of an animal which strays on to the public road, or goes on to the public road, can be liable for the actions of that animal is where the animal is under the immediate, and very immediate, control of the owner or his representative.  In other words, you have the rather extraordinary situation that the farmer who was taking care and herding his cattle along the road was, in fact, liable for any damage which his cattle did during the course of that operation, while on the other hand the farmer who allowed the cattle to come home without any person in attendance was not responsible for any damage caused.  Now that is a rather extraordinary rule of law.  I suppose it could be understood in the context of a situation where there was virtually no traffic passing on the road and the roads really only existed for the local traffic, but nowadays with the greater mobility of the population the number of people traversing any area, who would not have intimate knowledge of the activities carried on in that area, has increased rapidly. That has given rise to a situation where there is no longer a balance of reason between the immunity of the animal owner on the one hand and the compensation for any damage caused to the pas-sers-by on the other hand.</P>
    <P>We then come to the actual suggestion of the Law Reform Commission.  The Law Reform Commission suggested in their working paper, and confirmed in their report, that the immunity conferred on keepers of animals which cause injury while straying on to the public highway should be abolished.  During the course of the brief consideration which this legislation got in the Committee on Legislation that matter was considered.  I have the privilege of being a member of that <Col N="964" /> committee.  It strikes me that the strict liability which the mere abolition of that immunity would confer is something which is quite easy to defend.  I can well understand why the Law Reform Commission arrived at the conclusion at which they did arrive.  The keeper of an animal, surely, should be under an obligation to ensure that animal is fenced properly or is kept under control and does not cause any damage.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the exceptional case in the Bill, and in the Law Reform Commission report, which deals with animals straying from land which is normally unfenced, there is a lot to recommend the Law Reform Commission's report in this regard.  I understand the Minister's point of view, that he has to amend the law practically as he finds it.  The transition from a position where there was virtually no liability to a position where there would be strict liability is something which, I suppose, the owners of animals find very hard to grasp.  I understand that the Minister had a practical political problem in that regard.  I think it is the way in which the law is developing.  I think it is the way in which this legislation will, in future, be amended.</P>
    <P>Those who have the responsibility for the keeping of animals should recognise the inevitability of that process.  The proposal of the Minister in section 2, and which no doubt we will get an opportunity of considering in detail on Committee, is to reduce or to eliminate the immunity and to substitute for it the ordinary rules which apply in the case of tort.  The Minister's justification for that is contained in his Second Stage speech.  I think the Minister is probably right in coming to the conclusion he has arrived at.  In coming to that conclusion, I think the actual way in which the law will be interpreted by the courts is something that this Minister or any future Minister will have to consider carefully.</P>
    <P>In my view the operation of section 2 will lead to an uncertain state of law which, no doubt, will be clarified over a period of time by court cases.  It is something about which the Minister and his Department will have to be careful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> The other point to which I would like to refer is the question of liability in respect of dogs.  Different influences come to bear on this point.  On the question of dogs a stricter liability is being imposed. That stricter liability reflects the fact that the owners of animals who are keeping them for farming purposes have found that the potential for destruction of the dog population is considerable.  They feel aggrieved in regard to the damage which they have suffered over the years.  They now wish to ensure that the owners of dogs will keep them under strict control and that in the absence of them being kept under strict control their owners should be made responsible.  If that is the view of the owners of farm animals in relation to dogs, you can understand how aggrieved people are when an animal kept for farm purposes strays on to the road and causes damage even though that damage is not caused by any negligence on the part of the driver of a vehicle. They are aggrieved that the owner of the animal is not strictly liable.  Even under new legislation there will be a substantial issue to be fought as to whether or not a person will be liable.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I would like the Minister to give consideration to the practical effects of the other portion of subsection (2) which deals with straying from unfenced land on to a public road. I imagine that there is going to be quite a problem in defining what unfenced land is.  A lot of land will acquire an unfenced definition where necessary.  That is a possibility. The Minister might give some consideration to whether it should be necessary to register one's land as unfenced land or whether a register of unfenced land should be kept for this purpose and whether there should be an obligation on the person who owns the land, prior to any accident, to say that the following portion of his land &mdash; or the following portion of the land that he uses if it is commonage &mdash; is, in fact, unfenced.  In the event of any dispute arising at a later date a register can be consulted which will clearly identify a portion of land as being unfenced.  Otherwise, the difference <Col N="966" /> which will arise between the treatment of torts in respect of animals coming from fenced land and animals coming from unfenced land will give rise to substantial legal disputes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other portion of the Bill &mdash; the portion which deals with the question of wandering animals and trespassing animals &mdash; I would like to commend the Minister for his diligence in pursuing this matter.  It has become a feature of Irish suburban life that certain elements of the community seek to keep animals in suburban and urban conditions which are totally unsuitable for such animals. The additional powers taken by the Minister and the powers being given by the Minister to the various authorities, and the various increased penalties to which the Minister has referred and which are set out in the Table at the end of section 7 of the Bill, will all contribute to the eradication of this problem.  Very many of these animals are kept not really for any profit motive but almost in a sense of defiance of authority and in a sense of increasing the capacity of certain elements to carry their weight around with them.  There is a certain element in it in that they are almost like &ldquo;walking&rdquo; wallets.  A person of a particular type with spare cash invests in these animals in the hope of being able to maintain the value of the investment, rather than actually getting the animals to do any useful work either of a recreational or other kind.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I welcome the Bill. The Minister is to be congratulated on it. I look forward to the explanations of the various problems which might arise from the Bill which, no doubt, the Minister will consider and deal with during his reply to the Second Stage and during Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I would like to thank all the Senators who have contributed to this debate.  I understand that there has been a constructive, helpful debate.  I am glad that the House is facilitating me in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as indicated in the opening <Col N="967" /> speech, deals with two main areas of law relating to animals &mdash; the law as to civil liability for damage which they cause, and the law as to the impounding of animals. So far as the liability for damage caused by animals is concerned, the Bill proposes two changes in the law.  First, it proposes the abolition of the immunity which occupiers of land adjoining the public road have enjoyed in relation to damage caused by their animals straying onto the road.  Secondly, it proposes that there should be strict liability for damage which dogs cause in attacks on persons. Senator O'Leary is drawing attention now to this and indicating that there is a divergence in the provision here from what was recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  Both proposals, in so far as liability for damage is concerned, are moving in the direction of putting a stronger onus on the owner.  In the case of land, the immunity which has existed for a long time is being removed.</P>
    <P>In the case of an attack on a person by a dog, while the dog is no longer entitled to one bite the requirement in law to prove vicious propensity in the animal is being removed so that it will now be an offence to bite the first time.  The movement is in the same direction. Whether we have gone far enough or not is debatable.  It would have made it a very controversial Bill if if we had proposed stricter liability on the owners of property or animals straying from the property. The change which is proposed is reasonable as a first step.  That, taken together with the other provisions of the Bill, will go a long way towards solving the problems of wandering animals and horses, in particular, in our cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary is correct.  The movement is in one particular direction, and I am sure a successor of mine will come back into the House at a future date, either shortly or in the distant future, and propose stricter liability along the lines of the proposals of the Law Reform Commission.  As Senators are aware, changes took place in the law in Northern Ireland and in Britain.  Section 2(1) of the Bill is the same formulation of words <Col N="968" /> as used in the British legislation and in the Northern Ireland legislation.  That is the change that took place there &mdash; removing the immunity.  It has got the general support of people who are the victims of injury and also the general support of landowners.  Senators are probably aware that I had consultations with the farming organisations when we set about drafting this legislation.  The main farming organisations are happy with the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The other area dealt with in the Bill is the provision strengthening the law for impounding in section 4 to section 8 of the Bill.  Some individual points were raised in the course of the debate, and I should like to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan commented adversely on the drafting of section 2 and referred to the simpler form of drafting in section 4 of the Law Reform Commission's draft Bill.  Section 2 of the Bill now before the House is identical with section 8 of the Commission's draft Bill but includes a definition of &ldquo;fencing&rdquo; taken from section 2 of the Commission's draft.  The wording of section 2 has been very carefully examined, and the draftman is satisfied that it is appropriate to meet the object of the section.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Law Reform Commission's Bill, to which the Senator referred, proposed that there should be a general principle of strict liability for any damage caused by any animal.  As was indicated in the opening speech, it is not proposed to adopt that recommendation.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan also referred to damage caused by animals such as badgers. I should say in this connection that there is no liability in law for damage caused by wild animals not reduced into captivity.  Mules will come within the definition of &ldquo;animal&rdquo; in section 1 and accordingly the impounding provisions in the Bill will apply to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan and Senator Fitzsimons referred to the insurance implications of the Bill.  These arise in relation to sections 2 and 3.  I agree that it will be desirable for landowners and owners of dogs to insure against the new liability <Col N="969" /> being imposed by these sections.  Inquiries have been made from insurance sources but it has not been possible to say what, precisely, the increase in premiums will be.  As far as landowners are concerned, it appears that the provisions in the English Animals Act, 1971, which corresponds to section 2 of the Bill, has not given rise to any considerable increase in the premiums for landowners in England and Wales.  It is expected that, as far as section 3 is concerned, the increased premium for dog owners will be limited in amount.</P>
    <P>The strict liability imposed by the Dogs Act 1906 applies in relation to injury to sheep, in view of the definition of &ldquo;cattle&rdquo; in section 7 of the Act.  In that section we are accomplishing the change by restating the section from the Dogs Act.  While it looks as if it is a significant proportion of the Bill, it is a re-enactment of the existing provisions which makes it look so extensive.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan pointed out that section 8 of the Bill repeals paragraphs (7) and (8) of section 19 of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1851.  The Senator inquired as to how the remaining provisions in section 19 of the 1851 Act can stand.  The position is that section 19, apart from paragraphs (7) and (8) has already been repealed by the Pounds (Provisions and Maintenance) Act, 1935 so that the effect of section 8 of the Bill will be to complete the repeal of section 19 of the 1851 Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan also referred to the provisions of section 20 of the 1851 Act. As was pointed out in my speech, there have been few complaints over the country as a whole about the operation of these provisions in the 1851 Act, relating to the impounding of trespassing animals by private persons.  The Senator suggested that the power which section 20 gives to the District Court to order the repair of fences, in certain circumstances, should be strengthened.  I consider that a provision of that nature would raise issues which might extend beyond the scope of the present Bill.  The objectives of the Bill are limited, and I would be reluctant to accept any amendment of the kind <Col N="970" /> suggested to section 20 of the 1851 Act as this might complicate the achievement of those objectives.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole suggested that the effect of section 2 would be to shift liability from road users to persons occupying land adjoining the public road.  This is not correct.  The effect of that section will be to make the law of liability in negligence apply equally to road-users and occupiers of land, with special provision for areas where fencing is not customary.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also raised the question of the adequacy of pound accommodation. Inquiries have been made from all local authorities in this connection. The replies indicated that this accommodation, generally is adequate. Section 5 of the Bill makes special provision for any short term inadequacy of public pounds after the Bill comes into effect.  The Bill makes no change in the existing law for cases such as those of damage caused by animals where a hunt crosses a farmer's land.  As to the manner in which the law of negligence will apply on the coming into effect of Section 2 it will be for the court to decide in each case.  It would not be correct to say that section 2 will complicate the law.  It will simplify the law by removing the existing anomaly.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary also referred to this point.  The Senator is correct in that it will take an initial number of cases before it will be certain how the courts will view that particular section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan asked how the Bill will affect persons who have to drive stock across the public road.  The Bill will not affect the existing law in such cases. The provision in the Bill which is most nearly relevant is section 2, but that relates only to cases where animals stray on to the road, and not to cases where animals are driven on to the road.  Senator Hourigan and other Senators referred to the situation where animals stray across land adjoining the public road from land which does not adjoin it.  It will be a matter for the court to decide liability in such cases, but it appears unlikely that the occupier of the land adjoining the <Col N="971" /> public road could be held liable for damage caused in such cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely referred to the damage caused by marauding and unlicensed dogs.  The Bill does not seek to deal generally with this problem.  This problem, and the associated question of dog shelters, is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, who is now considering a report made by an inter-departmental committee on the subject.  The Senator also commented adversely on section 6 of the Bill.  It would not be correct to say that this imposes liability for damage caused by stray animals on occupiers of development sites generally.  The statutory liability will be imposed only where the local authority has made a designation order in relation to the particular site, and even in such cases the occupier of the site can escape the statutory liability by authorising the Garda and local authorities to remove and impound animals straying on to the site.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons referred to the question of obliging owners to muzzle dogs.  Any provision of this kind would be outside the scope of this Bill.  This suggestion, as well as the question of licensing dogs, might be appropriate for consideration by the Minister for Agriculture, who is considering the general question of dog control.  The Senator referred also to the liability occurred by occupiers where their dogs injure trespassers. The position is that, under the Bill, the ordinary rules of negligence will apply.  This is secured by the proposed new section 1 (5) of the Dogs Act 1906, the effect of which is that the occupier will not incur strict liability in such cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons also mentioned the question of compensation for damage caused by animals straying on to the public road.  This will be a matter for the courts to decide in each individual case. I can assure the Senator that where the owner of the animal is not negligent section 2 will not have the effect of ensuring that damages are to be awarded against him.  The Senator also referred to animals trespassing on private property.  As far as urban areas are concerned, trespassing <Col N="972" /> by large animals is a comparatively recent phenomenon deriving from the acquisition of such animals by persons who have not got adequate facilities for them. These animals are allowed to wander on public roads and on open spaces and they occasionally enter private gardens.  This problem would arise in rural areas to a much more limited extent.  In so far as animals wandering on the public roads and in public spaces are concerned, I am confident that the problem will be met by the measures now proposed in the Bill. These should have the effect of considerably reducing the number of intrusions by large animals onto private property. In rural areas, where cases have arisen over the years of livestock straying from one person's land onto another, the position is adequately met by the existing statutory provisions which were probably designed to avoid breaches of the peace that could occur when the occupier of the land trespassed on was allowed to detain the animal.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke expressed concern about the adequacy of the impounding facilities and the related financial arrangements.  As I have said already, I have made inquiries from local authorities and the general impression is that existing facilities are adequate.  However, I will have this aspect of the problem pursued in any instance where it transpires that the facilities are inadequate after the coming into effect of the impounding provisions of the Bill.  The general intention is that these impounding provisions should be self financing so far as possible through increased fines, higher pound fees and where necessary the sale of impounded animals.  I would also refer Senators to the provision in section 5 of the Bill where in order to meet any short term demands for impounding facilities following the coming into force of the Bill local authorities may arrange for animals to be impounded in private pounds. This would save the necessity for providing permanent impounding facilities that might rarely be used once the legislation has full effect.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with the points <Col N="973" /> raised, though necessarily in a general way.  I thank the Senators for their contribution and I am sorry I could not be in the House at 2.30 p.m.  I had questions in the Dáil at that time.</P>

      <P>On section 2 &mdash; this is slightly related to what Senator Fitzsimons raised on section 1 &mdash; I understand from the Minister that the animal which is referred to in section 2 is a wider definition of animal than is referred to in the definition section and includes domesticated animals.  In other words, it includes dogs, for example.  In those circumstances what is the position, bearing in mind subsection (2) where a dog strays from unfenced land to a public road and <Col N="974" /> causes an accident to cattle by reason of its presence on the road?  Does section 2 apply or does section 3 apply where a domesticated animal leaves land on which it is normally placed, goes on the road and causes an accident to cattle on that road?

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The scope of the immunity has never been clearly defined in common law, but it refers in general to all farm animals.  That would include farm fowl for example which would come under the definition of animal whether hens, geese or turkeys. In theory it would also include a dog in so far as it is a farm animal and a domesticated animal.  I would think that it would ultimately be a matter for the courts to decide, if negligence occurred, under which section of the Bill to proceed. If it was a case of a dog attacking catle on the road or savaging sheep on the road, it would be the sort of situation that has pertained up to now because there was strict liability for attacking animals anyway.  What we are doing on the dogs side of the argument is extending the strict liability to people for the first bite of the dog, but that strict liability applied to animals anyway.</P>

      <P>Regarding paragraph (b) of subsection (2), the interpretation of fencing could have a very wide interpretation. In one instance it may be very <Col N="975" /> adequate to deal with a set of circumstances to keep animals from straying onto the road.  In other circumstances the very same type of fencing may be totally inadequate.  There may be a problem there because animals at particular times, perhaps frightened or in heat, may be more difficult to keep off the public road than otherwise would be the case.  The definition of fencing is something the Minister might clarify.  Is it a matter for the courts, or how is it defined?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Obviously it would be a matter for the courts, but it would include a wider definition of fencing than we would colloquially use when using the term &ldquo;fencing'. It would include not only fences as ordinarily understood but ditches whose object was not solely drainage but also the retention of animals.  It would include things like catle grids.  There are areas in the country which we can name and which traditionally have been unfenced. Some of them are being used as commonage, and we have to allow for that in the Bill.  Again, I am sure it will come down to an individual situation where a controversy could arise to to whether land was traditionally unfenced or not.

      <P>Again on the question of fencing, would the Minister look at subsection 2(a)(i) when he says that the <Col N="976" /> damages caused by an animal straying from unfenced land to a public road, are not the responsibility of the person who placed the animal on the road in that he shall not be regarded as having committed a breach of his duty to take care by reason only of placing it there if the land is situated in an area where fencing is not customary.  That is the first condition. Does that mean the rule will not apply even where somebody has fenced land and that fencing has been proved not to be accurate but is in an area where fencing is not customary?  Suppose, for example, one were on the Curragh or on the edge of the Curragh &mdash; and there is no doubt that in that area fencing is not customary &mdash; but if an individual property owner within that area had fenced land, he could say, &ldquo;My land even though it was fenced and I have tried to keep it fenced is situated in an area in which it is not customary to fence land.&rdquo;  It does not say the land is land which it was not customary to have fenced but that the land is situated in an area which is customarily not fenced.

      <P>My understanding of the position of fencing at the moment is that if animals have trespassed on my land or if they trespass on my site, it is my duty to fence them out rather than the owner's duty to fence them in.  It seems that this is being changed here.  In relation to a third party who might get into difficulties by putting animals off his premises, that difficulty could be overcome by using the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  It seems also in that same subsection (2) (i) where there is reference to a public road and animals straying on to the public road, as I mentioned in my <Col N="977" /> contribution on Second Stage, damage is also caused in situations apart from animals straying on to the public road.  I mentioned specifically an old cemetery where monuments and headstones were damaged and there was danger to a 12th century cross.  In that situation could the difficulty not be overcome by referring to fencing cattle on the land or preventing them getting off the land on which they are confined or grazed rather than on to a public road?  It would broaden that section.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The existing position is that there is liability on the landowner who allows his animals to wander on to a neighbour's land.  If your neighbour allows his cattle to wander on to your land you have a case against him.  He is liable now.  The immunity only applies to animals wandering on to the road.  There was never immunity for wandering on to a neighbour's land.  In fact there is liability.  The obligation is not on you to fence cattle out.  It is his obligation to fence cattle in. Otherwise he is liable when they wander. All that is being done here is to remove the traditional common law immunity which brought about a situation that if animals wandered from land adjoining a public road on to the public road the owner was immune from any liability for any damage caused.  We are moving it in to a middle position now where the same laws of negligence will apply and the courts will test the relative negligence of the motorist and the owner of the cattle that wander out.</P>
      <P>The further step which the Law Reform Commission were proposing was that we should go from a situation of immunity to a situation of strict liability where the owner of the land would be absolutely liable for animals that wandered on to the road.  We are going to the middle position but not to the position recommended by the Law Reform Commission.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are only making one change here in the Dogs Act, 1906 and that is to deal with the point which is often expressed.  You have heard the phrase a dog is entitled to one bite.  That was a kind of shorthand way of explaining that one had to prove that a dog was vicious before one could hold an owner liable for an attack made by a dog.  The only way one could prove the dog was vicious was to prove that he had attacked before.  The owner had a free run so far as the first bite was concerned but he became liable for the second one. We are bringing about that change by amending section 1 of the Dogs Act, 1906, but we are doing it by re-enacting the whole section.  In the definition of that Act the term `cattle' has a much wider meaning than what locally we would take it to mean.  It includes horses, mules, asses, sheep, goats and swine. These provisions are in sub-section (7) so what the Senator has in mind is included.</P>

It would be relatively easy to prove <Col N="979" /> ownership by showing a receipt for a payment of a licence but it might be very difficult to prove that somebody did not own the dog at the time of the attack. Also it would seem that in that situation the identity of the owner of the dog would need to be known.  One could have a situation in which somebody would keep a dog and know the owner and they would not be liable.  If they kept the dog and did not know the owner it would almost be the same condition.

Premises now include land as well as houses.  This rule is to apply also in relation to any particular dwelling in a house.  For example, when a house is set in flats, the owner of the flat to which the dog is attached would be presumed to be the owner of the dog and the onus on him under subsection (7) is to prove he was not the owner of the dog.

      <P>Regarding a point I raised on Second Stage, I must again express disappointment that the drafters of the Bill did not consider amending at the same time section 20 of the Summary Jurisdiction (Ireland) Act, 1851 and in particular the provision of that section which allows a district justice to make an order compelling somebody to put up fences.  That is a very relevant power and one that should be easily used, but because of the procedural problems that can arise by virtue of the fact that it is <Col N="982" /> based on a complaint of trespass, there can be difficulties in giving effect to the power that is there.  If it were possible to exercise that power where a decree for damages had been obtained in any court in respect of trespass, it would be much easier to make an application under that section.  In practical terms it is something that should be looked at.  It is a power that can be of tremendous use to farmers who have awkward neighbours who do not maintain their fences.  But by virtue of the fact that it is based on a complaint &mdash; the old fashioned trespass summons &mdash; it is very difficult to use.  It is something that should be examined with a view to bringing in amending legislation to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>When we were discussing this on the last occasion we got a lot of very valuable information from the Minister on section 5 and indeed the preceding sections, but specifically on section 5, on the matter of strategic plans and reviews of the new Combat Poverty <Col N="983" /> Agency.</P>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention that this strategic plan which under subsection (2) is to be drawn up in respect of the period to 31 December 1987 should be a static thing?  In other words, should there be a strategic plan for the period to December 1987 and no strategic plan then and that stretching until 1990?  Is it a rolling plan that the Minister has in mind?  Is it a three-year plan or is it a rolling three-year plan that the Minister has in mind? The Minister has adequate power under the section to make it a rolling type of plan, in other words, a plan for a three-year period ending 1987 and during the following 12 months extending that to 1988 and in the following 12 months extending that to 1989, so that you have three years ahead at all times.  I wonder which one the Minister has in mind in this regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment on the points raised by Senator O'Leary and other Senators who have already contributed to the debate on section 5.  In principle, Senators are agreed that the idea behind this section is a good one.  While a provision on these lines is not to be found in similar legislation relating to other agencies, it is, however, in line with Government policy on the monitoring of the activities of State bodies.</P>
      <P>The existence of a strategic plan will be of considerable benefit for the agency itself and for the responsible Ministers in that once the plan has been agreed the agency will be in a position to operate within an agreed framework and the performance of the agency can be evaluated within the framework.  It is in everybody's interest that the relationship between the parties concerned is an orderly one and that the agency develops in a planned and not in an <i>ad hoc</i> way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Senators expressed concern about the situation which would arise if either of the Ministers concerned did not approve the agency's plan or did not do so within a reasonable period of <Col N="984" /> time.  Obviously, the Minister cannot be required to approve the plan as submitted by the agency.  In the normal course what would happen would be for the Departments concerned to enter into discussions with the agency with a view to reaching a consensus on the plan.  The plan will naturally incorporate an operating budget for its main activities detailing proposed expenditure, projected staff resources, etc.  These matters will have to be agreed with the parent Department and the Department of Finance.  There is no point in pretending that it will always be easy to reach agreement.</P>
    <P>The financial contraints which apply elsewhere will also affect the operation of this agency.  It would probably be too much to hope that the resources would be available to enable this agency to do all that in its view needs to be done.  The benefits of the plan will be that it will enable the agency to plan for three years rather than for one year ahead as would be the case in the absence of a provision on the lines of that contained in the section.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to place a requirement on the Ministers concerned to approve the agency's plan within a certain time limit.  If the plan were not approved it would not, as has been implied, mean that the agency would have to come to a full stop.  It would continue to carry on its functions within the limits of the financial resources available to it.  The existence of the strategic plan is not a pre-requisite to action.  It is an added benefit inasmuch as it enables the agency to plan ahead rather than to operate on the more <i>ad hoc</i> basis which would otherwise be involved.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators were concerned about the time scale for the first strategic plan as contained in the section.  The first plan which would cover the period up to 31 December 1987 must be submitted by the agency within six months of its first meeting.  Subject to the speedy enactment of the legislation I would hope that the first strategic plan would be drawn up by early 1986 and, allowing for the constraints which the new agency will inevitably be under in the first few months <Col N="985" /> of its existence, I consider it reasonable that the first strategic plan should be in respect of a shorter period, effectively two years rather than three years.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon wondered about the extent to which the preparation of the strategic plan would be affected by the EC poverty programme.  He was concerned to ensure that Ireland is in a position to benefit to the greatest possible extent from that programme.  I can assure the House that preparations are already being made for the Irish input into the EC programme which was agreed by the Council of Ministers in December of last year.  The interim board of the Combat Poverty Organisation are advising the Minister as to the projects which should be submitted to Brussels for inclusion in the programme.  It is expected that the programme will commence later this year.  The Combat Poverty Agency, when established, will obviously have a central role in the implementation and monitoring of the Irish element of the programme.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson raised the question of the reviews of the agency's purposes, functions and activities which are to be carried out from time to time by the Minister under subsection 3 of section 5. She was concerned that no time scale was set out for the preparation of these reviews.  The legislation is designed to allow flexibility to the Minister in determining the period of the reviews and the time at which the reviews should be done. It would seem logical that a review would cover the same period as the agency's strategic plan, but this need not necessarily be the most desirable approach.  The Minister might consider a longer period to be more appropriate.  As far as setting the time at which reviews should be carried out is concerned, it is considered that this also should be at the discretion of the Minister.  The agency will also be constrained by the availability of the necessary resources or the professional expertise necessary for this purpose.  It is worth mentioning, of course, that one of the agency's own functions as set out in section 4 (2) (f) of the Bill will be the evaluation of its own activities, and this <Col N="986" /> will also be relevant in the context of an overall review of the agency under section 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all grateful to the Minister for his careful explanation of the intention behind section 5, and there is a great deal of logic in what he has said.  There are just one or two tidying-up points that I would like to ask the Minister about.  Under section 5(1) there is provision whereby the agency shall draw up and submit to the Minister and to the Minister for Finance for their approval a programme outlining the agency's projected activities.  Why is it intended that there should be a system of dual reporting?  Why is the Minister for Finance being drawn into it at this stage? Why is it necessary to get his approval? I understand that where money is being spent the approval of the Department of Finance is necessary, but a lot of the programme outlined by the agency might not, indeed, involve the expending of any money other than the money which they had available themselves by way of a grant-in-aid &mdash; if that is the way in which they intend to finance themselves.  Why, then, in the event of what you might call free money being available is the approval of the Minister for Finance necessary for their work for their programme as well as the approval of the Minister who is responsible for the agency, who is defined in the interpretation section as being the Minister for Social Welfare?  Why has the Minister for Finance to give his approval also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question that occurred to me and perhaps to the Minister. I would like to thank him for his honest and long reply to the many questions asked here the last time we discussed this matter.  He himself referred to the financial resources, and I think we can be happy that we have made as much progress as possible on the EC side.  The Minister has confirmed that.  Is it envisaged that there should be &mdash; Senator O'Leary touched on this also &mdash; any input, if you like, from the Department of Social Welfare?  Obviously, that would <Col N="987" /> need the Department of Finance approval in some way.  Could I ask what is the intention towards the various health boards?  Are they expected to contribute from their capital allocation or will they be getting, as Senator O'Leary said, a grant-in-aid for work of this nature in their particular areas?  The health boards will be saying at this point in time, with the kind of money they have at their disposal, that they might not be able to afford to spend any money on this important problem.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>On Senator O'Leary's point about the Minister for Finance being mentioned in subsection 1 of section 5 I do not think it would be appropriate to limit the subsection because I do not think it would be appropriate to assume that the programme outlining the agency's projected activities would not include aspects of financial consequences that would need the approval of the Minister for Finance.  I agree with Senator O'Leary on the point that perhaps many parts of the programme may not need financial approval, but to rule out that possibility would be unwise.  It is appropriate that the reference to the Minister for Finance should be included in this particular subsection for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The section as a whole provides for three-year plans, each plan to be in respect of a three-year period.  The second plan, however, would have to be drawn up and submitted before the end of the relevant three-year period.  I consider the provision as it stands a reasonable one. The Minister will, under section 5(3), be reviewing the activities of the agency on a regular basis, and I am satisfied that the arrangements provided in section 5 will ensure continuity in the activities of the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, on Senator Fallon's point, I would also submit that until the actual plan is available it would not be possible to know what details would be in it.  It could happen that in the first plan there might be, for argument sake, no part for <Col N="988" /> the health boards to play in it.  If there is a part in the plan, I am sure there will be proposals in the plan to deal with any expenditure the health boards may have to incur.  I would submit that Senator Fallon's question would have to wait possibly until the various plans would be available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to come back to this question and I think the Minister should give further consideration to it either before Report Stage in this House or in the other House.  There is really a point at issue here as to the extent to which the Minister for Finance is going to get himself involved in the detail of the programme of the agency. As I understand it section 9 of this Bill deals with the question of grants to the agency and that, putting the matter very simply, says that, subject to what conditions the Minister may apply the Minister would pay to the agency each financial year out of money provided by the Oireachtas, a grant and may seek the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the agency.  That is fair enough.  I think it is up to the Minister involved to negotiate with the agency on one hand and the Minister for Finance on the other hand.  It is reasonable that the Minister should exercise that overall control.  Here we are asking the Department of Finance to do more than that &mdash; I think there is enough control in that for the Department of Finance.  We are asking them to approve strategic plans, and are we not in effect asking them to give approval to a plan to spend money for three years ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I know the Department of Finance, they do not like doing that.  They do not like giving approval for items of expenditure and programmes of expenditure more than one year at a time.  One will find that the Minister for Finance will not be geared to approve these plans.  I certainly have no objection to the Minister for Finance being kept aware of what the plans are so that he can include them in his budget option.  The section is very clear, and says it must be drawn up subject to the Minister's and the Minister <Col N="989" /> for Finance's approval.  Would it not be better if a programme outline were submitted to the Minister for his approval and to the Minister for Finance &mdash; in other words, not looking for the approval of the Minister for Finance for the strategic plan but just providing information. This is a recipe for inter-departmental memos at a great rate.  We are involving the Department of Finance &mdash; because effectively, it is the Department of Finance, not the Minister for Finance &mdash; in an area of activity in which they have no expertise.</P>
    <P>I cannot say what the Minister would think about being released from the constraints of the Department of Finance but I can say that, by and large, the Department of Finance tend to try to control things very tightly indeed, to the annoyance of other Departments and to the Ministers responsible for other Departments.  I think in these circumstances there appears to be a case for the Minister to look again at that aspect of this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I would like to make the point to Senator O'Leary that I am sure that the Minister for Social Welfare would be only too willing and pleased to pass many or all of the plans but that would be a useless exercise if the necessary moneys were not made available by the Minister for Finance.  That is the whole relevance of having the Minister for Finance mentioned in this subsection. The agency will probably not be financed by a grant-in-aid but rather by an annual grant and that will, in effect, be their only source of income.  Any expenditure will therefore be subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  That is why the Minister for Finance's involvement in the section is necessary in order to approve the strategic plan.  Approval by the Minister for Social Welfare only could, in effect, be meaningless if the necessary funds were not going to be made available by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>Section 6 (1) says that the Minister shall appoint two members of the agency to be chairman and vice chairman respectively.  I know this is done, but in a committee or an organisation such as this obviously one could say that it smacks of ministerial intervention.  I realise it is the Minister who selects the committee but the committee themselves should have the choice of selecting their own chairman and vice chairman.  That might have worked better.  It would seem to me to have been a fairer way of doing it, keeping away from the realms of political intervention, as it were, and you might at the end of the day have a better organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 7(1), I had considered putting in an amendment here but perhaps we will discuss it in some way.  I honestly feel, and perhaps the Minister agrees &mdash; I hope he will &mdash; that for a major national organisation such as this a small committee &mdash; which it will be &mdash; will be too small to really operate very effectively.  I hope I am wrong.  I think it would be preferable if you had a bigger committee, a committee of 12 to 15.  Furthermore, in the composition of that agency it would obviously be desirable as we have said in the past, and I know that the Minister would be aware of this, that the people who would form the base of this committee would be expert in the field and would have a great knowledge of this area of combating poverty.  I would hope that the agency would not just be Dublin-dominated, that they would extend right across the country.  Preferably what I would like to see, as I said&mdash;<Col N="991" /> and perhaps the Minister would comment, or consider it later on another stage of the Bill &mdash; is an extension of the agency to 12 or 15.  Rather than a Dublin Pale area the whole nation should be considered in the selection of that agency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to explain, in addition to the points raised by Senator Fallon, what subsection (4) means and particularly the later part of subsection (4) of section 7.  Subsection (4) says that the Minister when appointing a member shall fix such member's period of membership, which shall not exceed three years and, subject to this section, membership shall be on such terms as the Minister determines.  I wonder what that last section means.  Is it a standard procedure that is used in other pieces of legislation or is it quite exceptional, because it appears to be quite unusual to have a situation where the Minister can actually determine the terms of membership and can impose conditions in regard to membership which are not specified in the Act.  I would like to ask the Minister's advice as regards the extent of this subsection and in particular that part of the subsection which starts at the comma and which continues &ldquo;membership shall be on such terms as the Minister determines&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Fallon, about the membership of the agency, the subsection provides that the membership of the agency shall be not less than eight and not more than ten. It is considered that while this is a much smaller number than under the old Combat Poverty Committee &mdash; there were 25 members in that committee &mdash; what is now proposed is about the right size to ensure adequate representation while at the same time enabling the business of the agency to be conducted efficiently. This provision, significantly enough, is in accordance with the specific recommendations by the former Combat Poverty Committee which, as I said operated with a membership of 25.  They have made a specific recommendation for the <Col N="992" /> smaller number.  The interim board of the Combat Poverty organisation also recommended a smaller number.  Those are the people who have been involved with the work of the old committee and with the work of the interim board, and I am sure they have very good and sound reasons for recommending that the committee should be of the size now mentioned in the subsection.</P>
      <P>On Senator O'Leary's point on subsection (4), under this subsection the Minister will determine the period of membership of members of agency, with the proviso that the period may not exceed three years.  Members whose terms of office expired could be eligible for reappointment under subsection (7) of the section.  Subsection 4 also provides that membership shall be on such terms as the Minister determines.  This is a standard provision.  There is nothing sinister about it.  Somebody must determine the terms of membership of the committee.  The most appropriate authority to fix the terms is the Minister, I know in committees like this it is not the same as terms of employment but it is kind of a parallel I would imagine.  I would also point out that it would not be appropriate for members to sit according to their own terms, to lay down terms under which they would act.  There is nothing sinister in it.  It is a common provision.  It is to clarify the minds of the members of the committee on the broad terms under which they act.  The Minister is the only authority to decide on that.  It is not for curtailing activities or limiting their work in any way.  It is just to set down terms.  Any member who is invited to serve on the committee would want to know the terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that the purpose of the Bill which will eventually be an Act is that it lays down the terms of the appointment.  I understand that when the Minister appoints a person to any committee obviously the Minister is the person who determines the terms of the appointment. Here we have the situation where the <Col N="993" /> Oireachtas is setting up a structure under which people will be appointed and it is giving the person appointed by the Minister certain statutory duties and responsibilities with regard to the carrying out of the duties and functions of the Combat Poverty Agency.  I do not understand the superimposition on top of that function of an additional series of conditions which are not laid out but which the Minister can apply.  While it is obvious that the Minister is free to determine the terms of an appointment to a body which is within his control this body and its terms of reference are being established by the Oireachtas.  The section would be improved by the addition of an additional number of words along the following lines: &ldquo;Membership shall be on such terms as the Minister determines subject to the Act.&rdquo;  All it says is &ldquo;subject to this section&rdquo;.  It is not subject to the Act; &ldquo;subject to this section, membership shall be on such terms as the Minister determines.&rdquo;  Surely it should read &ldquo;subject to this Act...&rdquo;.  If we make membership only subject to the section it appears to me that the only rules which the Minister can change by way of additional rules or terms are the rules which fall within section 7.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he might be assisted in his objective by changing the section to make the appointment subject to the Act rather than to the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

      <P>The actual subsection is subject to the section.  For example, subsection (5) reads:</P>
      <P>Any member of the Agency may, at any time, be removed from membership of the Agency by the Minister if, in the Minister's opinion, the member has become incapable through ill-health of performing his functions, or has committed stated mis-behaviour, or his removal appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the Agency of its functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the context in which the power is given to the Minister within that section. <Col N="994" /> Section 4 is subject to the full contents of section 7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to add any words to this exchange except ones that would be of some assistance.  Perhaps I am over simplifying the point made by Senator O'Leary.  The thrust of it would be to remove any suggestion of arbitrary interpretation.  The point he is making is one I would support and urge the Minister to think again about is that it goes without saying that where determinations have to be made it is obvious that the Minister would be the person who would make such determinations and it is equally in the interests of the Minister in any actions that he may take, in any determinations he may make, to be doing so explicitly within the terms of the Act rather than implicitly by some other criteria.  The wording before us creates at least that suspicion as a possibility. It would strengthen the Bill if the Minister acceded to Senator O'Leary's request.  Subsection (5) to which the Minister addressed our attention is one which is quite explicit on the grounds on which the Minister would act.  There is a problem if you take subsection (4) to be read with it that there are over and above the grounds of subsection (5) other grounds which cannot now be stated.  It is to the protection of the Minister of the day if you use Senator O'Leary's formulation or some such in which this will be exercised subject to the Act.</P>

      <P>Section 7 is the section which refers to the members of the agency.  The other sections deal with other matters.  It is felt that this is the correct procedure for dealing with membership and the terms of membership.  I would not regard it as appropriate to connect other sections of the Act with the section that deals with the membership of the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>May I help the Minister further in this regard?  For example, if of the ten members of the agency two were civil servants from his own Department, one person, on the basis of this, could be <Col N="995" /> appointed on the basis that he would always support the other in any vote in the agency.  That would be within the terms of the Act.  This is a more real problem than the Minister might imagine.  Very often with appointees of Ministers, particularly where there is more than one appointee, people of different levels of administrative authority acting as independent members of an agency or a State-sponsored body, the policy of the Minister as determined by the mind of the most senior civil servant present becomes automatically the minds of both civil servants or the three civil servants as the case may be.  That is something of which I have personal experience as a member of a State-sponsored body. The mind of the Minister magically transferred itself not only to the most senior man but through him to all the other civil servants.  You found they were all acting in accordance with the Minister's wishes, but they also happened to interpret the Minister's wishes in the same way at precisely the same time.  If on the following day the Minister changed his mind or the senior man said the Minister had changed his mind, they all changed their minds too.  This is a real problem.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the present Minister would impose any such unreasonable conditions but it is important that those people who are appointed should be appointed subject only to the fact that the Minister can, at any time, under subsection (5), remove them.  That is only right and proper.  We should leave people as free as possible to act as freely and as independently as possible, subject to the ultimate sanction of the Minister, which is a two-edged weapon.  No Minister likes to remove somebody, and that imposes a brake upon the Minister's impatience with the individual actions of a member of an agency or a member of any board.  On the other hand, the member knows that he can only go so far.  We should retain the maximum amount of independence possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the ways to do that is to make <Col N="996" /> membership subject to such terms as the Minister determines which are in conformity not only with the section but with the Act in general.  It is a drastic matter, but these things do form a very important background to the way in which legislation subsequently affects the independence of members and affects the independence of thought.  If anything came out of our detailed discusion of this Bill on the last occasion it was that the independence of thought of the members of the agency was going to be most important.  They are going to be saying unpopular things, things that I will not like, but I want them to say them and if I do not agree with them I would like the freedom in this House or somewhere else to disagree with them.  It is important that that freedom would be maximised.  Their contribution to our society will be enhanced by their greater freedom.  In those circumstances I would like the Minister to have a look at it between this and Report Stage and see if he would, having reflected on the matter, accept some amendment which would have the effect I suggested at the earlier stage.</P>

      <P>On section 14, which deals with superannuation, could I ask the Minister whether it is intended that the superannuation provisions which relate to the public service in general are to be extended to the employees of the Combat Poverty Agency or is there going to be a more realistic scheme devised which will not have the grosser excesses of the present public service pension scheme which is imposing tremendous strain on our resources?  I am not suggesting that there should be changes in respect of anybody already in the public service, but here is an opportunity to break away from that mould.  I would like to ask the Minister what is the present <Col N="997" /> intention with regard to superannuation. For example, are there to be very big tax free lump sums?  Are there to be inflation proof pensions?  Is it his intention to use the superannuation provision being enacted here to add to our problems or is it his intention to propose, subject to the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service, a more realistic system of superannuation?</P>

      <P>This section requires the agency to prepare and submit to the Minister a superannuation scheme for its employees.  As the House is aware there are a number of superannuation schemes operating in the public service area &mdash; there is a difference between the State bodies and the public service as such &mdash; so that it will be a matter for the agency, in the first instance, to prepare a superannuation scheme for its employees.  Such a scheme would fix the time and conditions of retirement for those to whom the scheme applies.  The other subsections deal with the working of such schemes. Subsection (4) reads:</P>
      <P>A scheme submitted to the Minister under this section shall, if approved of by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service, be carried out by the Agency in accordance with its terms.</P>
      <P>Section 14 (6) prohibits the agency from granting pensions and gratuities except in accordance with the scheme submitted and approved under this subsection. Every scheme submitted and approved under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say to the Minister that I appreciate the fact that it is a little early to ask for a definitive decision from him with regard to the type of superannuation scheme involved. However, it is also wise that the Minister should be aware that there will be at least one Member of the Oireachtas &mdash; if he is still around &mdash; who, when the scheme <Col N="998" /> submitted and approved under this section is laid before the Oireachtas, if it includes the type of provisions which have become normal, the opportunity will be taken to object to that on the basis that the further extension of this very expensive scheme cannot be in the national interest.  I am not trying to take anything from anybody who has it already, but it is important that these things should not be extended further.  In considering any proposal from the Combat Poverty Agency the Minister should bear in mind that there is a limit to the public purse. Certain changes in the area of pensions in so far as they relate to public employees and to employees of State sponsored and similar bodies, some changes with regard to new employees and some changes with regard to new agencies, might well be in the public interest.  Automatic approval of all the Members of this House should not be assumed to a scheme which is identical to the scheme at present operating in the public area.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), lines 6 to 8, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) elected as a member of either House of the Oireachtas of of the Assembly of the European Communities, or&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thank you for facilitating the putting <Col N="999" /> together of these.  It is a most useful way of debating them.  I will be as brief as possible because I think they are self evident. An important principle is at stake. In relation to the first, it is an extremely harsh provision if a member of the agency who has been nominated by the Minister had to lose his place on the board because he was nominated for election to either House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities. It may have the effect of losing a person needlessly from the agency.  As we all know there is a great gap between nomination and election.  There is quite a gap between the expectation of election and the enjoyment of it.  It is a needlessly harsh provision to want to lose somebody from the agency.</P>
    <P>As well as that, the kind of person you are likely to get on the agency may very well be somebody who has had both a professional role and a political role or a person who has had a professional role and a community activist role and so forth.  It is requiring too much that, from the moment of nomination, you would lose such a member.  Looking at the equivalents of the Combat Poverty Agency in Britain and in the United States, under the Johnson administration there were many people who moved between the administration and active political life.  This is a needless restraint. The amendment states where a person is &ldquo;elected as a member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities...&rdquo;.  In the case of nomination to the European Communities any number of people can be nominated as ancillary candidates and so on.  It is needlessly wasteful of perhaps a good member's contribution.  In relation to amendment No. 2, the case is even stronger here.  It is that a person who spent his life, for example, in setting up and evaluating schemes of direct intervention in relation to poverty, inequality and so on wants to move into the political realm with different options, it is needlessly harsh to ask the person from the moment of nomination to pull back and <Col N="1000" /> it is equally wasteful of a person's perhaps very valuable contribution.</P>
    <P>I take the point that Nos. 3 and 4 are consequential on No. 2.  The point is made that the net consequences of accepting the amendment which would substitute the point of election for the point of nomination would be that it would have these consequences in relation to remuneration or allowances. Overall, the notion is that by mere nomination you are contaminated, to use an unfortunate word, and that it makes your services suspect.  It is ridiculous to imagine that a person would not have some orientation.  In fact, it would almost disqualify him from being a very valuable person if he were not inclined towards some options in relation to the political, social and economic worlds.  It would encourage more people into the political process if you allow, up to the point of election, people to be nominated.  It would be far more open.</P>
    <P>If a person is on the agency or is working for the agency, why lose that person because he has been nominated?  It makes sense if you are arguing the point that there is a conflict of roles involved between a legislative function and an administrative one.  There is no legislative function until after the person has been elected.  It cannot be argued that he is crossing over the ground there.  I urge the Minister to think again about the question of the point of nomination and the point of election.  If there is any conflict involved, it is purely from the point of election and it is needlessly restrictive and needlessly wasteful of contributions people have to make.</P>

      <P>I strongly support Senator Higgins.  This type of problem arose on at least one other occasion and I think Deputy Barry Desmond was the Minister involved.  As far as I can recall, the Minister supported this view and said he hoped to look at it in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Higgins has made a positive case as to why the amendments should be carried.  For example, on the administrative panel of the Seanad, to which there are seven members elected, the <Col N="1001" /> people who are involved in this type of work are targets to be candidates for the panel in question.  There is much merit in what the Senator said and I agree totally with his sentiments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that there is a general view in the House that restrictions like this in quite a number of matters should be swept away.  There have been many views expressed down through the years with regard to many different types of agencies, companies and State-sponsored bodies, that a nomination as a member of Seanad Éireann or a nomination as a candidate in respect of either House of the Oireachtas should not automatically disqualify from membership.  I am speaking from the point of view of membership of the body and leaving aside the question of employees.  I support what Senator Higgins has said.</P>
      <P>It is ludicrous to make candidature for Seanad Éireann a disqualification for membership of an agency such as this. The parliamentary draftsman, who is including this type of condition in draft Bill after draft Bill, will have to be taught a lesson.  Senator Ferris and I promised that we would teach him a lesson some time.  We have not found exactly the right Bill yet but we will and we will teach him a lesson that membership of Seanad Éireann is recognised as being less political. It is less political.  A Seanad election is less overtly political.  There is no reason why membership of these kind of agencies could not continue during the course of that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators may be interested to know that during the course of the 1982 Seanad election I was an outgoing Senator and I acted as an agent for a series of candidates who were being put forward at that time.  An issue arose regarding a particular candidate who was seeking election to this House.  The difficulty arose with regard to the question of that candidate having been nominated by a nominating body and wishing also to be nominated by a panel of four Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A dispute arose as <Col N="1002" /> to whether the person was nominated without her consent as a candidate by a nominating body.  For the purpose of the examination by a High Court judge it was assumed that she was nominated without her consent; the judge held, as a matter of law, that a person can be nominated for Seanad Éireann without his or her consent.  The consent of the candidate is not a necessary prerequisite for candidature. This is an important distinction between Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. The consent of the individual is not a necessary prerequisite to be a candidate for Seanad Éireann.  It is possible in theory &mdash; I accept that it would not happen in practice &mdash; for a person who is a member of an agency such as this to be removed from membership of that agency by his or her nomination as a candidate for Seanad Éireann by a group of individuals without his or her permission.  The judicial referee, who was a High Court judge, held that it was within the authority of the nominating body to nominate somebody without his or her permission.  This alone must distinguish candidature for a Seanad election from the situation which appertains in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that between now and Report Stage he should look at the amendments that Senator Robinson suggested and which Senator Higgins proposed and that he should look in particular at how the Bill affects membership of this House and candidature for membership of it and introduce the necessary amending legislation in view of the decision of the judicial referee with regard to the question of a person being nominated as a candidate without his or her permission. That decision could have been appealed to the High Court.  It was not appealed to the High Court because there is no doubt that the decision of the judicial referee was, in fact, the correct decision. The Minister should reconsider the matter particularly with regard to being nominated as a candidate for election to this House.  Having dealt with that matter we can deal with the wider matter in some later legislation which comes before the House.  I would recommend that the Minister would do that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the recommendations of the Review Committee on Adoption Law and recognises their value; and calls upon the Minister for Health to introduce <Col N="1006" /> legislation without delay implementing these recommendations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this important report.  However, I very much regret the circumstances in which this opportunity has been created.  I was not present in the House at 2.30 p.m. when the Order of Business was agreed.  I was informed in the course of this afternoon of the decision taken.  I was informed in adequate time to prepare to contribute to the debate.  Once the House decided that the motion referring to this important report was to be taken at this time, if the motion is not moved then it lapses.  It would be extremely regrettable if a report of this significance, as will be evident from the debate which we will have today and on the next day when the debate resumes should lapse.  That would be highly regrettable.  The report refers to very urgent matters in relation to our adoption code which are badly in need of reform.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret that the proposer of the motion, Senator McGuinness, is not present and is not contactable so that she has not been able to express any view on the matter.  I know that she will want to make her contribution.  Senator McGuinness will have an opportunity to wind up and reply to the debate.  It is unfortunate and regrettable that this has happened. The debate has been set in train.  The best course at this stage is to use the time that has been allocated by the House and to have this debate on the Review Committee on adoption law.</P>
    <P>The primary reason why I seconded the report at the request of Senator McGuinness was because she particularly asked me to do so as somebody like herself who has been involved as a practitioner dealing with adoption cases.  She felt it would be appropriate that I should second the motion in her name so that we could express not only our strong views on the recommendations of the Review Committee but also our sense of urgency, a sense that it is important that priority be given to bringing in the necessary amending legislation, and that we could say that as proposer and seconder <Col N="1007" /> of the motion.  I am sure Senator McGuinness will echo that in her reply to it.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to debate the report of the Review Committee which was submitted to the Government in May 1984.  It is a model of what I would regard as a balanced and caring report. That is not, in fact, to say that I necessarily agree with every detailed recommendation or position taken by members of the Review Committee.  They are to be commended for the very balanced and reflective way in which they have sought to put forward proposals for reform in this particularly vulnerable and difficult area of adoption.  It is an area which affects a number of different people.  To some extent, it is an area where pain will be caused to some at least, if not all, of the parties involved.</P>
    <P>It affects deeply the mother of a child who faces a decision whether to keep that child, if she is an unmarried mother, or whether to place the child in adoption. Her position is thoughtfully and caringly reflected in the recommendations of the report.  It affects the prospective adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>Some of the criticisms of the existing procedure show an awareness of unnecessary delays and unnecessary complications in the procedure which have led to heartache and, sometimes, very severe grief on the part of adopting parents, where, at the end, the process does not come to completion as they might have wished.  It affects the child who is the subject of adoption.  It also affects other children who are not at the moment eligible to be considered for adoption.</P>
    <P>Given that adoption is a legal mechanism whereby we as a society provide an alternative family to a child, it is very strange that we have for so long refused to broaden the category of eligibility for adoption.  It is strange &mdash; in a society that does, in a sense, pride itself as caring about children and as being very child-centred and family-orientated, &mdash; that we deny to a significant number of children the possibility of being eligible to have the alternative of an adoptive family and <Col N="1008" /> to have all the security of growing up in a two-parent family situation.  We, in many cases condemn them to growing up in institutional care or, alternatively, in some cases in a much less secure position of long-term fosterage.</P>
    <P>This report is timely and its recommendations are urgent.  There being only a certain time allocated to contributors to a motion in Private Members' time, I propose to consider the summary of the main principles and recommendations in the report, starting at page 99 of the report, and to make comments on these basic principles and recommendations. The first basic consideration which is identified and which is dealt with in detail in chapter 2 is that a child has a right to grow up in his or her family of origin and that this should be supported.  It is clear from the thrust of the report that &ldquo;family&rdquo; there means not just the narrow context of the family based on a valid subsisting marriage, but means &ldquo;family&rdquo; in the broad sense of a single mother in relationship with her child, or mother and father if they are married parents or a couple cohabiting if they are living together as a natural family.  The child has a right to grow up in his or her family of origin.  The State should lend its support to this principle and ensure in particular, that no mother would be obliged to give up a child for adoption because of the economic problems that would otherwise be created for her.</P>
    <P>In theory that is part of our present adoption code &mdash; theory, because of the requirement of a fully informed and free consent on the part of a natural mother. One could argue that a mother should not be forced by economic circumstances and yet there have been a number of judgments in which have said: &ldquo;Look, if we were to look into all the possible pressures of an economic sort on mothers then we could never be sure that there was a situation where there was a fully informed and free consent to the placement of a child for adoption&rdquo;.  If you like, the opposite view is in effect, being implied.  It is being put forward that if the mother was in a secure position economically and in every other way with proper <Col N="1009" /> supports, then it would be much less likely that she would take the decision to place the child for adoption.  Indeed, There is no doubt about it.  Over the last 15 years or so we have seen a substantial reduction in the number of children being placed by their mothers.  We have seen a corresponding increase in the number of mothers who are keeping their children themselves and rearing them.  It is important, as a basic principle, that the State should actively subscribe to the principle that a child has a right to grow up in his or her family of origin and that the State should lend support to that &mdash; financial support, advisory support, and all the help and back-up that would be necessary.  That would mean some fairly substantial practical measures in the area of child care and other areas in order to secure, particularly to the one-parent family, the kind of supports that would ensure the application of that principle.</P>
    <P>The next principle which follows from that basic one is that a child has a right to a stable and caring home.  Where this cannot be provided by the family of origin then a range of alternatives should be available, either short-term or long-term, as the particular case may require.  This is the proper emphasis.  It leads to the next main area of consideration, which is in chapter 3 of the report, and that is the question of the eligibility of children for adoption.  Under our present law the class of children who are eligible for adoption are children who are illegimate or orphans, There is a technical extension of that to include a legitimated child under the 1964 Act provided the birth of that legitimated child &mdash; a child legitimated by the subsequent marriage of the parents &mdash; has not been re-registered.</P>
    <P>Excluded from eligibility for adoption are the child or children of married parents, even if those married parents have completely failed to assume any parenting role, even if they have been completely lacking in any capacity or willingness or ability to assume the responsibilities of being loving and caring parents, even if they are themselves separated no longer living together in any family context, or even if there are in practice <Col N="1010" /> the most appalling problems and insurmountable barriers to any kind of normal family life for the child.  The child can be taken into care if this is necessary, but that child would not be eligible for adoption. The review committee rightly come down on what ought to be the principle which would apply, and that is that all children should be eligible for adoption and that the law should be changed to allow for the adoption of legitimate children with parents living, where the circumstances warrant them, to give them the opportunity of being placed in an adoptive family.</P>
    <P>The review committee also &mdash; and I would support this &mdash; note in some detail in chapter 3 the possible constitutional difficulties which could arise, and rather than wish those away the review committee recommend, in effect, that there be an amendment of the Constitution.  I would support that view because although this is a difficult legal area &mdash; I do not want to dwell on it at length in the time I have at my disposal &mdash; I think it is a wrong area on which to have a shadow of doubt.  In other words, I do not think we should contemplate bringing in legislation which is potentially open to the taint of being unconstitutional, because if a challenge were to be brought it would affect so many vulnerable individuals and families in the country.  It would be much better to clarify the matter by putting forward the appropriate amendment of the Constitution.  This is important also because there is a value being promoted. I think it is a value on which it is appropriate to act by way of a constitutional amendment involving the necessary referendum and therefore public discussion and participation by the people by way of referendum.  I would very much support that major change.</P>
    <P>Again in the next chapter &mdash; chapter 4 &mdash; the review committee consider the question of the eligibility of adopters. I would broadly support the proposals which they make in that area that whereas adoption should continue under normal and in most circumstances to be adoption by married couples jointly, that a single person in addition to existing <Col N="1011" /> categories should be eligible to adopt where it is in the best interests of the child.  There have undoubtedly been cases &mdash; and I have certainly known of some cases &mdash; where a person who should have been in a position to adopt was not eligible to do so under existing law.  There was a tragic case of somebody who was, in effect, the real parent of a child and who had been bringing up that child and wished to assume the full legal relationship of parent and child, but was, for very technical and unconvincing reasons, excluded from eligibility to adopt.</P>
    <P>I note at paragraph 4 (18) and 4 (19) that the review committee are of the view that unmarried couples or those whose marriages are not recognised by the State should not be eligible to adopt jointly.  I would certainly like to see that further discussed and developed, because undoubtedly, under our present situation in Ireland, we are seeing evidence of an increasing number of stable unions between couples who are simply not themselves eligible to marry, to use that phrase again.  There is the problem for one of them having been involved in a previous marriage.  In the absence of divorce &mdash; which is something I hope we will discuss very shortly &mdash; the couple cannot regularise their position.  These are, generally, couples who want to marry but who are prevented for doing so and it may well be, for one reason or another, that they would be an eminently suitable family to adopt a child.  In those circumstances the State should allow the adoption to be effected jointly by such a couple.  The circumstances could be set out quite strictly as is done in the case of married couples.</P>
    <P>I support the simplification proposed in standardising the minimum age for all categories of adopters to 21, and I support also the continuance of the position that there is no statutory upper age limit for adoptive parents.  There is a rule of practice and a code of procedure about the age limit so far as the adoption societies are concerned, but there can be circumstances where a couple who are older <Col N="1012" /> than adoption societies would consider to be ideal are the appropriate couple to adopt in particular circumstances.  I would not like to see them disbarred altogether by statute.</P>
    <P>Chapter 5 deals with an extremely important area in relation to adoption, and that is the whole area of consent. The review committee, having looked at this closely are of the view that the present consent procedure is too long and complex.  They recommend a simplified system but one which would nevertheless operate in two stages, the first stage being an agreement to placement for adoption and the second being the actual consent to adoption.  In effect that more or less describes the two main stages of the existing procedure.  The review committee recommend that the existing method for the placement of the child for adoption should continue to operate but then they recommend a significant change to the present position.  By and large I go along with this recommendation but I have some cause for concern which I will mention in a moment.</P>
    <P>The review committee recommend that a natural parent &mdash; it would in normal circumstances be the natural mother but we will see that the father is also potentially involved in certain circumstances where his consent may be required &mdash; would be statutorily entitled to the return of the child within the first three months of placement for adoption. In other words there would be a clear right to the mother if she decided to look for the child back, because she had changed her mind after the agreement to place, as long as it was done within three months and this statutory right to the return of the child means that adoption societies would be obliged to ensure that the child was returned.</P>
    <P>Normally that right would exist for three months after placement, but that right would only endure up to the time of the actual making of the consent to adoption by the mother in the event of her consenting before the three month period expired.  If she consented earlier &mdash; she would not, of course, be in a <Col N="1013" /> position to consent before a period of six weeks &mdash; and before the three months, then she would only have a statutory right to recover the child up to the time she consented, but not after that.</P>
    <P>Then there is the recommendation which I will quote: &ldquo;after the expiration of this period she should be required to apply to the adoption court for the return of her child&rdquo;.  I will come to the proposal in the review committee to establish an adoption court as a substitute for the existing adoption board with its statutory powers and functions under the adoption code.  I am concerned about the way in which that balance is worked out, because it means that after a period of three months has elapsed the onus of applying to the adoption court is on the natural mother.  In a sense this may mean that the onus of proof on the matter is on the natural mother after three months following the placement.  It requires that the natural mother have clear access to legal advice.  It is based on an assumption that she would have available to her legal advice to enable her to take proceedings. Natural mothers at the moment do sometimes take proceedings.  They take proceedings under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  They may take <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings when they want to take urgent steps.  They do sometimes manage to get legal advice and indeed once they are involved in seeking the return of their children, legal aid is provided under a special scheme to ensure in the particular circumstances that they will have legal advice.  At the same time it has been my experience that there are a number of cases where a natural mother simply did not take any steps because she had no legal advice.  Very frequently adoption matters come to court not because the natural mother has taken a step at all but because the prospective adoptive parents &mdash; when the mother has failed to complete the final consent &mdash; decided to bring an application under section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1974 seeking to dispense with her consent.  Very often, therefore, the matter comes to court because the prospective adoptive parents &mdash; having exhausted any other <Col N="1014" /> method of trying to get the consent and having been told by the adoption society that it looks as if the mother is not going to consent in this case, will bring proceedings under the 1974 Act.</P>
    <P>This reflects a practical reality.  It also brings out the lack of easy access to legal advice by single mothers.  In many cases where the natural mother is young, or where she comes from a background where she is not accustomed to taking independent decisions on her own behalf or where she lacks the self confidence, she could be disadvantaged by the fact that she would be required under this recommendation to apply to the adoption court.</P>
    <P>I would also be concerned to ensure that the natural mother did not carry with her application some heavy burden even after three months in relation to seeking to establish that it was in the best interests of the child in order to ensure that the child be returned to her.  That is something I should like to see more fully discussed.  It may be something on which the Minister might comment when participating in the debate.</P>
    <P>The next recommendation is that the consent to adoption should be irrevocable. At present a natural mother may withdraw her consent to adoption at any time before the making of the adoption order.  I can see the substantial reasons behind this recommendation of the review committee.  There have been heartbreaking situations for prospective adoptive parents where the mother has withdrawn the consent, so giving rise to the necessity for an application under the 1974 Act and for litigation on that.  But if the consent is now to be irrevocable, that requires a very high quality and standard of advice and counselling and help to the mother before she consents. That is something we would have to think very carefully about.  However I may have misread that slightly and I may have raised an issue which is not a major problem in the area.</P>
    <P>The next matter I want to consider is a proposal which I very much welcome, the review committee would give better recognition to the natural father and <Col N="1015" /> enable him to exercise significant rights in certain circumstances which he does not have at the moment.  They propose that the consent of a natural father to the adoption of his child should be required where the paternity has been established and, secondly, where parental rights have been vested in him by court order.  There is a definite link between that provision and the proposals in the Status of Children Bill.  It would be interesting to hear the Minister's comments on the proposed extension of the right to the natural father, which I very much support, and on the manner in which this would be affected.</P>
    <P>The dispensing of consent would be done by the adoption court, which would be so empowered, in certain circumstances. This is another reason why it would be preferable to have a constitutional amendment to remove any possibility of a constitutional challenge to that provision in the case of a child of married parents.  The court would be empowered to dispense with consent to adoption in certain defined circumstances provided that a period of three months had elapsed since the child was placed.</P>
    <P>There are a number of useful proposals in relation to adoption agencies.  It is noted that there are too many agencies and that there is a need for new criteria for registration and the maintaining of standards by the agencies.  I would agree with that.  There is a proposal to limit more narrowly private adoption arrangements. It would no longer be lawful for a person other than a relative to receive a child for the purpose of adoption unless the child is placed by an adoption agency. This is probably a wise course given the full implications of adoption and the need for very careful counselling and standards to apply.</P>
    <P>A major structural reform proposed by the review committee is that the adoption board &mdash; which was established under the 1952 Act &mdash; would be replaced by a specialist adoption court and that this would be a single authority having a jurisdiction throughout the country and having the powers of the High Court.  It <Col N="1016" /> would function as a branch of the High Court.  I find the proposals of the review committee on this extremely interesting. They are not dissimilar to the proposals in relation to a family tribunal contained in the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  That was dealing with much broader areas of jurisdiction, but it is interesting that the approach is not at all dissimilar.  The recommended composition of the Adoption Court is that it would be presided over by a single judge especially appointed for that function and the judge, where there was a contested case, would sit with two assessors who would be drawn from a panel chosen by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I should like to see further discussion on the composition of that panel.  I welcome the idea of assessors sitting with a judge, in that this would give a balance between the strictly legal issues that would have to be considered and on which the judge would have to be satisfied &mdash; whether all the statutory criteria were established, whether there was a proper consent in the circumstances &mdash; and the broader issues in relation to the proper decision on the basis of the welfare of the child.  In chapter 10 the review committee make a number of recommendations in regard to procedures to be observed by adoption agencies in making placements and in supervising placements for adoption. My view would be that the standards of adoption agencies vary greatly throughout the country.  Some are excellent, some are adequate and some are substandard in the sense that problems arise in relation to the way in which they exercise their functions.  I would agree with the recommendation of the review committee that there needs to be a proper basis for registration and for deciding on the procedures of the adoption agencies in order to ensure that they carry out their functions of supervising placements to an adequate degree.</P>
    <P>I support also the idea of giving an alternative jurisdiction to the Adoption Court to make an order of guardianship as opposed to adoption in certain circumstances. This is an appropriate concurrent jurisdiction for a proposed adoption <Col N="1017" /> court of that kind, as it may well be that it would be better in some circumstances for the court to make an order appointing the applicants to be the child's legal guardians.</P>
    <P>Another important new proposal is that a child would have a limited but a defined statutory right to information. This is a recommendation supported by a majority of members of the review committee, and it would apply only to future adoptions.  A majority of the committee were not of the view that it should extend to adoption orders which have been made already.  The effect of it would be that when a child had reached the age of 18 &mdash; and was therefore an adult for legal purposes &mdash; that child would have the right of access to his or her original birth certificate. The statutory right would not extend beyond that.  In order for that right to operate fairly for the natural parent or parents involved, they would be made aware when the child was being placed for adoption that the child would have that right.  It is available in other countries and it helps certain children who have a crisis of identity &mdash; particularly as teenagers &mdash; and who in order to understand themselves during the period of adolescence have a basic need for greater information about their parents and about themselves.  In some cases they may wish to find their natural parents and seek to establish a relationship with them.  It is important that a recommendation of that kind be implemented. There has been a slight artificiality in our adoption code.  It has been too absolute. Therefore, I welcome that recommendation.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to consider any further matter but I look forward to the debate and to the contribution of the Minister and of Senator McGuinness in replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of the motion, I welcome this report.  Its recommendations are long overdue in the adoption field.  Senator Robinson is the best person possible to deal with the constitutional aspects of it in terms of consent.  I intend <Col N="1018" /> to restrict myself to chapter 7 which is the adoption agency section.  Despite the fact that the review body made such recommendations, they have failed to grasp the nettle.  Last year the adoption agencies dealt with 1,100 children.  We are all under the protection of the State, but there is no section so vulnerable as children.  We would be unhappy if a child with a broken arm for instance, was sent to a part time semi-skilled practitioner to have the arm repaired, but we are content to allow part time, in many cases unskilled and very inefficient organisations to decide what to do with thousands of children.</P>
      <P>As we can see from the report, the Adoption Board do not fulfil their function in terms of monitoring and reviewing. Therefore, we can say with some justification that the system appears to be that the agency apply and get an automatic agreement from the Adoption Board for what they propose.  The review committee have said they wanted to acknowledge the genuinely humane concern and compassionate approach that normally prevails in the difficult work of the adoption agencies but in the submissions received from interested organisations and individuals there was a considerable volume of criticism of some aspects of the work of the agencies.  In general we accept that the criticisms are well founded.  When this review board report comes up for legislation the Minister will have to pay far more attention than did the review committee to chapter 7, in relation to the agencies.  What is the reality?  The reality is that you can shop around.  We know of the trauma of many couples who are unable, for one reason or another, to have children of their own. We know the searching that goes on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying before I was interrupted by Senator Ryan that the idea of a couple who wish to adopt a child having to shop around various adoption agencies should not be tolerated.  Prospective parents of an adoptive child do not know what the standard or the criteria is in any adoption society.  In some cases some agencies refuse to allow a child to be adopted by parents who are over the age of 40.  Some agencies refuse to allow a child to be adopted by couples who are under the age of 40.  In some cases it is impossible for a non-Catholic to adopt a child in this State.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that, having called for a quorum, the two gentlemen concerned are now leaving.</P>
      <P>Some of the agencies would seem to be more concerned with establishing that one is a card carrying member of the Catholic Church rather than establishing one's suitability to look after and bring up a child with the love and care all children should have as a right.  The difficulties faced by people who are not members of the majority Church in this country are immense.  All prospective couples should have equal rights in terms of adoption.  There should be some common standard set by an authority.  In this case it is a matter for the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare to set known standards.  One can imagine the chances of a non-believer, or a Protestant, a Jew or a Muslim, going to the Catholic Protection and Rescue Society or the Limerick Catholic Adoption Society regarding the adoption of a child.  As we go down the list we have the whole calendar of every saint canonised by the Church before there is reference to adoption agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has a role to play.  While I admire the work of voluntary bodies &mdash; I do not decry it in any way &mdash; the area of the placement of children is so important that it ought to be a matter solely for the State and in this case under the aegis of the various health boards.  There is mention of this in the review committee's report: you have a situation where in one part of the country a couple are quite happy and prepared and are suitable to <Col N="1020" /> adopt a child which another area has found extremely difficult to place but there is no transfer of information.  Why should there be?  How can one expect that there would be when you are dealing with part time, understaffed voluntary, and, as the report says, in many cases inefficient bodies?  There is a need in the interests of the children.  Like many organisations, after a while they are run sometimes for the benefit of the people who are charged with the task of organising them and the main function of placing children in proper homes for adoption is sometimes lost sight of.  We now have more than 20 adoption societies.  Last year one society had no children available for adoption.  This begs the question of why they are there?  Is it because there is a chairman, a secretary and committee members who like to be around in case something happens?  There is no reason to have 20 agencies to place something under 1,000 children in this State.  When this review committee's report comes up for legislation that whole area of adoption societies should be taken into account.  I do not want my contribution to be construed as an attack in any way on the work these societies have been doing.  I simply question, as do the review body, their efficiency, their capability and the need for them when we now have in the eighties a health system which is sophisticated, which is administered in various areas and which is light years away from a situation when local community voluntary bodies had to do this because nobody else could do it.  That situation has utterly changed.  Therefore, the review committee should have grasped that nettle and said simply and straightforwardly that the placement of children will become a matter for the State.  Even if they did not want to go down that road totally, they could have taken another direction because at the moment the 20 agencies who have the power to recommend the placement of children are financed in the main by the State.  The Department of Health pay substantial sums of money to these voluntary bodies for the work they do.  It is quite right that they should.  But in return there seems to <Col N="1021" /> be no facility for representation by the Department.</P>
    <P>So long as an agency submit their registration criteria and that is accepted that is the end of the matter.  They are then in receipt of State funds to carry on the work in a voluntary fashion.  I have always believed that wherever the State gives out, on an ongoing and regular basis, sums which may be substantial or otherwise it should have representation on those boards.</P>
    <P>It states in this report that the agency sent out questionnaires; most of the agencies replied and some did not.  The committee accepted the fact that the Adoption Board does not have a proper monitoring procedure.  As I stated at the outset it is conceivable that little, if any, checks are carried out on most of the agencies.  I submit that there should be, as a right, representation from the Department of Health on all the agencies, not only to monitor how its money is spent, but more important, to monitor how these people go about placing children. It is ludicrous to have a choice of any one of the 20 agencies; you do not know what they require of you as they all have different standards and requirements. This is a situation that no couple seeking to adopt a child should be put into; everybody should know that there is a basic criterion that they must meet and that it is not decided by a private group bringing into play their own religious ethos and their own system of values which may not be generally shared.</P>
    <P>While the review board has been quite brave in many areas in terms of the adoption for the first time of legitimate children, it has muddied the waters there to a large extent.  This is an area where in another forum within the Labour Party I intend to pursue chapter 7 in far greater detail than in the two minutes I have been requested to finish in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Members, I, too, want to warmly welcome this report.  It is a pity that it was introduced in controversial circumstances, as it is <Col N="1022" /> deserving of an open-ended debate.  As Senator Robinson has stated, it is timely and urgent and I hope that it gets the attention that it deserves.</P>
      <P>As I did not get enough time to study the report, my contribution will be based on representations made to me at different times relating to it.  The importance of this matter is indicated when you compare the births out of wedlock in 1953 as given in the report as 1,340 and the corresponding figure for 1983 of 4,517. I believe the children born to married couples through extra marital relationships cannot be adopted; where a married mother had a child in such circumstances her husband is the legal father and under the law the child is his; they can place the child in a foster home where it may be moved around from one institution to another three or four times during its childhood.  This child cannot be adopted, because the only criterion is illegitimacy as is set out in the report on page 11, under &ldquo;Adoptable Children&rdquo;, 3.1 and I quote as follows:</P>
      <P>The present law permits the adoption of</P>
      <P>(i)  orphans,</P>
      <P>(ii)  illegitimate children, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  children who have been legitimated, <i>inter alia,</i> by the subsequent marriage of their parents but whose births have not been re-registered in pursuance of the provisions of the schedule to the Legitimacy Act, 1931.</P>
      <P>It has already been pointed out that the third category accounts for a relatively small number.</P>
      <P>It is intended to do away with the status of illegitimacy.  This is something with which we all agree.  There will be a problem in this area because unless the law is changed in relation to adoption, technically, it will not be possible to adopt.  Page 12, paragraph 3.4 of the report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our view adoption should be one of the options available to provide care for all children, whether they are born in or out of wedlock, who cannot grow up in their natural families.  We have <Col N="1023" /> found general support for that view in the submissions received by us.  Furthermore, a survey of member organisations carried out in 1980 by the Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children revealed that 100 per cent of the respondents to a questionnaire favoured the adoption of legitimate children.  In all the circumstances, we recommend that all children should be eligible for adoption irrespective of the marital status of their parents.</P>
    <P>In this regard there are some people who feel that care should be exercised in this area, particularly in coming to a decision concerning the circumstances under which legitimate children could be adopted. For example, if somebody is taken into a mental hospital, or contracts a terminal illness, or is declared an alcoholic, could the State take the children into care?  And in such a situation in the long term could they decide to have the children adopted?  This would be contrary to Article 41 of the Constitution.  I quote the relevant section:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>Article 41.2 states:</P>
    <P>The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its Constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>Article 42 states:</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents, for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means, shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    <P>This matter is considered in detail in <Col N="1024" /> the report but as I have stated I did not get enough time to study it and as a result I cannot elaborate on this.  It is an area which causes considerable anxiety for a number of people.</P>
    <P>I understand that for every one child available, there are seven couples who want to adopt it.  On the other hand, the information in the report does not seem to bear this out, because the number of applications received in 1953 was 1,520 and the corresponding number in 1983 is 1,115.  A mother may sign an order to have her baby placed for adoption and after a period of time &mdash; it is generally regarded as six to 12 months but in fact could go on for a couple of years &mdash; the mother can change her mind and refuse to sign the final consent form.  I believe that the Adoption Board can dispense with her authority if it is in the child's best interest.  There are some people who feel that even in this sensitive area and making allowance for the mother's rights at particular times the board might and should do that.  Not very long ago there was publicity in the daily papers about one family that I know very well, a young married family.  They had taken a child for adoption and they had this child for nearly 12 months and, apparently, at that stage the mother changed her mind. There was a relationship established between the child and the adoptive parents.  I suppose that this was not an isolated incident and that it can happen on quite a large scale.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that it can happen in such a sensitive area.  There are many people who do not think it is fair that if a mother places a child for adoption and then takes a long time to make up her mind and she wants it looked after and does not want to take the child back, she should have put it in for fostering in the first place.  This situation is covered in page 76 in paragraphs 10.12 and 10.13 of the report where it refers to the waiting period.  It points out that there is no statutory minimum period which must elapse, but in section 10.13 it states:</P>
    <P>It is clearly desirable that there should be a waiting period before the <Col N="1025" /> legalities of an adoption are finalised. The child and his prospective adopters need a trial period to ensure that they have been suitably matched for a permanent relationship.  It is important also that the decision of the natural parent to have her child adopted is not too hastily given legal finality.  However, since most adoption placements do not give rise to any special difficulties and involve very young children whose natural parents are certain of their desire to have them adopted, there is no reason why the completion of the adoption process should be delayed any longer than is necessary in the interests of the parties concerned. In our view it should be possible, in the generality of cases, to establish whether a placement has been successful by the time the child has been in the care of his prospective adopters for three months.  We recognise, of course, that in certain adoption placements a much longer period is required for the child or his prospective adopters to adjust to their new situation.  Nevertheless we consider that in most cases three months is a reasonable waiting period.  We recommend therefore that the new regulations should prescribe this as the normal minimum period, while retaining the present discretion to reduce it in particular circumstances but not below six weeks.</P>
    <P>I believe it is very hard to get foster parents for this reason &mdash; that they might have to give the child back.  I also believe that fostering is to be recommended but it is very difficult to get foster parents to look after a child and to begin to love it and to establish a personal relationship with it for a few years and then give it back.</P>
    <P>The point is made that there is payment for fostering and there is none for adoption. I think a tribute should be paid both to people who adopt and to people who foster.  I believe that it takes a very unselfish person to foster, to take a child into a stable home from a mother who perhaps is alcoholic and in hospital for a time and then, having learned to love <Col N="1026" /> the child, to hand it back.  I believe the mother who gave initial consent to adoption cannot take the child back without a court order and the mother has to apply for a court order.  I also understand that certain people who adopted children have been intimidated into giving them back.  I am told that if an official of the society from which the child was adopted calls and says that the mother has changed her mind, the adoptive parents do not have to say, &ldquo;Yes, we will have the child ready tomorrow&rdquo;.  If a couple have the child for a long period of 12 months or 18 months naturally they would feel that it would be in the best interest of the child to keep it.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the mid-seventies the law was changed so that the top priority is the welfare of the child.  I believe that abandoned children cannot be adopted unless the mother can be found to sign an order and there are many hundreds of those cases.  If this change in the law is to be made I believe the criteria should be given under which legal children may be adopted, and there are certain people who believe it will stir up a hornets' nest. There should be a set of rules for all adoption societies, the same age limit, as Senator Magner has said, clearly defined and so on.  People of mixed marriages should not be penalised.  I understand that we have only one &mdash; most of the people in this country are Catholics &mdash; non-Catholic adoption society and one Jewish adoption society.  It is necessary that religion should be considered, but not to the extent that good Christian people should be penalised.</P>
    <P>Overall, the feeling I have got from some quarters is that the biggest objection would be that all children should be available for adoption because you could have a situation where the mother would have a nervous breakdown or something similar and she would lose her children. The Adoption Board deserve great credit.  It is a voluntary body and some feel that there should be more young people on it.  By and large, they are elderly and a broader mixture would be helpful. There is nobody on it at present with adopted children.  There is only one paid <Col N="1027" /> member with far too much work to do.</P>

      <P>Just to reasure my Independent colleagues about our interests in this motion, as a Labour Party we have been keenly interested in adoption and the implications of adoption for many years.  As a party we have produced position papers on the subject.  I would like the record of the House to indicate that it was a Labour Party Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, who requested this report of the Review Committee which he set up in April 1983.  It is appropriate to quote the Minister's introduction to the report:</P>
      <P>We have a special responsibility towards all children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was quoting the Minister's introductory statement in his acceptance of this report from the Review Committee on the Adoption Services. I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a special responsibility towards all children and particularly to those who might otherwise be denied the benefit of a stable family life.  The introduction over 30 years ago of a legal adoption system provided a very valuable way of safeguarding the future of such children.  Last year I decided that the time had come to review the operation of the laws and procedures of adoption, to see whether this beneficial service could be further strengthened and developed.  I am now very pleased to introduce the report of the committee which I established for <Col N="1028" /> that purpose.  Its comprehensive recommendations raise important and fundamental issues.  I, and the Government, would welcome public comment on them in order to assist us in taking decisions about the future operation of the service.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Private Members' motion in the names of Senator McGuinness and Senator Robinson is what the Minister has asked for, public comment and debate on this very important subject of adoption.  As a member of a health board I have been quite involved with numerous adoptions by way of recommending suitable parents, from my knowledge of them.  Also, as a member of a health board I have been subjected to the trauma of children being taken into care because parents for one reason or another were proven to be incapable of looking after them.  That gives us a special interest in this area of adoption and the valuable recommendations that have been made by the committee who have dealt at length and in great detail with all the various aspects of the present situation regarding adoption.</P>
    <P>The Chair will be aware of the interest shown by the public in this area when the constitutional amendment took place, following a court case, to regularise the adoptions that had already taken place. I welcome Senator Robinson's statement that any changes that would be proposed by way of new legislation would not in fact affect existing adoptions.</P>
    <P>The committee on page 4 of their report, paragraph 1.14 state:</P>
    <P>During the course of the McL. case the constitutionality of the Board's functions and hence the validity of every adoption order made since its establishment in 1952, were brought into question on the grounds that the Board was not a court of law as required under Article 37.1 of the Constitution. Although provision existed for the exercise of limited civil powers of a judicial nature by a body authorised by law, it was argued that the Adoption Board's functions might not be regarded as &ldquo;limited&rdquo; within the <Col N="1029" /> meaning of the Constitution since the Board created and terminated legal relationships.  In the High Court it was held that the Board was operating within the Constitution, but on appeal to the Supreme Court the matter was left undecided.</P>
    <P>To secure the board's decisions a referendum was held.  There was widespread interest throughout the country in the issue although there was no political campaign by any side.  I am glad to say that many of the agencies &mdash; Senator Magner referred to them in his contribution to this debate &mdash; and in fact adoptive parents became quite involved in bringing to the attention of the public the importance of passing this constitutional amendment to ensure that the families created by the adoption of children prior to that were accepted as being lawfully established.</P>
