      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Ferris that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The practice of purchasing milk without regard to its butter fat content, which has caused widespread disruption in the Golden Vale.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Ellis of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The delay in processing applications by unemployed school leavers for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator John Browne of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the number of decisions by An Bord Pleanála upholding planning appeals contravening the development plan in Carlow the need for the Minister for the Environment to issue a general policy directive to the board in order to ensure compliance with a development plan in a given area, particularly Carlow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ferris and Ellis as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I regret that I have <Col N="1866" /> to rule the matter raised by Senator Browne is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground that for the Minister to issue a policy directive in this matter would require amending legislation.  I have selected Senator Ferris's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
    <P>Senator Ellis may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1 and 2 today.  It is hoped to complete all Stages of No. 1.  I would suggest that if No. 1 has not been completed by 8 p.m. the House would sit late in order to complete the consideration of this Bill, but in any case not later than 11 p.m.  If, on the other hand, No. 1 is completed before 8 p.m., I suggest that we should then discuss motion No. 2 until 8 p.m.  For the benefit of Senators, I might indicate the business for tomorrow. The Minister for Health is anxious that he should put on the record of the House, before the House adjourns, his speech for the Second Stage of the Nurses Bill.  I will be asking the House tomorrow morning if they would agree that this should be done and that there should be one speech from the Opposition and then the main debate adjourned until September. I think since the Minister for Health will be coming in to do this that the House should take the opportunity to dispose of the Report and Final Stages of the Combat Poverty Agency Bill on which there will be a Government amendment. I propose tomorrow also to order No. 2, which probably will not be completed, and also to order No. 5.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to talk about Bob Geldof today.  Section 1 of the Farm Tax Bill, 1985, is the usual definition section.  One term of particular importance is the &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; because he is the person who will obviously pay the tax.  The occupier is the person entitled to the immediate use or enjoyment of the land whether it is actually used or <Col N="1869" /> enjoyed.  The vast majority of farms are run by owner-occupiers and under the definition they will be the persons who will be liable for the tax.  The definition goes on to specify who is to pay in a number of particular situations.  The section also contains an anti-avoidance provision, in subsection (2), which is intended to prevent transfers of land within families or between related companies and so on being used to avoid farm tax.  The persons involved in such transfers will continue to be treated as one person and their holdings aggregated for tax purposes unless, of course, the persons concerned are actually farming and managing the holdings separately from each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>In the section line 18 states &ldquo;commercial woodland&rdquo;.  Will the Minister tell us if the fact that it is being determined as &ldquo;commercial woodland&rdquo; automatically creates a grave anomaly? It means that land being used for afforestation is being exempt.  Therefore, a farmer who owns land which is classed as woodland does not pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the exemption of commercial woodlands is concerned, timber is an investment which involves a long pay-back period.  It is a vital national resource and was recognised as a big area for development in the Government White Paper on Industrial Policy.  It is right and proper that it should be encouraged through taxation measures. The income tax law exempts private commercial woodland developments and, of course, State forests or a commercial undertaking would not be liable to income tax.  This Bill follows suit by exempting from the farm tax woodlands commercially developed, and these include State forests.  It would be pointless in any event to tax State forests because it is simply a wasteful and circular transfer of public resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first anomaly created in the Bill.  If a farmer has marginal land &mdash; many parts of my county are marginal lands &mdash; and he plants it he <Col N="1870" /> will not pay tax.  This provision will force marginal farmers to sell their lands to the major groups involved in private afforestation. Those groups will be exempt from paying tax on these lands.  The exemption should be limited to the number of acres. I also hope that State forests will be totally exempt.  There is a very grave anomaly here in that large multinational companies engaged in private afforestation will be exempt.  That is another case of tax avoidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the last remarks.  There are two exceptions in the Bill, for woodlands and land used mainly or wholly for sport.  Certainly, the argument that because marginal land is exempt it will give some benefit to a particular grouping or other is not acceptable because the reduction in the size of the holding when it is adjusted into adjusted acres will mean that most of the land, certainly in the Senator's constituency, will not fall liable for land tax.  It certainly would not adjust to the minimum taxation requirement in any event.  Outside of those two exceptions &mdash; they are the only two exceptions that I will be dealing with &mdash; all the rest of the land will be considered for adjustment for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be missing the point I am trying to make. The Minister appears to be creating a situation where afforestation will have an unfair advantage over farming in marginal land.  Is this meant to be the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This exemption is an important one to make.  Every day of the week from the Opposition side, and this side of the House we ask for encouragement to be given to people to go into the development of forests, whether small private forests or woodlands.  We all recognise that it would be a major national industry if it could be developed properly.  Anything that gives a definite advantage to that industry must be welcomed by those of us who have an interest in seeing our forests developed by private enterprise or by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1871" /> The Minister, in his first reply confirmed that because of the special importance of forestry to the national economy any assistance possible should be given.  I do not think it would be a good thing to penalise people who want to develop in an area that we feel is good for the economy.  There is a widespread need for timber here.  A processing industry in my constituency is in need of timber and anything the Bill can do to stimulate the production of timber should be welcomed by all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not answer Senator Ellis's point which is an important one, that the section could be subject to abuse.  Tax could be avoided by people within the State or by large companies outside the State.  Will a farmer who plants some of his land be exempt from tax?  Could he set some land in forestry on a commercial basis to avoid paying tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister about the massive tracts of land that are undivided, where people hold turbary rights or are involved in commonages.  How does the Minister propose to adjust acres in the case of commonages and turbary owned by farmers? Will they be completely exempted or will they come in under the assessment code?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow up what the previous speaker said in relation to commonages.  I should like the Minister to indicate to the House how it is proposed to assess the value put on commonages or how it is proposed to adjust acreages held in commonage?  Is it proposed to divide the total acreage on an adjusted basis as between the various holders in that commonage?  If so, the Minister should be aware that as far as the larger commonages are concerned many of the people with legal entitlements to them are in fact unknown and the persons who occupy a commonage can be far fewer in number than those who are registered as the owners of the <Col N="1872" /> commonage as such.  I should like the Minister to indicate exactly how it is proposed to deal with commonage shares. The Minister should be aware, as the previous speaker is aware, that in the west this is a very serious problem and one that is causing considerable concern. It is one to which commonage holders would like a response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the position of commonage, this would be a matter for the local authority to decide the apportionment as between the occupiers of the commonage, whether they had an acreage which after adjustment became an adjustment above 20 acres.  In that case it would be up to the local authority to indicate the occupier who would be liable for the farm tax.  On the point of the woodlands I should like to state that it is Government policy to encourage the growth of timber here. One of the ways of encouraging this is to exempt interests in this area from a land tax.  There is a general agreement on this policy across the floor of the House.  I come from a county where there are a large number of State forests.  They are totally exempt and would only create a circular transfer if they were to be adjusted.  In any event, it is our aim to increase the amount of land under commercial timber and some advantage is given to those who decide to enter into that commercial occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with the reply given by the Minister.  Surely it is unrealistic to think that the local authorities have any say in this.  The local authorities are only an organisation for collecting.  They will not be defining the type of land that will come under the Bill. They will have nothing to do with it prior to the land being adjusted.  If it is exempted, the adjustment falls into that category but if turbary rights and commonages are not exempted, what happens when they start adjusting the acres on undivided shares spreading over maybe 15 or 20 miles of the west coastline? It is not realistic for anybody to adjust acres on variable soils where I am <Col N="1873" /> the tenant because I am not responsible for any particular undivided section of that commonage.  If I am not the owner of a certain undivided section of that commonage it cannot be assessed for the purpose of my adjusted acres.</P>
      <P>A farmer with an adjusted foothills acreage could have desirable land on the lowlands, coming very close to the lower bracket of 20 acres, but if he has one-tenth share of maybe 1,700 acres commonage spreading across two counties &mdash; take one area from Lennane, County Galway, to the Sheefry Hills in County Mayo where there is a large overlap of commonages &mdash; how can a local authority decide whether that land should come into the category of being adjusted?  We should exempt commonages and turbary rights because if we leave them in they will never be adjusted.  I know that from practical experience.</P>
      <P>I said on Second Stage that I do not think the Bill will go that far.  Anyone who sat in an office or who worked on the ground could not assess commonages when they are undivided.  How can one say that the part of the commonage which belongs to me is better than land ten miles away?  This is very hard to do where ownership is defined, but where it is not defined, there is no way it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr Durcan Mr Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole made some valid points.  In the west, and in west Mayo in particular, there are many commonages which are held by a considerable number of tenants.  For instance, in Achill there are many mountainsides running into 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000 and ten thousand acres held by over 500 persons.  I am aware of one commonage held by 517 people, and this gives rise to its own problems.  In relation to a commonage of that nature, you will find that at least half the registered owners are deceased, are in America or England or cannot be traced.  In practice, maybe 50,60 or 70 people use portions of the commonage for sheep grazing.  Under those circumstances, how will it be possible to adjust the acreage, or make any particular person assessable for any proportion of tax?  If you are going to assess, <Col N="1874" /> how can you define under those circumstances the difference between owner, on the one hand, and occupier on the other hand?  The problem of the occupier is all the greater where many people trespass on these commonages and where the usage is far from regular.  Senator O'Toole mentioned the Sheefry area which runs between Counties Mayo and Galway, and where there are vast mountainside commonages owned by a considerable number of people with two local authorities dealing with one area.</P>
      <P>My understanding of the Bill is that the question of adjustment is a matter for the commissioner who will be established under this Bill and the question of collection is a matter for the local authorities. What I would like to know is how a farmer with a commonage share is going to be assessed for tax should he come within the scope of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with extreme but nevertheless important cases.  The adjustment will be done by the commissioner and the apportionment as between the occupiers of the commonage will be done by the local authorities in consultation with the commissioner, if necessary.  Let us take the example given by Senator O'Toole of somebody who had some land plus commonage.  If, say, somebody had 25 acres of adjusted land and 100 acres of commonage which adjusted to one-tenth of that size, then he would have 25 adjusted acres plus ten adjusted acres for the commonage which would be aggregated.  That seems to be the way this problem will be resolved.  I am not here to adjust the acreage of commonage.  This is a job for the adjuster, and that is why we require specialists to do it.  The best answer I can give is that the commonage will be adjusted but the apportionment of commonage will be done with the local authorities in consultation with the farm tax commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>That appears to be a very simple answer but I am afraid, in practice, it is not just going to work like that.  In the Minister's constituency and in mine, we have the same problem of <Col N="1875" /> commonage.  There are large stretches of mountainland in commonage even on the east coast, which may surprise many of our western colleagues.  I am not satisfied that the Minister has sorted out this problem, and it will require some sorting out, but I do not know how it is going to be done.  It is even greater than has been outlined by the previous speakers because many of these people who are entitled to commonage do not use them. This means that others are getting greater usage of them.  How the local authorities are going to determine that I have not been able to sort out in my mind.</P>
      <P>Are there any other exemptions for the land tax?  Would land used for educational purposes and land held by local authorities be exempt from the tax?  I know lands held by the local authority in its own area are exempt and local authority buildings are exempt from rates, but are lands held by local authorities in another local authority area exempt from this tax?  This could become quite a problem in County Dublin where large tracts of land are held by another local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat that the only exemptions are sporting land and forestry. Any other land will be adjusted and attract the farm tax.  As the Senator said, there are large tracts of commonage in my area and I can only repeat what I have said before.  We are dealing with the extreme cases and when the commonage is adjusted the commissioner and the local authorities will decide the apportionment as between the occupiers of that particular commonage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have consistently opposed this measure.  It is already clear as we debate section 1 that Senators from different parts of the country are coming up with practical problems which they see difficult of solution.  If we go back to the beginning, the aim of this Bill was to achieve a predetermined yield from the farming community which was aimed at creating greater equity between the different sectors in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> We argued that it will be very difficult to implement this measure.  Perhaps it is a pity that the Government were panicked into introducing the Farm Tax Bill when the income tax system was beginning to find root.  Quite a number of independent economists around the country have argued that if the income tax system were made to work properly and if there were sufficient staff in the Revenue Commissioners' offices, by the time this land tax is implemented &mdash; even supposing that it does create the kind of income which the Minister envisages &mdash; the income tax system would have equal or even greater revenue returns than it. But the fundamental flaw in this Bill is that it does not take account of the ability of the individual to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the difficulties which Senators have already come across in debating it.  Overall, we are going to see a lot of time and effort wasted, which ultimately may not increase the amount of money from the farming community over and above what would accrue under the existing system but will shift the emphasis of payment from the better off farmers to, as I see it, the poorer farmers.</P>

      <P>In answer to the direct question, turbary rights will be considered for adjustment.  But we all know that the value of that very marginal land would adjust to a very low level, just as with commonage.  Dealing with turbary, one would have to know the circumstances of the area of ground we are talking about.  In the vast majority of cases, land of that nature will adjust to such a low level that in nearly all cases it will not reach the limit for taxation purposes.</P>
      <P>In dealing with particular cases like that, we will have to deal with the facts on the ground rather than take something in the whole and say that there is going to be a tax on that land.  We will have to know the acreage which is under occupation by an individual and know whether that will adjust to the 20 adjusted acreage level.  It is a question of facts rather than dealing with it in an abstract form and saying that the particular land will attract a tax.  We will have to know the facts of the area being considered.</P>

      <P>In relation to the commonage question, I do not want to harp on the issue, but I want to refer to something that is of concern to the part of the country I come from.  The section defines the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; in relation to land as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;occupier&rdquo;, in relation to land, an agricultural land holding, or part of such a holding, or a taxable farm, means the person entitled to the immediate use or enjoyment of the land, the holding or the farm, as may be appropriate, whether actually used or enjoyed or not...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing in mind that definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;, am I right in saying, in relation to commonages, that tax will be levied on registered owners, or persons entitled to be registered as owners, as a proportion of the total number of shares in the commonage? In other words, if there are 20 shares in a commonage and if the adjusted acreage of that commonage is, <Col N="1878" /> say, 60 acres, would each of the 20 registered owners be deemed to have three additional adjusted acres?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">

      <P>Getting back to the point I raised earlier with the Minister concerning commercial woodland, does he not feel that it would be much better if there was a limit on the amount of commercial woodland which could be exempted?  We now have large commercial interests from outside the country purchasing large tracts of land here for timber planting. We have no commitment from those outside groups that the timber produced from those lands will be processed in Ireland.  Senator Ferris mentioned that there is a timber industry here which needs the timber.  We know that when it comes to selling that timber those outside interests will sell it on the open market. If they find it to be more beneficial to sell it in England or on the Continent, will we not have allowed them to use our land without making any contribution to the economy, bar what they have paid for having it planted or for having the timber extracted?  A limit of 50 acres would be sufficient to allow private individuals within the State who might wish to plant their own land to be exempt from tax, but over 50 acres should be taxable.</P>

      <P>Dealing with Senator Durcan's query, the example he cited is correct.  I agree that if there are a number of registered owners then they would attract an adjusted acreage such as Senator Durcan suggested.  In regard to Senator Ellis's query, we have said already there are two excepted areas in this Bill, forestry and sporting land, and that remains the case.  In the passage of time, if there is seen to be an obvious need to consider the taxation of particular owners such as forestry owners, this could possibly be an area for income taxation but in the event that it is considered that this should be additional to this measure, that can be looked into in the future.  At present, in order to stimulate the development of our forestry we are exempting those two areas which include forestry, from this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator says &ldquo;all racecourses&rdquo;, and perhaps he knows more about racing than I do, but I assume it is a bit general to say &ldquo;all racecourses&rdquo;. The best known ones that I could cite would be exempt but perhaps there are racecourses which are farmland and may be used for one race a year but for the rest of the time are farmland, and I cannot see why those should be exempt.  From what I know of commercial racecourses, these are exempt from this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>A commercial racecourse is one on which there is one race meeting a year.  It would be planned as that and there is nothing in the Bill which states that it cannot be.  That is why I wonder if there is a further need to have an exact definition of what is wholly or mainly for sport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot go any further than what is in the Bill.  If there is a race meeting once a year and if the land is used as farmland for the other 364 days of the year, then the definition &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; for farm use clearly indicates that this land should be adjusted for farm tax.</P>

If he has a problem like this he is entitled to make his case before the tribunal and have his problem considered. Land that is used wholly or mainly attracts the farm tax; if it is for sport on <Col N="1880" /> one or two days of the year it still attracts the tax and if there is a problem as regards the amount to be paid or loss to the farmer, then it has to be considered by the tribunal as to the liability which it attracts.</P>

      <P>This is becoming an amazing debate.  It seems that Senator Ellis is concerned that somebody will hold land, that a race will be held in it every New Year's Day and then he asks if he will be compensated.  If you look at the PAYE sector you will find a benefit in kind &mdash; for instance, company cars.  If you tried to make a case that because one brought kids from the local school once a year on an outing that the benefit in kind should be adjusted subsequently, you would not get within an ass's roar of a hearing from anybody.  We are getting to the stage where it seems that the speakers for Fianna Fáil do not accept that farmers in 1983 contributed 1.9 per cent of total tax to the State.</P>

      <P>Section 1(1)(b) states:</P>
      <P>Where a person is in possession of land or such a holding or farm as a personal representative of a deceased occupier... shall be deemed, for the purposes of the Act, to be entitled to the immediate use or enjoyment of the land, holding or farm:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If somebody is the executor of the will of a deceased farmer and occupier of land and on that person's death the executor finds he has to take over for the purposes of good estate management the running of the farm of the deceased owner, should it be that prior to that happening neither the executor in his own personal capacity nor the deceased registered owner came within the ambit of the Act but the combined total of their holdings would bring them within the ambit of the Act then it seems that this section makes farm tax payable.  It would appear that is totally unfair, if I am right in my supposition. The land which the executor or personal representative would hold he would simply be holding that in a trustee capacity.  He would not be holding for his own benefit.  He would be carrying out the wishes of a deceased owner.  Yet, by virtue of that and the fact that he is doing something for somebody who is deceased and which will not lead to any benefit to himself, nevertheless that will have the effect of bringing both himself and the land of the deceased owner within the tax net.  I would like to know if I am right in <Col N="1882" /> my reading of the subsection because it would seem to clearly specify that in so far as it says that he shall be entitled to the immediate use or enjoyment of the land, he shall be do deemed....</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so I think this requires an immediate amendment to this Bill.  It is completely against any principle of justice that in the case of somebody who is in occupation of land without the possibility of any personal benefit accruing to them that that should give rise to a tax situation.  It would certainly be understandable if the person was in occupation for his own benefit.  Here is somebody in a trustee capacity and by virtue of being in that capacity he is now being taxed.  If that is correct, I ask that this subsection be looked at between now and Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the section differently. I understand that this applies to a farm in which the owner is deceased and we have somebody acting as a personal representative or an executor.  While he is holding that position, either in disposing of the land or otherwise, of course this land, if it comes within the adjusted acres, is subject to this tax.  That tax becomes a charge on the estate and will have to be paid for by the estate, but it does not penalise the person because he may own less than the adjusted acres in a personal capacity.  While he is in possesion of this land in a legal capacity, he will be penalised for that.  I understand that this section refers to the piece of land for which he has legal responsibility and if it is within the adjusted acres he will have to pay the tax on the disposal of the property and that the charge will remain on it.  It does not have anything to do with the person himself as a person; it is only in respect of the land that he holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be so if the <Col N="1883" /> definition of agricultural land holding which is contained in page 1 of the Bill was not there.  Agricultural land holding is defined as the aggregate of the land in the occupation of the same person or persons.  Let us take the case of land held by somebody in his personal capacity for which he may not be liable for tax and where that man suddenly becomes a personal representative in respect of a farm of land held by a deceased person who in his own right was not liable for tax.  Once he becomes executor on the death of a person, then a tax liability can arise as between the two holdings of land.  That is the only explanation if one accepts the definition of agricultural land holding. That penalises unfairly somebody who is not benefiting from the second farm of land; he is only there as a personal representative. It is unfair; it is a movement in Irish law which I do not like and is certainly a movement in Irish society which would encourage people to desist from acting as personal representatives. There is a policy elsewhere where insurance companies and corporate bodies act in that capacity and that can be very costly.  The practice has been for individuals to do this job, but certainly if this section is to be construed in the way I feel it can be construed it is going to lead to many more problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will find that under section 3 the apportionment of land will take care of the problem about which he is concerned.  Obviously, if a person is a trustee, caretaker or agent of the land, then the income from the land which he possesses as a trustee, caretaker or agent will be liable for farm tax. If he is deriving benefit from the land as well as from the land which he personally owns then he will be liable for tax but under section 3 it will be possible to determine the apportionment as between his personal possession and that which he has in his possession as an agent, caretaker or trustee.</P>

Is this going to be aggregated and involve him in the payment of land tax on the possession of a holding in a temporary capacity which he is really not going to benefit from? The Minister was not clear about this. We need further explanation on the paragraph or we will have further difficulties.</P>

      <P>My understanding of this Bill is that it applies to bona fides farmers but there does not seem to be any definition to cover the title, &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; in section 1.  This might be necessary in a number of areas.  If, for instance, a farmer had an outside, part-time occupation or if he had an income outside farming, what would be the position? Another example is that if somebody in a different profession who wished to become a farmer because of some attractions this Bill might offer, for example, would not have to show accounts or bank statements to the Revenue Commissioners, bought a farm of land and ceased his other activities, would he then become a farmer immediately and would he be included as a farmer for the purpose of this Bill?  Throughout the Bill I do not see any reference to farmers as such.  The reference is to owners and occupiers of land.</P>

I would simply ask the Minister to look at this again between now and Report Stage and perhaps if section 3 overcomes the difficulty, somebody might explain it to me in greater detail.  I should like also to refer to the other aspect of subsection (1) (b) on page four and says that where a person is in adverse possession of land or such a holding or farm he should be deemed for the purpose of the Act to be entitled to the immediate use and enjoyment of the land, holding or farm.

That is where this will be decided.  I cannot put it into the Bill as this stage.  Cases such as these can be determined by individuals who have the knowledge or the expertise or who are in a position to make that decision but not, I am glad to say, the Minister.</P>

There is a triple opportunity for farmers to have their difficulties considered &mdash; the farm tax commissioner, the tribunal and ultimately the courts.  If land is capable of agricultural use then it will be adjusted for farm tax purposes.  The use the owner makes of that land is his own decision but the land will be considered and adjusted. Regardless of whether an individual wishes to do nothing with land or uses it for some particular purpose, so long as it is capable of being used as agricultural land and adjusted in agricultural acreage as set out in the Bill, it will attract the tax.</P>

      <P>To deal again with Senator Ellis's point, I would have to say that I have given an explanation.  If there is a problem about whether the land is used exclusively for sporting activities and if there is some doubt about its definition, the appeals system is there to decide the issue.  There are two exemptions and one is in respect of land used for sporting activities.  Golf courses, as such, are used for sporting activities and therefor are exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's final statement proves my point about lands used for sporting activity.  Therefore, an individual who may lay an all-weather track on his land is using that land for sporting purposes.  Also an individual who may set up a show jumping arena for use on his land is also using his land for sporting purposes.  Those lands have been so adapted for sporting purposes which means that those lands are automatically exempted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say anything different from what I have already said about this.  If somebody makes a decision to use their land in a particular way thinking that have changed the purpose for which the land was used previously &mdash; such as for agricultural purposes &mdash; then they have the facility to appeal.  It is a question of fact, and where there is disagreement about that fact then there is provision for recourse to the appeals system.</P>

If somebody decides to put up a few fences over which to jump horses, leaving them there for the remainder of the year until they require the land, they had better appeal to the tribunal to ascertain whether that constitutes sporting land.  As far as I am concerned it is a question of establishing fact in each individual case where there are grounds for appeal.  I repeat that that provision is in the Bill for anybody who feels they have converted agricultural land into sporting land.  That matter will be decided by the appeals tribunal.  If that decision does not please an appellant they can have recourse to the courts to decide the issue.</P>

Football pitches would be similarly classified.  We all played on pitches that farmers gave us.  One could not possibly get a definition here.  It would have to go back to the local scene to somebody who would know the set-up and would appeal it.  We could be here all day discussing this.  We could continue to give examples, such as a donkey derby on one Sunday and something else on another. <Col N="1889" /> This would be impossible to define.

That is a question of fact and under the provisions of the Bill we have set up the machinery which can determine that fact. I do not think the Senator will find any legislation which will state a question of fact in such a manner.  In order to overcome difficulties that may arise we have provided for an adequate appeals system. I hope the Senator will agree that it should be used to determine questions he posed here today and which I believe to be very exceptional as far as where this debate is concerned.

If the husband and wife are regarded as jointly liable for the tax and they have gone through the whole appeal system at three levels, and at the end of that system they are still considered to be jointly liable, they must pay tax.  If the wife has no income or is deriving no benefit, even at that stage she can go to her local county manager under a different section of the Bill and make her case and see if she will receive more sympathetic treatment at that level.  Perhaps he would know her circumstances <Col N="1893" /> better than the various levels of the tribunals. Senator Ellis has shown little faith in our appeals systems by suggesting that the justice or merit of the case would not become evident, having gone through three levels of appeals.  This is a Farm Tax Bill with a very comprehensive appeals system.  There is a possibility that a very exceptional case might not be considered sympathetically enough but that could arise under any legislation.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister be more specific about the two questions I asked?  We have been told that one of the great benefits of this Bill is that farmers do not have to submit accounts, but if a farmer has an income outside farming will he have to submit accounts, and his bank statements in the ordinary way? To become a lawyer, a doctor or some professional like that, one does a specific course qualifies by doing an exam.  I am not advocating that that should apply to farmers; but if somebody in one of those professions simply buys an area of land, say, 50 acres of land, and ceases his other activities does he automatically become a farmer for the purposes of this Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not indicate whether the person in the occupation of the 20 adjusted acres to 80 adjusted acres is a farmer.  It simply deals with the tax that attracts to the occupation of land adjusted between those two limits and therefore that person pay tax.  If a person has less than 20 adjusted acres and has an occupation as well, then that is a situation for the income tax code and the Income <Col N="1894" /> Tax Acts and it has nothing to do with this measure.</P>

He is proceeding all the time as if there were no mechanisms in this Bill where a person who feels aggrieved can have redress.  The Senator knows that that is not the case.  Proceeding along that line is to a large extent a pointless exercise because there are sufficient safeguards in this Bill to take care of much of the concern that he has voiced, including the person who allows his field to be used for a day by the local football club, and he has still refused to accept not just the lack of faith in the courts but the fact that other mechanisms are there also to ensure that justice is done to all concerned, to the State and to the citizen.</P>

      <P>The answer to the second part of the question is yes.  Should there be some change in the circumstances and the local authorities consider that it is necessary to review the situation then they can require the adjusters to come back and take a look at it.

    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This will require much definition from the Minister because it will militate against any farmer who has been trying to upgrade the standard of his land over the past number of years, whether under the western package, the western drainage programme or the reclamation programme throughout the whole State.  Where a farmer improves the productivity of his land and brings it up to a very high standard, his acreage will be penally adjusted as against the man who has done nothing with his land. So it will militate against the farmer who has been trying to improve the fertility of his land.  That is the main objection I have to the Bill.  It will discourage farmers in the future.</P>
      <P>I know of large tracts of land to be reclaimed throughout the whole of the west and large tracts of land that have been improved.  The Minister's reply to Senator Kiely's question seems to indicate that an adjusted acreage will stand for all time, regardless of whether the land improves or disimproves over a period.  I know land in the west where there is very poor fertility and a very poor filtration base which can deteriorate over a period of five years and revert to its condition prior to reclamation.  The base is such that it can drop back inside five years to what it was prior to reclamation if it has not adequate and full retention all through.  This is the section that will militate against the farmer who is trying to benefit himself and the State and he is going to be penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guideline acre is the best acre of land in the State.  Is the Minister talking about a tillage acre?  I asked this on Second Stage.  There is a big variation <Col N="1897" /> and it has to be spelled out.  We want to know what type of an acre the Minister is talking about when he refers to the best acre of land.  Is he talking about the Meath acre, the Wexford acre, the Kildare acre, or the Tipperary acre?  Anybody who examines the exercise carried out by An Foras Talúntais in regard to soils throughout this State will see that there is a big variation of soils, each able to produce a particular commodity.  One may be suitable for grass, another for cereals or root crops, while another may be suitable for grazing.  This question must be answered by somebody here.  I know what the Minister is going to say: it will be left with the Land Commission and the experts.  He must be more specific on this occasion and tell us what acre of land will constitute the best acre of land within the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole hit one of the points.  I would like to deal with it a little more.  It concerns the tillage acre. A tillage acre is a most peculiar type of acre.  It is an acre in which the soil has to have depth, quality and a very strong growth potential.  Any lay person travelling along the road can see by just looking over the wall the difference between what is a good acre and what is not a good tillage acre.  At the time when growth is at its fullest, one can see light land, that is land with a very light soil where the colour of the crop is quite different from that of the crop in a very good tillage acre.  One will have to be very wary when administering this section.  It is not good enough to say as stated in the Bill:</P>
      <P>...subject to subsection (2) of this section, &ldquo;adjusted acre&rdquo; means any area of agricultural land (whether equal to or greater than one acre) the estimated capacity of which for agricultural production is equivalent to the capacity for such production of one acre of land capable of the estimated highest said production in the State and &ldquo;adjusted acreage,&rdquo; in relation to an agricultural land holding....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not as simple as it sounds.  There are acres of land which can produce milk but <Col N="1898" /> not tillage.  There are acres of land which can produce tillage but not milk.  There are acres of land which produce fat sheep but which cannot fatten cattle and there are acres which can do quite the opposite. There are mountain acres which, depending on which side the sun rises, can produce grass in abundance and there are others which cannot.  It will be very difficult.</P>
    <P>We have two examples of adjusted acres.  The EC headage payment scheme, for example, was based on a synopsis sent by the Department of Agriculture.  I know it is outside the realm of the Minister for the Environment but it must have been the most obnoxious application made in the history of the State as far as the west is concerned.  Land which was incapable of rearing one-third of the stock was not put into the designated area and land which was arable was included. Large farms were put into it and small farms were not.  Rocky terrain was left out and land which was less rocky was included.  It all seems to have stemmed from the Department of Agriculture in maps supplied to the EC.  If something like that happened in this case the law would be used to a most extraordinary degree to try to get fair play into the definition of an adjusted acre.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission had a programme for the division of adjusted acres.  May I ask the Minister if that programme will now be taken into account in regard to the adjusted acre?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with Senator Kiely's question about the investment in land.  The Bill assumes that land will be subject to reasonable management and investment.  Therefore, if a farmer through his own efforts improves his land and spends money on his acreage, he will not be adjusted upwards.  If, however, he lets it deteriorate, it does not mean he will be adjusted downwards. If because of a freak accident or hazard of nature the character of the land changes, it is open to him to look for a readjustment.  An intensive investment programme on land which improves its output will not necessarily be taken into <Col N="1899" /> account, as clearly set out in section 2 regarding changing the nature of the land and the attraction of a higher adjustment. If, however, the Office of Public Works carries out drainage to land and improves it, then circumstances could warrant an adjustment in that acreage.  Also, if the sale of land requires changes in the adjusted acreage which makes the settlement larger and if it was not adjusted before &mdash; in other words, if it was below 20 adjusted acres and somebody buys a certain amount of land which brings them above that and that land originally had not been adjusted then the whole acreage would require adjustment.</P>
      <P>To deal with Senator Killilea's questions, section 2 sets out as concisely as possible those parameters which will be taken into account by the adjusters. Many of the problems which he mentioned are also taken into account in section 2.</P>
      <P>The Bill states that one of the factors to be taken into account is the range of uses to which land can be put.  If land is only suitable for one particular use obviously it cannot be adjusted to the same level as land which is capable of several uses.  We will not be involved in adjusting land in this House today or in the future.  The adjustment of land has been given over to professional people who are being asked to take on this responsibility.  We have set out in the Bill those factors which have to be considered when the adjusters are in the process of visiting land and must take into account the various parameters and items listed in section 2 (2) of the Bill.  In that way they will produce their evaluation of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will accept that no matter what parameters and conditions are laid down to adjust acreage it will come down to a matter of opinion in the end.  We do not have any specific basis on which to adjust acres. The Germans many years ago adjusted their land but it was based on a very scientific soil survey.  The position with regard to the national soil survey is that <Col N="1900" /> the second edition has been launched but we are a long way from getting to the stage where we have any survey nearing completion which would assist the specialists whom the Minister is going to appoint in adjusting land.  Therefore, it will be a matter of arbitary opinion.  Arising from that there will be a massive load of appeals and vast amounts of money will be shovelled into the pockets of legal consultants representing people challenging the opinion of the specialist.</P>
      <P>I want to put forward a few examples. In section 2 (1) the Minister refers to the range of uses to which the land can be put for the purposes of agricultural production. It is possible to have land either in one county or in different areas which is equal and an adjuster must be satisfied that these two areas are equal on the basis of the range of use to which the land could be put.  If land can be used for tillage, grass production or any other purpose you can have two technically excellent farming producers, but because of quotas one can never hope to achieve the same income as the other since he cannot have access to the same enterprise.</P>
      <P>I should like to give one example with regard to the quota on milk production. In the case of two people with land, the range and the use of which is similar, one may not have access to the kind of farm production that the other has, though he is very efficient, and he is not in a position to achieve the same income.  We have consistently argued against the Bill on the grounds of equity.  The Minister will come up against that problem on the ground, but there is nothing in the Bill to deal with that problem.  The Minister should signal some road forward for farmers who will not be in a position to get involved in the farming enterprises from which the best income can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one comment on Senator Killilea's remarks about the acreage that was submitted with the disadvantaged areas.  I could not agree with him more.  Great anomalies arose out of that decision on eligibility. Unfortunately, we have no system of appeal to it except, possibly, within the European Parliament.  Section 2, apart <Col N="1901" /> from the level of tax that was to be charged per acre, was the one that created the greatest amount of interest and, indeed, concern among the farming community because they did not know what norm would be used by the adjusters.  Certainly, the Land Commission in the past used the term &ldquo;adjusted acre&rdquo; which technically was a division of the whole acreage by aproximately one-third. Throughout the country it may have been used in that way; but, whatever the fraction that was used by them in adjusting, generally speaking it was acceptable to most people in the agricultural community. They understood what a Land Commission adjusted acre was and accepted it.  It was a fact of life.</P>

    <P>On this section as I understand it from talking to people in the agricultural industry, they were as concerned as I was about using the term, adjusted acre, because it could create doubt in the minds of some people about what an acre was. The various categories have been laid down by the Minister as a guideline.  On average, if all these things are taken account of &mdash; it is specified in the Bill that regard shall be had to a range of matters including access to land, the nature and quality of the soil, the location and climate of the place, whether the land is sloping or flat &mdash; we can be satisfied that what is considered to be an acre in this terminology will be an acre that is capable of producing the highest possible agricultural production.  If we accept that as a principle then it will probably apply but it has caused worry to people in regard to how it will apply.  They are worried about public officials visiting the farm and making decisions.  Somebody has to make a decision and other sections give a person the right to appeal.  We could not be fairer in trying to come down with some reason on the side of fair play.  If that is done, and the acres are adjusted properly, there will be a widespread acceptance of this form of taxation, which will not be a penalty for increasing production or a disincentive to production. It could be an easy way for farmers to comply with the tax regulation.  They would make a contribution to the local <Col N="1902" /> authority and would not have to pay somebody else to prove their case.  On Second Stage I said that the vast majority of farmers I spoke to were in favour of this system of taxation.  Provided the adjusted acre is seen to be fair, I think this system will be accepted; but if the adjusted acreage is used as a blunt instrument, then there will be widespread abuse of it and the whole appeal system will be clogged up.  I note, however, that under another section pending an appeal the farmer will still be liable to pay the tax as determined by the officer or the farm tax commissioner.  That will be a disincentive to appeal except if there are good grounds for it.</P>

      <P>Everybody will agree with what Senator Ferris said with the exception of one point, it is all full of &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;.  All the &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; are based on the system of an adjusted acre being operated fairly.  I asked the Minister if the Land Commission assessment of an adjusted acre will be taken into account in the new assessment of acreage.  The answer I got from the Minister was quite clearly that experts would be appointed to deal with the valuations and the adjusted acreage. I must accept, therefore, that the Land Commission assessment to date will have a bearing on the matter and will have a part to play in the assessment.  It is my opinion, and the view of a lot of the small farmers, that the most unfair system of the adjustment of acres in the history of the State is being introduced.  That is an indication of the unfairness of the adjusted acreage system and what was done to farmers in the division of three estates in Galway &mdash; the Gordon estate at Milltown, the O'Brien estate at Barnaderg and the Coen estate outside Athenry.  If anybody with a conscience tells me that the Land Commission decision on adjusting acres for those who were in for sub-division of those estates was fair then the sense of fairness is beyond my comprehension.  The tragedy is that most of the experts the Minister will appoint are the former experts in the Land Commission.  That frightens me quite a lot because I experienced their <Col N="1903" /> sense of fairness before and to me it was not fair.</P>
      <P>Whether the land tax should be put down or not is another question.  All of us can have our political opinions on that. Some of us may say it is unfair and some of us they say it is fair but the experts must be fair.  They should not be the type of experts the Land Commission put on the ground in the west over the last 15 years.  I am sure Senator Ferris is surprised to hear me saying that.  I have named the estates in question in public. It is sad to think that the people who were supposed to be the experts in the past will now be the new experts.  The Government will have an enormous number of appeals to deal with.  If one says to the farmers that they must pay this tax under the Bill whether he or she agrees with it or not, I can assure the Minister, the Government, and the Seanad, that if a farmer feels his acreage was unjustly adjusted he will have no more notion of paying one shilling to the State or to the county council than a man from France, because he knows in his heart and soul that if he yields on the first occasion in the hope of compromise, honesty and integrity, he will be washing the clay from beneath his feet &mdash; he will be sweeping away the ground from beneath him.  If a farmer is threatened with a year in jail, he will go to jail, because his first stand will be the essential one.  There is no point in day-dreaming or believing that because a man feels that his land adjustment was unjust that he has to pay and that he will be compensated later. That will not wear with any section of the community, much less the farming community.  I say that openly.</P>

      <P>As regards section 2, the paragraphs in roman numerals are fine.  I know the Minister probably intends to lay the basis for it here but I want him to make a commitment that the Land Commission assessment of adjusted acres cannot and will not be taken into account, because if it is it will start trouble here this very day.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given two instances where we have seen the Department at work: first, the headage payments in the disadvantaged areas is an absolute calamity.  It was the greatest error ever made.  Second, the Land Commission subdivision of land for smaller farmers on the basis of their adjusted acres has not worked out fairly and there are numerous instances of that. I ask the Minister to give a commitment today that what is in the files, documents, maps, etc. of the Land Commission, will not be taken into account in the adjustment of acres.  That is the first priority. The second is in regard to experts.  There are many experts &mdash; and not all of them come from the universities and most certainly they do not come from the Land Commission &mdash; who know and understand land.  ACOT have plenty of them and An Foras Talúntais have fine people who understand the make-up and the fibre of land.  I do not think the main thrust of this assessment should be given to former senior civil servants of the Land Commission because, in frankness, it has not worked in the past.  There have been an enormous number of unjust decisions made by the Land Commission in the past and talking about them now is no <Col N="1905" /> good, but when preparing for the future we can gain experience from it.  If the Minister gives a commitment today that the Land Commission assessment of an adjusted acre will not be taken into account as and from now, he will help to resolve the problem and start off on a proper footing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by Senator Killilea that officials of the Land Commission would be allowed in an uninhibited and unrestrained way to adjust acres.  I share the point of view he expressed about their activities in the past when considering the adjustment of acreages when it came to dividing estates.  We can all cite cases where this has been done in a way that is not understandable to God or man.  The Land Commission have their own ways, which have not won the confidence of the people.</P>
      <P>I have some confidence in the Bill before us because it appears, for the first time, that a statutory obligation is being placed on the adjuster to have regard to certain matters when adjusting.  In this regard I follow through the point made by Senator Ferris in relation to appeals. When land is adjusted for the purpose of this legislation, if it is enacted, then the occupier of that land should be made aware precisely of the basis upon which the adjustment is being carried out.  If, at the end of the day somebody ends up with a simple statement of facts as to the adjustment, then a total disservice has been done.  In my view, that person is entitled to get a very clear statement indicating precisely the basis upon which the adjustment was carried out.  I say that bearing in mind the appeal procedure that is available.  If the basis of the adjustment is clearly spelt out, then there will be fewer appeals and where there are appeals they will be dealt with in a more streamlined and speedier way.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether this is a matter for regulation or otherwise, but I would like to be sure that when an acre is adjusted the precise basis of the adjustment, having regard to section 2 (2), will be spelt out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1906" /> The Minister said that we are not in the business of adjusting acres and, of course, we are not, but we are in the business of laying down the guidelines for adjusting acres.  The point I am making is that in so far as regard is had to those guidelines, the occupiers should be made aware of the precise points upon which his land has been adjusted.  The point has also been made by other speakers that we cannot be precise, but I think subsection (2) brings in a certain element of precision.  Let us draw a comparison with the PLV system on business properties. I am not aware if there is any statutory matter to which officers of the Valuation Office must have regard.  They have complete freedom in determining what the valuation of a particular premises is.  So far as that is so, I welcome subsection (2) which at least puts down in statutory form certain matters that the adjusters in estimating must have regard to.  The system cannot be precise.  Senator Killilea said it is full of &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;.  The whole tax system and certainly the non-PAYE tax system is full of ifs.  It is imprecise in many ways and that is why it is subject to so much critical comment.  It is difficult to eliminate the &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; from the tax system but subsection (2) introduces a certain element of certainty.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (v) refers to &ldquo;the structure of the agricultural land holding of which the land forms part,&rdquo;.  That I presume, means holdings which are fragmented and which are difficult to manage.  My understanding is that there would be a once-off assessment, and that there would be no reassessment.  I would like to know what happens in areas where a restructuring has taken place and where fragmentation has been eliminated. There are many areas where fragmentation is a major problem.  In certain parts of the country one of the successes of the Land Commission &mdash; and certainly one of the successes of Deputy Connaughton, Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture &mdash; was to try to eliminate fragmentation.  I am glad to see his policy is succeeding in certain areas.  So far as fragmentation is eliminated and holdings are consolidated, what happens where an <Col N="1907" /> assessment has been carried out before the consolidation took place?  If this question is not addressed we will be facing a situation which could give rise to a constitutional challenge to this legislation. It was that kind of situation which was the basis of the challenge of the PLV system.  This is something on which I would like to hear the Minister's comments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see, this is the most contentious section of the Bill. It is a pity the Government could not wait until the national soil survey had been carried out by An Foras Talúntais because then they would have some scientific basis on which to go to adjust the acres.  Naturally not alone is there concern among Senators, but concern is being expressed by farmers because once their acreage is adjusted as I see it, that is going to stick.  It is one thing talking about the Land Commission adjusted acres, but those acres were adjusted for a purpose.  The farmer either succeeded in getting additional land or he did not, but this is a different adjustment entirely. Now, when the acreage is adjusted, if the farmer has 20 or more of those adjusted acres, he will have to pay tax for the rest of his life.  That is the fact of the matter. If he is not in a position to pay that tax, it will be levied on the land anyway according to this Bill, and his successors will eventually have to pay it.  That is very wrong, too, but this is what the Bill says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, farmers are naturally very concerned that this adjustment would be carried out properly.  It will be very difficult to do it properly because there are so many different problems in different parts of the country.  You have the fertile soils of the midlands and the south; you have the drumlin soils in Leitrim; you have the boggy, mountainy areas in the west; you have the fragmented holdings &mdash; and they are a particular problem in the west.  You also have large tracts of land in the west held in common.  The progress that I would like to see has not been made in dividing those commonages.  Senator Durcan <Col N="1908" /> referred to a land policy coming to grips with the problem.  I know of no land policy at present in the west that is helping in any way either to eliminate fragmentation or to divide the commonages that are so prevalent in Galway and Mayo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have particular experience of Mayo because I was partly responsible for initiating that programme there.  A certain amount of progress was made during 1977, 1978 and 1979, but progress since then has been very, very slow.  The same applies to Galway.  There is no policy in existence in regard to the division of those commonages.  It is a pity, instead of winding up the Land Commission as had been done, that the resources of the Land Commission were not applied to that problem to get it out of the way.  I know from my own experience that there are many dozens of files in the Land Commission office in Galway awaiting for personnel to do the job that is to be done.  That is one of the problems I see in the west in regard to adjusting the acreage.</P>
      <P>There is a variation in the quality of soil, from one farm to another, even from one field to another.  Unless every single acre is inspected and analysed, soil surveys taken and so on, then there is no way that we can accept that this system will be fair to everybody.  It is a major problem and, as I said, once land is adjusted that is it.  The farmers may appeal &mdash; I am sure many of them will &mdash; but it will take a long time and the process will be very slow I can envisage the whole system being choked up in a very short time with very small cash return for the Government.  The whole purpose of this legislation should be to try to find an equitable system of tax, to try to bring more money into the Government's coffers. I do not think it will succeed in achieving that because this appeal system will choke up, farmers will be dissatisfied and, certainly, they will avail of the appeals system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> In the west of Ireland, also, a very large percentage of farmers are 55 years of age and over.  Many are unmarried and, certainly, I cannot see those farmers developing and improving that land if, at the end of the day, they are to be penalised by having to pay tax on it.  Will any consideration be given to situations like this?  We have heard a great deal about taking over land from elderly farmers and passing it on to the younger generation of more progressive farmers.  But land will not be put to its full productive use simply because of the system of tax we are now imposing.  There is no way that those farmers who have reached the age of 55 or 60, and who in many cases have no dependants will speculate money at this stage to develop that land and by doing so have themselves penalised by this tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediately after Senator Killilea had spoken, I wanted to put the record straight.  Unfortunately, the Senator went into an attack on the staff of the Land Commission.  It has always been an accepted principle in this House that one should not condemn members of staff, particularly as they are not here to answer for themselves.  Most of us have had dealings with the staff of the Land Commission, whether it was at Agriculture House or down in the country.  I, for one, can compliment them highly on the way in which they have always dealt with any queries or problems I had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, they were subjected to political influences at times, but I have never had any experience of them succumbing to that influence.  It is unfair to pick out one section of people who have been involved in adjusting acres and say that they were unfair or did it wrongly, or otherwise, in various parts of the country. The reality is that they are agents of the State, civil servants employed by the Government, carrying out policies laid down by the Government.  The staff of the Land Commission always acted in accordance with the policies laid down by the Government of the day, whether Senator Killilea's Government, or any Coalition Government, or any other <Col N="1910" /> form of authority.  They acted in accordance with the policy laid down by the Government and, if the performance of that policy on the ground did not suit a particular area, that was unfortunate. That is how it went and anybody who has had experience in the Department of Agriculture knows that.  They depend on a guideline and a policy laid down by the Government.</P>
    <P>In this section we are trying to lay down guidelines and I have the utmost confidence in whoever will be chosen to implement them.  I am glad some experts from the Land Commission will be involved in this, because there is a tremendous wealth of experience there.  With the guidelines laid down here I can think of nobody better able to carry out an adjustment on the ground.  I also hope that the Government, in their wisdom in abolishing the Land Commission, will consider some form of land agency which will be vitally necessary to the orderly development of holdings, that there will be expertise available in that agency and that they will have some statutory rights, also.  I have always advocated that within my party and will continue to do so.  I am putting it on the record of the House here today, since the staff of the Land Commission were subject to criticism. I am sorry Senator Killilea is not here because I would like to have argued this further with him.  I contend that officials act in accordance with policy laid down and we should not criticise them.  We should criticise the policy makers, possibly.</P>
    <P>We are now legislating and making policy today.  Let us make it as fair as possible so that the people who get the job of trying to administer this on the ground will have something concise thing to work on.  We must endeavour to ensure that as far as possible the various categories and classifications of land will be set down in legislation while still allowing a certain element of interpretation.  We will, of course, have an appeal system, anyway.  Nothing could be fairer.  There is no question of penalising people for having improved their land or penalising them for increasing their production.  It <Col N="1911" /> is a system of trying to ensure that this sector pay a contribution to the running of the State in line with their capabilities to do so.  That is built into this legislation.</P>

      <P>It was unfair of the Senator to refer to Senator Killikee's comments when he is not here.  Senator Killilee is entitled to make comments.  He was speaking about the criteria used by the Land Commission in their assessment that we used heretofore and I do not think he was referring to anything else.  I would agree wholeheartedly with him. The Minister said 200 people will be employed, 100 from the Land Commission and 100 now under recruitment. What type of people has he now recruited or is in the process of recruiting? What were the guidelines and criteria laid down for that type of person? Had he to be an agricultural adviser or to have a degree in agriculture?  What type of person will be used to assist the Land Commission in the assessment of the adjusted acre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see in the Bill any reference to islands off the west coast, unless they are covered under section 7.  Reference is made to inadequacy of means of access to the land, location and climate and the nature of the soil but the Minister does not say he is specifically talking about islands when he is talking about access.  I am sure the Minister knows that we have <Col N="1912" /> 365 arable islands in Clew Bay alone &mdash; one for every day of the year &mdash; and there are islands off the west coast of Galway and Donegal.  I know the dangers involved in getting stock to and from these islands.  Will those island acres be adjusted in the same way as on the mainland? That is a problem.  What type of adjustment will take place or what criteria will be used for islands off the west coast?  That is very important.  There is a number of fragmented holdings in Clare Island, Inishturk and on Aran.  It is important that we know.  Section 2 (2) (c) (i) states:</P>
    <P>if investment in the land is at a level that is higher than a reasonable level for land generally or falls short of such a level, any capacity of the land for agricultural production, or any lack of such capacity in the land, that is attributable to the part of such investment that is higher than such reasonable level as aforesaid, or, as the case may be, to the short fall shall be disregarded.</P>
    <P>He lists down the application of fertilisers or other substances for improving the land for agricultural use and the level of general reclamation of the land.  Do I take it that where there is a clearance of stones, trees, weeds, gorse and other unwanted vegetation from the land and other listed items here that will be taken into consideration?  Alternatively, will this investment eliminate the people categorised here and as spelled out in the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 deals with the adjusted acre.  The adjusted acre means any area of agricultural land whether equal to or greater than one acre.  I should like to ask the Minister if he can give the House an indication of the scope the proposed adjusting officer will have in their adjustment of the acreage? This is a question in which every farmer will be interested.  In the midlands, an area that I know best, with regard to reclaimed peatland and the cut-over bogs, Bord na Móna and An Foras Talúntais have proved that they can get <Col N="1913" /> a record return in pounds of beef per acre per year on their place in Clonsast.  The land is pure cut-over bog.  The cattle or the bulls they have there are on slats from the end of September or October until May or June.  I do not know what way they are using the land, perhaps they have zero grazing.  Here the land is not equal, it is not a mineral soil, and the ordinary farmer would not have the finance to follow that kind of farm husbandry. First, there is the expensive cost of the slatted unit and, secondly, the cost of the expensive machinery necessary to operate zero grazing.</P>
      <P>If we take the Barrow valley or the Nore valley which is subject to constant flooding, or indeed the Shannon valley which covers a great part of the country, one will argue that land is submerged and flooded in many townlands for five to seven months of every year.  What kind of criteria will the adjusters have and how are they to take this into account?  It is very important that it should be taken into account.  Up to 1977 before rates were abolished there was a very genuine complaint and grievance among farmers in those flooded areas that they did not have the use of their farms for almost half of each year and yet the rate was demanded and collected on those lands which were subject to the valuation of Griffith from the middle of the last century. I hope that the adjusting officers will take all those things into account, as well as the item enumerated in subsection (2) (a).</P>
      <P>What kind of criteria will the adjusting officers have at their disposal?  Will they have regard to the poor law valuation as applied by Griffith, or will they have regard to the national soil survey as carried out recently by An Foras Taluntais, which I think is very comprehensive?  The people operating that national soil survey in the counties that are completed visited not only every farm but every field.  Will they have at their disposal the records of where land reclamation was carried out with the assistance of grants from the Department of Agriculture?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that <Col N="1914" /> arterial drainage and other major drainage will be taken into consideration in the future upward adjustment of this acreage.  I am sure he realises where drainage is carried out all the land does not benefit uniformally.  It depends to a large extent on the capillary capacity of the soil where gravity drainage is concerned and even the application of this consideration will involve great difficulty.</P>
      <P>This section has been described by many people as being unconstitutional. The Minister has stated that professional people will carry out the adjustment, but the reason many people believe it is unconstitutional is that it is not a tangible thing.  It is a theoretical measurement and really nebulous.  Senator Smith said there should be a scientific basis involved but there must be something based on scientific data.  Will these criteria be available to the people who own the land?  In other words, if a number of groups of professional people were to value or adjust the land independently would they arrive at the same conclusion?  There could be many uses of land but maybe the crops in one area would be far inferior or less beneficial to the landowner than the crops in other areas.  The land of County Meath must be among the most fertile in the country and yet it is known as heavy land. If there is heavy rain during a night the land is unusable for a number of days afterwards unlike areas in the south where after a heavy downfall the land can be worked the following day.  This is not possible in County Meath.  Indeed, over the winter months the land, for this reason, cannot be put to its full use. Within the terms of this section the only factor that would apply in this area would be the nature and quality of the soil, and this would be a consideration, but I am not satisfied that that would be the only factor in coming to that conclusion.  It seems that for this adjusted acreage, taking the very fertile land of Meath, it could not measure up to other areas where there is better drainage.  Overall, taking everything into consideration, the section must be unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>Regarding paragraph (b) of subsection (2), what is a reasonable level of investment for land generally? That is the question that adjusters and farmers and occupiers of land will be faced with.  Are we talking about the norm for that particular area, bearing in mind paragraph (c) in which under subparagraph (ii) or listed eight different items which are deemed to be investment? Do we take into account the level of investment that is normal in a particular area, or on the other hand do we look to what is good husbandry or to what is an acceptable level of land maintenance generally without regard to the area concerned? That is a question that deserves to be answered and I would like to hear the Minister's response to it.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in relation to subsection (2), am I correct in saying that when that reasonable level is determined, any works which are deemed to be in excess of that reasonable level &mdash; if we reclaim in excess of the reasonable level in the area, if we construct or maintain farm buildings in excess of what is reasonable in that area &mdash; will not be taken into account in adjusting?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a long debate on this very important section of the Bill.  Initially Senator Smith queried the ability of people to make expert judgments in their assessment of land and suggested that their judgment would be open to appeal and that this would result in masses of appeals.  Senator Smith is making the judgment that there will be masses of appeals.  He may be right.  But what we have done in staffing the commissioner's office with expert adjusters, all of whom will be agricultural science graduates, whether they emanate from the Land Commission or from any other direction, is in itself a reason for one having some optimism that the job will be done properly.  In that respect the farm commissioner will ensure that the adjusters will have to take into account the very detailed criteria set out in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Killilea asked me if adjustments already made by the Land <Col N="1916" /> Commission will stand.  This job will have to be tackled afresh by these adjusters with the criteria laid down in the Bill.  I hope he will accept that as a straight reply to some concern he had on this matter.  I do not wish to pursue his criticism of former judgments of Land Commission staff or their operation.  I have neither the expertise in that area nor indeed the knowledge of what has happened in the areas he listed to do so.  However, I have full confidence that the people being recruited for this job have the necessary expertise to do the job.  For the first time in any adjustment made in this country, the farm commissioner will have a list of very strict criteria which will reduce the possibility of there being great anomalies appearing from area to area or from individual adjuster to adjuster or from farm to farm in the adjustments being made.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable at this stage to say what we think an ideal acre is.  In this area we have to fall back on agricultural experts again and they agree generally that the best land in the country is in the south &mdash; the Golden Vale, the Midleton area or further south, say, in Fota Island.  These areas have the climatic conditions, the absence of much frost and adequate rainfall, which results in a long and productive growing season.  When these climatic conditions are combined with top soil capable of a wide range of usage and with good drainage &mdash; core samples will be taken by the trained agricultural experts &mdash; then land will come close to the best land in the country.  I have no doubt that in many cases adjusters will come across land which adjusts one for one with this assessment.  Whether they come across with whole farms which adjust on a one to one basis is another matter that will unfold during the classification process.  There will be cases where land will look good in say, July but which could be flooded for six months of the year.</P>
    <P>The adjusters will be trained agricultural experts.  They will not be holiday sightseers who will arrive for a day, as it were, make a judgment and never be seen again.  Under section 17 they are entitled, of course, to information on <Col N="1917" /> matters relating to a farm.  This will be the farmer's opportunity to put his case in relation to his holding, such as whether it is warm land, cold land or flooded.  I have no doubt that the common sense of the farmers and of adjusters will prevail and that there will be co-operation between farmers and adjusters in the vast majority of cases.  I have no doubt also that there will be some who will make life a little difficult.  But when it is accepted that the basis on which the adjusters operate is fair and clearly defined there will be confidence in their work.  I would call on the farming community to co-operate in this adjustment.  Co-operation will certainly help in arriving at a correct adjustment.  If the farmer can give his opinion to the adjuster &mdash; rather than perhaps show him the gate &mdash; that would constitute a more constructive approach.</P>
    <P>As far as the questions of subjectivity and making assessments are concerned, adjustment will be a matter of judgment, which was what Senator Smith was concerned about.  He was concerned about the objectivity of the adjusters and he mentioned that, in the end, they might just make a judgment and that would be that.  These adjusters will be informed, academic, knowledgeable people in the work they are undertaking.  We accept this in many other areas.  For example, income tax involves judgments by accountants and tax inspectors.  In the case of capital taxation we accept judgments by valuers and auctioneers.  We find nothing wrong so long as the judgments are informed ones and we have confidence in the people who issue such judgments.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis &mdash; where agricultural experts disagree &mdash; there is recourse to the appeals process.  It will remain to be seen whether there will be a massive volume of appeals resulting from this exercise.  If there is this combination of experts doing the job with the co-operation of the farming community then the job will be done better than might be the case otherwise.  The criteria laid down that and will have to be taken into account will ensure that it will be of great benefit to have all of the land of this country adjusted on the basis of such a <Col N="1918" /> system.  For the first time this will bring a benefit to the whole of the farming community, not just on the basis of land value, but will provide a basis that was not there before and which was criticised by some Senators today.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey thought the national soil survey was useful and advocated that as a basis that might be taken into account.  It does not constitute a suitable basis for adjusting acreages because the scale of the maps being used is not sufficiently large.  The soil surveys show typical soils found in various parts of the country. But, within those areas, there can be disparities between types of soils even between one field and another.  For that reason a farm by farm investigation of land must be undertaken in arriving at the adjusted acreage nationwide.</P>
    <P>I have informed Senator O'Toole those who will effect the adjustments will all be agricultural science graduates.  He need not have fears that it will be done by anybody of less than proven technical and academic ability.  Senator O'Toole also inquired about the situation of land on the islands and how they will be assessed. Accessibility to land is one of the criteria which is set out in section 2 (2) (VIII).  If there is this ideal acre on an island, or comprising an island, there will be costly transport involved to and from that island.  That will be taken into account and that is why it is set out among the criteria to be considered in adjusting the acreages of islands.  I can assure the Senator that his concern for the islands in the west and perhaps some on the Shannon and elsewhere, will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan asked about No. V of the criteria which refers to the structure of the agricultural land holding of which the land forms part.  If circumstances change and the land is restructured into one holding it will be up to the occupier, owner or, indeed, the local authority, to request the classification officer to reclassify that land.  Therefore if one party does not do it certainly the other will.  If it is to the benefit of one party then generally it will be that party who will make the request to have the reassessment done, <Col N="1919" /> as was the case under the old valuation system.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fitzsimons that drainage does not necessarily bring about equal benefit to all of the land drained.  I think Senators will agree that we would not have carried out so much drainage in this country if it had not been of benefit to the land.  There is an improvement generally when land is drained.  It will be up to the adjusters to make an adjustment on the basis of any improvement affected by way of drainage when that exceptional circumstance arises.</P>
    <P>On question of the level of investment, the adjustment process assumes a reasonable level of investment.  There can be no question of tax discouraging investment, indeed, quite the opposite.  If the investment is unreasonably low the occupier will still have to pay.  If the potential of the land is vastly improved by an over-investment, then that would not be regarded as reasonable.  If buildings are erected on the land I do not think they would be regarded as investment in the land itself.  The quality of the land having been improved or made more productive by a reasonable amount of investment, which is set out in section 2 (c) is the quality which the adjusters will have to take into account.  We should not assume that any farmer can continue in business without putting back into the land the various outlays mentioned in paragraph (c).  The normal use of fertilisers and other substances maintains land at a particular level of production.  Therefore it is part of the normal business of making land more useful.  Paragraph (c) sets out what is regarded as investment.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the queries. This section of the Bill, which we all regard as most important, has been set out in a way which I had hoped, would have met with the agreement of all Senators. It is an attempt to lay down criteria which would ensure that the adjusters, who are experts, would be able to take an informed and even-handed approach to adjustments and, arrive at a system of adjusted acreage which would be comparable from north to south, and from <Col N="1920" /> east to west, and which would be a reasonable basis for pursuing the land tax which I hope will not result, as members of the Fianna Fáil Party have suggested, in a mass of appeals coming forward.  If we wait and see the result, with some exceptions there will be an acceptance of what is being done, and it will be seen that the people who are asked to do this job are doing it fairly and evenly.  With the help of the farming community, we will also ensure that the land is adjusted to a level that will represent exactly what we are trying to achieve in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Just two questions. Senator McDonald raised a very important question which the Minister has not yet answered.  Where land is used for six months of the year only, would two acres of that land be the equivalent of one acre of land used on a continual basis?  We have a lot of the type of land of which Senator McDonald is speaking in the west.  You could not have any stock on that land because of climatic conditions during the winter; so it is only productive for six months of the year.</P>
      <P>Will the local ACOT advisers be consulted in relation to adjustments?  I take it that the 100 people mentioned will be academics just out of college without the practical experience of ACOT advisers. Indeed, will the CAO and his staff be consulted?  They have a wide knowledge of the type of farming that takes place within their own county.  At any time during the assessment will these officers be used on site with the farmer or indeed at all?  This will have a great bearing on the adjustment.  The college graduates will have no practical experience at all but will be available for appointment to the staff.  This will be an opening for them to make a few pounds for themselves in the short term.  To adjust an acre of varied land one would require a lot of practical experience.  I would not welcome the academic, just out of college, assisting the Land Commission in the assessment of land.  Does the Minister intend to take the advice of the practical agricultural instructors in each county when this is taking place?</P>

      <P>The Minister has a reputation for being a fairly fair minded man. Perhaps he surpassed himself with the degree of infallibility he attributed to the graduates in the context of this adjustment. We are trying to assist the Minister in having a Bill passed in this House which will at least try to deal with some of the complexities of the problems that will face us as far as proper adjustment is concerned.</P>
      <P>We do not have to go back too far to find black holes in the economy and a cock up in statistics in relation to our milk production.  I am quite sure, without casting any reflection on the generality of graduates, it is more likely than not that the advice given to the AIB with regard to ICI came from graduates.  I have every confidence in people emanating from our educational institutions, but for this kind of problem experience shows us there is no easy solution.</P>
      <P>In relation to the statement which I made with regard to land capable of a wide range of usage, how can a person who cannot get a sugar quota or a beef quota compete with somebody who can or how can somebody who cannot get into milk production compete with somebody who is in it?  The lack of a scientific basis for the completion of the soil survey, added to the quota system which has been introduced in farm production, makes this job extremely difficult.  I am not casting reflections on the personnel who will be called on to do it, I am putting it to the Minister that there are inherent difficulties in trying to have an equitable system.  The appeals will not come from people whose acreages have been adjusted on a high level.  The appeals will come, on the basis of these comparisons, from individual farmers who do not have access to farming enterprises in the top earning areas at the moment because of the quota system.  I am coming up against this difficulty every day and that is why I am putting it to the Minister as strongly as I can &mdash; I hope I will not be regarded as a judge &mdash; in all of these matters.</P>

      <P>I do not share the views of Senator O'Toole and to a degree <Col N="1922" /> those of Senator Smith.  The graduates, especially the young graduates, will be ideal persons.  If I read the Bill correctly we are talking about the quality and capacity of the acre to be adjusted. People must have scientific knowledge fresh in their minds in order to be able to examine and assess the quality and capacity of the soil.  I agree with Senator Smith that there is the added question for ordinary agricultural management of the various quotas, levies and so on.  That is a separate question and, while it is a problem for the individual farmer, the adjusting of the acreage should be on the quality and capacity of the soil.  Consider the inequalities in the old PLV system where land was £1 an acre in some areas, as low as half a crown in others and up to 25s. in others.  After 100 years of erosion perhaps and the forces of different husbandaries the quality of the soil does not bear a great relationship to the valuation placed by the Griffith organisation. That is why the adjusted acre must have above all a very distinct relationship to the quality of the soil and its capacity and location.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Smith makes the point that farms have often attached to them quotas under which the milk super-levy system applies and that this will affect the production of the farm while other farms have not got that facility. Let me point out that the adjusted acre system is designed to reflect the potential productivity of land for agricultural purposes. It would destroy the logic of the system if factors extraneous to the land itself were to be taken into account.  Decisions taken in Brussels are extraneous to the quality of the land because there is, for example, the age of the farmer and the level of his ability as a farmer.  If we introduce these factors we will destroy the whole concept of the adjusted acre. While on this subject, while milk production is the present target for EC production limitations, it is reasonable to assume that other forms of agricultural production may be the subject of other EC measures in future years.  Clearly, if the adjusted acre concept is to stand up for some time, as we confidently expect it will, then it cannot be constantly changed to reflect the year to year decisions from Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the graduates &mdash; Senator Smith has paid a tribute to me as being a reasonable person and I know him to be a reasonable person also &mdash; the 100 inspectors of the Land Commission with their wide experience as well as their qualifications, supplemented by 100 graduates who will be trained and supervised to ensure that adequate and consistent adjustments will be made, should give confidence to the farming community about the type of adjustments that will be made.  There will be a useful fusion of the fresh ideas from the graduates and the experience from the experienced officers. They will all be dealing with the concrete process of adjusting the acreages following the visits to and on the spot examinations of the various pieces of land. Experience will bring about the right result.  I think some Senators are concerned needlessly about the ability of graduates from college to make the assessments.  As I say, the fusing of the experience of the people from the Land <Col N="1925" /> Commission with the knowledge and recent experience of the graduates will, I am sure, result in a very good job being done in the adjustment of the acreages.</P>

      <P>Many of our farms include ancient and historic monuments. In the east, for example, they are mainly Norman motte and bailey, ring forts, crannógs and souterrains.  Provision should be made in this section for a generous allowance where these are concerned because in the past we have lost many of those monuments due to farmers trying to maximise their holdings.  Quite apart from the area involved in the monuments, these are open to the public and there is considerable trespassing.  In the interest of preserving these very valuable monuments some generous concession should be made in this section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly we all have the concern that Senator Fitzsimons has for land which contains such monuments, and they occur throughout my county and his.  A matter that will have to be taken into account when land is being adjusted is whether a portion of the field wherein the monument lies is viewed regularly as a means of getting to and from these places or building of historical interest.  This is a point that must be taken into account if the land is not used for agricultural purposes around the area of these buildings, crannógs, or whatever. If land has to be set aside for entry into that area it can be taken into account quite easily by the inspectors in the performance of their duties when arriving at an assessment of that piece of land.</P>

Farmers can plough over it if they want to and some of them have, unfortunately.  It would be comparable to the rest of the farm.  There are visits by the public to these monuments, some of them on quite a large scale.  In the interest of preserving those valuable monuments which are very important to our culture and our heritage, provision <Col N="1926" /> should be made in this Bill.  This would be the appropriate section to include that provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of adjusted acreage, perhaps one of the matters most often raised with me in the past few weeks is the timing of the visit of some of these graduates.  If one drives around most of Ireland at a certain time of the year all land looks in reasonably good shape.  At other times of the year, for perhaps half of the year, the best of land can look very bad.  Will decisions be reviewed by any of these people at a different time of the year?  The landowner knows exactly what his land is capable of producing.  In the months of April or May all land looks very well.  In the winter or the autumn it can look in terribly bad condition.  Has the Minister any thoughts about some type of an appeal before a final decision is made?  I know that final decisions must be made, but it is just a question of viewing the land at different times of the year.  From my own experience as a farmer I know that the poorest land can look reasonably good at certain times of the year, but at other times it can look as if it is not capable of producing anything.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this whole exercise is to adjust acreages according to their agricultural production. That is the basis of the Bill.  If the farming community use the land around a monument for agricultural purposes, that land must be adjusted according to its agricultural potential.  An appeal could be made under other legislation to preserve a certain amount of land around a national monument under the control of the Office of Public Works.  That is the answer I have to give under the terms of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already dealt with the point about a review being done at different times of the year.  I said that at different times of the year land looks differently, even to somebody like myself who is not an expert.  We are talking about people who are expert and who have been working with land through all the seasons of <Col N="1927" /> the year and have in the vast majority of the cases grown up on the land.  People who are going to do this inspectors' job know what they are about.  They are not going to farms as sightseers; they will be there as experts who will make their judgment on the basis of their scientific knowledge and expert qualifications and, I hope, with the full co-operation of the farmer and an ACOT official, or somebody else if the farmer feels he wishes to have another expert opinion.  Basically, the inspector will not be coming down two or three times a year to see if things have materially changed from one season to the other.  He will make his decision on the basis of his visit to the farm.  That can be with or without the co-operation of the farmer involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that his idea of an adjusted acre is to adjust an acre to its maximum ability to produce. Senator Smith earlier raised the point about the income per adjusted acre from beef as against milk, cereals or sugar beet.  The net result is that the incomes as produced by An Foras Talúntais from the various sections of farming are totally different, yet the Minister tells us that he is adjusting it to the maximum benefit or use that can be made of that land.  If one follows that on, the maximum use at the moment would appear to be from milk production which is limited under the EC with super-levies and quotas.</P>

As the law stands he is handicapped in that he cannot enter milk production, which is the most lucrative type of farming, without having a quota.  Can the Minister tell us how this proposed tax can work equitably for each person or for each type of farming operation in view of the fact that the income levels are totally different?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this subject at a much earlier stage when I said there were different land uses and that this would have to be taken into account.  We had the question of land which could be used for one particular purpose and might not have the quality to be successful in another area of agricultural production. Of course, there are other lands which are much more versatile in that they can produce grass or cereal crops or otherwise. These must be adjusted to a different level.  We are not dealing with the income of farmers; we are dealing with the ability of land to produce and the various criteria which are mentioned in section 2 (2) of this Bill.  We have given the example of where the most suitable acre might be found and every other acre that does not measure up to that must be adjusted downwards.  If it is only suitable for one form of production, it will not be adjusted at the same level.</P>
      <P>We cannot get into the argument of whether we are getting more from milk or less from cereals at the moment.  There is not a good price for beef at this time of the year.  We are adjusting the acreage to provide us with an even guideline on the ability of farmers to produce.  I thought we had dealt with that at an earlier stage.  It will have to be accepted that if even the best land has limitations in regard to location or climate it must be adjusted downwards.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the ability of the land to produce is taken into consideration.  If that is so it must be taken in conjunction with what it can produce.

      <P>We are now in a circular argument again.  I had fully dealt with that item when I answered Senator Smith's query on a similar point.  I told him that on that basis we would be changing the basis of the adjusted acre every time Brussels decided that there was an oversupply of any particular commodity. <Col N="1929" /> At present there is an upper limit or a downward production in cereals and perhaps that would happen in some other area next year.  That would mean that we would have to do the whole adjustment again on the basis of decisions which are made for different reasons in Brussels.  I cannot accept that argument.

      <P>The Minister stated that those quotas will not be of any benefit so we can take it that milk quotas are no longer of any benefit to a farm.  The Minister also stated that the people whom he will be recruiting are graduates. What will be the minimum length of practical knowledge required by those people who will be recruited before they can be appointed as assessors?  The Minister stated that they would have practical knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt with this point.  I said that there would be a mixture of very experienced people on the Land Commission, that there would also be graduates, some of whom might not have a great deal of practical experience but there would be a mixture of experience and academic qualifications and perhaps the newer graduates would have greater expertise than somebody out of college for a longer period of time.  They will be working under the farm tax commissioner who has guidelines in section 2(2) of the Bill which he will apply to the adjusters in arriving at the adjustment of acreages.  I cannot lay down in this Bill the length of service which one should have before being taken on as an <Col N="1930" /> adjuster and inspector in this process. There will be a selection process and I am sure that knowledge and experience will be of benefit to the candidates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a practical side which applies to agricultural science degrees and someone even one day out of college would have some practical knowledge in this area.  I accept that many other people would have practical knowledge as most would be from a farming background and would have practical knowledge and experience in farming as well as the academic knowledge acquired through achieving a degree in agricultural science.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>If we follow the Minister's argument through we will see that he thinks people who come from an urban area may be at a major disadvantage as far as this is concerned.  I still feel that the people who should be used in this are those who have worked as ACOT advisers in their areas for quite a number of years rather than people who are fresh out of college.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  We had a debate on the abilities of other people in the Land Commission and now we are having a debate on the ability of people coming out of college.  I have faith in academic qualifications and experience which these people have.  I do not think Senator Ellis should make a judgment in that regard.  People who come out of agricultural science colleges are very experienced and have the best qualifications anyone can get in any country, because we have a more varied agricultural system in this country than anywhere else.  I think he should have a little more faith in the people who are being <Col N="1931" /> educated in this country at third level colleges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2(2) states that regard shall be had to the range of uses to which land can be put for the purposes of agricultural production.  As the Minister knows, those purposes are limited. The quotas will mean that a farmer who may have the best land which could have very high output as far as milk is concerned can now come in and make a case under subsection (2)(a)(1) that the purposes for which his land can be used are minimal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ellis wants to have it both ways.  He said, by implication, that milk is more profitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>One can say that about sugar beet also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may say that as milk seems to be the more profitable activity in agriculture those involved in that type of farming should pay more tax.  In the same breath he is saying that milk is hindered by levies and quotas. I do not know where we are on this.  I am discounting the whole argument about quotas and levies.  I have not accepted in the Bill that Brussels should say today the level of taxation farmers should pay under the Bill and tomorrow decide something different.  That would be ridiculous and I do not think the Senator believes that is the way we should proceed under a Bill that is trying to achieve an adjustment of acreages on the basis of ability to produce or otherwise.  I reject that argument.  I rejected it before and I do so again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admits that it <Col N="1932" /> is the ability of the land to produce that is involved but the ability of the land to produce is hindered by outside circumstances beyond the control of the Minister and farmers.  What will the legal position be if some farmer decides to challenge in the courts, as he is entitled to, this section on the basis that the ability of his land to produce is hindered by the quota system?  I am thinking of two identical farms alongside each other, of 40 adjusted acres, one in milk and the other in beef.  Both will be levied on 40 adjusted acres at the same amount per acre.  The ability of the land to produce is not the same.  The beef farmer, in my opinion, will be in a position to prove in court that the ability of his farm to produce is less than that of the dairy farmer who is beside him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Senator Ellis in all fairness is doing the farming community a service because what I take him to be asking for is a different adjustment for each type of husbandry.  If he is advocating that those in milk or those in beef should pay a higher land tax than those who are, perhaps, in beet or barley production, that is rather dangerous.  Is the Senator asking that each farm should have a special certificate and the crops one grows will reflect the rate of land tax?  That would not be welcomed by the farming community.  The margins in farming, as everybody knows, are restricted and are getting tighter each year.  The farmer takes a conscious decision as to the line he wants to be in.  People with milk quotas have them because they were in milk up to one and a half years ago. There were no quotas before that, there were no restrictions.  By and large people in milk have been traditionally in that area.  Similarly with beet.  The beet restrictions are only two years old.  I do not welcome them.  It is nice to have the flexibility to move in and out and improve one's rotation by sowing beet but the market seems to want to consolidate the production and know exactly how much tonnage will be produced.  The Bill is setting out to classify the quality and potential of the land.  Farmers will be <Col N="1933" /> happy enough with that but if we are to have a different certificate for each crop it will be disastrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McDonald has made the point I was about to make. Senator Ellis made the point that in the case of three neighbouring farmers with the same type of land but in different lines of production, barley, cattle and beet, we should have a different charge for each one.  Quite honestly, that case is weak because if the margin of profit from milk is higher than that from beef the farmer will have known that for quite a long time.  He has not to wait until now simply because a £10 land tax is put on him to decide whether to produce a certain crop or get involved in milk or beef. I do not think he is going to make any other decision than staying in the line he is in simply because there is a £10 land tax.  The farmer will have made his own judgment.  It could be that milk production or barley production did not suit him.  Every farmer has his own line of business that he feels he is best or happiest in.  The weakest part of Senator Ellis's argument has been the case of the three farmers with land of equal productive quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to point out that the tax as proposed is totally inequitable without regard to the ability of the farmer to pay.  After all we have been talking about having equality of tax here for the past 20 years.  This tax legislation is creating more anomalies than we had before. The Bill is another sad and botched attempt to have a fair taxation system which has gone the wrong road.  The Minister must accept that this is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ellis speaks of equality.  The PAYE sector would certainly love to see some of the equality reflected in legislation.  The facts are that in 1983 £32 million was the tax paid by the farming community out of a total of £1,660 million collected.  That is the sort of equality that the Bill moves towards. <Col N="1934" /> With regard to the specifics under discussion, it is clear that the Minister is trying to accommodate the views expressed but the weakness of the case is evident to any neutral observer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be an incentive for people to move into productive lines.  It is a free country and if one particular line of production is more profitable, then a farmer can choose to go into that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot.  Senator Howlin should be educated on this.  Farmers cannot move in due to the restrictions already there in the various sections.  Senator Howlin has indicated his lack of knowledge when he stated that they can move at will.  With regard to the term, the adequacy of the water supply to the land, may we take it that lands which are adjoined by a group water scheme or have access to it will be at a higher rate than lands which have not access to a group scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the old problem of which way one looks at it.  Land which has not got a water scheme will, obviously, be at a disadvantage and, therefore, should not be considered as productive.  That is reasonable.  All water schemes are sponsored by my Department and grants are given to bring them about.  If any area has not got a water scheme they should get in touch with my Department to see if we can help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it that lands which adjoin towns, or which adjoin roads which may be of use for building, will not have this position taken into consideration when the land is being assessed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we are <Col N="1935" /> assessing agricultural land, and land near a town has some benefits.  We are not talking about development land or anything like that; we are talking about being near suppliers etc.  It would obviously be of some benefit to have a farm in that position.  But, on the other hand, if like many people in my constituency, one had sheep on the land and lived near a town it might not be such a benefit because people living near a town may abuse farm land.  All these factors are taken into account.  I would not be in a position to say whether it was an advantage for a farmer to be near a town.  It would depend on the line of operation he is in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging from the Minister's reply, we can take it that the fact that land may be adjacent to a town and may have development potential will not be considered when it comes to evaluating its agricultural use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <P>Again we get back to the subject we referred to earlier.  If he had not been able to apply a reasonable level of investment to a farm which would have resulted in greater production, and therefore a bigger return to him, that means that the adjudication by the inspector will probably be higher on the basis of his lack of investment potential, or energy or whatever, and the level he may have to pay in farm tax may be higher than if he had applied what we regard here as a reasonable level of investment to the land.  If the opposite is the case, if somebody applies a far higher level of investment and goes beyond what would normally be necessary to produce a reasonable income from land, that too would be taken into account and the adjustment would in that case be lower than what otherwise would be regarded as a higher rate of return from that particular land.</P>

That is the whole basis of the Bill.  It is not for me to say whether a farmer is good, bad or indifferent.

      <P>Section 2 deals with adjusted acres and under this section they cannot prove that they are in straitened circumstances.  We are dealing now with the land which will be adjusted, and how it is to be adjusted, and how to arrive at the acreages which are being adjusted and fall into the category which will attract tax.  We are not dealing with the individual farmer-occupier of the land. We are simply dealing with this section and how the inspectors are to arrive at an adjustment of acreages throughout the country.  When time allows, we will probably deal with the farmer himself and his ability to pay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 34 and 35, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) For the purposes of this Act and the Income Tax Acts 1967 to 1985 whenever in any given year farm tax is liable on a taxable farm of not less than 20 and not more than 80 adjusted acres, income tax shall not be liable on the owner, occupier or such other person in respect of the said farm in that year&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage the Minister indicated that the intention with regard to farmers who had fewer than 80 adjusted acres is that they would be exempted from income tax when the new farm tax is in operation and we are endeavouring in this amendment to have this provision included in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal in section 3 is that farms of between 20 and 80 adjusted acres will be exempt from income tax.  The Government propose to grant an exemption from income tax for farmers of fewer than 80 adjusted acres according as they are deemed to be in the farm tax net.  It is appropriate to provide for this, not in the farm tax legislation, but in the Finance Acts under which income tax is payable.  The Finance Bill, 1986 will contain the appropriate provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended to revamp or increase the personnel in the Central Statistics Office in order that we can have an absolutely reliable basis for the section covering estimated level of farm incomes?  Secondly, can any provision be considered which would take account of the differing incomes and the different enterprises in farming, bearing in mind what I said earlier, that it is possible to have an overall increase in farm incomes for one year over another and have contained within that individual groups of farmers who actually suffered losses on the previous year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Reluctantly, I must say no on both counts.  On the first count there is no reference to the CSO in this Bill and the complemental persons in that section of the Taoiseach's Department. I cannot give that guarantee but I can indicate the Senator's concern to have additional staff there and indicate to the Taoiseach the reasons that might be necessary.  If he agrees I propose to act accordingly.</P>
      <P>On the question of considering the incomes of various classes of farmers on the basis of the types of farming they are involved in, we considered this at length in section 2 and I said then that I could not take on board any proposals such as this that would differentiate between farmers having adjusted acreages which may have an assessment of equal value. The rate is set at £10 per adjusted acre in this section and that would have to be the level for 1986 for all acres adjusted within the 20 to 80 acres provision.  I would not be able to depart from that figure for any category of farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 14 and 15 to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) The Minister shall by regulations made under this Act specify the conditions under which undue hardship, in regard to the payment of farm tax, can be met, and in a case where any of these conditions are met, the charge to farm tax shall be waived in full by the local authority concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This, again, is one of the more contentious aspects of this Bill.  Numerous attempts made, prior to the passage of this Bill in the other House, I understand involving meetings with the Cabinet, by individuals in the farming community and the farm organisations to try to have a clause included in the Bill which would cater adequately for what might be considered undue hardship.  In my Second Stage contribution I said that there obviously would be situations where the land tax might not be capable of being paid by the present occupiers of holdings but where there would be a justifiable reason for mortgaging the property in the context of land tax and having it remain to be paid at some stage by a beneficiary of that estate.  But the real situations we are trying to get at here are those of individual families, taking into account the death of a parent, where there is handicap or incapacity, continuing illness, even animal disease or disease in crops.  One can think of a variety of examples where individual farmers for one reason or another would be incapable of meeting their liability to the land tax. That would apply to all sizes of farm holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1945" /> To propose to allow the land tax to be a continuing charge is a very extreme proposal.  It would be like a creeping mortgage, paralysing individuals and could be considered to constitute a gradual confiscation of the property.  Under all systems of tax to date it has been possible to include a proviso where by such cases could be dealt more sympathetically. The Minister will have to go some way down the road to cater for the kinds of situation I am outlining.  We have the farm rescue package, with its different clauses.  We have had representations to the Department of Agriculture by groups who have been left out of the milk quota provisions and who could have been considered. Various hardship cases have been put forward.  Where the incomes being derived from farming are such as to leave no tax liability whatsoever the Minister is insisting that land tax would remain a continuing charge.  That individuals who through no fault of theirs are unable to meet their liabilities have to meet the land tax the charge as a creeping mortgage is an extreme and heavy penalty. It should be remembered that if one does not reach the income tax threshold one would not have to pay tax.  Clearly that would be the position in the instances I am outlining.  I must ask the Minister to consider this amendment very seriously giving somewhat more sympathy to individual farmers who may find themselves in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is another group also who, because of borrowings, find themselves in extreme situations.  Regrettably, these are to be found in every county at present.  Many of these could also fall into this category.  I am not anxious to open the floodgates or bring about a situation in which farmers who would not be justified in claiming this relief would do so.  However, it is absolutely essential that there be a scheme available to cater for the genuine cases that every public representative in both Houses knows exists.  Therefore, I am putting forward this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to take another look at this part of the <Col N="1946" /> Bill.  Perhaps it is introduced on a trial basis.  In the months or year ahead, however he might take a more sympathetic look at this.  I cannot put a number on them but there is at present a certain section of farmers who would be in what is known as the rescue package category. On the face of it, it would seem that these people are unable to pay any additional moneys because of being stretched to their limits.  While I accept that there is in the bill a hardship clause giving power to county managers to perhaps postpone the date of payment which in the final analysis, whether it be in six months, 12 months or 12 years, will be a charge on their farm &mdash; I always felt &mdash; and I stand to be corrected on this &mdash; that in the old days of the rates, when the council or the managers had power to waive rates in cases of people who were unable to pay, they were waived for all time.  I do not mean every year but perhaps in a particular year, if somebody found themselves unable to pay and it could be proven to the county manager that they were a hardship case, the county manager had the power to waive the rates in those cases.  In one particular year &mdash; perhaps not every year &mdash; in my lifetime in the council the managers had power to do so. In relation to the numbers of farmers in the rescue package category, these people are stretched to their limits at present, and there are a great number of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take, for example, a man with an acreage of around 80 acres.  That man has to be in accounts at the moment because he is in the rescue package and must produce accounts.  For that reason he will have an additional burden of perhaps £800 dependent on whether he has 80 adjusted acres.  No doubt that would have to be another £800 borrowed and he would incur interest on top of that.  While the council manager would have power to postpone payment of the tax, that is not going far enough.  I would request the Minister to take another look at this, perhaps giving managers power to waive these liabilities completely rather than merely postponing the evil day.  When this tax is implemented it will be well <Col N="1947" /> known to every farmer who unfortunately cannot pay.  It is bad enough to be poor and unable to pay without everybody in a council chamber and everywhere else knowing it.  Perhaps most of us are poor but we do not want to talk about it.  We do not want to let anyone know we are as poor as we are.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister on this. The Minister may well make the case that we could be opening the floodgates.  I appreciate that.  There are many people who could be described as being hardship cases.  But I am specifying the people in the rescue package category.  I could not put a number on it, but I know many of them because I happened to be a member of the ACOT board when the people from ACOT carried out this survey to find out how many farmers were in difficulties. The number we came up with may not be correct, because people are not that fast to say they are in financial difficulties.  They wish to keep this sort of trouble to themselves.  I know from discussions with the banks that some of these people are incapable of being rescued.  I appeal to the Minister to take another look at this and take my views into consideration as my information is that these people will not be easily rescued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In amendment No. 2 Senator Smith proposes that it be written into the Bill that the Minister will be required to make regulations specifying the conditions in which undue hardship can be met and providing for the full waiver of farm tax in such cases.  This amendment cannot be accepted.  It would not be practicable or possible to specify hardship conditions in advance.  The central factor must be that where hardship is claimed an evaluation of the circumstances of the individual should be made. The Bill already contains the necessary provisions in the section as it stands.  It is more sensible to allow local authorities to evaluate each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment also provides for the waiver of farm tax liability in full.  This is not justified where there is an asset of <Col N="1948" /> the nature of farm land over 20 adjusted acres.  I agree to issue guidelines for specific categories of farmers in difficulties to local authorities, where a waiver of tax may be granted and carried forward until better times arrive.  No interest will apply to these waivers and in exceptional cases either the local authority or the farmer can apply for a mortgage to set against the property.  Amendment No. 3 is consequential on amendment No. 2 and is, therefore unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Lennon mentioned the rescue package for farmers.  The farmers who qualify for the rescue package are ones who, due to heavy borrowings, have difficulty meeting their repayments.  The problems are usually temporary.  In these circumstances the provisions in the Bill would allow for the collection of the tax to be postponed until times improved. The build up over a period of three or four years in respect of farm tax would not be very big, in the light of the size of the farm and its capital value.  I therefore reject both amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was really asking the Minister to take another sympathetic look at these people.  We are introducing land tax on the productive capacity of land, but we should look at the capacity of people to pay land tax, especially people who, for reasons outside their control, are in financial difficulties.  Having met some of these people and discussed their problems with the banks, I know that some are borderline cases.  Some of them are on the point of sinking and the banks have grave doubts as to whether or not some of them can be rescued.  It is an added burden on these people to think that if they do not pay this year they will have to pay the next year or the year after.  I appeal to the Minister to have a further sympathetic look at these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulty and I know that we can find hardship cases other than those recognised under the rescue package.  Down through the years under the old rates system councils did not pressurise hardship cases to a great extent.  As far as I can recall, in one year the manager of the council got <Col N="1949" /> power from the Minister of the day to waive the debts in that year.  This was a year in which farmers suffered great losses and were unable to pay their debts. I would appreciate it if the Minister would be a little more encouraging and tell me that he is prepared to look at it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed with the Minister's reaction.  I had sought in the amendment to ask the Minister to lay down the conditions where this waiver could arise.  In a variety of schemes operated by the local authorities and the health boards, individual Ministers laid down conditions under which certain allowances are payable.  In this instance I thought that we had better have national criteria which would apply in every local authority and that the local authorities would have the guidance of the Government Departments in operating the schemes.</P>
      <P>We are talking here about a small minority of cases, individuals who have always paid their way, who have tried not to be in debt.  What we are now saying to those people is that, under the income tax laws, they have no tax liability because of their financial circumstances, and that we recognise that they have subsistence living standards, but this law is such that under no circumstances can it be waived and it is therefore a gradual mortgaging of the property.  I can give an example. In my locality a farmer fell into very poor health.  His young family were unable to manage his farm and he was in poor financial circumstances.  How can anybody stand up and tell that individual that he must have a continuing mortgage put against his assets over the next I do not know how many years?  It will run into thousands of pounds over nine or ten years.  Does the Minister consider that a fair imposition on people who genuinely would have no liability under the income tax code?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is perhaps expressing the most extreme situation that could be found.  Therefore, I must repeat that I will be issuing guidelines for specific categories such as he has outlined <Col N="1950" /> where the local authorities can consider a waiver for that situation in which that farmer might find himself.  That means that that individual is relieved of paying any tax in that year and if that situation continues for a number of years and the case can be made again and again, then that waiver will continue but the sum will undoubtedly mount up over a period. What was done in the old rating system for a person who was unable to pay his rates because of lack of income basically, whether he was in a house, a business or anything else, will be the gist of the system that will be used in this situation. It may get to a stage where the sum would be relatively large and in that case a mortgage could be taken out on the holding which would remove it as a debt from the books of the local authority, and it would stand there until eventually either the person was in a position to remove that mortgage or even the property was sold. I have sympathy for people in that situation, but we must always consider that there is there an asset which has been adjudged by the inspectors as having a potential for delivering an income to that family.  Therefore, whether it was the old rating system or this system, that would indicate a level of taxation for each year, and that can be relieved only by it being paid or by being waived for a period of years or a year until the person is in a position to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lennon mentioned that he recalls that under the old valuation system certain uncollected rates were not just waived for a year but were regarded as uncollectable and written off.  Of course, that is quite true; that happened in very exceptional circumstances.  I can tell the Senator that that usually happened when the asset itself had gone into total disrepair, whether it was a house or a business.  If it was a factory that simply went out of business and became derelict nobody was ever going to pay the level of rates that attached to it as a going concern, and in circumstances like that it was possible to write off rates as uncollectable. The value of a domestic dwelling which was let run into total disrepair <Col N="1951" /> and disuse could not be got back from the person who was the rated occupier or likely to be an owner in the future because the place had no value.  However, in this case the land has value and will continue to maintain its adjusted acreage valuation.  That is the difference between those uncollected rates in the past and this situation here.  There was a time around 1980 when a regulation or perhaps a letter issued from the Department of the Environment suggesting to managers that they should take a lenient line on the collection of rates from farmers.  That depended on each manager and the state of his balances at the time.  Some managers accepted that as a direction and ordered their rate collectors so to carry out their collection.  Others thought that they could not afford to carry out that direction.  I think it was overtaken by the High Court decision and the situation did not apply any further, and those rates that were not paid apparently will never be paid.</P>
    <P>Again I must say that we are making arrangements in this Bill to take into account a category of occupiers or farmers and they can have a waiver of a temporary nature over a period of time if their situation requires it.  I would say that we should see how this works for people over a period of years and if real hardship emanates from it, but initially tonight I must say that I have to reject the amendments.  However, I have sympathy for the case being made and we should see if this situation that is being put forward tonight by both sides of the House becomes a reality in the future.  Then I, or whoever is in this Department, will have no hesitation in coming in again and perhaps bringing forward an amendment to the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious that the Minister's latter statement is not as entrenched as his early contribution was, nevertheless I must insist on my point where the land tax remains chargeable against the State.  I want the Minister to try to put himself in the position of somebody such as I have described.  The <Col N="1952" /> Minister says that I picked the extreme cases.  They are to be found everywhere. It could be brought about by the sudden death of the farmer or any one of a variety of handicapping features which place an individual, through no fault of his or her own, in a position where he or she has no income tax liability and, therefore, should not have this as a continuing mortgage on his or her estate.  The Minister said that land is a resource and that it has been evaluated with having a certain value for the purpose of this Bill and for the payment of farm tax, but any resource is only as good as the individual who has to operate it for the time being.  God between us and all harm, we never know what can happen with accidents and what have you.  To have an individual facing up to the kind of circumstances that I am talking about, a charge which is against the estate and growing all the time pressing in on top of him, is an added, unacceptable burden in those circumstances. In my time on the county council dealing with problems of that kind the charges, even if they were held against the estate, were held for only a limited time and eventually were written off and these uncollectable, written off rates were brought before the council year in year out.  This is one amendment which gets down to the guts, the root of this whole tax.  Most people accept that it is inequitable and that consideration cannot be given to the difference between incomes that can be got for different enterprises in farming.  Nevertheless, there is a broad acceptance that farmers must be seen to pay more than has been paid up to now and to carry their share of the national burden of taxation so that no sector will feel that they are being left to carry an undue burden.  There is a broad acceptance of all of that.  This may be a crude way of doing it but it is probably one way of getting a reasonable tax income from the farming community.  Leaving aside all the other problems that are in it, all the inequities, in this one area the Minister must give way.  I go so far as to say that it is immoral to press a person who has no tax liability whatsoever, because of his individual circumstances, and force <Col N="1953" /> him to have this charge laid against his estate as a growing, increasing and gradual mortgage of the farm to the State. That is totally unacceptable and I cannot see why the Minister, in contemplating making changes in a few years' time, could not now once and for all treat that minority of cases the same way as one would treat any other group in society who do not have the resources to meet their liabilities.</P>
      <P>The Government will be paying unemployment assistance in some of those areas.  The Minister for Agriculture in some of those cases will be paying a rescue package.  At the same time another element of the Government's arm insists on a continuing charge on the estate of somebody who is qualifying for assistance of the nature I am talking about.  Is it consistent for the Government on the one hand to accept that they should have a medical card, that they should have some other assistance and at the same time to place that charge against their estate?</P>
      <P>I do not want to hold up unnecessarily the proceedings of this House.  We have debated a lot of other issues for a long time today, but I have to say that this is a fundamental crux with this Bill.  We have tolerated a fair level of inequity throughout the whole of it, but I cannot stand by and see individuals I know placed in a most extraordinary position <i>vis-a-vis</i> any other taxpayer in the community. We are talking about a small minority of people, a group of people who would pay if they were able.  Because of incapacity of one kind or another they may not be able to meet their liabilities under this Bill.  They will face that mounting charge year in, year out against their estate.  Theoretically it could reach the position where the State would own the farm, not the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have much sympathy with the point Senator Smith is making.  If we were to apply waivers in the same way as we apply waivers in any of the existing local authority schemes &mdash; for instance, for water charges &mdash; they would be waived for the year and forgotten about. <Col N="1954" /> The next year is taken as it comes.  I would have interpreted the word &ldquo;waiver&rdquo; to mean <i>ad infinitum</i> in respect of that year.  The number of people Senator Smith talks about is probably small, but because it is so small a provision might be abused if it were written into the Bill.  I feel there is a way out of this dilemma.  The Minister has touched on it and stated that he could look at it.  The amount of money that would probably be involved is £700 or £800 a year at the top end of the bracket, while at the lower end of the bracket it might be £300 a year.  The county manager might decide, because of some catastrophe &mdash; wiped out by a flood or some tragedy on the farm &mdash; that there was not an income as such, but there is still the asset of the farm.  In principle we are talking about a type of resource tax as a replacement for income tax, but also as a contribution to local authorities based on the assets or earning capacity of the farm.  I would prefer if the charge could be properly waived and forgotten about, but I could see a situation where there would probably be abuse of it because there would be so many people looking for waiver of tax that nothing would be collected in any year.</P>
      <P>I would be prepared to accept the Minister's commitment to look at the section again if there was an ongoing degree of hardship which would continue from one year to another and which a farm could not carry.  If there is an anomaly here it will only be seen during the operation of the legislation over a number of years and the Minister has stated that he would be prepared to look at it again.  I have sympathy with the amendment, but I can also see some problems in it.  The Minister has been reasonable in his attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is a good section.  It is a concession that was given following representations from farming bodies, particularly the ICMSA who made a very strong and reasonable case on the basis that any taxation would have to be seen to take into account a person's ability to pay.  The Minister has conceded that unlike other taxpayers who owe money and have to pay interest on it, at least in <Col N="1955" /> this section he is not expecting a person to pay interest on the amount owing.  He will want to review it each year.  If he realises after a number of years that undue hardship is being caused by a debt accruing against a small farm which cannot carry it, I suppose a readjustment could be made.  The acres could be adjusted downwards because of the tragedy, whether a flooding or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I take it therefore that the level of tax, which is now decided at £10 per acre, is subject to fluctuation up or down in the event of anything going wrong.  It certainly is agreed that if farming incomes increase the rate per acre will possibly increase.  In the event of some peculiar situation in the Community in which farming incomes might drop out of all proportion, obviously the rate of tax would also drop.  I can see nothing wrong with the principle of readjusting acreages in a situation where a whole farm could have been wiped out by flooding &mdash; and 100,000 in the Suir Valley are wiped out by flooding every year.  Senator Smith knows this.  There will be a period or readjustment in situations like that.  That will probably assist the continuation of a waiver or the writing off of a liability under this section.</P>

      <P>I am heartened by the fact that the Minister has agreed to look at the position in a couple of years hence. One of the problems here was that the IFA said even before the Bill was published that they were not going to pay or co-operate with this kind of taxation.  I assume that the rather peculiar portions in this Act are possibly to offset that.  My concern is totally for the small numbers of people who, for various reasons, find themselves with no income.  Each year &mdash; I will take my own county &mdash; there are one or two massive breakdowns in animal disease, whether due to brucellosis or <Col N="1956" /> TB, and a whole herd is cleared out.  That means that the cattle are sold off at a fraction of their cost, perhaps a quarter or a third of what would otherwise be their marketable cost.  It is very hard to get urban people to appreciate that one can have absolutely no income.  People who are working for a wage may perhaps get sick, but at least there is unemployment benefit or sickness benefit coming in.</P>
      <P>In some farming situations not one brown penny comes in.  I am not saying there are very many.  In my 30 years on Laois County Council up to 1977 we always returned &mdash; if my memory serves me correctly &mdash; a rate collection somewhere in the region of 97 to 98.9 per cent year in, year out.  There were a very small number of hardship cases.  In the collection of rates the team of rate collectors &mdash; we had 18 &mdash; knew every individual family personally in their area and that was common throughout any county. If a rate or portion of it was waived, that was the end of it.  It is too strong to have that put as a mortgage on the holding.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister for Transport offered an extra £30 million to a semi-State company because they did not get a sufficient subsidy for the last three or four years.  Agricultural margins are not only low, but are shrinking.  We are dealing with people who for one reason or another are unable to make a profit.  It could be due to lack of expertise, husbandry, the particular line they are on, a crop failure or the incorrect application of a spray.  Unless one gets up to an optimum yield in tons or gallons one is not making money and there is nothing to fall back on.  A small number of unfortunate people will be caught by this subsection. Every family has its ups and downs but the tradition here has always been charitable in regard to people who meet lean years.  I hope that the Minister will amend this section at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I have not discussed this amendment with Senator Smith but he is asking the Minister if there will be an allowance for serious illness.  I have made no comment today on this Bill, but I want <Col N="1957" /> to make it quite clear that I believe in everybody paying their fair share of tax. There are cases to which this amendment is relevant.  It is all right to talk about bringing in an amendment to this Bill at a later stage when we find that there are cases that should have been dealt with here tonight, but it shakes me that there is now waiver for a farmer with an illness. I agree &mdash; and I rarely agree with Senator Ferris that it could be abused, but it is frightening that we are not making any allowance for serious illness in a farming family.  I say this because it is relevant to the amendment and is partly what Senator Smith is saying.  We have all gone through rough periods in life.  It would be frightening to know that you may not get well and the debts are accruing on the farm and that eventually you might die leaving those debts hanging over the heads of your widow and children.</P>

      <P>I welcome the assurance from the Minister that he will take another look at this, although he did not say when.  I ask him to be a little more explicit and to say if it will be within the next year.  The Minister has already said that this can be postponed from year to year and that perhaps they could mortgage this against their farm.  Some of these farms are already mortgaged and the decision as to whether they sink or swim is very often in the hands of the bank manager, who might well decide that an additional £800 or £900 is too much for the farmer to pay.  However, I repeat that I welcome the Minister's assurance that he will look at this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the first year of operation of the Bill county managers will see the number of people &mdash; hopefully small &mdash; who will come before them and satisfy them and their officials as to their genuine inability to pay.  When the Minister has the numbers from the different counties of the genuine cases who are unable to pay, perhaps he will take a fresh look at it.  The Minister is a very reasonable man who does not want to do anything which will adversely affect any section of the community.  I believe he will come up with something that will satisfy the needs <Col N="1958" /> of all sides of this House and those of the unfortunate people who find themselves unable to pay.  Most farmers want to pay and find it embarrassing if they are unable to do so.  It is very embarrassing to have to say to a rate collector that they are unable to pay and it is merely postponing the evil day of reckoning.</P>

      <P>I am not encouraged by what the Minister said because any legislation should be looked at in a few years to see how it has worked.  I ask the Minister to take an immediate look at this situation.  While I welcome an attempt being made to have farmers like everybody else pay their fair share towards the running of the State, there are cases of hardship in all walks of society and they have been amply outlined here tonight.</P>
      <P>You, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, took the line that I had intended taking, that not only can you have the destruction of crops, or a failure of crops, or failure of a herd, or disease in a herd, or whatever, but you can also have a continuing illness in the family or in the main worker on the farm.  A son or a father and husband could be ill for years.  This mounting burden would not help him to get over his illness.  Indeed, he might have the sympathy of the county manager whose hands are being tied by this section of the Bill.  The Minister said it can be looked at in a couple of years.  I ask him to have an immediate look at it.  If he gave us that assurance we could get on to the mext section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all appreciate the position in which we find ourselves.  The Dáil is in recess. The Bill has gone through the Dáil and we have to get it passed.  We want to ensure that hardship is not caused for the less fortunate in our society who may fall <Col N="1959" /> ill or find themselves in financial difficulty. Even one individual is worth fighting for and it is worth the Minister's while to have a look at the section sympathetically and give this power to the managers. The Minister said there was a waiver of rates under the old rating system in cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that we should call this a waiver.  It is only a postponement of the collection of rates.  It is only a postponement of the normal collection of rates from year to year.  Indeed a person could be sick for five years or even ten years and eventually die and put an added burden on his family which could push them to the point of having to dispose of their property.  I do not think any county manager would want to impose a charge on a family who had been in the area for centuries to the extent that they would have to sell the property.</P>
    <P>It is as serious as that.  There may be only one case as I said.  Others said the numbers may be small.  We do not know how small or how large they will be but that is irrelevant.  We should not place a county manager in the terrible position of having to impose a charge in the knowledge that, by imposing that charge, he was pushing a family out of business and forcing them to dispose of property they may have held for 100 years, or even hundreds of years.  If the Minister can give us an assurance that he will have an immediate look at it, then we can agree to pass on to another section.  I appeal to the Minister to tell us that he will have an immediate look at it and see if he can bring forward some amendment to the legislation in the next Dáil session to give power to the manager to waive the rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt earner with the normal waiver of rates under the old rating system.  In many cases that waiver was not temporary.  It was for all time. The following year's bill would arrive on the manager's desk and, if the hardship was still there, he would judge the case on the information before him.  In many many cases in my own county where there was hardship the manager had power to <Col N="1960" /> waive the rates.  We should give county managers that power in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to what Senator Smith said with conviction. I have a great deal of sympathy for his amendment and his intention to ensure that hardship is avoided.  There is a perception in the urban population that there are no such beings as farmers in financial difficulties or in distress on farms.  That is a perception that neither I nor the Labour Party share.  We are very conscious of the fact that there is extreme financial hardship in large sections of the farming community and, in particular, among small farmers and, because of the markets and the economic situation and, indeed, our own financial situation, among some middle sized farmers as well.</P>
      <P>I am reasonably satisfied that the Minister's commitment to issue specific guidelines to deal with those hardship cases should, in large measure, meet the reservations voiced by Senator Smith.  If they do not, and if we have some hard men or hard women as county or city managers, we may have to come back to this House with an amendment which would protect those people completely.  As the Minister said &mdash; and I think this is a reasonable approach &mdash; you have to see how the legislation works in practice.  I share the concern voiced by Senator Smith, but I accept the Minister's assurance that these people will be protected in so far as he can ensure that they will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my support for the amendment put forward by Senator Smith.  The owner of a farm could be ill for five or ten years.  If this tax had been allowed to roll over for ten years eventually the bill might be as much as the farm was worth.  After the farm was sold there would be nothing left for those who sold it.  We must accept amendments that are fair and reasonable, and we must guard against hardship cases.  It is all very fine for us to say we can have a look at the Act in two or three years' time.  If we decide to look at it in two or three years' time we may find that <Col N="1961" /> a number of anomalies have arisen.  The Minister should accept Senator Smith's amendment in view of the fact that once this Bill leaves this House, the chances of amending legislation coming in the near future are very slim.  The Government may want to put quite an amount of other business through both Houses. Senator Smith's amendment will not hold up the process of commencing the work the Minister wants to do.</P>
      <P>This Bill as proposed is intended to extract more money from the farming population.  We all want to see every section paying their fair share and what they are justly entitled to pay.  In hardship cases may people may be asked to pay what they are not entitled to pay and what they would not have to pay if they were in another sector.  It goes back to what I believe should have been the position. There should have been a threshold fixed for farm tax, a dividing line, above it, tax would be paid on an account system, the same as for other businesses. That is my main objection to the Bill in its entirety.  It is an unfair type of taxation and here is a case where that has been proven.  I honestly believe that the Minister, in his wisdom, and the Government should accept Senator Smith's amendment. Perhaps if both Houses had had more time to debate this Bill, especially the other House, we might have come up with better legislation.  The Minister should accept Senator Smith's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to repeat the reasons why I had to reject this and the consequential amendment and to remind the House what I said at the beginning of this debate.  I said it would not be practical or possible to specify hardship conditions in advance.  The essential factor must surely be that once hardship is claimed an evaluation should be made of the circumstances.  We are being asked to specify hardship in advance and to put it in a Bill.  That just cannot be done.  I am saying that honestly and fairly to the proposer of this amendment.  I have gone some way to meet his difficulty and we will specify categories of difficulties to <Col N="1962" /> the local authorities and ask them to postpone the tax for a year or a number of years &mdash; as long as difficulties continue. I cannot accept the amendment, which asks me to set out a list of hardships and to specify where out tax would be waived entirely.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day Senator Ellis was telling us about the difficulties of a wife who received nothing from her husband. Would it be a hardship if, unfortunately, that poor husband died and she suddenly found herself in possession of the whole farm?  That might be a benefit.  How could I write into the Bill that the death of a farmer would be a hardship for a wife when Senator Ellis has already given an example of where this would not be so? It could be very difficult to write that kind of thing into legislation.</P>
      <P>Senators will recall that under this Bill 200 inspectors are going out to make assessments and that will take some time. I hope the earlier assessments will be made by the middle or the end of this coming year.  I have been requested to bring in something next week, but that would not be of any great benefit because I would not be aware of the problems that would arise as regards hardship until this Bill has been in operation for some time and when we will see what difficulties arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the circumstances mentioned with such great heat and fervour by many Members from both sides of the House will not be a big issue.  If one person is in difficulty his case should receive maximum consideration.  I have agreed that if a family is suffering hardship help will be given immediately, but that does not mean the difficulty will be written off, simply that it can be postponed again and again if necessary.  If it is proven that there is a need for a write-off, then I certainly would not have any hesitation is asking that the Act be amended at that stage.  I hope Senators will accept this as a genuine move to meet their case.  I am asked to list individual cases but I might leave out some case that might result in far greater hardship as time goes on and so that would be an additional problem. <Col N="1963" /> In any event, I cannot accept this amendment for the reasons I have stated.  I have made arrangements for the difficult cases and if the difficulties mentioned here today manifest themselves in the future, I will come back with an amendment at some future date.</P>

      <P>I do not know how much longer we can discuss this amendment, but each time the Minister contributes he comes further down the road to meet us. I am at a loss to know why the Minister and his officials, who seem to be totally unaware of what is happening throughout the farming community could not combine their resources to anticipate the difficulties which might arise, bearing in mind that we bring very comprehensive legislation before this House every year, in particular the Finance Bill, and arrange a complicated set of procedures anticipating difficulties on all fronts.  I regret that the Minister and his officials did not have the ingenuity to anticipate such difficulties and I am sorry that that seems to be the Minister's position in the context of this amendment.</P>
      <P>What I had in mind was that we would have a uniform set of conditions throughout the whole country rather than having power given to the county managers and maybe having a different interpretation of the Act in different areas.  I am prepared to accept the Minister's statement on this, and I want to thank Senators on all sides who have supported this amendment. I am not claiming that I and Members on this side are the only people concerned about individuals in this situation. Many Senators are familiar with the instances I referred to and I will be very anxious to see what the future holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will not be law very long before representations of the kind I am talking about are made.  I will instance one final case which has just been brought to my notice.  A young farmer, with five children, had a heart attack about a year ago.  Yesterday I was informed that his herd had been decimated by brucellosis. That sort of thing keeps happening.  They are only a minority of cases, but there will <Col N="1964" /> be no trade union or farm organisation shouting about the individuals I am referring to.  They have nobody to support them.  There are individuals behind the trauma and the difficulty of family circumstances and I do not want to see them unduly penalised.  I would like to think that any law passed here would have enshrined in it the kind of sympathy we sought in this amendment.</P>

I want to ensure, as a member of a local authority, that as much money as possible would remain with the local authority for use at <Col N="1965" /> their discretion.  I hope the Minister will consider this.  It does not need amendment to the Bill, but it is a matter for ministerial order in the future as to how much money will be retained by the the local authority for their own use and how much would be remitted by them to the Central Fund.  I am asking for a total retention of the amount of farm tax paid by the farmer with 80 adjusted acres and over.</P>

      <P>One of the arguments that have been consistently put forward since the abolition of rates on agricultural land has been that there have not been sufficient funds to repair roads and to attend to local authority schemes of that nature in the way that we should.  I do not want to labour this point, but the Minister is well aware that, in particular, the county road network is crumbling.  I was terribly disappointed when this Bill was introduced to find a statement in tandem with the introduction indicating that for every £1 that would be taken up in land tax, collected and kept by the local authority, they would be reduced £1 of the normal rate relief or grant given by the Exchequer. I am not going to tell the Minister what he should do, but it is clear that if he wants to sell the notion of this tax it is crucial that the benefits from it begin to be seen in some of the neglected areas of local authority activities at present.  To collect this at local authority level and to subtract pound for pound from the Exchequer grant to local authority is a retrograde step.  It may be possible to give the whole grant, but the Minister should indicate that the local authority funds are going to be enhanced in some way by the introduction of this tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have said in this Bill is that the full amount of the rates collected will accrue to the local authorities and there will be an adjustment made, obviously a reduction, in the rates support grant.  That having been said it is a separate issue, not part of this Bill.  What we have said is that the whole tax goes to the local authority but in regard to the rates support grant there <Col N="1966" /> will be an adjustment which will take into account some of the income from the farm tax in adjusting the rates support grant, so that it remains with the county that has collected it to help them to attend to some of the problems that have been mentioned by Senator Smith.  In that way, there will be an obvious benefit to the county.  What I have not put into this Bill is what that amount should be.  It is not part of this Bill.  It is part of the general estimating procedure that takes place within the Department and that will be decided in consultation with Cabinet colleagues.</P>
      <P>It might be wrong if a particularly large amount of tax accruing to one county were allowed to remain with that local authority, while another county would have a very small amount left with the local authority.  If that were the case, the wealthier counties, those with the larger amount of adjusted acreage, with the benefit of the tax would do proportionally far better.  I hope the Senators will see and understand the reasoning behind the methods being used.  If we did not do this and allowed the whole amount of tax to remain with the county collecting it certain counties would be much better off and the poorer counties that collected very little would get very little back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing with the Minister on the basis of the formula used in allocating these funds <i>vis-a-vis</i> the different counties and their different needs. One has to accept that a clear formula has to be worked out on a fair basis throughout the whole country.  What I am concerned about is whether the proportion of the total tax yielded from this source will ensure that the total grants to the local authority from the State, including this one, will be considerably increased from what they are at present, in other words that the lion's share of the tax yield, once the national formula is worked out, will reside with the local authority.  I understood originally that there was a statement from the Government Information Bureau to the effect that when this tax would be introduced it would be raised by the local authorities <Col N="1967" /> and used by the local authorities but account would be taken of the fact in the total grant allocation to local authorities. I understood that to mean that for every pound the local authority would gain from this they would actually lose a pound from the Exchequer grants to them.  I now understand the Minister to say, if not in so many words, that the local authorities can expect, through the implementation of this tax, a fairly sizeable increase in their allocation, bearing in mind the national formula for the individual county needs.</P>

I take this opportunity to tell the Minister that many people who paid rates down through the years did not enjoy much of the services.  What I mean by services is sewerage, water and road schemes.  I am prompted by the councillors in my area to make this appeal to the Minister and I hope he will take note of it.  In recent times the allocation of money for Louth LIS schemes has not been reduced but absolutely cut out altogether and the roads in Louth are as important as the roads in the west or in any other part of the country.</P>

It is my intention to ensure that there will be an incentive to local authorities in that particular matter.  This does not arise on this Bill but it is nevertheless the intention that the incentive will be given to local authorities to collect this money.  That is important to get the work done efficiently.

      <P>In connection with the equalisation of rates about which we have heard for some time past, I am sure the Minister knows the imbalance that exists from county to county.  In my own county the rates are £30 in the pound while in other parts they are in the region of £50 to £80 and less.  Will the Minister take steps to ensure there is an equalisation so that each county may pay their fair share?  We in the west are penalised in regard to what is happening.  It is not fair for a person living in the west and especially in Mayo, to have to pay £30 in the pound while residents in other counties can get away with much lower rates. What the Minister is proposing will militate against us because of the type of land we have in Mayo.  There will not be the same yield from this farm tax as in the case of counties with better land.  It will widen the gap and there will be a greater imbalance when this Bill is implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1969" /> Will the Minister make available a substantial grant-in-aid from the Department of the Environment to help counties like Mayo, Kerry and Donegal who are at a disadvantage as against the midland counties where they have higher valuations and their recoupment values are greater?  There should have been some recognition in this Bill of this fact. It is a serious situation.  We have been penalised for many years.  Many times we have looked for equalisation of rates and it has not happened.  All previous Governments have failed to tackle this problem.  Now that the Minister is bringing in local government reform it would be an opportune time to deal with the matter if it cannot be adjusted in this Bill.</P>

      <P>With regard to local authorities, will the total gathered by the local authorities and submitted to the Minister include the cost of collection, or will the local authorities be allowed to deduct the cost of collection when they are making their submission of collection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not submit the rates collected to me.  They will be holding this money themselves and the cost of collection will fall on the local authority.  That is why I said earlier that an incentive will have to be built in when we are considering in regard to the rates adjustment how much will be allowed for collection, plus an incentive to collect this kind of money in a particular area.  What Senator O'Toole is suggesting does not form part of this Bill.  While I might on the one hand have sympathy with him that we will not be getting the same level of farm tax from his county that we might look forward to in counties like Kildare, Kilkenny and Wexford, on the other hand one must assume that the farmers there will not be levied with that level of tax either.  The equalisation of support for each county is something that does not fall within the preview of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with that. <Col N="1970" /> If there is a great difference in recoupment as between various counties the gap will be widened even further.  The ratepayers in Mayo will be penalised while their counterparts in Meath and in the richer counties will have their rates reduced.  The Minister said that because of our poor land the farmers will not pay and that is so but the ratepayers will suffer.  Counties such as Meath, Tipperary, Wexford and others will be able to recoup more as a result of this farm tax. That will finance the services within those counties and reduce the rate considerably, whereas in Mayo the rates will be higher because the farmers will not be paying as much due to the bad type of land.  The Minister has not said there is going to be any grant-in-aid from the Department of the Environment to remedy this anomaly.</P>

      <P>Ní raibh mé ag éisteacht leis an Aire nuair a dúirt sé to raibh Fianna Fáil ag cuidiú leis an mBille seo.  I was not listening perfectly to the Minister when he said he was getting acceptance from Fianna Fáil that this Bill was going to be a reality.  We are taking him at his word that he intends to stay in office for a little while.  We take our responsibility seriously and since we do not have a majority in either House we are trying to improve the Bill as much as we can, much as we might dislike it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the collection of this money by the local authorities, it is envisaged that this would become the work of the rate collectors who are employed by those local authorities and doing very little work for the past number of years, or is it intended that there would be another means of collection by the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities will have to work out with their staffs how this can best be collected.  They are at present negotiating with rate collectors in some of the counties about the situation and about how their work can be expanded into other areas as revenue collectors. The unions, local authorities and <Col N="1971" /> managers association are considering that.  I am not certain as to the level of success that has been reached in that debate but I would expect that this would be the type of work that rate collectors could do.  On the other hand, it might be possible to set up revenue collectors and offer the redundancy package to the rate collectors.  That would be a new situation and one that is not included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister in many respects but it would possibly have been a good idea to have included a further subsection to section 13 providing that this would be the responsibility of the present rate collectors without their negotiating further charges, which they are doing at the moment, for this collection. The cost of collecting rates in every county at the moment is ridiculous in comparison with the yield.  It may be time the Minister looked at the possibility of rates being collected directly by the local authorities without having tax collectors or rate collectors involved.  The bills could be sent out the same as the water charge bill is sent out at the moment rather than having another tier of administration taken into the scheme which is going to take away further moneys from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The big snag about water charge is that there was a bill sent out and there was no personal contact.  The point was made to me that the same would hold if bills were sent out for the farm tax and nobody called to collect the money.  With the personal touch of somebody reminding the person that there was a bill due there would be much more hope of getting the money in than merely sending out an impersonal letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister for coming in to reply to it.  I am not sure which of the briefs the Minister for State at the Department of Foreign Affairs is holding, whether it is the Agricultural brief or the Justice brief.  However, we will proceed and see if he can elicit some semblance of a response to this motion.</P>
      <P>The orderly development of the co-operative movement in rural Ireland has been a matter of pride to all of us who have an interest in the agricultural sector.  We have had a particular pride in the processing sector and we have always advocated the fullest support for that sector.  The processing sector in the dairying sector is one that assembles and adds value to one of our natural national resources, that is our dairy produce.  In this regard dairy produce, or liquid milk as it is in this instance, is of particular interest.  It is one of our most plentiful supplies and also one of our most rewarding enterprises for those involved in the agricultural sector and because of this milk, particularly in the Munster area from which the Minister and I both come, is of keen interest at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of this plentiful supply co-operatives have invested a lot of space and money in increasing handling and <Col N="1973" /> assembly facilities throughout the country. This development was grant-aided to a large extent by the Department and by the EC which basically is taxpayers money which has been put into the handling facilities in various co-operative movements.  Then suddenly all the rules seemed to have changed.  Producers were confronted for the first time by the super-levy, which was initiated in the European Community and which now effectively precludes efficient milk producers from increasing their milk production.  This has led in recent months to co-ops in the Munster region entering into what is now being called the milk war.  That means that Kerry Co-Op, by coaxing suppliers through various methods which I will deal with in a few moments, have now taken approximately 2,500,000 gallons of milk from the Golden Vale Co-Operative. One can argue that suppliers have a right to sell their produce to the best possible market but this must be done within the law and having regard to the full implications of that action.  One of the implications is the possible consequential loss of employment in the co-op which loses its milk.</P>
    <P>Golden Vale who at present employ about 980 people, have a milk in-take of approximately 90 million gallons per day. They will loose approximately ten employees for each million gallons lost in this war and because of under-utilised and increased capacity in Kerry Co-Op, no corresponding increase in employment is likely to take place in that creamery. Perhaps there might be an additional few members who would be employed in the collection process but there will be no corresponding increase to compensate for the loss in the Golden Vale area.  Because of that members of my party and, indeed, members of the trade union movement are extremely concerned that some order will have to be put into this area and into the supply of milk to various co-operatives.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Minister for Agriculture stated publicly recently that he is considering extending the period of notice by suppliers of their <Col N="1974" /> intention to change from one co-operative to another.  The Minister mentioned a possible extension of such notice from three to 12 months, which I welcome. The Labour Party Agricultural Committee, of which I am a member, also welcomes this.  In the interim period we are concerned &mdash; in order to prevent loss of employment &mdash; that the present purchase of milk on a flat or volume basis be investigated.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what brief the Minister of State holds but I contend that the present purchase by Kerry Co-operative of milk from suppliers to the Golden Vale is on a volume basis and that under the Food and Drugs Act it is said to be illegal to sell milk to creameries or liquid milk outlets unless it has been butter fat tested and have not less than a 3 per cent butter fat content.  If my information is correct the purchase by Kerry Co-operative of milk from any supplier and the sale to Kerry Co-operative by suppliers on a flat rate basis, would be contrary to the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to state if he is aware that that type of purchase is taking place, if he is aware whether Kerry Co-operative are testing such milk for butter fat content at its source of purchase and, if not, what steps he intends taking to ensure that suppliers and purchasers comply with the relevant section of the Act, that is if my information is correct.</P>
    <P>I would request the Minister to ask An Foras Talúntais to carry out a full survey of the employment and other consequences on the milk industry as a whole of this type of milk poaching.  Perhaps a pilot study should be undertaken by An Foras Talúntais, particularly in the Munster region with which the Minister and I are familiar.  It is a matter which has been of concern to all of us.  We accept the principle that suppliers should be able to choose the best possible market.  But suppliers will realise that, if they do not have regard to the overall consequences of their actions, efficient creameries, like Golden Vale, could be forced to rationalise their enterprise, to lay off workers in a particular region which would not necessarily be compensated for in <Col N="1975" /> another.  Indeed that could lead to a monopoly situation in the milk assembly industry which would not be in the best overall interests of suppliers, farmers and producers.  I have no axe to grind with any particular co-operative enterprise.  But if there is not some sense of order brought into this situation the strongest will be seen to have survived and the weakest suffered.  From an employment point of view the consequences would be extremely worrying to those of us endeavouring to ensure a spread of employment throughout the region.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State to take my suggestions into account, to advise me if the Food and Drugs Act does specify that testing must be carried out and to consider the request that An Foras Taluntais be asked to undertake a scientific study of the implications of what is taking place in this area.  Because of the implementation of the super-levy the larger co-operatives, with extensive space available, are now entering a cutthroat situation in which the fittest will survive and, if the weakest suffer, that will mean that all of us will suffer likewise. This would be catastrophic for this sector of the industry which we are all committed to seeing develop further. Such development would suffer also as a result of this type of milk war going on, with farmers, for short term gain to themselves, cutting off their noses to spite their faces.  The Ministers for Justice and Agriculture have a responsibility in this area.  In replying the Minister of State might indicate whether my information is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the concern of Senator Ferris.  The governing Act is the 1924 Dairy Produce Act.  Under that act an order entitled the Milk and Cream (Calculation of Price) Order 1928, was made under the terms of which order all milk and cream bought by creameries must be paid for on the basis of the percentage of butter fat contained in the milk or cream. The Minister for Agriculture is aware, <Col N="1976" /> however, that four or five co-operatives are at present paying for milk in a way which is designed to get round this legal provision.  Only one of these co-operatives is situated in the Golden Vale area with the others being located in Leinster, the north west and east Munster.  Irrespective of where they are located the Minister deplores the fact that any co-operative would adopt this method of payment as apart from being contrary to the law, flat rate systems of payment could do substantial long term damage to the dairy industry whereas payment on a compositional basis is clearly in the interests of the industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister's problem is that, as indicated, the legislation in this matter &mdash; the 1924 Dairy Produce Act &mdash; is nearly 60 years old and the penalties provided for breaches of the provision are a mere £20 and therefore completely inadequate to deter offenders in this area.  The Minister has recognised for some time that all of the domestic dairying legislation is badly in need of revision to take account of the various changes which have taken place in the dairy industry over the past 60 years.  He has set up a special group in the Department to consider the changes required to update this legislation and considerable progress has been made in the matter.  A memorandum will shortly be circulated to the industry outlining the various legal amendments proposed and seeking their views.  It is envisaged that the ensuing consultation process will be completed by early autumn following which a new Bill will be drafted as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the principal issues to be decided in the revised legislation will be the basis for the payment of milk.  The options are to leave it to each co-operative's suppliers to decide how they wish to be paid or to lay down provisions for payment on the basis of composition.  The Minister wishes to emphasise that whatever provisions are laid down will be backed up by effective legal penalties. Therefore co-operatives who have changed over or are thinking of changing to a flat rate payment basis should be aware that provisions can be made in the new <Col N="1977" /> legislation which would completely outlaw this practice.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes these co-operatives to know also that while the new legislation may not be enacted for a further eight to nine months, this does not rule out the possibility of action being taken against them in the interim.  Indeed the Minister is now setting in motion arrangements which could result in those co-ops who are in breach of the present law being prosecuted and brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>Furthermore in regulations to be made very shortly in order to provide formally for the implementation of the super-levy system, the Minister will be making provisions compelling all milk purchasers to test for butter fat and to make available the results of these tests to the suppliers concerned as well as to Department officials.  While this is designed to meet the legal requirements of the super-levy regulations, it will also bring more transparency into the arrangements for supply of and payment for milk.</P>
    <P>Finally, this is, of course, a matter primarily for farmers themselves.  The present legal provisions were designed to protect their interests at a time when they were less well organised than they are <Col N="1978" /> now and when the dairy industry was very much less developed than it is at present. The industry and the farming community are now highly organised.  It is clear that consistent arrangements for milk testing and payment are in the long term interests of all.  Irrespective of the legal position milk suppliers themselves can and should insist on such arrangements being provided.  As I said, however, the Minister will in any event be moving on the legal position.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris raised two other matters. I understand from the Minister that a change in the transfer arrangement is proposed and should be in operation very shortly.  The other matter raised by Senator Ferris referred to a possible survey by An Foras Taluntais.  I believe from my instructions from the Department that they do have all the necessary information to enable them to act.  In that circumstance having a further survey might not add anything to the situation in that it might only cause further delay.  The Minister intends to proceed as I have outlined in my earlier remarks.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 July 1985.</P>
