      <P>Senators will be glad to see the work by the Office of Public Works on the repair of the ceiling of the Chamber is underway, so there will, of course, be some temporary inconvenience for Members which is unavoidable. The platform above our heads is, I know, unsightly but efforts will be made to improve its appearance.</P>

      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Lynch that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urgent need for the Minister for the Environment to consider the <Col N="2" /> proposal for Stage 2 of the Kells-Old-castle water scheme.</P>
    <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 10 p.m. to 10.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, in that order.  I might indicate that the introduction and circulation of the Private Members' Bill under No. 1 will not be opposed.  I might also foreshadow that if No. 2 is agreed to in respect of the debate on agricultural aid being extended to five hours, the proposition would be that time be taken from <Col N="3" /> 7 o'clock to 10 o'clock tonight and from 10.30 a.m. until 12.30 p.m. tomorrow.</P>

      <P>On the last day before the recess the Leader of the House gave his word that No. 32 would be taken first today.  I also understood that No. 10 was to be taken today.  What is the situation with regard to the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1985?  Is it now being withdrawn from this House or what is the House doing with it?</P>

      <P>I understand it is the intention of the House to sit tomorrow, specifically, I gather, to discuss No. 6. Could the Leader of the House give us any indication of the timetable of the Government on the debate of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and how long he intends this to sit in this House? Have we a timetable for finishing this, for it to go to the Dáil?  The issues of divorce and of marriage breakdown are in serious danger of losing impetus unless we show some sense of urgency in the House of pushing this through.</P>

      <P>I would join with Senator Ross in questioning the time to be given to No. 6 on the Order Paper and I hope this will be dealt with tomorrow and as quickly as possible.  In addition, I gave notice to the Cathaoirleach that I wished to raise a matter on the Adjournment. I left it into the office before 11.45 a.m. today and I wonder what has happened to that.  It was a matter with regard to the education of a profoundly deaf child.  It would suit me perfectly well to have it on the Adjournment tomorrow, a Chathaoirligh, if that is wished.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, may I refer to Bills in Progress on page 186 of the Order Paper?  The Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983, Committee Stage has been set for 6 November 1985.  I thought the Leader of the House and I both understood that that was to enable sufficient time to elapse in order that the Government would be able to publish their own proposals on this issue.  I distinctly recall the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment speaking here on this issue, assuring us that the Bill would be published within days.  Approximately 90 days have passed since the Minister of State spoke.  We now have a new definition of &ldquo;within days&rdquo;.  Possibly it could be 180 days.  Does the Leader of the House have any information on this? There have been suggestions that there are disagreements at Cabinet level about it.  I would like to know what these terms may be taken to mean &mdash; days or years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised.  First in response to Senator Cassidy on item No. 32, I did understand at the time we discussed this last that it was a matter of urgency and of getting a nomination in for this year's prize but since, I understand, that it would be a matter for next year and I understood that there was a degree of all party agreement.  I thought it had now <Col N="5" /> been overtaken by events, but certainly if the House wishes to discuss it, we can arrange to discuss it at an early date.  I apologise if I did mislead the House in regard to the matter.  We could discuss this among the Whips.</P>
      <P>In regard to item No. 6, I did indicate that it was proposed on item No. 5 to complete the debate by 12.30 p.m. tomorrow, and to devote tomorrow afternoon to a further discussion of item No. 6.  The question of when the debate in the Seanad would conclude is a matter for Senators and not for the Leader of the House.</P>
      <P>In regard to item No. 34, in reply to Senator Brendan Ryan, all I can say is that I do not know of any disagreements in Cabinet in regard to the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983.  If I did I would be unlikely to announce them to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that I have repeatedly indicated the desire of the Seanad that this Bill should be published in order to allow the Seanad to compare the Bill with the Private Members' Bill and the Seanad to then do what it wished.  My latest representation was made this morning.  The date fixed for the Committee Stage of the Bill was 6 November in order to allow the Government to publish the Bill.  I am not going to be so foolish as to talk about days or weeks, or anything like that.  My information is that the Government Bill will be published before 6 November.  I may have fallen into the trap that numberous Ministers of State have fallen into&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if there is a misunderstanding which I would like to clear up for Senator Cassidy.  He said he understood that the Bill was coming in today.  The Bill may well have been ordered for today, but the ordering of Second Stage for a particular day means that the Bill cannot be taken before that day.  It is not an agreement by the House to take the Bill on that day.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Aid Motion: Allocation of Time.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That notwithstanding Standing Order 41 the following arrangements shall apply in the debate on the motion relating to agricultural aid and on any amendments thereto:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="8" /> (a) the time allowed for the debate on the motion shall not exceed 5 hours;</P>
    <P>(b) the speech of the Senator proposing the motion shall not exceed 35 minutes:</P>
    <P>(c) the speech of a Senator proposing an amendment shall not exceed 30 minutes;</P>
    <P>(d) the speech of each other Senator called on (other than the final speakers) shall not exceed 25 minutes;</P>
    <P>(e) the debate shall conclude with a final speaker being called from each side of the House in the order of (i) non-Government and (ii) Government, the speech in each case not to exceed 30 minutes.</P>
    <P>This is a motion that has been put down after discussions with representatives of the other groups.  It is, in fact, concerned with the allocation of time.  Usually allocation of time motions are concerned with limitation of time.  This is concerned with the extension of time.  This debate on a Private Members' motion, which would normally take about three hours, is now being extended to five.  In the motion as put down here it is suggested under paragraph (d) that there should also be an extension in regard to the time of individual speeches by Senators from 15 to 25 minutes.  Since the motion has been put down, the point has been raised by Senators that a large number of Senators wish to participate in this debate and that if we did keep a limit of five hours, and 25 minutes per speech, this would restrict the number of Senators.  Accordingly, in moving this motion I would ask the permission of the House to amend it in respect of paragraph (d) by reverting to the normal 15 minutes, so that we would have a larger number of 15 minute speeches rather than a smaller number of 25 minute speeches.  With that amendment, I propose No. 2.</P>

      <P>Before we proceed with the amendments, I would like to remind Senators that the proposers of an amendment may close the debate on the amendment but no other Senator may speak more than once on each amendment.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 47 to 49, to delete &ldquo;with the consent of or at the request of the appropriate member of the Government,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would like to say, first of all, that those of us who put down amendments to this Bill on various Stages are very grateful for the non-political and receptive way in which they have been taken by the Government.  It is in this spirit that I put down these two amendments.</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 1 is, as has been the trend and the emphasis in speeches throughout the Bill, to give the Director more access to the files and the records of various Departments than he had been given in the original Bill.  I see no reason why the examination of departmental records should be done with the consent or at the request of a Minister.  The initiative in this should come from the Director himself and not from the Department or from the Minister. This Bill has had the goodwill of Ministers and Departments and I do not doubt that goodwill from the present Government and from those who framed this Bill.</P>
      <P>We have to realise that this Bill will be on the Statute Book for many, many years unamended.  We have not had a record of many Archives Bills.  What happens if there is a Minister in charge who does not have the sort of goodwill that we have at the moment?  He would be able in that case to obstruct the access of a director to these departmental records whenever he wanted to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> There is an implication &mdash; and I do not believe it is deliberate &mdash; in this clause in the Bill that the Director in some way is not trustworthy, that he cannot look at departmental records without being vetted in some way by a Minister.  The appointment of the Director is in the power of the Government and it is inconceivable that the Government could appoint someone who is suspect in this way.  It is against the attitude of the Bill, and against the spirit of the Bill.  Our amendment is a perfectly good compromise, to give the Taoiseach the power for a good reason, for certain categories, to bar the Director from seeing various records which are in the hands of the State. He would have to have good reasons and we would be talking about the security of the State and the interests of the State. Even then, according to my amendment, it would be subject to the Taoiseach's bar, but the Director could see the records with the consent of the Department concerned.  I believe this is a more satisfactory amendment.  It gives the safeguards to the Government in cases of national security or the interests of the public, but it does not mean that the Director is in the same position as a member of the public or as some tradesman coming to the door.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Ross's amendment to this clause of the Bill.  I feel very strongly, as he does, that the consent of an appropriate member of the Government, or at his request, is an unnecessary part of the Bill.  If we appoint a director in this situation, we appoint someone whom we can trust and the Director is someone whose priority is the national archives.  However well intentioned Ministers of the Government may be, their priority is the running of their Department.  Perhaps their priority may also be the preservation of ministerial reputation, or matters of that nature, but their priority is not the national archives.  I suggest that the Director is a person properly appointed by the Government who has this priority and there is no need to include that he requires the consent or <Col N="11" /> request of an appropriate member of the Government before inspection of these arrangements for preservation.  I would suggest he should be left a free hand and trusted in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this amendment. It is precisely the same thing we talked about on Committee Stage.  It is quite conceivable that there would be masses of departmental records and quite junior civil servants would have access to them, but the Director of the National Archives would need the consent of the Minister in question to have access to the same records.</P>
      <P>We have all listened and discussed this matter, as Senator Ross said, in a very non-political and non-partisan fashion.  I cannot help thinking that somewhere in the minds of those who drafted the Bill, as distinct from the Taoiseach himself whose interest in this is better known and indeed far more extensive than my own, there was an attempt to provide for the possibility that somebody might not want something to be seen for a period of time. If one cannot trust somebody with the status of the Director of the National Archives to do these things in a responsible way, responsive to the concerns and feelings of various people, then one is really to some extent undermining the whole concept of independent national archives.</P>
      <P>The amendment Senator Ross has proposed gives the appropriate status and trust to the Director and, at the same time, enables the Taoiseach of the day to ensure that, where there are serious matters which should be withheld even from the Director of the National Archives, that can be done on the authority of the Taoiseach who has the appropriate status and authority to insist that something should not be inspected by the Director.  Anything else undermines the status of the Director of the National Archives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable sympathy for the purpose of this amendment and, indeed, for the explanation <Col N="12" /> offered for it by the proposer and seconder. There is no doubt that the amendments which the Taoiseach introduced on behalf of the Government on Committee Stage have substantially improved the role and functions of the Director in this regard, because the Director does have unimpeded access for the purpose of inspecting and examining the arrangements for the preservation of departmental records.  That is very important and it is a very constructive step.</P>
      <P>Where the Taoiseach drew back or refused to accept an amendment on Committee Stage was to the same effect as this amendment, that there should be some qualification on the power of a Department to refuse consent.  That is legitimate.  That is reasonable because at present there is not any check or control on a refusal of consent by a Department. A Department could refuse for a variety of reasons.  Clearly, there could well be reasons why it might not be felt appropriate that the Director would have access to certain departmental records.  We are talking about recent departmental records, not necessarily historical documents. It could be that there were reasons of security that would be reasonable in the circumstances.  But at the moment in the Bill as it stands, there is no control over the Department.  Practice could vary very substantially from Department to Department or from Administration to Administration.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Taoiseach expressly made the point that he would be favourable to allowing access to departmental records, but that may not be the position in the case of a future Taoiseach and that is not a good basis on which to legislate.  We have to legislate in structural terms for the future.  I agree with Senator Ross.  We are unlikely to see any further legislation in this area in any reasonable timespan because pressure of other business and other priorities will predominate.  Therefore, we must make sure that this Bill represents the best possible model.  I favour this amendment and I await the response of the Taoiseach to debate on these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> In the event of the Taoiseach not being prepared to accept the amendment, then one other possible control which is a much less satisfactory one would be a requirement that when the Director reports annually, as he is required to do by section 21 of the Bill, and the Taoiseach is required to lay his reports before both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Director should specify what Departments have refused consent for what records and for what reasons.  In other words, the report of the Director should deal fully with the reasons for a refusal of consent.  At least that would mean there would be a greater public knowledge of what was happening in Departments.  At present I would consider the amendments as reasonable and an improvement on the text of the Bill at the moment, or alternatively that another control mechanism be introduced, or at the very least that the Director be required to state expressly where a Department have refused consent to allow the Director to have access to departmental records.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter we are discussing relates to a particular function of the Director &mdash; a function which is, in fact, not part of the control, management, preservation, administration and so on of the national archives: it is related to this function concerning material which is not in the National Archives but which is still in the control of Government Departments for a 30 year period but where it is important that his specialised knowledge and his very particular concern for the preservation of records should be allowed to play a role in ensuring that they are properly preserved.  That is the limited area we are talking about and I am not sure that it was totally clear to everybody listening to the debate.  The <Col N="14" /> question is, apart from his role as Director of the National Archives what function should he have to make sure that material not in the archives is preserved and nobody is letting the mice get at it. Indeed that was an experience I had early on in my married life when I was picking out some records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that many papers are kept in houses and offices under unsatisfactory conditions.  I can recall having access many years ago &mdash; and I stress &ldquo;many years ago&rdquo; and cast no reflection on the present management of the institution &mdash; to material in the National Library which was kept in stacks.  I was very taken aback at that time, about 30 years ago, at the way the material was left lying around and the condition it was in.  All of us must be concerned that material is preserved properly.  It is that function of the Director that we are talking about here, in relation to papers that are held by Departments and are not in the National Archives.  The question is, how should that best be done?  He must be able to inspect and examine the arrangements for the preservation of records to see how they are kept; to see what containers they are in.  Are they properly preserved?  Are they in damp conditions? Are they untidily kept?  Is there anything about the way they are kept which would be likely, in his view, to impair the availability of these as archives when the 30 year period is up?  That limited question is what we are talking about.  The amendment would broaden this in a quite extraordinary way and it would change the whole character of his office to give him the right to inspect any and all papers currently in use, or any papers within the last 30 years, unless the Taoiseach personally determines that these specific records, or that category of records, are not to be available for his inspection. That seems to reverse the process around him in a way that would be extremely cumbersome.  As things stand at present if he is dissatisfied with what he sees of the way records are preserved he can ask the Minister concerned to inspect them further.  That Minister would not, I would hope, unreasonably withhold consent.  At <Col N="15" /> that point his attention would be directed to specific records so that he could then determine, in relation to them, with reasonable facility, whether it was an issue of public security or not and if there was no issue of public security he would allow the Director to examine the records more closely than the kind of general inspection which might have revealed possible defects requiring closer inspection. That is the procedure that I envisage. What is proposed would involve something enormously complex.  It would involve the Taoiseach in determining forthwith in respect of all records everywhere in the public service, which files or categories of files it would be against the public interest to disclose.</P>
    <P>We could think of tax records alone. There is an absolute guarantee to people by inspectors of tax records that nobody will see them except the Revenue authorities dealing with them.  That is a well defined category.  You would really have to examine all records immediately in the entire public sector and decide which ones will not be allowed to be destroyed. That simply is not practicable.  It is totally unrealistic.  What is realistic is that the Director should inspect and examine the arrangements.  If he is not satisfied with what he sees, and feels he needs to look at files more closely there is a possibility he might see what is in them.  He can apply to the Minister in that respect.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson made a point which I will make in a very different form.  If he gets a response from the Minister which is dismissive and which gives him no good reason for being refused access I would hope that he would put in his report to the Taoiseach which will be laid before both Houses, that he examined the records in such and such Department, he was not satisfied with the inspection he was allowed, that he requested the Minister for permission to examine them more closely and the Minister did not allow him to do so and did not even purport to suggest that the records involved public security or the public interest.  If there is the possibility for him to put that in his <Col N="16" /> report the Minister would be slow to walk himself into that.  The remedy is there.</P>
    <P>The remedy proposed in the amendment is so extreme that it would make the entire system unworkable.  It will be difficult enough in a period of two years to transfer all the records for the period from 1922 to 1955 and in that period to examine them to extract the small minority of aspects which involve the public interest under the other relative sections of the Bill and to complete the process of handing over the rest.  The Taoiseach would have to be responsible for examining every piece of paper everywhere, every category of records everywhere in the public service, with a view to determining which ones the Director will not be allowed to inspect, when there is a perfectly straightforward mechanism here with a procedure which will ensure nobody will unreasonably withhold consent.</P>
    <P>Any Minister who did not give consent and was not able to say that there was a matter of public interest or security of State involved would find himself indicted in a report put before the Dáil or Seanad.  It would be walking into trouble for some Minister to withhold consent in such circumstances.  The existing provisions, plus the provision that the Director shall make a report to the Taoiseach, who shall put it before the Dáil and Seanad, cover the particular problem.  In most cases, I would hope, the inspection arrangements will show the Director that the system is adequate, and in any case when he looked at it more closely that permission will be given unless there is a specific issue in regard to those records of public security and public interest.  I am sure this will work quite smoothly, and if it does not the Director in his report can take the necessary steps and he has the public encouragement of the Taoiseach in this debate to do so.</P>

      <P>I fully understand the Taoiseach's point on the large volume of work that might be involved in this, but I still believe that it is an unnecessary restriction on the initiative of a man who is being appointed to look after the archives.  I <Col N="17" /> see the Taoiseach's point fully about Ministers being reasonable, but I do not agree that that is necessarily the case because the Taoiseach said here today that he hoped Ministers would not unreasonably refuse this sort of access.  I do not share his optimism on this issue because I can think of certain cases where Ministers would not mind very much what was said in the report from the Director at the end of the year but would refuse and could be obstructionist.  This section gives to a Minister a blanket power to refuse access to the Director in any case.  The Taoiseach says that in the case of conflict the Director can produce a report to the Oireachtas saying what the conflict is about.  The purpose of this amendment is specifically to avoid that sort of conflict, not to allow it to happen.</P>

I do not accept that construction, but I propose to amend the <Col N="18" /> section by inserting in it a specific reference in section 19 (3) and (4) which provide for the making of regulations by the Minister for the Public Service to deal with such matters as the copying of records with a view to disposal of originals. The House will know that under the provisions of these subsections any destruction of original records in the course of microfilming or other copying processes will be subject to the approval of the Director.

      <P>I accept the reason behind the amendment but I should like to raise a technical point.  The wording of the amendment may be slightly awkward because the section is being made subject to the regulations laid down in the two subsections of section 19.  That requires that regulations be enacted.  If they are not, what is the proper construction of section 7 (1)?  Obviously, the intention is that the regulations will be enacted, but section 19 does not provide that they will be because subsection (3) merely states that the Minister for the Public Service, after consultation with the Director, may make regulations.  &ldquo;May&rdquo; quite often means &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in such circumstances, and provide the subsections mean &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in this instance there will be no problem, provided the Minister will do it rapidly.</P>

      <P>Even without advice it seems to me that here we are making sure that the requirements about destruction of records will be applied properly. Though the amendment refers to the subsection in section 19, it does not refer to regulations made under them &mdash; if there are no regulations the whole clause falls. Therefore, if regulations are made under the subsections, then what follows will be governed by such regulations.  In that case the provisions of the amendment will stand on their own.</P>

    <P>This amendment was dealt with on Committee Stage.  The Taoiseach said then that he would give it some consideration and that it could be discussed on Report Stage.  The point is similar to that in amendment Nos. 1 and 2, dealing with the preservation and destruction of copies and originals.  The Director should have at least a consultant role in regard to the destruction of documents.  I can foresee an argument that it would be unfair for the Director to go through every copy of every document.  That is not the intention of the amendment.  The intention is that when there may be a conflict in regard to the preservation or destruction of a copy the Director should decide what should be kept and what should not.  This is simply because the Director, presumably, will be a person who is well versed, an expert, in the field of archives.  He should be the person to make decisions.  We should also consider the point of what is a copy and what is not.  In that case, too, the Director should be given the power and the discretion to decide what should be retained and destroyed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying point here seems to me to be a doubt in the Senator's mind as to what exactly is a copy.  Obviously, if a document is simply copied and nothing else has been written on it there is no point in keeping endless copies.  Anybody with experience of Government files knows that a large part of the bulk of a file is numerous copies of the same document, usually unimportant. It would impose an impossible task on the Director if he had to examine every piece of paper, whether a copy or not.  If anything has been written on a copy document which adds to it in any way, or alters it, then it is not a copy but a fresh document.  The Senator's concern is also mine in this respect.  In a file one might have the original and a copy and <Col N="20" /> on the copy one may have written something or even used the copy for redrafting purposes, or may have written a note of some importance.  I am satisfied that if anything is written on a copy it ceases to be a copy and becomes an original document.  It is only when a copy is a pure copy with nothing on it at all, a carbon copy of something, that destruction will be permitted.  In cases like that there is no point in the Director examining them.  It is the normal process to weed them out of the file before handing them over.</P>
      <P>The process of controlling the file while it is in use would normally be one in which at a certain time a person may say, &ldquo;I will take out these copies because these are pure copies and do nothing else but clutter up the file&rdquo;.  In those circumstances that is all that is involved.  The amendment is not necessary and I do not think the consent of the Director would be appropriate.  If there is any doubt what was meant by a copy I would see the point and would be concerned about it.</P>

One which springs to my mind was a document not exactly relevant in this context. What would have happened to the delightful little poem about Pangur Bán in <i>The Irish Student and His Cat?</i> If a document like that had been considered a copy and was worthy of destruction we would not have the delight of that lovely little piece.

      <P>In page 8, line 42, to delete &ldquo;be contrary to&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;seriously damage&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have had an interesting discussion on this.  I was confused on Committee Stage when I took offence quite unnecessarily at something the Taoiseach said.  I raised the question and proposed an amendment which would have deleted the paragraph in subsection (1).  The Taoiseach legitimately suggested that it would be far too sweeping an amendment.  I should like to refer the Taoiseach to what he said on that occasion.  He said he had certain sympathy with my point.  I refer to column 1406 of the Official Report of 3 July 1985.  On the term &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; and the suggestion that it is an extremely weak and generalised term, The Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to confess to a certain sympathy with what has been said.  I am very uncertain as to how I might meet the points made.  There is no doubt that there can be an all too ready inclination to use public interest to cover a multitude of sins of omission or commission.  I suppose there must be <Col N="24" /> some temptation when documents are to be published which may reveal some act of incompetence or unwisdom on the part of an official or of a Government 30 years earlier not to publish them.  Given the continuity of the Government system and the party system I suppose you could envisage a document being published in 1985 or 1988 about something that happened in 1958.  The Government might be embarrassed about having it published even 30 years later.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was enormously in sympathy with those of us who felt that the expression &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; was less than a happy choice of phrase.  Senators Higgins and McGuinness supported the view for different but related reasons.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that instead of deleting the entire reference to &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; some form of words other than &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; should be substituted, and I suggested &ldquo;seriously threaten&rdquo; or &ldquo;seriously endanger&rdquo; and I have finally come to &ldquo;seriously damage&rdquo;. The Taoiseach very kindly responded and said that was a very constructive suggestion and that he would look at it.  It is a matter of great regret to me that there is no amendment proposed by the Taoiseach on this and therefore I have no option but to produce my own reasonable amendment.  There is no doubt that the same instinct that all of us have to avoid embarrassment and to minimise trouble for ourselves will give rise to a fairly generous interpretation of what is contrary to the public interest.  I have no doubt that what is defined as contrary to public interest is what the public will have the greatest interest in.  Therefore, as a minor improvement to this Bill and as a minor improvement to a whole concept &mdash; I find it very difficult to accept the idea of the public interest being defined by people other than the public &mdash; I suggest a stronger form of words.  I have suggested to substitute &ldquo;seriously damage the public interest&rdquo; for &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; because &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; is undefinable.  There <Col N="25" /> would have to be evidence that publication of something would seriously damage the public interest before these virtually unlimited powers of withholding documents could be invoked.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined the point made by the Senator in the earlier debate which is a matter of concern to me.  For reasons which I will give I have not gone along the road he has.  I have attempted to tackle it by a somewhat different route.  The problem about his suggestion is that basically the issue that must be determined is what is the public interest.  Even with the Senator's amendment we must establish that before we get to the question of whether it is contrary to or seriously threatening.  That is where the difficulty lies.  Once it is identified, then under the existing wording it is a question simply of whether the release of certain records would be contrary to that interest.  If the amendment were accepted it would be necessary to identify the public interest which is the real problem. Then with the further complication of trying to establish an undefined degree to which the public interest would be threatened you would get into an area of value judgments.  There is merit in trying to keep it as far as possible in an objective area where you are trying objectively to determine the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I do not think that the amendment would help in practice.  The real difficulty is that it is simply not possible to anticipate instances arising or every specific ground where the retention of records would be genuinely required in the public interest.  Nonetheless, having heard the debate the last day, I came to the conclusion that perhaps I had been directing my concern too exclusively against the possibility of material being withheld for political reasons, and the debate highlighted the possibility that records would also be held back by administrators for administrative rather than political reasons.  It seems that there is a possibility in a marginal case that an <Col N="26" /> administrator might feel that publication of certain records would be undesirable in what he would think would be the public interest and yet his judgment might not be totally objective if he felt the reputation of his Department or even a colleague in the Civil Service might in some way be affected.</P>
    <P>The problem is to get a balance between these two and I was orientating myself particularly towards the danger of suppression for political reasons.  I have introduced &mdash; I am anticipating but I feel it is relevant to mention it and I will come to it in a moment &mdash; the new section 11 under which in any case where an administrator certifies that something is in the public interest that decision can be overruled by the Taoiseach.  It gives no fresh power politically to a politician to withhold publication, but it gives to the Leader of the Government the power to overrule an administrative decision which might have been unduly cautious.  The introduction of that amendment is designed to deal as far as possible with this problem without getting into the rather subjective area of having to determine what seriously damages the public interest which in some ways could distract attention from a proper consideration of the public interest itself.  Therefore, I have decided to leave the wording &ldquo;be contrary to&rdquo; but to include this new section 11 which we will be coming to in a few minutes.</P>

      <P>I am very interested in the Taoiseach's contribution on this amendment and his reference to the amendment which he proposes to move which will give the Taoiseach power to override and to make available for public inspection departmental archives which are over 30 years old.  It does not, however, bring us any further on to what constitutes the public interest here and it is important in this debate that we do that.  It seems important that we affirm first of all that it is in the public interest that these records be available after 30 years.  That is the first thing.  You have got a positive view of what is in the public interest and it is in the public interest that <Col N="27" /> there be access.  In that case there would have to be some very strong reason indeed to change that around completely and have it &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; or &ldquo;seriously damaging to the public interest&rdquo; which is the wording Senator Ryan would prefer to see inserted here. It would have to be seriously damaging to the public interest in order to be excluded from public access and to displace the initial view, purpose and intention of this Bill and of the Oireachtas that it is in the public interest that there be access and that there be public inspections, because of the values inherent in that and the necessity that we have access to records, learn from them, be enriched by them. They are part of the resource of the nation.  It may be important that the thrust of the Bill affirms that the public interest requires access and therefore, if something is to be prevented on the grounds that it would be contrary to the public interest it could be done only if it seriously damaged or seriously endangered the public interest in some way, and that presumably would have to be established.  The debate on this amendment may bring out this point.  I agree with the concern expressed by Senator Ryan and the Taoiseach and I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach's amendment on this point will be moved.</P>

      <P>The main thrust of this Bill is to show that it is in the public interest that these documents be made available after 30 years.  A phrase such as &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; is a rather weak phrase which is open to wide interpretation by administrators or whoever happens to be in charge of these records so as to avoid the publication of some record which may not be contrary to the public interest but contrary to the interest of the administration or the administrator personally or whoever he happens to be working with.  To accept the amendment as it is to show that in order to prevent the documents from being available they must seriously endanger or damage the public interest will not damage the situation in the least. <Col N="28" /> That phrase would be open to a reasonable interpretation that it must be shown that something serious is involved and not just a matter of reasonable administrative convenience.  Those of us who spoke on Committee Stage emphasised that a phrase like &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; is so amenable to interpretation that suits whoever is saying it, that it is not strong enough.  If the person involved had to show that it was a serious matter and that it seriously damaged or endangered the public interest he would hesitate before suppressing documents under this kind of clause.</P>

      <P>People like me sitting on the back benches in eternal opposition as independent Senators assume that when parliamentary draftsmen draft a phrase like &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; the expression &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; is clearly understood and defined and that, therefore, it should not be the job of somebody like me to define it in legislation.  Therefore, I must assume that the term &ldquo;the public interest&rdquo; when it is used in legislation has a precise meaning.  There is no point in the Taoiseach saying that the real problem is the definition of &ldquo;the public interest&rdquo;.  If that is the problem, his draftsman and he should have found an alternative wording which was more explicit and did not leave a phrase like this open to apparently a wide variety of interpretations.  The possibility of wide interpretations of the public interest is the reason I proposed to have this section removed on Committee Stage because it is far too sweeping, but in order to be reasonable I felt we should leave the concept of the public interest to be defined, as the Taoiseach said, by the circumstances of the day.  As Senator Robinson quite rightly said those who are to take a decision that something generally was in the public interest to be released should not be released should have to weigh their thoughts more carefully than simply considering a word like &ldquo;contrary&rdquo; which, like any other word in the English language, is open to subjective interpretation just as much as &ldquo;seriously damage&rdquo;, &ldquo;seriously endanger&rdquo; or &ldquo;seriously threaten&rdquo;. <Col N="29" /> Heavier emphasis must be placed on the fact that it should be only under exceptional circumstances and not for administrative convenience or for the long list of reasons we went through on Committee Stage concerning political or administrative sensitivity.  We must bear in mind that it is quite conceivable that some of the documents that might be withheld could well be documents in which an officer of a Department had an interest or input when he was a junior civil servant 30 years previously.  Therefore, in order to emphasise what Senator Robinson quite rightly underlined, that generally the public interest is met by documents being disclosed, the wording used where exceptions are to be made should be sufficiently strong.  &ldquo;Contrary&rdquo; is a word which is so weak as to leave enormous room for interpretation.  It is as subjective as &ldquo;seriously endanger&rdquo;.  It would not do any damage to the intentions, possibilities or issues that the Taoiseach raised.  It would leave his amendment No. 9, which I welcome, quite capable of being introduced and it would, as he mentioned, improve the Bill further.  To clarify the seriousness of the intention of maximising the release of documents I propose this amendment. Notwithstanding what the Taoiseach said, I am entirely unhappy with the choice of words and, therefore, feel the proposal I have made to substitute &ldquo;seriously damage&rdquo; for &ldquo;to be contrary to&rdquo; is quite moderate and a reasonable alternative.</P>

      <P>Let me ask for confirmation on a point.  Is the effect of this amendment that, for example, departmental records which are more than 30 years old and are being retained in a Department because they are in fairly constant use in that Department would be open to public access as though they were held in the National Archives?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>We are referring to the amendment which adds the words &ldquo;or held elsewhere in accordance with this Act&rdquo;.  Section 8 (2) as now amended, provides that a Department may certify that for stated reasons a particular departmental record or class of record which is more than 30 years old and specified in the certificate is in regular use in that Department or is required in connection with its administration and that its transfer to the National Archives <Col N="31" /> would seriously interfere with the administration of the Department.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, &ldquo;held elsewhere in accordance with this Act&rdquo; makes reference to another section's provision that documents can be in the National Archives without being specifically held in a building called the National Archives.  In accordance with discussions in this House on Committee Stage we made changes to enable documents to be held elsewhere under the Act as the National Archives Documents retained in the Department for the reason the Senator mentioned would not be in the National Archives nor would they, in accordance with this Act, be held in accordance with the normal provisions of the public service.</P>

      <P>That is not what it appears to say, as amended.  We are dealing with section 10, the sideline of which is &ldquo;the right to inspect archives with National Archives&rdquo;.  It will be now amended to read, &ldquo;All archives in the custody of the National Archives or held elsewhere in accordance with this Act.&rdquo; Archives that are held elsewhere or archives that are held in Departments, say, are in frequent use they are not going to be transferred to the National Archives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 is the one to which I have already made an anticipatory reference, probably in a disorderly manner but not meaning to be disorderly.  During Committee Stage of the debate I mentioned that I have been sensitive to the danger of non-disclosure of records for reasons of particular embarrassment, but I recognise that there might also be the temptation on the part of civil servants not to disclose something because it might reflect adversely on a Department or perhaps even on a civil servant who is still serving. I must say with respect that the provision in the Bill which requires the consent of an officer of the Department of the Taoiseach to any such decision is a strong safeguard but there is no question of an individual civil servant, who has been designated to the Department by the relevant officer, taking the decision on his own account.  He would have to have the approval of the relevant officer of the Department of the Taoiseach before taking a decision of this kind to withhold a document.</P>
      <P>To provide a further safeguard, lest in any instance over-caution by two public servants in two different Departments would lead to a document being withheld unnecessarily, I have made provision here that any such decision can be overruled by the Taoiseach who can direct that departmental records, which are more than 30 years old and which have been retained in the Department, be transferred to the National Archives and made available for public inspection.  We have built in as many checks and balances of a progressive or an open character as we can, designed to guard against over-caution in publication and to ensure that there is not the least possible chance that anything will be withheld for publication without very strong reason.</P>
      <P>I emphasise again that this provision involves the Taoiseach only in the process of overruling a decision to withhold a document.  It does not give any power to him or any other politicians to withhold a document.  It only gives power to disclose what may have been withheld.  That is the only power that should be given.</P>

      <P>I am a little worried about the amendment.  I would have thought that in legal terms there was no difference between an officer of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach himself, since ultimately the Taoiseach is the effective legal authority in the Department.  Therefore, I do not know how much difference it makes.</P>
      <P>If the authority now rests with the Taoiseach, will this depend on the time available to him?  It is not for me to tell a Taoiseach how little time he has for talking or thinking about things, but I would have thought it would be best to leave the position that there was an authorised officer who could in turn be overruled by the Taoiseach rather than to take the position where the authorised officer of the Department of the Taoiseach, as I read it, no longer exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am sorry that there is some confusion about this.  This is notwithstanding the provisions of sections 8 (2), (4) and (6), 10 (1) (b) and 10 (5).  Section 8 (4), for example, provides that:</P>
      <P>An officer of a Department of State authorised for the purpose of this subsection may, with the consent of an officer of the Department of the Taoiseach so authorised (except in relation to records of the Department of the Taoiseach), certify, . . . .</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>To pursue the other side, it would be interesting to know how the Taoiseach envisages that matters of this kind would be drawn to his attention. A case might arise where a request would be made.  Would it be the director or his authorised officer who could consent? How would the Taoiseach become involved in this and perhaps seek to override and either have documents transferred or have public access to them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to be precise about that.  Most likely the director from his knowledge of archival material in the Department and from his contacts with the Department would have some knowledge of certain material being withheld. If he has doubts about that or if his experience of the Department was such as to lead him to be concerned and lest an over-cautious view be taken, he could draw the attention of the Taoiseach to it and ask him to examine whether in that instance the view taken by the administrator had been over-cautious.  The Taoiseach could then direct his attention to the files.  There may be other ways in which it might happen but this is the most likely way.  I think that only rarely would this power be invoked.  It is useful to have a check there which the director could make use of if he were dissatisfied and, even without any concrete reason, reached a conclusion that there was a tendency to be unduly cautious in his Department, and he could ask that the matter be looked into by the Taoiseach. This is the most likely way for it to be invoked.  However, I do not want to rule any other procedure out.</P>

      <P>I wonder whether I would be totally out of order if I made a comment at this point on a matter on which an amendment was not put down but which was raised.  It is a question of parliamentary records.  I have not put down an amendment on that because I am advised that it would not be the proper procedure, that because of Article 15.10 of the Constitution there would be difficulty in dealing with records of the Houses within the structure of the Bill and that the question of the records of the Houses would probably be dealt with under Standing Orders by the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses.  I say this because I do not want anyone to think that I inadvertently overlooked the point but I thought it would be improper and now I have discovered that it would be unconstitutional to attempt to cover it in the Bill.  However, I thought that if I sought permission to make this point now and drew the attention of the House to it, this House and the other House might like to make their own disposition on the matter along the general lines of the Bill, but it is entirely a matter for both Houses.</P>

Having a person sitting up there listening to what you say is an interesting and new experience for many of us.  One has the impression most of the time that the answers are prepared irrespective of what one may have to say. The Taoiseach should advise his Ministers that now we have had the experience we might become quite addicted and expect to be taken more seriously when matters are being discussed.</P>

    <P>Finally, the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1985 has been on the agenda for the last five months.  It is liable to end up being disclosed as a public record <Col N="38" /> before it is passed unless moves are made on it quickly.</P>

      <P>When enacted it will require considerable administrative follow-up.  For example, it requires regulations to be made both by the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Public Service.  It requires to be authorised in every Department and an official in the Taoiseach's Department to work with officials authorised in every Department and it envisages the possibility of further assignments, function, and so on.  It would be desirable for this House to affirm the widely shared view of the Seanad that it is most important that all of this administrative follow-through should occur without delay.  I know this would be something that the Taoiseach would strongly endorse.  Looking at the Bill from the point of view of the approach adopted, it requires quite a considerable administrative follow-through which we hope will happen without further delay of any kind once it has passed the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In a short contribution on this very important piece of legislation, I wish to commend the Government, the Minister responsible and his Ministers of State for the interest they have shown in this Bill.  I wish to thank them for the widespread consultation and debate they had with all the interested parties.  This led in no small way to an excellent debate in the Dáil on this legislation and to some fundamental amendments being agreed by the Minister.  He had wide-ranging discussions with members of the Irish Nurses Organisation, the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, the Federated Workers Union of Ireland and many other trade unions and associations representing nurses in various ways.  It was because of that widespread discussion that there is now, generally speaking, a warm welcome for the terms of the Bill which has passed through the Dáil and is now before us.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill itself is that An Bord Altranais, who were established in 1950, will be abolished when this Bill becomes law and will be replaced by the Nursing Board.  The composition of the Nursing Board has improved in regard to the representation of nurses on it.  That was one of the areas that concerned nurses.  They wanted to ensure that their profession would be adequately and majoritively represented on the board. Arising from amendments and various representations, not fewer than 18 and possibly up to 20 nurses out of a total board of about 29 will now be on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome in the Minister's Second Stage speech the commitment to seriously consider, in making regulations, that the voting procedure to be adopted by nurses in electing their members would be proportional representation.  If we draw a comparison between this legislation and the Dentists Act, which was put through this House after some considerable debate, discussion and amendment which produced very fine legislation at the end, a similar section was conceded by the Minister.  I am glad that he has now given an assurance that, in making these orders setting down the procedure, <Col N="40" /> he is seriously considering the use of proportional representation.  We welcome this because there are certain sections of the nursing profession who in the overall context might be in a minority situation but under the PR system of voting would have an opportunity of ensuring that their voice would be heard and represented on the board.</P>
    <P>Regarding the functions of the board, most of us would welcome particularly the area of the registration of nurses, the whole area of the setting of standards of nursing and the minimum standard of educational requirements for nurses.  I am sure that when we talk about the minimum standards of education required the incoming board will have regard to the recommendations of the working party on general nursing.  Many of us, including yourself, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, I am sure, have views on the educational requirement of nurses. Nowadays we seem to be obsessed with academic achievements of people who are considered suitable to be even interviewed for nursing.  We have many people who would achieve the minimum requirements and above the minimum but because of the numbers of applications from young girls for nurse training, training schools themselves have set a higher standard and that higher standard is usually based on academic qualifications. I admit that biology and chemistry are essential subjects for nurses but it is debatable whether mathematics or anything else should be that important.</P>
    <P>Apart from being a very professional and dedicated body of people nurses also have a special qualification which has nothing to do with education.  That is a vocational qualification: the ability to be kind to people who are sick or old or infirm.  I would hope that when minimum standards for entrance to training are being set, that attitude would be considered as being a very important and necessary minimum educational requirement. We should ensure that instead of having hundreds of young people qualifying on the basis of seven or eight honours in the leaving certificate, those who <Col N="41" /> would have the minimum standards in the important subjects plus the ability to be able to deal with people would also be considered.  That might need some change in the curriculum or otherwise in our second level schools.  It is important that at least I put it on the record of the House that I consider that to be a very necessary part of any qualification to be a nurse. Apart from being a job nursing is a profession, a vocation and something that many girls we talk to in the country aspire to.  A girl with an excellent leaving certificate might make a great banker but might not make a very good nurse.</P>
    <P>The system of central application which has been talked about in the Bill and which has been the subject of some controversy is one that has to be welcomed. We have the problem at the moment of the same girls having to apply to five or six different locations, to different training schools or hospitals, seeking interviews that would result in their being placed on the panel for nurse training.  If the system were centralised and some definition laid down by the board of what the requirements were, it is possible that interviews could be carried out at regional level and that the results could be sorted out at central level.  Girls who may be successful in one area fail in others though the requirements may be the same.  By rationalising this procedure in a central way girls could be spared some of the financial burden that is now placed on them by reason of their having to apply to the various health board areas.</P>
    <P>Another very important function of the board which has led to some degree of debate &mdash; I will not say controversy &mdash; was the power of the board to remove nurses from the register.  They could be removed for any of a whole list of reasons which are included in the Bill.  One of these is professional misconduct.  There was a reservation that any board would have that power.  In speaking with nurses who raised this problem with me, I was glad to assure them that the members of any profession in this country, whether doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons or otherwise, are expected by the public to <Col N="42" /> attain and adhere to a certain code of conduct.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the vast majority of the nursing profession would welcome that provision.  It is appropriate that they maintain a certain high standard which all of us accept and expect them to maintain. From our experience of dealing with nurses on health boards and in hospitals and so on they have this tremendous high standard of professional conduct, no provision in the Bill insinuates that there is widespread departure from this but it is appropriate that if their profession is to continue to have this high standing in the public mind, the safety valve would be included that the board have the power to remove from the register a nurse who was found to be guilty of misconduct.</P>
    <P>There is another section which gives the board power to bring in ancillary grades of nurses.  This has created some concern particularly when we have regard to the large numbers of nurses who are unable to obtain employment in hospitals, nursing homes, health boards or otherwise.  They find it difficult to perceive that we are now possibly going to create a category of people who are not nurses but who are allied to nursing.  In some professions this is to be welcomed and is necessary because we do not have sufficient qualified people to carry out all the functions they would normally carry out.  In the Dentists Act we created certain groups who with proper training could do a lot of very important work that dentists do not have time to do.  In the area of nurses and ancillary grades of nursing I would have reservations about the urgency factor in view of the fact that there are so many unemployed nurses available for work.  I am personally aware of such people and most Members of this House would be aware of them also.  I should like to think that they would be employed before anyone else would come in as a second tier or lower tier to be provided with a certain status which would be included in the functions of the board.</P>
    <P>In saying that I know there are some girls who because of the educational requirements or for some other reason <Col N="43" /> will never be able to qualify as nurses but who will spend their lives caring for the sick or the infirm or the mentally handicapped. Perhaps in the area of mental handicap there is a place and a need for this ancillary type of nursing.  I would have certain reservations about ancillary nursing grades in general hospitals, geriatric hospitals and so on, but in the area of mental handicap there probably would be a need for this ancillary type of person who would be very good and extremely kind with these types of patients.  In that regard I hope the board will take into account that type of person if they decide to have a second tier of nursing type personnel with a certain type of registration in this new board.</P>
    <P>The other area is one that is really controversial and that is the area of the right of nurses to object to carrying out particular medical functions which could in fact contravene their own conscience or moral judgment.  All of us accept that in any walk of life, in any profession, people should have the right to opt out of particular medical operations or otherwise that could create a conscience problem for them.  The discussions we have had with nurses organisations in this regard indicate that they are satisfied that this was not the area which was included in the section that gave the Minister certain powers of direction.  It did not impinge on their moral and conscientious right to object as a profession, as indeed the professional ethics they acquire on the day of their graduation would have given them in any case.  I want to put it on the record that that principle should be enshrined in any legislation.  We are living in a democracy in which people would have the right to opt out of any procedure that would be in conflict with their conscience.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking the provisions of the Bill are ones that I welcome.  They are long overdue.  The nurses themselves are anxious that we as a House would complete this legislation as soon as possible so that the board may be set up.  I welcome all the efforts that have been made to tidy up all the anomalies that <Col N="44" /> apparently had been there in the past and hope that with this new surge forward in the importance of the profession the nurses will respond magnificently, as they always have done in the past.  I commend the Minister and his Ministers of State for the interest they have shown in trying to ensure that the legislation reflected their views because they are the people who will be involved in the carrying through of this legislation by way of the setting up of this new Nursing Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill in its regulation of the nursing profession and in its bringing up to date legislation covering the nursing profession.  All of us, either through ourselves or through our friends or relatives have cause to appreciate the care and the high standards which obtain in the nursing profession in Ireland.  It is quite obvious that this is true because in so many countries one finds Irish nurses working and Irish nurses appreciated for their high standards and their high qualifications.</P>
      <P>This is an essential piece of legislation in terms of widening the horizons of nursing and, as was said by the Minister of State in introducing the Bill in this House on the 18 July, in taking in the fact that nurses nowadays go ahead to further qualifications, to third level education of different kinds and to dealing with this kind of situation.  Therefore I think the Bill is necessary and it is to be welcomed.  I would certainly support the flexibility that has been built into the Bill to allow for changing situations with regard to the nursing profession.  It is practically impossible for us as legislators to foresee exactly what may happen in future years and we should try to enact legislation which will be flexible and which will be adaptable to changes that happen in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Bill has had long debate in another place and that it has been improved by various amendments. Generally speaking the idea of a central applications board is a good one for the reasons which have been mentioned by other Senators.  It is very cumbersome <Col N="45" /> and difficult for a girl who wishes to become a nurse, or indeed for a man who wishes to become a nurse, to apply to all sorts of different hospitals and different health board areas.  Therefore the central handling of applications is probably, as it has turned out to be in the university situation, a reasonable way of dealing with this.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one area that I wish to draw to the attention of the House in this Second Stage debate, and indeed possibly also on the Committee Stage but certainly now, and it is one which was mentioned at the close of his speech by Senator Ferris when he referred to the wish of certain nurses to include what is usually described as a conscience clause in the Bill.  I, in common with other Senators no doubt, have received correspondence about this from various nursing and matrons associations.  I have quite carefully replied in at least two long letters to what has been said to me.  This refers to section 51 (2) of the Bill which states that it should be the function of the board to give guidance to the nursing profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.  As was pointed out by the Minister of State in his contribution on 18 July last, a code for nurses has been brought out by the present board.  This provides in section 1 (11) of the code that a nurse shall be entitled to make known at the earliest possible opportunity to an appropriate person or authority any conscientious objection which may be relevant to professional practice and that the board shall be the final arbiter at to whether any such objection falls within the scope of this clause.</P>
    <P>This seems to me to be a very fairly reasonable way of dealing with the matter.  But what is being sought is probably something that goes a good deal further than this, something which will allow a nurse &mdash; or perhaps nurses gathering together &mdash; through conscientious objection to prevent a patient from having some form of medical treatment <Col N="46" /> which is within the conscience of the patient and very possibly within the conscience of the patient's doctor.  This would seriously concern me.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for us to say that in a democratic society, as Senator Ferris said, one should have a right of conscience but this can be an area where there is a right of conflicting conscience. There is the conscience of the nurse and also the conscience of the patient and possibly the conscience of the doctor. It seems to me that sometimes in these discussions we lose sight of the fact that all medical care is really about patients and not about nurses or doctors.  Nurses and doctors exist to care for the patient. In a sense where the patient needs treatment and accepts that that treatment is within his own conscience, it seems to me to be going rather far to suggest that by concerted action or even by individual action nurses could prevent the patient from getting that treatment.  I know this may seem to be a far-fetched idea, but it is not really.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State says regarding the common contract for consultants, that consultants must accept the ethical position of the hospital they work for. This can give rise to difficulties.  During the summer while this House has not been meeting there has been considerable discussion and debate, particularly in the west of Ireland, about the question of female sterilisation being provided in the Galway Regional Hospital by a certain gynaecologist.  Statements have been issued on the matter by the Bishop of Galway.  There have been threats &mdash; if I may put it that way &mdash; to bring in an ethics committee which will put a stop to this kind of thing.  In addition it has been revealed that when gynaecologists wished to purchase a hospital from diocesan authorities they were only allowed to purchase it on condition that they obeyed the ethical standards set out by the diocese, not the ethical standards of the doctors or the ethical standards of the patients but of the Roman Catholic diocese.  I am inclined to think that when we talk about ethics and conscience in this situation we are very often talking <Col N="47" /> about the ethics and conscience of the majority Church and perhaps of a rather right wing group within the majority Church.  Therefore, I am worried about the idea of it being put forward that there should be either an overt conscience clause in this Bill which would allow total freedom of conscience to the nurse at the expense of the freedom of conscience to the patient, or alternatively, that even if we do not put this in, it should be as Senator Ferris said, accepted that it is in the nature of things that this is the position that should prevail.</P>
    <P>It is easy to talk about freedom of conscience, about the necessity for each person to be able to exercise his private conscience.  It is perhaps a lot harder to work out an acceptable balance between what are the needs of the patient, the recommendations of the doctor, the conscience of the nurse or whatever.  That is not easy.  I quite accept that it is not easy and that it can create difficulties for nurses just as it creates difficulties for doctors and patients.  But I would say that the task that the new board have to apply themselves to, and a task they can well apply themselves to under this section 1 (11) of the code for nurses, is to develop what the correct balance is as between the rights of the patient, the rights of conscience of the nurse, the view of the doctor and perhaps the view of those who run the hospitals.</P>
    <P>In this situation whatever may be said about the rights of private hospitals, which of course though private hospitals are largely run on public money, the rights of health authority hospitals are a very different matter because they exist for the whole community, not just for, say, a private nursing order or whatever. Therefore, we must be extremely careful that these types of consicence clauses cannot be used in the framework of health authority hospitals to prevent certain kinds of treatment to patients who wish and desire a certain treatment, whose conscience allows them to have that treatment and whose doctors are willing to carry out those procedures.</P>
    <P>I am rather afraid that the Minister <Col N="48" /> of State in his attitude, as shown in his contribution at column 1989 of the Official Report of 18 July last, may be too weak-kneed in this situation, that he is leaning over backwards to reassure that nothing that will offend anyone will be done.  This is a nettle that we have to grasp as legislators, as health boards, as the new nursing board and so on.  It is something that we have to think out quite carefully.  I would ask that in this debate we do not make assumptions that the new board will be totally bound by this type of conscience clause or by this type of view of ethics that has been virtually accepted by the Minister of State in his contribution.</P>
    <P>This is a crucially important area in medical and social ethics.  It is something which arises on this Bill and which I feel strongly about.  I would ask that the powers of the board and the powers of the Minister in this situation should not be curtailed by a particular view of what are or are not medical ethics.  Having said that, I would repeat that I welcome the Bill and that in general its clauses are very suitable and that it will provide a framework for the progress of the nursing profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I.  too, join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  In doing so I would like to compliment the Minister for Health on bringing this legislation before the House.  The Minister is one member of this Government who has been criticised by many people across the broad, political and quasi-political spectrum for many diverse and different reasons.  But we as legislators and certainly those involved in the medical profession in its broadest sense have to be thankful to the Minister for at least bringing various aspects of the medical profession into the eighties in the legislative sense.  I say that because the Bill we are discussing this afternoon is in many ways similar to the Dentists Bill we discussed in this House some months ago.  My only regret is that the Minister did not introduce this Bill in this House also.  If he had done so he would have followed the <Col N="49" /> precedent set by his illustrious predecessor, Dr. Noel Browne, who introduced the 1950 Act in this House as the 1949 Nurses Bill.  When we are discussing this Bill we have the opportunity of recollecting briefly the whole history of nursing in this country.  It is only appropriate that we pay tribute to all of those over the centuries who played a role in developing the nursing profession to what it is today.</P>
      <P>In the report of the working party on general nursing, published some years ago, there is an interesting history of the development of nursing in this country. We note from that report that the idea of nursing as such was known as far back as the Brehon Laws and was recognised as such.  Indeed reference is made to the role which monastic settlements played in the time of early Christianity in providing a nursing service.  There is also interesting reference, interesting in the historic sense, to the development of some of the terms which we now associate with nursing.  I was particularly amused to note the way the concept of &ldquo;matron&rdquo; has developed &mdash; I quote from page 18 of the report of the working party where they refer to a definition of &ldquo;matron&rdquo; as follows:</P>
      <P>The function of the matron in Dr. Steevens' Hospital in the early Nineteenth Century is described as follows: to take care of all the functions belonging to the house, to keep all stores and deliver them to the nurses as the occasion requires, to see that the several nurses keep their wards clean, to lay up carefully the old linen and blankets and to deliver them to the surgeon as often as he should call for them.</P>
      <P>When one realises that was a description in the early 19th century it is interesting to realise how the role of matron in a hospital has developed up to the present time.  If we note the development of the role of the State in providing nursing services it is also interesting that the nursing services which were available until the beginning of this century were provided by charitable organisations and largely provided by private resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> I welcome the fact that this Bill updates the 1950 Act and also has the effect of repealing the Midwives Act, of 1944, and the amending Act of 1961.  I hope at the outset that in considering and in preparing the Bill the Minister and his Department took account of the various excellent reports which were published over the past ten or 15 years dealing with nursing, such as the survey of the workload of public health nurses published in the early seventies, the 1973 report on the psychiatric nursing services board and, more importantly, the report I referred to earlier, namely, that of the working party on general nursing.  I hope that the effect of this Bill will allow An Bord Altranais to give effect to the recommendations of these working parties in so far as they govern the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to certain sections of the Bill, in particular to Part II of the Bill which re-establishes the board, because the board are already in existence by virtue of the 1950 legislation.  I welcome in particular section 9 of the Bill which deals with the composition of the new board, a board of 29 members which constitutes nurses involved in various types of training and in various aspects of nursing administration, nurses engaged in various aspects of clinical nursing practice and the 12 other members whom the Minister, after consultation with various bodies, may appoint. The Minister has chosen wisely with regard to persons who were suitable for appointment to the board.  Subparagraph (x) of section 9 (1) (d) states that &ldquo;two shall be persons representative of the interest of the general public.&rdquo;  I hope that those two will play a wise role in bringing in outside expertise and the views of the public to ensure that the new An Bord Altranais operate in an objective way.</P>
    <P>It is extremely unfortunate that the Bill provides that one committee, namely, the Fitness to Practise Committee, will not have on it any member of the public. Section 13 deals with the establishment of committees.  Section 13 (3) states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> A committee established under this section, other than the committee referred to in subsection (2) of this section may, if the Board thinks fit, include in its membership persons who were not members of the Board.</P>
    <P>The committee referred to in subsection (1) is, of course, the Fitness to Practise Committee.  I think it is a very good idea that all professional committees should have people who are not members of the professions.  It brings to the committees the views of outsiders.  It gives them the opportunity of seeing things objectively, it certainly brings to committees a sense of openness and it allows the public to look at statutory committees in a way that is fair.</P>
    <P>The most important committee which this Bill establishes is the Fitness to Practise Committee.  It is wrong that that committee should not have outside members. If one bears in mind that at the moment we are debating in this country &mdash; although we are not yet debating it in the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; establishment of a Garda complaints procedure the question arises as to whether or not we should have outside participation within that procedure.  There is a broad spectrum of opinion which says we should have outside opinion.  I know that the Incorporated Law Society have been in consultation with the Department of Justice regarding the committee of that body which deals with solicitors who have been out of order.  I understand that legislation is in the pipeline which will provide for lay participation on such a committee. The very same thing applies in relation to the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that the Fitness to Practise Committee of the nursing profession should have outside, lay participation. I say that not in any way to try to worry the nursing profession.  I do not say this to try in any way to make the nursing profession feel that they are coming under a microscope but I say it for the reason that by having lay participation they are protecting themselves against the public.  The Fitness to Practise Committee is a statutory committee <Col N="52" /> with quasi-judicial powers.  It is an extremely important committee and if nurses are subject to review by a committee composed entirely of their own peers then I think a worry may emerge.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude to that section and to that committee.</P>
    <P>I know in the preparation of legislation Ministers have consultations with outside bodies.  I am quite sure that the Minister had consultations with representatives of the existing board and with representatives of the various nursing organisations and possibly they said that there should not be outside participation.  I say that without any pre-knowledge.  It would be very wise, not merely from the point of view of the public but also from the point of view of the nursing profession, that there should be outside participation on this committee.</P>
    <P>Section 10 imposes on the Minister the duty to take all steps to secure the appointment of the members to the first board and, of course, consequent on that we come into the election of the president and vice-president of the board.  Those elections are provided for in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  I must compliment the Minister on ensuring that the president and vice-president can be elected by the members of An Bord Altranais.  One of the legislative controversies of the past 25 years was when the 1961 Bill was introduced by the then Minister for Health, Mr. MacEntee.  If one reads the debates dealing with that measure one will see that the principal provision was to ensure that the president of the board could be appointed by the Minister for Health. If one reads Mr. MacEntee's speech on Second Stage in the Dáil one can see very little good reason but if one reads speeches by Opposition speakers one certainly gets the impression that there was a very able president on the board at that time who had obviously come into conflict with the then Minister.  I must compliment the Minister for being open in this regard in allowing the new board to elect their own president.  It is a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>On the question of education and training of nurses, I hope the board will <Col N="53" /> comply with the recommendations contained in the report which I have mentioned. The report of the psychiatric nursing services board lays down very clear recommendations as to student training.  I will just mention a few of them.  One is that there should be a nurse education committee in each hospital, another is that clinical teachers should be appointed in all hospitals and there should be one fixed time of student intake each year, followed by a proper induction course.  It is possible that all of these things are already in existence in so far as psychiatric nurses are concerned.  I understand there has been a revolution in their training but I hope that the recommendations of the 1972 working party are complied with and I hope that the Minister, in exercise of his statutory powers under the new legislation, ensures that is done.</P>
    <P>In relation to the report of the working party on the workload of public health nurses, I think there are recommendations there to the effect that public health nurses should have as much practical training as possible.  There are also recommendations to the effect that public health nurses should be spared the workload of clerical work which they were certainly subjected to until recently. I am not altogether <i>au fait</i> with how public health nurses operate but I hope this is already in existence and if it is not in existence I would like the Minister, under the section of this Bill dealing with education and training, to ensure that the board carry out their functions to see that the recommendations of the working party are carried out.  Likewise, with regard to the report of the working party on general nursing, there are recommendations there dealing with education. Again, I hope that those recommendations are carried out because certainly they make impressive reading.</P>
    <P>I have expressed my views on the Fitness to Practise Committee.  I would just like to say in a general way that the powers which that part of the Bill confers on the board are extensive and will be exercised with caution and properly. There is one particular power that is a <Col N="54" /> very important one.  It is one that I would like to see being used frequently and my nursing friends may not like my making reference to it.  It is the power contained in section 41 that refers to the power of the board, following an inquiry and report by the Fitness to Practise Committee, pursuant to section 38 of this Act to advise or admonish without taking any further steps.</P>
    <P>There are certainly bodies who have similar powers and who do not use them. I refer to the Garda Síochána who under the Garda Síochána discipline regulations have powers under section 7 of those regulations to deal in a very informal way with a member against whom an allegation is made.  For some peculiar reason Garda officers have failed to use that power in a regular way.  There may be fears of various kinds behind that reluctance but I hope that no fears of that kind will arise in relation to the exercise of the power conferred by section 41 of this Bill.  If An Bord do not exercise that power, then I ask the Minister, in exercise of his very substantial powers, to ensure that they use that power and use it frequently.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to one issue which Senator McGuinness referred to and it is one which I think many Members of this House have been approached on namely, the question of the inclusion in this Bill of a conscientious objection clause.  I do not agree with all the remarks of Senator McGuinness.  I agree with her when she says we must get the balance right.  There is a duty on legislators to consider the rights of a specific group for whom we are legislating and also those of the public whom that group serve and to try to get the balance right between the two of them.  Having said that, I do not think that the balance is right if you remove absolutely from nurses the right of conscientious objection. I do not agree with the point made by Senator McGuinness that one must take into account absolutely the right of conscientious requirement on the part of the patient.  If a patient requires the administration of drugs which would have the effect of allowing euthanasia, should <Col N="55" /> that right in an absolute and unfettered way be given to the patient, should that right of conscience be given to the patient in an absolute way and should that right of conscience under those circumstances be removed from the nurse who would be required by law to exercise the administration of such drugs?  I just cannot see that that stands to reason.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I do not want to get involved in the sterilisation controversy. I do not altogether disagree with the views the Senator expressed on that subject but I do not altogether agree with the facts as she outlined them here today. I do not think it is relevant to get involved in that argument in relation to the question of conscientious objection by a nurse.  If a nurse is required to do something which she or he believes to be morally wrong, then I think that nurse should have the right to opt out.  I certainly do not accept that the inclusion in the code of conduct of nurses covers the point. The code of conduct provides in paragraph 1.11 as follows:</P>
    <P>a nurse shall be entitled to make known at the earliest possible opportunity to an appropriate person or authority any conscientious objection which may be relevant to profession practice.  An Bord shall be the final arbiter as to whether any such objection falls within the scope of this clause.</P>
    <P>That quotation comes from the code for nurses issued by the nursing board but that phrase and that right do not have any statutory force.  It is only right that there should be included in our legislation a statutory provision giving our nurses the right of conscientious objection to opt out of something which they do not wish to participate in by virtue of the terms of their employment.  I stress &ldquo;by virtue of the terms of their employment&rdquo; because the majority of our nurses, 95 per cent at least, are employed either by the health boards or by the voluntary hospitals and as employees there are certain restrictions on what they can do and what they cannot do.  As an employee a nurse may be compelled to do certain things and <Col N="56" /> rather than create a situation where a clash may arise within employment we should now legislate and provide in this legislation for that right which our nurses seek.</P>
    <P>I have had the opportunity of speaking with many nurses who are involved particularly in the maternity and gynaeco-logical side of things and they are extremely worried about this matter.  I do not envisage a situation arising whereby a mass of nurses will, as it were, gang up and come together to prevent an individual having a right to certain types of surgery.  I do not see that situation arising and to suggest that, as has been suggested in this House today, is a totally unrealistic response to the call by nurses and matrons for this right.</P>
    <P>I call upon the Minister to include such a right.  I do not know how he will respond but I hope he will respond as openly to this Bill in this House as he responded to the Dentists' Bill in this House some months ago.  This is an issue on which I will certainly have to consider my own position when it comes to dealing with this Bill.  Having said that, I think it is important to realise that in relation to this type of issue some months ago the Cortes in Spain enacted legislation providing for the legislation of abortion under certain circumstances in that country. <i>The Irish Times</i> of 3 August 1985 carried the news of the introduction of that legislation.  I qoute from that newspaper one paragraph from the article dealing with it where it says:</P>
    <P>A law allowing doctors and health workers to decline to assist in abortions on grounds of conscience also went into effect yesterday.</P>
    <P>I sought a copy of that legislation from Spain.  The Spanish Ambassador kindly sent me a copy of it in Spanish but I did not have the knowledge to translate it and I could not find somebody else who could do so for me.  I ask the Minister to look at the legislation which the Socialist Government in Spain have introduced in relation to a matter very similar to this. I ask our Minister who is a member of the Government which I support and who <Col N="57" /> is also supported by many people who describe themselves as socialists to look at that legislation and see if at this stage we could introduce such an amendment here.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that this is essentially a Committee Stage Bill and it certainly is a Bill which I will be following with interest in Committee, as I know will many Senators.  I also say to the Minister that we were very happy in this House at his attitude in relation to the Dentists' Bill.  We learned much about the organisation of the medical and allied professions when he accepted, dealt with and debated with us the various amendments which we, on the Government side, principally, put forward in relation to that Bill.  I hope the Minister will be equally open when it comes to Committee Stage of this Bill in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this Bill will be short.  We must remember we are dealing with a profession which has given a tremendous service to the nation over the years, in many cases far beyond the call of duty.  I listened to some of the speakers, both in this House and in the Dáil, and I ask the Minister to take seriously the views expressed by the nursing profession.  We are dealing with a service that is over-burdened.  How much longer can the nursing profession withstand the strain?  Members of health boards are fully aware that while the embargo on recruitment continues there is an extra heavy burden put on this profession. When we are dealing with geriatric hospitals there is a limit in so far as one can act in this area.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was published and was discussed in my health board I waited for a reaction.  I got a very very mixed reception from medical practitioners on the board and indeed from the nursing profession.  Some went so far as to say the Bill was ambiguous.  Representations have been made to all Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas with regard to the matter of conscientious objection referred to by Senator Durcan.  This House should not let the Bill go through without making proper amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> The Bill is to provide for a new nursing board to deal with the registration, control and education of nurses and other matters relating to nursing.  With a total of 29 members, 17 elected by the nurses and one nominated by the Minister, it appears that the nursing staff will have control in nearly all matters related to in this Bill.  However, I am not satisfied with the conscientious objection clause in this Bill because if a nurse objected to carrying out a specific duty because it was against her conscience, there would have to be a ruling by the board in order to decide whether she was entitled to object or not.  This would neutralise her objection. If a nurse has a conscientious objection she could not feel assured that the Bill has adequate in-built protection for her.</P>
    <P>The board as envisaged at present seems to be capable of dealing with any such problem but there is no guarantee whatever what will be the constitution of this board in future years.  It is proposed to have a central applications board.  I consider each hospital should be allowed to interview and choose their own trainee nursing staff and that the amendment tabled in the Dáil regarding this matter should have been accepted by the Minister. Each hospital should also be allowed its own ethical committee in order to make decisions on a moral question for the hospital in general.  The overall result of the Bill is that it vests too much power in the Minister.  He will have the final decision on questions of alleged misconduct or behaviour.  The question of misconduct is very much open to misinterpretation and for that reason I hope the Minister will take seriously the views expressed by Senators and, indeed, take more cognisance of the views expressed by the nursing staff who made representation because it is their future that will be affected by the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The aspect of it that I wish to concentrate on is the question of educational training because it is very important indeed particularly in view of the rate and pace of change which has taken place over the <Col N="59" /> years in the nursing profession.  I see educational training as being possibly the most important aspect of the Bill from the point of view of the question of dealing with the patient's health.  Many other provisions relate to the questions of discipline, procedures for recruitment and so on, but emphasis must be placed on the actual training.  This is very important because particular types of patients are more dependent on good nursing than they are on the attention of a doctor. For this reason it is very important that educational training be given very serious thought and I believe that the appointed board will take that road.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied also that where a multi-discipline team is involved and where good nursing turns out to be the major aspect so far as the needs of the patient is concerned, there is no reason why a nurse should not lead that clinical team. It does not have to be led by a doctor. Given developments in training and education this can be very much more a reality than it is at the moment.  It is no harm to put on record that nurses spend the longest time with the patients and they are the people who really get to know them.  If they have been in training with a multi-discipline team and they have a good grasp of the other aspects of the care of the patient the nurse is, in that sense, the leader.  Therefore, her time and talents can be made greater use of and I think this board will possibly pay attention to that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why there should not be a development of the nurses training service and ultimately taking a greater share of clinical responsibility.  At present in psychiatric nursing nurses are actually going into the community from the hospital base and in this respect nurses are acting as therapists.  Of course, in giving care and treatment inside the hospital base, they act as therapists as well but not in the accepted recognised sense.  If there was more recognition through education and training and an examination of the discipline involved we would find that the talents and time of the nurses could be better utilised.  In the psychiatric <Col N="60" /> field nurses are called on to give more care and attention to patients because of the limited number of psychiatrists.  Some doctors and psychiatrists are remote and nurses are the best people to give leadership when it comes to considering the question of taking general nursing into consideration, which would include community and psychiatric nursing.</P>
    <P>There have been remarkable developments since the beginning of the century. The nursing profession has undergone great changes but it needs to be developed.  We should harp on the fact that the profession is on the threshold of further development in training and education.  The new board may supplement that.  They have to give the nursing profession greater recognition through their education and training so that they will be more self-confident and be recognised not as an auxiliary to medicine but as members of a different profession. The potential for that exists.  The board, as at present constituted, should be able to bring about initiatives in that direction and changes in the training programme. If that occurs we can look forward to our nurses playing a more central role in the care of the mentally handicapped and the elderly.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the board developing the area of training.  At present a nurse when psychiatric training is completed moves on to community care.  That training programme should include all aspects of nursing.  Nurses will not let anybody down and they have proved that over the years.  They are a unique group and are separate from medicine or any other profession.  The quality of our nurses is well recognised and overseas the Irish are well established in many hospitals.</P>
    <P>There have been improvements in the recruitment of nurses as a result of developments in education and I trust that any new educational programmes will lead to a continuation of that.  We will always have many people applying to enter the nursing profession and, for economic reasons, they may have to pursue their careers elsewhere.  It is a pity that that is <Col N="61" /> happening.  I hope the board will have a look at that.  It is sad to see such talented people having to look elsewhere for a job when they have set their sights on securing a position at home.  Nursing is a vocation and it is sad that some people have to leave it at a certain stage.  While great work has been done about the quality of the candidates and the standard required before training there is the problem in regard to numbers.  I hope that will be looked at in an objective way.</P>
    <P>As a result of further education and training some nurses get promotion in the caring grades or in the direct patient service but because there are not sufficient posts in the patient care area some nurses opt for administrative jobs.  I am not saying that people should not opt for administrative jobs but many nurses who have given most of their lives to nursing would prefer an opportunity to advance to more senior positions, if they were available, rather than taking on administrative posts.  We should try to cater for nurses who want to stay in nursing.  The structure will have to be changed and talents directed towards patient care, particularly where a nurse wants a career in nursing as distinct from administration. There will be practical problems in this respect but there are ways of dealing with them.</P>
    <P>The training of specialist geriatric nurses might be a way of providing promotional outlets.  That brings in the question of working alongside other health visitors who work with children.  There may be problems in regard to overlapping. I trust the board will help with training and development in this area so that nurses will have another avenue for promotion open to them.</P>
    <P>It is easy to stand up and wish the nursing profession well because most of us have a high regard for them but I also wish the board well because they will have a difficult task.  I can see them having all sorts of difficulties.  The onerous task of looking after nurses' education and training is only one aspect of their work.  There is also the whole question of discipline.  The possibility of somebody taking a case to the High Court <Col N="62" /> is another problem that must be dealt with.  They have many areas to cover. However, education and training will be the key area.</P>
    <P>I have one area of concern and the Minister might ease my mind on it, the question of rehabilitation.  There is not a lot about rehabilitation in the education and training of nurses.  I hope the development of the area of training will have regard to rehabilitation because nurses have a substantial contribution to make in that area.  They can teach people, through their own approach, psychological and otherwise, to become more independent and self-reliant.  District nurses can encourage relatives and friends to teach people to use aids.  Some people through fear have failed to use aids and subsequently there has been a deterioration in their health.  Nurses have much to offer in that respect.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position with regard to undergraduates is but there should be an element of common training for social workers, radiographers and so on.  In other words, nurses should see themselves that, while they are a profession in their own right they are not elite and that there are other problems with which they must deal.  On the question of common training I suggest that a study be undertaken to see if a more effective method is needed.  The whole question of drug abuse, for example, has to be dealt with.  It is not just a question of rehabilitation but one of common training with social workers and so on. That would be of great assistance to nurses.  There is great potential if the education and training are handled and developed properly.</P>
    <P>Accidental injury is another area to which we do not pay much attention. Nurses should be trained with other groups and get the experience they require from the other professionals.  Psychology, occupational health, sociology, health economics and social administration are all part of the social preventive medicine area.  I hope the new board pay attention to some of the points that have been made in the Seanad, not only by myself but by other Members.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> I will conclude by referring briefly to the powers given to the board to inquire into alleged unfitness to practise, professional misconduct and so on, where they have the power to suspend registration. The power to suspend registration is an additional power.  This is a very serious step.  I do not rate it in the context of people being pilloried or anything like that but often lapses occur. With a board of 20 or 30 people it is possible to lose sight of how a problem should be tackled and, at the end of the day, for an error to occur.  Since the majority of nurses are in trade unions I would have thought that it would have been appropriate for the Minister to have appointed a member of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  One could say that 90 per cent of the nurses are members of the two major unions &mdash; the Workers' Union of Ireland and the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union &mdash; and some are members of nurses' organisations.  As we have to deal with this question of misconduct it might not be a bad idea to have somebody on the board who could look at a case from the point of view of the person being investigated.  I am not saying that the board will not be impartial but this advice might be necessary.  I have no hang-up about this but such a move would be wise because some difficulties could be avoided.</P>

      <P>When we decide to take the Second Stage of any piece of legislation we should ask ourselves how vital to the nation are the people referred to in the legislation.  This evening we have an extraordinary situation.  I would welcome anything that would help our nurses but we must bear in mind the conditions in our hospitals with which we are all familiar.  The Nurses' Bill is dated 1984 and it is now September 1985 and it is a much amended Bill to that introduced in the Dáil last year.  Members of all parties, and the INO, at a very early stage did not realise the implications of some of the provisions.  It was at that early stage that I decided to oppose the Bill no <Col N="64" /> matter what the eventual consequences for me would be.  Nobody in this House would have made me vote for the Bill in its original form.  It has been greatly amended since due to the commonsense of my colleagues in the other House and the Minister who used his commonsense before a vote was taken on it in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>We seem to have arrived at a stage of not giving enough time and interest to legislation that affects people like our nurses.  We have gone off on flights of fancy and wasted time on things that affect people who are not as important as nurses.  The Minister of State in his Second Stage speech said:</P>
      <P>These highly-motivated nurses, together with their colleagues among the leaders of the profession, are aiming to prepare nurses for the challenges that face them in this modern age of high-powered medical and technological science.</P>
      <P>That was much different from the Second Stage speech in the Dáil.  Some of the things he said then when considered in relation to conditions under which nurses in general hospitals, such as the general hospital in Clare, work under do not add up at all.  I do not want to be unruly, but I want to quote what the Minister of State said.  He went on:</P>
      <P>There is a new era for nursing opening up and today's nurses want to ensure that their profession is ready to play a full part in its shaping.</P>
      <P>That sentence should be re-read because, even though he did not mean it, it would be wrong to talk about a new era for nurses because they have played an enormous role in Ireland since we got our freedom.  We are all very quick at times, when it suits us, to pay tribute to them. Many Members here referred to a new era of nurses but I want to put on record a tribute to the nurses who have gone and those who are serving.  It is fine if the Minister wants to be prepared for the era that seems to be ahead of him.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister of State said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it is possible to plan for change <Col N="65" /> and I am satisfied that this Bill has sufficient provisions for flexibility built into it to allow for adjustment to suit changing needs and circumstances in nursing as they may develop.</P>
    <P>Here again we have a continuation of the theme that perhaps as Minister he is not too happy with the service nurses have provided up to now.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said:</P>
      <P>. . . I am currently considering the possibility of providing regulations, which I must make for the election of members of the first board, that the election will be conducted on a system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.</P>
      <P>I welcome that system of election because it will give a chance to the people with the lesser numbers to have a voice.  Here I must state that people who care for the mentally handicapped seem to get a lesser voice in the nursing world.  I make the difference between mentally handicapped and mental illness.  Nurses in that area will get a voice on the board.</P>
      <P>We have a much amended Bill before us and that is a good thing.  I am glad it has been corrected.  I understand there will be 17 elected nurses and one appointed by the Minister, a total of 18. That makes much more sense than what was proposed earlier.</P>

I do not think there have been too many comments in speeches today on whether he should have that amount of power or not.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-committees referred to in section 13, I asked: why exclude the chairman of the board from being chairman of any of the committees? That is a little different from legislation dealing with other boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann recognising the tragic circumstances of farmers in the west of Ireland and in the Shannon basin resulting from the disastrous weather conditions, calls on the Government to ensure that, in making emergency aid available, farmers in all parts of Ireland who have also suffered losses are compensated under the emergency aid programme.</P>
      <P>The motion highlights in this House of the Oireachtas the crisis that the farming sector are facing arising from this year's disastrous and continuous rainfall throughout the whole country.  It is the first opportunity that a House of the Oireachtas has had to discuss the problem and I am thankful to the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, for being present for the debate and I hope he will have an opportunity of responding to it. It was important that the House agreed today to take this motion and extend the period of time to give Senators from all sides of the House who want to contribute to the highlighting of this matter an opportunity of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> We in the Labour Party particularly recognise that the problem is a national one.  It is not confined to particular areas within the country.  It can be broken down into four categories.  Most of us have first hand information about this problem.  We have visited many of the farms involved in our own areas, with the good offices of ACOT, to whom I want to pay special tribute for the work they have done in advising the Minister in how serious the problem is throughout the country and, indeed, in keeping the picture updated every week since the problem has arisen.</P>
    <P>I have visited areas in my own constituency that I know are in a desperate situation, for example, Solohead, Doon, Cappawhite, Hollyford, the Glen of Aherlow and so on.  We are living in the Golden Vale and one would assume, on looking at particular regions, that an area such as that would not have suffered as much.  It is because of this that the motion is worded in such a way that if and when aid is announced by the Minister and the Community the problem will be dealt with on an individual basis throughout the whole country and not just confined to any particular region or townland. Otherwise, one could find oneself assisting people, in that kind of blanket situation, who do not need assistance and could leave out those who are in desperate need.</P>
    <P>The problem is a fourfold one.  The first part which was identified &mdash; and the Minister was very swift in ensuring that it was identified &mdash; was tackled properly. There were 350 farmers who experienced what can only be described as a freak loss arising from the hailstorm which stretched across a four miles wide corridor from County Louth to County Carlow. Every farmer in that belt was wiped off the farming scene for 1985 and possibly there will be repercussions for 1986.  We visited some of the farms and ACOT have estimated that 350 farmers had crops of every description &mdash; apples, peas, carrots, cereals, fodder and so on &mdash; wiped out in that freak night of destruction.  There is a specific problem <Col N="69" /> in that area.  The Minister and his Department are aware of this.  It has been documented fully for them by the ACOT advisory team, who have also analysed the financial consequences of everybody concerned in that area.</P>
    <P>The second part of the problem was that of flooding which has afflicted very many areas throughout the country.  We are all aware of the flooding in the Shannon basin.  The motion actually starts off by recognising that there are tragic circumstances for farmers in that basin.  This awareness was heightened for all of us by the presence of the media, television cameras, visits by EC officials, the Taoiseach and the Minister to that area.  My concern is that while specifically picking out that area as having a major problem, which we all agree it has, that same problem of flooding has affected very many other areas which have not been visited by any EC commissioner or the Taoiseach, although they probably have been visited by the Minister.  They certainly have been visited by the various ACOT officials in the different counties.  Other river basins throughout the country &mdash; including the Shannon, because I want to be fair to that area as I know how bad the situation is there &mdash; are seriously affected, for example, the Suir valley, the Nore and the Barrow, the Aherlow and the Arrow.  There are areas too numerous to mention.</P>
    <P>Just before I came into this House I spoke to a friend in Donegal who wanted to be sure, first of all, that we were aware of the problems up there.  They have had continuous rainfall in Donegal since 13 June up to and including today, with only one 24-hour period without rain.  Whole areas were practically overcome by water, for example, the Finn valley and the Leannan valley Strabane and Ballybofey were also flooded last Saturday. Shops had to be evacuated.  There was major flooding on 7 September and gales on 14 and 16 September.  Farmers have had losses running from £50,000 to £200,000.  I just want to make sure that all the areas in the country are identified and I am picking out the specific places that I can categorically prove to have <Col N="70" /> difficulties.  The information available from the ACOT offices will confirm this.</P>
    <P>All the areas affected by flooding, and all the associated consequences, are in one of the more serious categories.  There are repercussions, particularly a fodder crisis.  Most of us would identify the fodder crisis because it is an immediate problem.  It has affected not alone traditional haymaking areas.  There are still traditional haymaking areas in this country where farmers will never make silage, never made silage in the past and will never be able to make silage, much as we would ask them to do so and much as we would like them to do so.  Physically, it is impossible for them to make silage because of the level of the terrain.  We are talking about Hollyford, Cappawhite and other places.  You could not get silage machinery into them.</P>
    <P>The whole area in the west is traditionally involved in haymaking.  None of these has survived this fodder crisis.  Not alone traditional haymaking areas, but silage making areas which would in a normal year make silage, were unable to do so because the conditions underfoot made it impossible, even in good areas, to bring in the necessary silage making equipment which is large, cumbersome and heavy.  People were left with acres and acres of what normally would be silage which could not be saved because they could not get the machines on to them.</P>
    <P>The fourth item which has caused concern for all of us is the cereal crisis, or the harvest.  I recognise that because of the slight improvement in the weather in the earlier part of this month the harvest position was somehow eased.  However, that easing was confined to certain parts of the country.  There are other parts of the country that still have a cereals crisis, a harvest crisis that will not now be able to be sorted out.  Those that did survive in the harvest &mdash; and I will give some figures in the meantime &mdash; find all their yields are down.  Much of the crop is still lodged and is sprouting and could not be cut and crop that was cut and could not be saved is also sprouting.  It is frightening to see a sudden spring growth in cereals, <Col N="71" /> causing a second growth which makes the harvesting impossible.  Certainly nobody in their senses would ever try to salvage it.  Even if you did salvage it, it could never be used in a cereal context.  It could possibly be used, with some additives, for animal feeding.  It would not be very good, but it would not be a total write-off.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to people in the tillage business and they have suffered this tremendous loss.  Many of their crop yields are down and the moisture content is up.  They have had all these problems. Their biggest problem is how to plan for next year.  Some of them will now have to decide whether to go into what is a marginal area anyway.  Judging by some of the figures that have been discussed by us at ACOT meetings throughout the country, the margins in cereal growing are questionable in the best of times.  We can safely say that those who are in it have had a disastrous year, that there are no margins, and in many cases losses are actually involved.</P>
    <P>I am hoping that the Minister might this evening be able to give us some details of assistance that might be forthcoming. He should clarify the situation because there are many doubts in people's minds about what assistance is forthcoming.  If this was clarified once and for all in this House it would help to bring a hope of survival to the many thousands of farmers, small family farmers particularly, in all parts of Ireland. The psychological importance of that for them cannot be over-stressed by me or anybody else in this House.  We know that they have come out and that they have rallied to help one another when they thought there was any hope if the weather changed.  In the slight change they all rallied around one another like they did in the old days, assisting one another by way of exchanging machinery and so on.  They need some assurance from the Government and from the Community of which we are a part that we are not unmindful of their problem.  To spell out for them the assistance available will <Col N="72" /> give them some bit of confidence to go on into another year.</P>
    <P>I referred to ACOT and complimented them.  They have research figures.  Some of them have been disclosed in the newspapers and some of them have been made available to us at various councils and county committees and in discussions we have had with them.  I am sure that as the Minister commissioned the ACOT people to research the problem on the ground, he has the full information.  They will confirm that the total deficit in fodder requirements would range from 30 per cent deficit to 60 per cent and even upwards.  ACOT will confirm that almost 40 per cent of the hay which normally would be saved is not cut and we all agree now that it is completely lost.</P>
    <P>Let me give some of the figures for fodder that I have.  Two-thirds of all the hay that is saved is bad or very poor and its nutritional value is extremely low. That is about one million out of one and a half million acres of hay.  In other words, 22,275 farmers have from zero per cent to 25 per cent of their requirements.  That is over 22,000 people with big problems. They have only one-quarter of their requirements and 32,220 individual farmers have been analysed as having between 26 per cent and 50 per cent of their requirements.  That is over 32,000 people with only half of what they would need to be able to sustain their livestock over the winter.  There are 37,345 farmers with between 51 per cent and 75 per cent of their total requirements.  In other words, no farmer here is totally self-sufficient and that is a dangerous situation as farming is a very important part of our economic life.</P>
    <P>We in Tipperary have some of the better areas and we have gone out and looked at them.  Senator Willie Ryan, a colleague of mine from South Tipperary, the Fianna Fáil Party Whip, visited farms there with me recently.  We saw at first hand people with cows which were brought in on 14 August this year because they would ruin the soil if they were left out on it.  These cows were being fed this year's silage which was made in the best week of the year.  The silage is very bad <Col N="73" /> and its moisture content is very high and it is still the best silage in the country. In spite of that good silage &mdash; as they consider it and as we would consider it &mdash; and the provision of five pounds of feeding meal a day, the milk yield has dropped by 25 per cent from the comparable month last year.</P>
    <P>Those of us who remember the beautiful summer weather last year will know that milk production in August last year was at an all-time low because of the drought.  This year, with good silage as we consider it, plus the meal, they are still 25 per cent down on milk production. This worries me because people may feel that what is in their silage is good and the quantity is sufficient but when it is analysed &mdash; and ACOT will prove this &mdash; the moisture content will be so high that we have seriously to consider what advice to give them about adding other concentrates to ensure that animals will be sustained over the winter.  If we do not do that, we will be facing the next spring with widespread outbreaks of diseases that are associated with bad weather.</P>
    <P>Already we have grass tetany, not associated with the quality or quantity of grass but with the magnesium content that is in the grass.  Because of this unusual kind of late stimulated growth in grass, suckling cows particularly are subject to grass tetany which is a killer disease. If they get a widespread outbreak of it farmers could have their whole herds wiped out.  Animals would die within hours of having been afflicted with it.  We would have thousands of outbreaks of red water which is also associated with wet and dry periods.  We would have widespread outbreaks of clostridial diseases such as blackleg, affecting all animals.  We would have a wide range of animals stretching from suckling cows and cattle down to sheep and lambs all suffering from immature flukes.  I am glad to see that the advisory agencies are already telling people that it is vital now to treat for all these diseases, particularly liver fluke &mdash; and to treat them with drugs that are guaranteed to kill immature fluke because there is no point in treating animals with products that will only kill <Col N="74" /> mature flukes, because by the time another month goes by they will all be reinfected if the immature flukes survive.</P>
    <P>Cereals have been subjected to serious lodging and winter wheat is sprouting.  In some cases the moisture content is as high as 35 per cent of the total matter. Naturally, cereals with that kind of high moisture content have to be subjected to a whole process of drying.  Because the drying is so intense now, all the procedures for drying cereals have slowed up.  It adds considerably to the normal cost of drying and to the cost of the harvest itself, and allied with the 50 per cent reduction in some of the yields, you can imagine the problems that cereal farmers have.</P>
    <P>In the south east 85 per cent of the harvest has been saved, but saved at what cost?  At least, it is not a total write-off. There is 70 per cent of the spring wheat cut.  In the midlands you find that 99 per cent of winter barley has been saved and the yields are down to about two and a half tonnes.  There are about 2,000 acres of winter wheat totally abandoned in the midland region.  What has been harvested is fairly good, but the moisture content is extremely high.  A large percentage of winter oats has been harvested, but about 20 per cent will not be able to be harvested and its value will be doubtful. There is about 90 per cent of the spring barley in the south east harvested.  It is one of the most useful products because there are tremendous inter-farmer sales going on in the south east.  This is a good thing.  I was concerned when I discovered that a great deal of good straw was being purchased down in the south east and south west and going to the North, when I knew that farmers in the west would be in need of it.  Once that message got out, it became bad taste to sell what we need ourselves to somebody else for the sake of short term gain.</P>
    <P>We have protein peas which are a very important crop.  Our county is probably exceptional in that this is probably one of the few crops that survived.  In other areas it has been disastrous, with 75 per cent of the total protein pea crop being lost in many areas.  In my region we are <Col N="75" /> extremely lucky.  The cost would be something like £100 an acre for areas that have lost that crop.  Half the potato crop has been blighted and that, added to all the other harvesting problems, will have a very severe impact, not alone on the economy now but on the consumer's economy next year.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to sum up and I do not envy the Minister his job in trying to ensure that the dispersal of any aid he might have would be done on a just and fair basis across the country.  Right across the country there are critical situations that require immediate Government and Community aid.  I hope the Minister might have some details before the end of this debate and if he does not have them tonight, I hope they will be made available to the House tomorrow.  There is no doubt that money is needed to purchase roughage and if you look at the amount of roughage used with some meals, the roughage available is scarce anyway.</P>
    <P>There are 150 days left in this winter in which to maintain your cow herd if possible and the additional cost for those 150 days will run at about £60 per cow. Food vouchers are important and the Minister has talked about them.  Some people have doubts about the advantage of them.  I see many advantages in meal vouchers because they can be interchanged between people.  They will be needed to acquire additional protein rations or corn glutens or beet pulp or whatever else is available.  The Minister has been responsible for easing certain restrictions, particularly in the area of 30 day testing.  He has kindly extended that to 60 days at the request of the General Council of Agricultural Committees when they met him in Carlow.  This was instrumental in stopping panic selling within the period when people were having the normal testing carried out.  He has included heifers under the age of 12 months because technically, from the Community point of view, they are not intended for breeding at that age.  There will be some confusion because we were unable to extend the 60 day exemption <Col N="76" /> to breeding animals, cows and heifers, as we are about to go officially brucellosisfree shortly.  I am sure the Community would not allow the Minister to extend the 30 day testing to 60 days for brucellisis, but the movement in that area of easing those restrictions was very important. Up to the end of July, about 5,500 herds were locked up.  That is a problem for people who cannot sell their animals and cannot feed them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the lifting of some of the restrictions in any scheme, particularly the farm modernisation scheme, is done through his development offices and ACOT.  He should look at the whole area of silage slab grants.  He did give them to people, and they still qualify for them if they are in the farm modernisation scheme and have not made silage before.  We had a bad run two or three years ago and people stopped making silage and had not used their grants in the meantime.  They should possibly qualify again now.  That kind of easing of restrictions will help people to realise that, if there is any way in which they can help themselves, we can assist them in doing so.</P>
    <P>We should also use all the influence we can with the lending institutions.  This morning ACOT requested the lending institutions to look constructively at the problem we all have in this particular area.  The lending institutions include the ACC, the normal commercial banks and the Central Bank who have a major input in taking up the guarantee on Euro loans. That could be useful to people in the cereal business who want credit.  They do not want presents of money handed to them, but they want credit at a reasonable price to ensure that they can go into a whole re-seeding programme again for next year.  I am asking the Minister and this House to recommend the lending institutions to look favourably on any proposals put to them by the farming organisations, by individual farmers or by the Government.  Any existing loans should certainly be considered for a moratorium, particularly for the people involved in the cereal business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> Money already earmarked for development works within the Department of Agriculture could not be taken up because of the tragedy which has happened in the industry.  There are many works that people would normally have carried out and for which they would be grant aided that cannot now be carried out and there are budgetary provisions made for these.  If that kind of money is available in the Department, then certainly that should be re-distributed into these areas.</P>
    <P>The question of social welfare has been raised by many people at public meetings throughout the country.  I have had discussions with the Minister for Health and Social Welfare about this.  One of the problems is that the smallholders' assistance scheme is not really suitable.  The social welfare scheme is not suitable because it applies to the previous year's income.  Possibly the social welfare code is a bit cumbersome to apply to an emergency like this.  The initiative should really come from the Department of Agriculture. I want to say categorically that all the people I spoke to on the ground are not social welfare orientated.  They want to be given assistance to survive.  They want grants and everything else, but they want to work for them, to do something. They do not want anything handed out to them for nothing.  In other words, they are not going around with a begging bowl.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to spell out his proposals and the Community proposals. It is not just a crisis for the 100,000 farmers who are involved &mdash; and they run mostly family farms.  That would make the number of people dependent on what is going to happen something like 300,000 or 400,000.  It is not just for the farmers, although they are a very important section that we should not forget.  They are a section of whom many people at times are very critical.  Their survival will ensure the survival of the country as a whole, the survival of the national economy.</P>
    <P>For that reason, with that kind of serious implication, there is no doubt in my mind that this is a crisis for all of us, <Col N="78" /> whichever Party we represent and whether we represent people in urban or rural areas.  Each one of us will be affected by what has happened to these 100,000 family farms.  I would say to the Minister that it is on his response to this that his whole performance as Minister for Agriculture will be judged.  That is a serious thing to say to the Minister, but I say it with all the sincerity at my disposal. He has had some major successes in his Department and he has gone through many crises, between super-levies and otherwise.  But his response to this is probably how most people in Ireland, farmers and others, will judge his performance.</P>
    <P>The media are running polls on how popular people are, or are not, and what they will or will not do, but people are judged by how they will respond to the problem that is before us.  It is a major problem for the nation and one for all of us individually.  That is why my party, the smallest party in this House, decided that this was our turn for a motion to be discussed and we considered that this was important enough to warrant debate at the first sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas after the summer recess.  I am glad that the House has extended the period in which it can be debated to allow everybody who has an interest, including our colleagues in Government and Members of the Opposition who also have an interest in this.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I accept and understand the reason the Minister switched his motion from where it was to become an amendment, so to speak, to my resolution on the basis that it was a legitimate way for him to get in on this debate.  But in my original communication to the Seanad Office and to the Cathaoirleach it was my intention to ensure that however we would discuss this problem it should be done on an all-party basis, that there would be no political divide on this, because we all share a common interest in trying to do something about it.  We want to ensure that there will be a reasonable debate in this House on the problem and that all of us from the various areas we represent <Col N="79" /> and with access to information from around the country, will put our views on the record of the House to strengthen the Minister's hand both in Government and in the Community to respond positively on a matter so grave that all of us are at one on it.  How will we handle the amendment tomorrow, because the difference between the amendment and the motion is negligible?  If there is a vote on the procedure tomorrow I know that it will not take from the commitment of the Opposition to this problem or indeed the commitment from those of us on the Government side.  At the end of the day we will all be at one in saying to the Minister that something specific has to be done.  Various commitments have been given by the Government at national level.  They have to be spelled out so that there will be no doubt in people's minds how they will be helped in trying to ensure that they can go on into next year with some bit of recognition for the efforts they have put in in one of the worst years ever.  We have had very bad years, and Members of the House will remember them, but none of us will ever forget this year.  In Donegal they had only 24 hours without rain since June.  That makes it impossible to survive when one is depending on tillage.  That was repeated throughout the whole country from the corner of Donegal to west Cork and even to the sunny south east, a tillage area that has suffered tragically also.  I am moving the motion in that spirit and hope the response from the Minister will be a positive one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;calls on the Government to declare a nationwide agricultural emergency following the disastrous summer weather, and in conjunction with the EEC to implement with a minimum of delay a programme of measures <Col N="80" /> to alleviate the fodder shortage, to stop the panic-selling of cattle, to tide grain farmers where crops have been lost over until next year and to provide assistance to farmers whose land has been flooded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One might say that there is very little difference between the motion and the amendment.  I agree, but it is important that we here, on the first day of our return to work after the summer recess, should debate this very important issue which is of such importance that I thought it merited the recall of the Dáil and Seanad to discuss the crisis in Irish agriculture and to give the Government an opportunity to show the way forward and what they propose to do to help farmers.</P>
    <P>The crisis in agriculture that we now face is the worst in living memory.  The high rainfall, in particular in the past few months, has created problems that in many instances are unsurmountable. Indeed, in spite of our tremendous advance in technology, we still cannot find a suitable answer to our high rainfall. This year, of course, is an exception.  The high rainfall has put the farming community into a spin because there just seems to be no end to it.  Day after day farmers witness the complete erosion of their profits.  In many cases a lifetime of hard work has been destroyed or put at risk.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, as we all know, is our main industry.  For that reason it is of vital importance that that sector would be vibrant and thriving, that confidence would be abounding.  Unfortunately, that is not the position today.  A great part of this is due to the atrocious weather conditions, but the Government must accept blame for the lack of confidence now apparent in Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>Since their accession to power they have set about dismantling many of the schemes that were the cornerstone of Irish agriculture.  The first victim of that policy was the farm modernisation scheme which the Government suspended for a period and thereby took millions of pounds out of the pockets of Irish farmers.  That scheme over the years <Col N="81" /> helped to provide housing for our livestock, thereby getting cattle off the land for the winter period.  This is something that we have all encouraged from time to time.  We see this year that it is very essential that cattle be taken off the land as early as possible.  That scheme provided yards and yards of concrete for Irish farmers.  It helped them to improve their farm buildings, to concrete their yards, to put down silage slabs and all the other things that are so necessary to improve working conditions on Irish farms.</P>
    <P>It was a very retrograde step for the Government to have suspended the scheme for that period, and even since then it has not got the go-ahead or the same degree of urgency that it used to have &mdash; there is certainly not as much going on under that scheme as there used to be.  I believe that the Government at present are not promoting that scheme. It is unfortunate.  The same applies to the lime subsidy, another scheme that was taken off.  The AI subsidy was also taken off.  Those are schemes introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government to help farmers when they were in real need.  I cannot understand why the Government at a time like this, when agriculture is in such a crisis, cannot find the money and the means to introduce some kind of schemes like the ones Fianna Fáil introduced to try to get confidence back into agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am only listing some of the things that have happened since this Government came to office.  The Land Commission were abolished.  Down through the years the Land Commission had been a battleground for many politicians: they blamed them and they praised them for things that happened in regard to the division and acquisition of land, but the Land Commission stood the test of time and did a good job.  They were abolished overnight without being replaced by any other body.  That was wrong.  They should not have been abolished until such time as there was another body to replace them.  This opinion is shared by the farming organisations, particularly the ICMSA and other bodies.  They are concerned that the Land Commission have <Col N="82" /> not been replaced by any other body to deal with land acquisition and land division. We know what will happen if some other body like the Land Commission are not put there to act as a watchdog to see that we do not go back to the landlord days, the days of the ranchers and so on.</P>
    <P>The last straw has been the imposition of land tax on farmers.  The party moving this motion today have claimed that the imposition of this tax was a victory for their members.  We heard very little about the land tax in the past couple of months when we know that farmers are really on their knees and it is not now a question of how many millions the Government will get out of this tax or how it is to be imposed and collected &mdash; there is no talk about the land tax at present.</P>
    <P>I refer to those things just to highlight the fact that the development of agriculture is not a very high priority with the Government.  It is not surprising, therefore, that they are slow to come to the assistance of farmers in the present crisis. For many months the county committees of agriculture, the farming organisations and, indeed, everybody connected with agriculture have been highlighting the problems facing the farmers and trying to get the Government to listen and to act, but to date I am sorry to say no positive plan of action has emerged.</P>
    <P>For our part, the Fianna Fáil group have been meeting and have tried to press the Government into some kind of action.  We put forward some proposals that we feel would be of assistance to farmers in the present crisis.  These include immediate financial aid for farmers seriously affected, particularly those in the Shannon Basin, restoration of and increase in the small farmers' unemployment assistance, an increase in headage payments to the maximum allowed and the restoration of the pre 1982 calf subsidy for calves born before 1 October 1985, a speeding up of payments of headage grants so as to create an immediate cash flow and a scheme to encourage the retention of stock, an extension of headage payments for newly designated disadvantage areas to this <Col N="83" /> year and not next year, the provision of low fixed interest rate loans through the European Investment Bank, the reintroduction of full carcase beef intervention and export refunds immediately to maintain prices, pooling of surplus fodder to be encouraged through co-ops and farm organisations, the banks and the ACC to help farmers to bridge their present difficulties, without interest penalties.</P>
    <P>Those are the proposals the Fianna Fáil Agricultural Committee have put forward. I believe that it is within the power of the Government to aid farmers immediately by implementing some of the measures which I have suggested here this evening.  We know that assistance has been promised to farmers in the Shannon Basin.  From my experience of that area I do not grudge the farmers there any assistance they will get.  I believe the maximum amount that will be available for any one farmer is £500.  I do not think that is enough.  It certainly will not compensate any farmer who has lost his hay or his silage or his grain crop.</P>
    <P>I wonder how the Government propose to define the Shannon Basin, because when you look at the Shannon you immediately think of the Suck, which is a tributary of the Shannon, and which has been flooded over the past few month.  I am sure Senator O'Connor who comes from that area will have heard the voices of the Roscommon farmers who have suffered from flooding along the basin of the river Suck.  Are they to get the same assistance as the people along the Shannon Basin?  I believe they should because they are just as badly affected. That region extends right down into East Galway.  There are two tributaries of the Suck which are very seriously affected by the flooding.  All farmers along that area are entitled to the same type of assistance and, unless they get it, they will not be satisfied.</P>
    <P>The second point I will refer to is the restoration of and increase this year in the small farmers' unemployment assistance. The Government have shown very little sympathy for people who have been getting small farmers' assistance.  A few <Col N="84" /> years ago most of them were drawing this kind of assistance and it was needed to supplement their incomes from their small farms.  In the past two years we have seen the social welfare officers clamp down on those farmers.  They investigated their means and in most cases the assistance was disallowed.  In a year like this it has imposed considerable hardship on those people because many of them were getting up to £50 and £60 and more per week and now they have to find that kind of money to replace that assistance.  As well, they are faced with the problem of the extra expense of finding fodder and meal for their cattle. The Minister for Social Welfare should show a little more compassion this year for those small farmers.</P>
    <P>The Government have it in their own power to help a very large number of farmers by an extension of the headage payment scheme.  The 12 western counties are in the disadvantaged area category and all those within the severely handicapped area qualify for headage grants.  The Government have the power to pay those people the maximum rate of grants and they will be backed pound for pound by the EC.  So far they have refused to do that.  I appeal to the Minister here this evening to increase those grants immediately because by doing so he would be helping a large number of farmers along the western seaboard who are seriously affected.  I appeal to the Minister to do that.</P>
    <P>The banks and other lending institutions are not too slow to look for their pound of flesh in November or May, whenever payments are due, and I hope that this year particularly the lending institutions will be more sympathetic to farmers who find themselves in trouble. We in the Galway County Committee of Agriculture met bank and ACC representatives and discussed the problem with them.  We asked them to lay off this year, not to press farmers who cannot make payments on time.  I suggest that the Government should use some muscle on the banks in a year like this to get them to ease off their demands in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> Farmers have been selling their stock at giveaway prices.  There has been panic selling in the past two months.  Mart sales have increased substantially, particularly of small store cattle.  It is unfortunate that farmers find it necessary to sell such cattle because next year the results of that type of panic selling will be felt throughout the land.  All farmers should be discouraged from going to the marts.  They should get every encouragement to hold cattle over.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised that Irish farmers would be supplied with intervention wheat.  I am not sure if that is the right thing to do and I hope the Minister will explain the position here tonight.  I hope he will tell us how the wheat will be distributed and if it is grain that will be distributed instead of cash.  Will it be very costly to distribute the grain?  Will the distribution be the responsibility of ACOT officers in different counties?  I hope the Minister will tell us about the type of scheme he has in mind.  I hope that in the allocation of grain from intervention grain producers at home will not be hurt.  We must be very careful about that because we know such producers have suffered enough already &mdash; they have had enormous trouble trying to harvest the crops this year and have had the extra costs attached to drying their grain.</P>
    <P>I have been told by farmers throughout County Galway that the extension of the 30-days testing to 60 days will not be a success unless brucellosis testing can be extended.  Many farmers who have heifers to sell are not to get the same facilities as people selling bullocks.  Perhaps the Minister could reconsider this and do something about it.  Farmers who have locked up herds deserve our sympathy at any time but they should be given special concessions in a year like this.  They should be given extra cash or grain if they cannot dispose of their stock.</P>
    <P>In the short time I had I think I have outlined the problems facing Irish farmers. I know the Minister is doing his best to get as much as he can for the farmers.  I hope he will get more support from his Cabinet colleagues &mdash; I am afraid many of them are not too well disposed to our farmers.  Agriculture is <Col N="86" /> going through a terrible crisis.  If the farmers cannot survive it, it will be a bad day for Ireland's economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate with great interest, particularly because the matter discussed is of major importance to our greatest indigenous industry.  I have been deeply involved personally in the efforts being taken and those yet to be launched to help to alleviate the very serious situation in which so many of our farmers have found themselves through no fault of their own.</P>
      <P>The weather since June last has truly been disastrous &mdash; I cannot think of another word &mdash; in its effects on many farmers throughout the entire country but particularly in the western counties. They have seen their hay destroyed or rendered of little value for feeding purposes. They have lost crops such as cereals. But, of course, their biggest worry has been the loss of fodder supplies to maintain their livestock over the winter months.  Farmers who depended on saving hay were particularly badly hit.</P>
      <P>We can be thankful that the ACOT campaign to encourage farmers to change from the saving of hay to the making of silage, which is much less vulnerable to weather conditions, has had a fair measure of success.  Otherwise the problems would be even more severe now.  Since the wet summer of 1980 the switch from hay to silage had gathered momentum.  It was helped by the first-time silage making schemes of 1980, 1981 and 1982 which were financed from Exchequer and Community funds.  As a result some 60 per cent of the fodder saved is now in the form of silage and some 40 per cent hay. This is a very considerable improvement on the position that obtained, say, ten years ago.  But it still is not enough, and this year's bad weather has shown that it is not enough.  In our climatic conditions large numbers of farmers cannot just rely on hay alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the western counties in particular, <Col N="87" /> too many farmers still rely mainly on hay for winter fodder.  I appreciate that it is not always possible or easy to change to silage.  The physical properties of their land do not lend themselves so readily to silage making.  In other instances suitable equipment for this form of securing fodder is not readily to hand.  Also some older farmers may show a natural reluctance to try out a new system.  Then again the transport of feed to outwintered stock is much easier when the feed is in the form of hay.  There is also the consideration that hay is more convenient for calves.  But the message of this year's weather is quite clear.  Farmers who still make hay only and do not make silage are at great risk.  They are dependent on the vagaries of the weather and, if the weather is bad, they are in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>I have kept in close personal contact with developments since the start of the crisis and have visited various parts of the country to acquire first-hand knowledge of the situation.  I have also had a number of meetings with farmer representatives and farm organisations to discuss the problem.  I also went to Brussels on 28 August and met the Vice-President of the EC Commission, Commissioner Andriessen.  With a view to obtaining Community assistance I outlined to him the exceptional difficulties that were confronting a large body of Irish farmers. More immediately then I sought the introduction of EC intervention for beef carcases with a view to helping to stabilise market prices here for cattle.  The measures in this connection were later agreed and full intervention is to apply next week for three weeks.  I regret that this period is not really long enough.</P>
    <P>We would have liked eight weeks of intervention for full carcases, and at the very minimum six weeks, but the Commission have particular difficulties at the moment in that they have a huge supply of beef in intervention, a total of some 750,000 tonnes.  This is proving to be most expensive for the Commission and they are finding it most difficult to get rid of <Col N="88" /> it.  As Senators may have read in the papers during the week, they have agreed to the sale of 200,000 tonnes to the Soviet Union at a considerably reduced price. That gets 200,000 tonnes of beef out of intervention and therefore creates a more buoyant market place for beef.  Irrespective of the selling price we are glad to see it being moved from intervention as it may improve the prospects of full intervention being extended, but three weeks is an inadequate period and I stated this at last week's meeting of the Council of Ministers and we received considerable support from other countries including France, Italy and Germany.  I hope the Commission will review the situation and have a change of heart over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>A major anxiety is to prevent the selling of young cattle, especially by farmers worried about the prospects of their being able to maintain their cattle over the winter months.  To help cattle farmers we are speeding up headage inspections, and I have extended from 30 to 60 days the period of the pre-movement tests for cattle under the TB eradication scheme. These measures are designed to give more flexibility to farmers in deciding on the disposal of their stock and at the same time to discourage panic selling.  I am glad to say prices for cattle have stabilised.</P>
    <P>At the same time, with a view to alleviating the serious fodder shortage I announced on 8 August the introduction of a nitrogen fertiliser subsidy scheme and a subsidy for first-time silage making, the latter being on the lines of a somewhat similar measure adopted in 1980, 1981 and 1982.  It was hoped that the use of the fertiliser would induce a late growth of grass and thereby enable a late cut of silage to be made.  The cost of these two measures is £2.5 million which is being borne by the Exchequer.  The weather has, however, militated somewhat against the full successful operation of these measures in some areas, particularly in the west.  Nevertheless the degree of farmer participation in the schemes has been most encouraging and I hope <Col N="89" /> that the schemes will make a useful contribution towards alleviating the shortage of fodder.</P>
    <P>As a result of the continuous rain, extensive flooding occurred in the valley of the River Shannon in the middle of August.  The floods have resulted in many farmers in the area losing their entire winter fodder supplies.  It is estimated that some 3,000 farmers are affected to some degree in the Shannon valley and, in view of the urgency of the situation and the severe losses incurred, it was decided to announce quickly some measures of assistance for the flooded area.  It was accordingly announced on 6 September that arrangements would be made for the payment to farmers in the Shannon Valley affected by the floods of the sum of £20 per livestock unit up to a maximum of 25 livestock units per farmer, that is a maximum payment of £500.  Payments will be confined to people who are mainly dependent on farming and have not more than 60 livestock units.  The total cost which is estimated at £1 million will be met from the Exchequer also.  The detailed arrangements for the scheme have now been finalised and are being announced today.  Application forms will be available at local offices of the Farm Development Service in Counties Galway, Roscommon, Offaly, Westmeath, Longford and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>While some limited progress in saving fodder has recently been made and some further progress can be expected over the next few weeks, the overall position is already reasonably clear.  It has been calculated that the losses of hay range from about 10 per cent to 20 per cent in the south-east, to about 70 per cent in the west and north-west where hay constitutes the bulk of the winter fodder.</P>
    <P>I should say that, arising out of my discussion with Vice-President Andriessen at the end of August, it was arranged that EC officials would come here to see for themselves the extent of the damage.  The Commission's Director-General for Agriculture with a colleague came here a fortnight ago and was able to get an idea of the losses sustained at <Col N="90" /> first hand.  I should like to express my appreciation of the helpful attitude of the Commissioner and his officials.</P>
    <P>On their visit they saw, for instance, the Mulcaire Valley in East Limerick which constitutes part of the Golden Vale which Senator Ferris referred to.  They also saw conditions in and around Athlone, particularly south Roscommon. They saw the bulk of the centre and the west of Ireland by helicopter.  They saw the area around Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim and are under no illusion as to the magnitude of the problem.  They have recognised the serious problems that exist and are seeking to help us as far as they can.  It is not an easy time for the Commission to give money.  Budgetary constraints are very very severe and are comparable with our own domestic difficulties.  Nevertheless they are prepared to help.</P>
    <P>Last week the Government considered what further response they should make to the crisis and they authorised me to approach the EC Commission with certain proposals with a view to seeking Community aid for the measures envisaged. Over the past few days I have had discussions in this regard with Vice-President Andriessen in Luxembourg and as a result we have some information from Brussels this evening in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the form of aid which we have in mind, the major problem confronting many farmers, mainly small and medium size farmers, is a shortage of winter fodder.  What these farmers need is some cereal feed which could be used to supplement the reduced supplies of fodder.  In this respect the Commission may be able to assist us by providing a substantial quantity of intervention grain at a specially reduced price.  The quantity of grain involved is 125,000 tonnes and the price reduction involved is 25 per cent.  The benefit of this price reduction and of a substantial contribution by the Exchequer will be applied to farmers who have a serious fodder problem.  Obviously, the resources that will be available from EC and Exchequer sources will have to be directed to the farmers in greatest need.  Thus, the aid will apply to <Col N="91" /> farmers who are mainly dependent on agriculture and who have not more than a certain number of livestock.</P>
    <P>I might also say that the distribution of vouchers would not be confined to the western counties but would apply to eligible farmers in all parts of the country who have serious fodder problems.  That incorporates the spirit of the motion before us.  We have difficulties all over the country.  For instance County Meath may appear to be a particularly affluent county with very good quality land but a sizeable number of farmers in County Meath have fodder problems, though not as great as the numbers in some western counties.  It would be improper to differentiate between people in trouble, so the scheme will apply nationally.</P>
    <P>A point I wish to emphasise is that the aid measure, including the use of reduced price intervention grain, will be operated in a way that will not upset the cereals market.  This aspect of great importance to cereal producers and to the grain trade is easily overlooked.  Clearly, we should not do anything which might disrupt normal trading activities, thereby adding to the difficulties of cereal growers and causing upset to those engaged in the grain trade.  The kind of arrangement we have in mind is to distribute feed vouchers to eligible farmers with fodder problems. These vouchers would be valid against the purchase of cereal feed.  In other words, they would be used by eligible farmers as cash, and normal market conditions would not be upset.  The vouchers would be redeemed by my Department from traders, and the Department will have discussions with the trade about this and about the handling of any intervention grain.</P>
    <P>Senators will understand that if there were a major movement of grain from the intervention stores in the EC on to the Irish market it would cause tremendous difficulties for the home trade.  We must be very careful to see that the quantity brought in is not damaging to the domestic trade but, nevertheless, that it comes in at a reduced price and is of <Col N="92" /> considerable benefit to the people in difficulty.</P>
    <P>During the current month some improvement in the weather has enabled considerable progress to be made in saving hay and making silage and in harvesting cereal crops.  Of course, substantial losses had already occurred and, for example, the winter wheat was severely affected.  There can, however, to be no question of having all losses for all farmers offset by the Exchequer, with some EC aid.  What the Government can do, and what they are doing, is to make a generous amount of aid available to the most vulnerable farmers.  In doing this we are mindful of having a useful amount of EC support.</P>
    <P>I referred to winter grain which has been very severely affected by the severe weather.  Winter wheat accounts for something less than 20 per cent of the total grain grown in this country, nevertheless 20 per cent is a significant proportion and there have been heavy losses by people who have been growing winter wheat.  About 65 per cent of all cereals grown in the country would be spring barely and, while there have been difficulties with all forms of grain, spring barely has been saved in many places in reasonably good condition, but that is by far the biggest variety.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, be very satisfactory if we could afford an aid scheme which would apply across the board to all farmers in an area or region.  Indeed, such a scheme would be very welcome from an administration point of view.  However, the amount of Exchequer resources which can be made available makes it necessary to be selective and to confine aid to those who have a significant fodder shortage and whose own resources are limited.  In the present difficult Exchequer situation it just would not be possible to justify giving aid to all and sundry whether they need it or not, so the point raised by Senator Hussey does not arise.  It is all very well to say that you should increase headage payments in the seriously disadvantaged areas or in all disadvantaged areas whether they are seriously or moderately disadvantaged. <Col N="93" /> That would be very easy for my Department to administer but there would not be equity in such a scheme.  You would not be able to finance the problems of people in other areas if you were to have such a blanket scheme.</P>
    <P>As well as that, people in other sectors of the community would feel particularly aggrieved that some people who did not have a problem were getting Exchequer support.  No Government could justify that.  For instance, the 230,000 unemployed would feel very annoyed that they were not going to get any extra assistance. It is not entirely practical to do it and, moreover, it is not fair to do it in such a blanket manner.  That option was considered but it was dismissed on the grounds of equity.  If aid were given to every farmer, then less would be given to those who really need it.  What we need is a scheme which is directed towards those most in need and to see that whatever money is available will be directed to genuine hardship cases.  If it were given to people on an overall basis there would be very little for anybody and it would not be a fair scheme.</P>
    <P>Of course, farmers can do much to help themselves, and this is what many thousands of them have been doing particularly when weather conditions permitted in recent weeks.  In addition, several co-operative societies have been most active in organising the movement of fodder from surplus areas to areas where heavy losses of fodder have occurred.  We owe a debt of thanks to ICOS who have arranged the movement of large quantities of hay and particularly straw from the eastern part of the country to the western areas.  Some individual co-operatives on their own initiative had started such movements before ICOS became directly involved but they have played a very significant part in recent weeks.  It is disturbing to see considerable movement of hay and straw from the South to the Six Counties.  People wonder why it cannot be stopped.  It is like any trade within the Community, particularly agricultural trade.  You cannot stop the free movement of commodities.  We <Col N="94" /> depend on our exports of agricultural produce and it would ill behove us to be seen to stop movement from one part of the Community to another, so while it is somewhat disturbing it is something over which we do not have any control.  I hope that sufficient fodder will be transferred from the eastern part of the country to the west to solve whatever difficulties may exist which that fodder will help to alleviate.  This has involved an added bonus because it has provided a cash market for cereal straw which might otherwise have been burned.  Senators will notice that they do not see cereal straw being burned this year as in previous years.  Most of it is too wet and probably would not burn.  A little of it is burned here and there but it is very bad quality straw and not worth while to bale. There have also been losses of cereals and the weather has affected other crops such as peas.  The pea crop has been disastrous.  It has been very severely hit and very little of the pea crop has been saved in any reasonable condition.  It is a pity because it was the first year when people went out in a big way to try to grow peas as an alternative to soya beans which must be imported.  Having had their fingers burnt, so to speak, people will be very slow to repeat the exercise next year.  It is an expensive crop to sow and the losses have been very considerable. It is unfortunate from several points of view.  Oil seed rape also has not been very good this year.  There have been considerable losses in places but not as bad as in the pea crop and some of it has been saved in reasonable condition.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem, however, is the losses of hay, and our main efforts have been directed towards alleviating that serious problem.  The harvesting of cereal crops and the saving of fodder are, of course, still in progress and I am sure that farmers generally are making the most of any favourable weather.</P>
    <P>The practical effects of the aid measures which the Government and the EC are putting forward are as follows.  As I have said, the EC are making 125,000 tonnes of grain available from intervention at a price reduced by 25 per cent. <Col N="95" /> The value of that we estimate to be about £4,250,000.  As well as that the EC will bear the cost of transport of the grain to this country.  That will run into something approaching £2 million as transport costs are quite high.  The Government are providing a sum of £15 million.  This includes the £1 million already announced for the Shannon valley but it does not include the £2,500,000 which was announced for the silage and nitrogen subsidy.  All in all you have a scheme which will be worth to Irish farmers in excess of £20 million, even excluding the transport costs to the EC.</P>
    <P>At this time I cannot commit any further national aid but, subject to this, I shall continue to keep the situation under review to see whether we might help in any other way.  People will always say that measures are not adequate no matter what you provide but I consider that in very difficult circumstances a total sum in excess of £20 million is a reasonable figure which will go a long way towards alleviating the genuine hardship which exists.</P>

      <P>He says that there is a 25 per cent reduction on the intervention price.  Would he relate for us the actual price?  I understand the market price in Ireland is above the intervention price. What in effect is the value of a tonne of grain to a farmer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his excellent performance in delivering this sort of package to seriously affected Irish farmers at this time.  The <Col N="96" /> figure of £20 million is very significant, very substantial, and if properly channelled should go a long distance towards alleviating the problems which exist.  I congratulate the Minister, his two Ministers of State and, indeed, the entire Government for their vigilance and diligence in recent weeks in ensuring that we got this outcome.</P>
      <P>It is of paramount importance that the money which will become available is channelled in the right direction, that it is given to deserving cases.  There is no point in channelling money to places where that money is not needed.  For that reason I believe that every case must be specially identified, specially classified and money channelled towards it accordingly. I am glad to learn from the Minister's remarks that that will be the approach, and with effective and proper adjudication of deserving cases it will help enormously in the problems which exist.  As the Minister stated, no matter what figure is announced it would fall short of meeting in total the losses that have been sustained by farmers in recent times, but I do not believe that anybody would expect that we would be in a position to meet in full all the losses which have been sustained.  It is impossible to quantify precisely the total losses as a result of the disastrous rainfall this year, but it is a very high figure.  We have just come out of or are still in a national natural disaster, although in recent weeks we have had some dry weather which helps to alleviate a very serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the major area of difficulty is winter feed.  We have the other problem areas which we cannot ignore such as the serious losses in cereals, potatoes, sugar beet and other crops.  We have reduced yields, poor quality, high moisture etc., but the main loss is concerned with the winter feed and its associated areas, by which I mean the production of milk and beef and the maintenance of store cattle.  Dairy animals were in eating silage in the middle of August of this year, and not in isolated cases.  In many parts of the country animals were taken off pasture because of waterlogged conditions and had to be put in to eat silage. <Col N="97" /> That should not happen sooner than November or even later.  Farmers who were unable to make a second cut silage have already made heavy inroads into their first cut silage and that in itself, regardless of the location, remains a problem.  Many farmers would have been able to make a second cut silage in recent weeks, but let us be realistic: there are still many farmers throughout the country who have not done so.  This problem is most serious in the western areas.  We have people who are still unable to make any quantity of silage and the grass remains growing throughout the year. We hope it will be cut and ensiled in the coming weeks but up to this moment in a sizable portion of the country people have been unable to operate machines to ensile grass.  Some farmers have absolutely no winter fodder whatsoever, although their number is reducing.</P>
    <P>I refer very strongly to that I consider a very serious consequence of this fodder matter.  The indications are that by springtime there will be difficulties by reason of poor quality feed being fed to animals.  This could result in a high level of mortality in stock.  We also have the more immediate problem of people engaging in panic selling of stock.  Perhaps those who had a limited number of cattle &mdash; maybe eight or ten &mdash; for sale sold them in a very rushed manner and at a very poor price, perhaps £100 or more less than what they would have been making 12 months ago.  That is a serious reality and, unfortunately, it continues to be the case.</P>
    <P>While cattle prices have stabilised, anybody here familiar with the cattle scene will acknowledge that small cattle are still being sold at giveaway prices. The measure the Minister has just talked about &mdash; the provision of grain at a cheap price &mdash; will help to keep those small cattle off the market until they are worth the price that is appropriate and proper to what they would normally be commanding. I am convinced that, if those cattle can be kept and sold in an orderly fashion, not necessarily right through the whole winter, they will command proper prices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> Let us acknowledge reality.  Many people are well fortified in regard to fodder and are well able to buy these small cattle from people who are obligated to sell them.  This is something we cannot legislate or regulate for but it is a fact of life that some people have an ample supply of silage, of hay or of a combination of the two and who can buy a lot of stock at this time at, unfortunately, these very giveaway prices and from people who can least afford to part with their stock at such prices.  We must do everything we can to ensure that the weak do not get weaker and the strong get stronger at the expense of the weaker. This is something we must positively address ourselves to in so far as is appropriate and proper.</P>
    <P>One cannot interfere with free trade, private enterprise and so on but I would say to the Minister that the price of cattle is usually a fair barometer of how things are in any country.  We must not be misled by the fact that beef animals and large store animals near the beef stage are commanding good prices.  We must be very conscious of the fact that the cattle down the line are at such giveaway prices and acknowledge that.  For that reason we must channel most of the money that is available here, in kind or whatever, towards the people who have these stock to make sure they do not sell them.  In that way we will be doing a great service to the individual and to the nation.  We will be ensuring good stock for the future and we will be ensuring the continuance in farming of farmers who would otherwise be forced totally out of farming. There are some people at the moment who are on the brink of being forced out of farming.</P>
    <P>The whole area of credit will be vital in the time ahead.  Many may not agree with this, but I believe that the European currency loans to the ACC and the banks of £100 million presently due for repayment in the next couple of months ought to be extended for one year.  In addition, to meet farmer requirements in the credit area, relating to cereals, livestock and so on, we need further European money at a reasonable price.  I am talking about 6 <Col N="99" /> per cent or 7 per cent and we would need, perhaps, about £100 million in order to meet the very serious problems that have arisen as a result of this disastrous year.</P>
    <P>The State, the lending agencies and, indeed, individuals combined could be asked to share the exchange risks of foreign currency money.  The risks may not be that great.  They may not be much at all but perhaps if we had a combination of sharing it would help significantly to overcome the problems we have.  With regard to credit, it is essential that that happens.</P>
    <P>A point I wish to stress is that in the areas of the country where there is no fibrous material for the feeding of stocks in the coming months, no matter what meals are made available we need roughage, straw and hay.  There is a lot of straw in the country but there is the question of the transportation of that straw from the areas where it is to the areas that do not have straw, hay or any roughage material.  Indeed, the ICOS, the central organisation of co-operatives, are to be complimented on the excellent initiative they have shown in having this straw transported vast distances from areas where the straw is available.  Individual co-operative societies have done trojan work both through the ICOS and on their own bat in getting that fodder across.</P>
    <P>We have had a position that is unique this year where people have talked about the massive year it has been for grass. That is true but it came to a very abrupt ending at the end of July or in August and for that reason we should not be carried away with this great year.  While people may have maintained milk yields, succeeded in keeping beef animals moving along, thriving and so on, it all has been at a very high cost and this all has to be paid for.  In the long run, the Irish farmer after this year will be in a very serious position and in my view will be in need of a helping hand in order to continue in farming in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Finally, at the risk of repeating myself, we must look at agriculture next year and in the years that follow and ensure there is sufficient investment in the industry so <Col N="100" /> that people can develop along the proper lines.  For that reason I stress very strongly that we need foreigh currency money, a Euro loan at the right price. Money being made available to farming must be at a fixed price and farmers must be aware that it will remain at that price for a certain length of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be as joyous as are some Members on the other side of the House.  When I had originally prepared what I wished to say on this matter I had not read the Minister's speech.  His proposal to make available to farmers through direct Government aid and EC aid a total of £20 million is totally ridiculous. The loss to farmers from the bad weather over the past couple of months has been estimated at in the region of £400 million and that is put down as a conservative estimate.  The Minister is now proposing to make up 5 per cent of the total losses that have befallen the farmers in the past three or four months. This is the extent of the aid that is to be provided at the moment.  The amount proposed is not the equivalent of the doubling of the headage payments in disadvantaged areas, not to talk of taking into account spreading that money over the entire Twenty-six Counties.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be hailed by the Government side tonight as having done a good job in securing this package but it will do nothing for farming.  His proposals, like the earlier proposals which he tells us will cost £2.5 million, for a silage and manure subsidy were of little help to farmers.  The silage subsidy as proposed would apply to only about 2 per cent of farmers.  Those farmers who were able to avail of the nitrigen subsidy and who spread nitrigen on the land are not in a position to cut the silage on that land. The Minister's proposal tonight to give £1 million for flooding along the Shannon is less than the amount of headage grants paid in the area within a mile of the Shannon.  This is sad, but it is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time that the Minister and his officials and the Government reassessed what they are proposing to give to farmers. Do they realise that one is talking <Col N="101" /> in terms of £20 million spread over the entire farming population?  Let us remember that farmers throughout the country are in a serious situation.  How much grain has been lost?  How much milk has been lost through the drop in the milk yield?  How much beef has been lost due to the fact that the average beef animals this summer put on approximately 1 cwt to 1½ cwt less than would be the case in a normal year.  That in itself is a loss of approximately £100 per livestock unit in the beef sector alone.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities at page 11 of their 21st Report would do a great deal to alleviate the hardship.  They recommended also the bringing forward of intervention arrangements for carcase beef.  We now have intervention for the next three weeks only.  The Minister said that for this to be effective he would have hoped to have eight weeks and at least a minimum of six weeks intervention for carcase beef.  How many of the cattle that are suitable for intervention will be slaughtered here in the next three weeks? Instead of helping to preserve jobs here, the slaughter of those cattle will benefit other parts of the EC and our near neighbours in Northern Ireland who have a different intervention arrangement and one which is more beneficial than the arrangement available to farmers in the south of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There were requests by various organisations for the Minister to double the headage payments in disadvantaged areas.  He does not seem willing to do this despite the fact that payment would be 50 per cent or pound for pound funded by the EC.  In other words, the Government are not prepared to back the EC funds that are available pound for pound to help farmers who are in real need.  The biggest losses so far as farming is concerned have been in the west and north-west and also in the tillage areas of the midlands.  The position is that many farmers in the west and north-west have no fodder at all.  They are now buying straw to use as roughage in the coming winter. Yet, if they are to feed their animals an <Col N="102" /> average of six pounds of meal per day for the six months of winter, one is talking in terms of a farmer spending £80 to £90 per animal to buy feedstuff alone.</P>
    <P>What the Minister proposes here tonight, with intervention grain at £136 per tonne, is out.  One has also to take into account the handling charges the merchants will add to the cost of that grain.  What price will it finish up at when it arrives at the farmer's gate?  What will be the cost per tonne to the farmer when it is delivered?  Will we have the old case that happened before where the middle-men will take what was meant to go to the small man?  The grain merchants will benefit from another voucher type scheme such as happened in 1974.  The effects of this farming crisis have not been felt either by the farmers or by people in our cities or towns but they will be felt in the next six months.  Farmers will not have the necessary funds to buy the necessaries of life for themselves and their families in many cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris mentioned the fact that social welfare for farmers would be assessed on last year's income.  I call on the Minister for Social Welfare to assess any farmer who applies for unemployment assistance or any social welfare payment on today's income and not on his income in 1984.  The problem did not exist last year.  There is no point in telling one of these farmers that he will be assessed on his 1984 income because he will be out of business.  His family will have suffered and so too will the country. It is important that we as a body ask the Minister for Social Welfare to tell his officers who investigate cases of hardship among people applying for unemployment assistance to assess these cases on the basis of current income.  Any unemployed person is assessed on the basis of present income.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also mentioned some of the other schemes he tried to bring in in the past few weeks to help out farmers. He extended the 30-day testing regulations but that is not of much benefit if one arrives at a custom post or an export port trying to move cattle to Northern Ireland or England.  A 30-day test is not <Col N="103" /> acceptable except for 30 days and the export certificate after 30 days is of no value.  The same is the position with regard to female stock and brucellosis. Therefore, the Minister's changes in the regulations are of little or no benefit to farmers when it comes to selling their cattle.  It means that if they are going to sell them at a sale without having their export certificate, the number of people anxious to buy them will be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Minister is not here to hear some of what I have to say. I have no doubt that the Minister of State will tell him what I have said.  I appeal to him to go back and look at the situation and realise that the proposals they have brought before this House tonight as their aid for agriculture are nothing but a drop in the ocean so far as the losses of farmers are concerned.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland will, as a result of the present crisis, lose many of the small family farms which we all cherish and talk about and say should be kept.  If finance is not provided in the hour of need, how can they be expected to be there in 12 or 18 months time?  Many of them will be forced to sell off their stock, possibly in many cases to sell off their land and never be in a position to go back into farming again.  The money they will receive for that stock will be needed to feed their families.  They will not be in a position to go to the bank manager in six or 12 months time and say they want money to restock their farms.  I know what they would be told by bank managers.  I know what many of them are being told by bank managers already: &ldquo;you pay your loans, we are not worried about the weather, our commitment is to our shareholders and to the people who have money on deposit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When one considers the money being provided by the Government in the light of the money that was provided by them for the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, one realises the difference between our major national resource, agriculture, and what is thought of some of the lending institutions of this country.  If the <Col N="104" /> Government could find money for ICI, why can they not find money now for the farmers?  Farming is our biggest industry. It is our biggest source of income.  It is the only natural resource we have as a country and let us not now sell it out for the sake of a reasonable amount of money being provided.  We provided money for the rescue of many other companies, semi-State and otherwise.  This Government have done so during their lifetime and other Governments have done so also.  But now the major resource of this country is going to be sold down the Swannee because the Government, even with the help of EC aid, are only prepared to provide approximately £22 million.  The Government commitment is approximately £18 million.  That is how much they are prepared to provide for the farmers.</P>
    <P>I would at this late stage call on the Minister to implement the proposals that were put to him by the various farming organisations.  I call on him to go back to the Government immediately and to go back to the EC if necessary to get the required funds to rescue agriculture. There is no use in throwing a lifebelt when a man has drowned.  What is being done here now is that the lifebelt that is being thrown is not sufficient to hold the man up.  It is the very same as if you gave a drowning man a leaf of paper to hang on to.  It is no good.  What I would say to the Minister here tonight is go back, examine your figures, talk to the farming organisations, ask them what they think of the moneys that you are providing, ask them what that money will do for Irish agriculture.  I know what it is going to do. It is going to mean that many of the small family farmers of this country will go by the board.  Many of our more efficient farmers who are in tillage or in livestock or in milk will also be forced to scale down their operations due to the losses they have suffered this year.</P>
    <P>Many of the grain farmers will, in my opinion, not be in a position to sow their land next year.  They will not have the finance available to them to buy the seeds, to buy the manures, to buy the oils for their tractors to plough the land.  We <Col N="105" /> can all talk about straw being moved to the west of Ireland but straw without sufficient meal is not of any great advantage to cattle.  Every farmer here will know that.  Earlier I suggested that it would take in the region of £90 in money to keep an animal in meal over the winter. I was being conservative and allowing for six pounds of meal to be fed for 180 days of winter.  The Government must bring in a realistic farm policy even if that means borrowing more money because I have no doubt that if it was a different section of the community of this country who were in trouble the money would be borrowed no matter what the cost was.  As I said earlier, money could be found for ICI, money could be found for Irish Steel and I hope that money will be found for the farmers.</P>

      <P>First, I should like to sympathise with the Minister on this great natural calamity at a rather difficult period for agriculture anyway in the EC. However, I would like to congratulate him on the efforts he has made to date to alleviate some of the stress caused by this great natural disaster.  In addition, I would like to thank him for his announcement here tonight of immediate aid for those farmers in distress.</P>
      <P>From my own inquiries and indeed experience in speaking to farmers I find that the two commodities in scarce supply at the moment are winter fodder and finance.  As the Minister has said already, a subsidy on fodder, on winter grain, would seem to be far more acceptable to the farming community and to the community at large than direct cash payments. However, as the Minister pointed out, it is important that we identify the people who are most in need of this support and this aid and that the scheme will be implemented with speed and efficiency and will not be restricted in any way by bureaucracy and that those people who are so urgently in need of this aid will get it as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding direct financial problems relating to farmers, the previous speaker, Senator Hourigan, referred to the extension of EC currency loans to the ACC <Col N="106" /> and I certainly would agree with him in this regard.  I would also like to urge both the banks and the ACC to exercise as much restraint as possible in demands on repayments on existing loans from farmers who are in trouble.  I would even recommend that they defer payments for some time and maybe spread them over a period of time.  The co-ops could play a very important role in co-operating with the banks in making loans available to farmers and I would suggest that repayments could be made from the farmers' accounts through the co-ops to the banks, again over a period of time until the problem is alleviated.  I have first hand experience of this problem in north Kerry and I feel that the bigger more efficient farmer has not been affected to the same extent as the smaller farmer.  We must recognise, as Senator Ellis has said, that the small farmer is in trouble and is in danger of extinction unless we help him immediately.  The loss of the smallholders assistance to many small farmers is not helping the matter.  No doubt many of the small farmers who are in receipt of smallholders assistance were assessed during the summers of 1983 and 1984. These were summers when even small farmers enjoyed prosperity due to the fine weather.  This summer must be taken into consideration and I would strongly recommend that appeals and fresh applications for smallholders assistance, or the dole as it is called should be speeded up. This could help in a big way to ease the problems for the small farmer.</P>
    <P>Whereas I welcome the schemes already initiated by the Minister towards helping the small farmers and indeed all farmers, the small farmer, due to a number of reasons, did not avail to the same extent as bigger farmers or more organised farmers of the grant that was made available during the past two months.  This is due to financial restraints and perhaps tradition.  The small farmer, in north Kerry anyway, is not ready yet to go into silage making.  The land was very wet and the cost of making silage is prohibitive.  In addition, much of the hay had rotted into the ground at the stage <Col N="107" /> when the grant was made available and it was not fit to make silage out of the hay.  Farmers are suffering and I hope the grain subsidy will help them.  Certainly as regards hay making or silage making, they can expect very little winter fodder from this source for this year.</P>
    <P>We must look at the small farmers' dole for this winter in a new light.  This has been brought up here in the Seanad on a number of occasions.  Social welfare officers are very slow on going out and assessing farmers and at times their appeals take months to be heard.  Extra staff should be appointed to the western counties to hurry up the whole process. Unless this is done fairly shortly you could have a large scale desertion of the land by these farmers.</P>
    <P>As was pointed out, and I agree with it, the small farmer is a very important part of our community and it is important to support him and to ensure that life is kept in rural areas.  We could have some form of repetition of what happened to the cottier during the famine times.  The small farmer could be forced to sell his cows and to sell them at such a reduced price that he would never be in the position to replace them again.  It has taken many small farmers years to build up to the stage they are at at the moment.  We are talking of small farmers increasing their herds by perhaps one cow a year.  If they had to sell them all at the same time it could take them the same length of time again to build up their herds.  Many small farmers would be totally discouraged and would be very reluctant to go back again to small farming.  In addition, their families would not be encouraged to stay on the land and this would create an extra unemployment problem.  It is very important that we face the reality that the small farmer is in danger of extinction.</P>
    <P>I believe that an announcement will be made shortly &mdash; and reference was made to it already by Senator Hussey &mdash; about the farm modernisation scheme.  It must be revived as soon as possible to ensure that these people will have an opportunity of availing of grants to lay out <Col N="108" /> silage slabs.  We must learn from the lesson of this calamity and we must try to encourage people to change from hay-making to silage-making.  To do this we have to make it easy for them.  If you cannot afford machinery or to hire a contractor you cannot make silage.  We must provide some subsidy for these farmers for making silage &mdash; as regards laying silage slabs and even towards the cost of the actual contracting of the silage.  I am sure Minister Hegarty would agree with me it is of utmost importance that the farm modernisation scheme be revived for the small farmer.</P>
    <P>Instead of being very negative about the Government's response, the farming organisations should encourage the small farmer as much as possible to try to hold on to his cattle and they should give him every type of psychological support possible. One particular organisation have created a very negative feeling among the farming community and have encouraged a fatalistic feeling that all is gone and that there is no hope of any reprieve.  Farmers should be encouraged to hold on.  They should be encouraged to avail of the grants and of the assistance that is being made available to them, no matter how small.  Whereas the figure of £20 million may sound small, at the same time in light of the existing financial restraints on Government spending it is a considerable sum.  If it is properly used it could alleviate much distress.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement made by the Minister here this evening.  I request him to continue bargaining on behalf of the Irish farmer, not alone the small farmer of north Kerry or the west of Ireland but the farming community as a whole in the country, whether farmers be in beef or cereals.  From his record to date the farming community can have confidence in the Minister.  He has proved himself to be very capable and competent in negotiating for the farming community in Europe.  He deserves all the support that we can give him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never had the experience of seeing the Minister for Agriculture on the dance floor.  In my <Col N="109" /> younger days I heard of a dance called the high caul cap.  I think the side stepping and step-dancing the Minister has gone on with here tonight is most unusual to say the least.  I ask Members to look again at his ministerial address to this House where he outlines that he was asked by the Government to approach the EC Commission with certain proposals with a view to seeking Community aid for the measures envisaged.  Bearing in mind that we are faced with and living through one of the most serious disasters that has hit Irish agriculture, which has brought in its trail problems on an unprecedented scale, and taking into account that the media in the past couple of days heightened speculation among the farming community that today or yesterday a package would emanate from Brussels which would try to help Irish farmers through their difficulties, we had this spectacle here this evening of the Minister bringing in an address to this House and pencilling in towards the end of that speech some kind of paltry solutions to this problem.  This motion has been down before the House for some time.  Is it not fairly unusual that the Minister would have to pencil in some of the decisions taken by the Government to solve this problem?  What he actually told us is not contained in this speech.  When did the Government make the decision because it is as clear as night follows day that our negotiations in Brussels were an absolute disaster.  They are trying to pull the wool over our eyes by suggesting that this grain proposal represents anything significant. I estimate having regard to the present price of intervention grain, that the price to the farmer in this instance will be around £102 per tonne allowing for the 25 per cent concession here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Brussels has been exporting grain at figures below that to countries outside the EC for a considerable time.  We in Ireland have a particular problem; we are living within the Community yet that is all that the Minister can win for us in Brussels.  I do not expect the taxpayer with all the difficulties in the economy at the moment to be able provide the kind of funds that would deal with this disaster. <Col N="110" /> Nobody would expect that but we would expect from EC sources considerably more than is on the plate at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would like to put a question to the Minister: is what he said really on the plate?  In this statement he says: &ldquo;I am hopeful that these discussions will have a fruitful outcome.&rdquo;  Further down the Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In this respect the Commission may be able to assist us by providing a substantial quantity of intervention grain at a specially reduced price.</P>
    <P>The step-dancing starts at this stage because from there on he refers to this as if it was an actuality.  He said that the benefit of this price reduction and of a substantial contribution by the Exchequer would be applied to farmers who have a serious fodder problem.  There was a doubt until then but at that stage apparently it becomes a reality.  My question to this House is: how could it be, in the face of this problem, that this document could not contain the simple proposals of the Minister?  I suggest that whatever negotiations are going on in Brussels it is absolutely abundantly clear that they have failed.  I am now calling on the Minister, the Government and, indeed, the Taoiseach, to go back to the European Commission.  They should not take the crumbs from the table; they should not accept a scheme that is available to other countries outside the Community as a concession to Irish farmers in view of all the difficulties they have.</P>
    <P>Before other Members on the opposite benches stand up and congratulate the Minister on what the Government are providing, I want to put it in actual terms. We are talking about £14 million. Although it is not clear I have to accept what the Minister said, that this will be devoted mainly to the grain voucher scheme.  Taking into account the number of small farmers in the country who are hit by this problem that is equivalent to giving about 60,000 farmers in the disadvantaged areas one tonne of grain for five-and-a-half to six months of a winter. That would be the equivalent not to <Col N="111" /> giving meal but to showing meal to about four or five cattle this winter.</P>
    <P>In this document the Minister states that 70 per cent of the hay in the west was lost.  If 70 per cent of the hay was lost in the west that means to me in raw mathematics that 70 per cent of the animals on the farms in the west of Ireland will not have in front of them for this winter anything approaching a satisfactory diet.  The average number of animals on a farm in the disadvantaged areas in the west is between 22 and 29.  One begins to see the range of problems that are there.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that the west is the only place in the country.  I said at another meeting here today that in every townland there are farmers who have been devastated by these problems.  We are not coming into this House arguing with this Government that they are responsible for this problem or that they could solve it all but we have to get a decent response and we must get it from EC sources.  In this case we are emphasising the question of winter fodder.  I agree with the Minister that that is the central core problem that resulted from this bad summer.  We have to maintain our stock numbers.  Many of us can recall the 1974 crisis during which time 750,000 animals were slaughtered in nine months, a haemorrhage which had very long term effects for the beef herd in this country.  Half a million cows from the beef herd were removed from Irish farmers and now 11 years later that beef herd is down to the level it was at after the 1974 crisis.  If one contacts factories and agents one will be told that cows are being slaughtered at a considerably increased rate on what would be the average for this time of the year.  One will also be told on the factory floor that many of these cows are heavy in calf.  Why would a farmer sell a cow that is heavy in calf?  He cannot sell the small stock.  There is no one to buy them. Therefore, he is forced to sell the seed breed because that is the only animal on his farm that can either realise a price that is acceptable to him or, alternatively, he has not enough fodder to keep that <Col N="112" /> animal for the winter.  Thus, he is forced to take that decision.</P>
    <P>I put it to Members that we have to be concerned that we do not allow panicselling and the disposal of cows, and particularly cows in calf, at the present rate. Therefore, we have to ask the Minister for Agriculture to do all he can for domestic resources but above all to try to get it across to our Community partners that they, too, have to recognise their responsibilities in this matter.</P>
    <P>In this situation that is only one side of the problem.  Out there there are potato farmers, there are grain growers and there is the pea crop.  There are also many other farmers who are not in cattle production or in dairying but who have lost their whole enterprise and their whole income for this year.  There is nothing contained in these proposals that will alleviate their problems to any degree.  In a year that has been a washout as far as Irish agriculture is concerned, the Minister has washed his hands of many of these farmers all over the country who are demoralised.</P>
    <P>I visited parts of this country looking at this problem and I just want to mention to this House the human aspects.  They are proud people who tried to manage their meagre resources to the best of their ability.  Many have young families going back to school, which is an expensive time for couples, and many housewives are drained to the last trying to cope with a problem which is totally outside their control.  I talked to young farmers on the side of a mountain who were tearing up their fields with tractors trying to salvage silage into corners of fields which will be inaccessible in the winter but it was the best they could do for the moment.  They stared out over my shoulders in utter despair because they knew what they were doing was the best they could do to salvage winter fodder but those fields are a write-off until next June or July.  I do not want to over-dramatise this but I came home from my trip a shocked person.  Having met people on the ground who were so utterly broken and demoralised I felt that it was very necessary that this motion should come before the <Col N="113" /> House at the first possible opportunity. We should try to use all the powers at our disposal to win from the Government, and in particular from EC sources, funds which will help these people to cope with their problems.</P>
    <P>Our economy is underpinned by agriculture. When our stock numbers are reduced our factory inflow is cut back, the spending power of the farming community is reduced and the debts to the co-ops, to the banks and to other institutions keep on mounting as people cannot meet the repayments because their way of living has been so drastically reduced.  I think we have to find some way to carry some of that burden in their interest and also in the interest of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is fair for any Minister for Agriculture to present that kind of a document to this House.  Either what he has said is real or it is not.  If it is real he is not just hopeful about it, he knows it has happened.  If it is real he is not just hoping that the Commission will be able to assist us, they are going to assist us.  I think he should be on his heels and at the negotiating table at the first opportunity. As far as the Members of this House are concerned and, indeed, throughout the country, he will have all our support in an effort to try to win from EC sources substantial funds to try to alleviate this situation.  The response so far has been totally inadequate.  It is paltry, it deals with only one side of the problem and to an individual farmer it is of little significance. The Government cannot afford to carry all that problem and we recognise that.  We have to lean on our partners to help us at this time.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I call on the Minister to reject out of hand the proposals which have been brought forward from Brussels, to remove the doubt and to remove some of the hysteria which is rife throughout the country and to go back and seek a new way forward.  To do less than that would be to write the epitaph of a number of people engaged in agriculture.  I do not think that is what he wants to do and I do not think it is what anybody here wants to do.  If this is the kind of response we are going to get from the European <Col N="114" /> Community in this problem, I am afraid the future for Irish agriculture is dim indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is the role and obligation of an Opposition to oppose but seldom have I heard such a short debate littered and strewn with so many of the old clichés and emotional terminology. Do not get me wrong.  It is not that I do not appreciate the problem or indeed that I have not got my finger on the pulse.  As a person who comes from one of the 12 disadvantaged counties I am fully cognisant of the situation, its extent and magnitude, but when we reach the stage when the tax-payer offers the farmers £16 million and when that allocation is greeted in a derisory way by a parliamentary party as being paltry then we are at a sorry pass.</P>
      <P>There is no question that there is unanimity on all sides of the House about the magnitude of the disaster.  These farmers have the support and the sympathy of everybody in their difficulty.  On a national scale we must have sympathy because when one realises that the agricultural industry in general accounts for 40 per cent of our exports we have to take serious cognisance of the situation. It would be most uneconomic, therefore, not to underpin agriculture and I believe the Minister has done this.  Looking at the text of the motion and the amendment the central theme is fodder shortage. This is what it is essentially about in relation to stock, stock numbers and the danger that people might have to sell stock.  The Minister has told us in no uncertain terms tonight that no stock will have to be sold as a result of shortage of fodder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Smith has made great play of the fact that the Minister did not include some of the things he disclosed afterwards in his speech.  The implication seemed to be that there was something sinister afoot or that the Minister was less than sincere in his undertaking that these would be included.  I draw to Senator Smith's attention that it was only in the course of his presence here in the House, <Col N="115" /> during his speech in fact, that the Minister was in a position to make some of the announcements referred to by the Senator.</P>
    <P>Over the past three or four months we have had a sorry saga for Irish farmers. We have had an excess of all the elements we do not want, rain, excessive humidity, lightning, hail and so on.  There is no doubt whatever, as the Minister said, that as long as we have 40 per cent of our fodder coming from such a source as hay which is largely dependent on the fluctuations and vagaries of the weather and climate we stand to lose at all stages.  The risks are too great.  In the west, as has been said by Senator Smith and others, we have only got approximately 20 per cent of the hay crop.  I am convinced that the measures taken here by the Minister, particlarly in relation to the assurances that grain through grain vouchers will be got to any farmer in need, will alleviate the difficulties and the disaster that would befall farmers if these measures had not been taken.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for moving at the very start.  He had moved before the IFA, the ICMSA or the Opposition moved.  I could safely say that the Minister devoted the bulk of his holiday time to monitoring the situation to ensure he was kept fully appraised of the degree and the scale of the disaster.  Who could have said four weeks ago that the disaster would have reached the proportions and levels that we have today?  Who can say what it is going to be like next week or the week after because the situation has not only been changing by the week but by the day and by the hour?</P>
    <P>To revert again to the silage problem, the Minister will have to tackle the problem of further grants seriously to ensure that small producers, in the west in particular, for whom it is not economic to produce silage, will be given every facility available to ensure that silage becomes the standard fodder from now on.  I would urge strongly the reintroduction of the group fodder scheme so that these people can pool their resources.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the Minister's <Col N="116" /> relief for the Shannon basin.  It may not be mind boggling but what we are talking about is not compensation but relief.  It is physically impossible, in such a situation, no matter how large or how small the scale of it is, to compensate people 100 per cent.  What we are talking about in this situation is relief for people in need.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on the numerous efforts he has made to highlight at Brussels level the magnitude and the scale of the problem and for succeeding in getting M. Le Gras, the Director General for Agriculture to visit this country and graphically illustrating the problem to him.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome other measures that received scant recognition.  I should like to welcome a measure which was sought for a long period of time, the extension of the pre-movement test period to 60 days.  That positive move is having, to a large degree, the desired effect.  I want to welcome the realistic suggestion of accepting the mart receipts as bona fide evidence that people had the stock at the time they applied for headage payments and that headage payments can now be made on foot of these.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the assurance by the Minister that for the first time ever headage payments will be completed and in the hands of farmers by the end of November.  There has been a great deal of agitation about the possibility of paying maximum headage grants to farmers but it is beyond the resources of the Exchequer, despite the fact that we have had emotional pleas and I, as a westerner would be sympathetic to the argument, to go into this to such a degree that we would have to double the headage payments. The early headage payments, plus the fact that the Minister is now prepared to receive mart receipts as bona fide evidence will considerably alleviate the problem.  One of the difficulties in any package like this is to target the relief to the people who need it most.  This has been fully addressed by the Minister.  I know that there are people in the west who did not get their hay or silage but we all know of people who did.  In a situation like this it is wrong to expect that we <Col N="117" /> should have across-the-board payments to all and sundry.  The same position operates in the Department of Social Welfare with people getting aid who do not need it while the people who are in need are being victimisedd.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something in relation to the general lack of recognition of the amount of work that the Minister has done to get this package.  Senator Ellis suggested that we should seek the views of the farming organisations.  The Minister asked the farming organisations for their views and we should consider their contrasting responses.  The ICMSA were reasonable, receptive and recognised with considerable gratitude the amount the Minister has done.  By comparison, however, the attitude of the other main farming organisations was less than positive and appreciative.  When the nitrogen subsidy was introduced it was derided.  Again, the offer of the 60 day test and so on, plus the acceptance of mart receipts, did not receive the merit and the gratitude they deserved.  When grain was offered to substitute for the lack of fodder the IFA looked for cash in hand payments.  I honestly believe that these types of crude bludgeoning tactics serve only to turn people away, to turn the sympathetic attitude of the urban community away from the plight and the dire straits of farmers.</P>
    <P>We had a similar attitude from the IFA in the period 1973-77 when one of the best Minister for Agriculture we ever had, former Deputy Clinton, was subjected to constant and persistent attacks. We had the same attitude from them when their deputy vice-president, Alan Gillis, went abroad to cash in with a Dáil Deputy on a deal that was already agreed by the Minister for Agriculture.  We got no credit whatsoever for the 4.6 per cent derogation in relation to the super-levy when we were the envy of the rest of Europe.  The people castigating the Government have short memories.  Do they recall that a Member of the other House when Minister for Agriculture, left them sitting on the steps of Government Buildings and refused to talk to them?  Later their leaders were jailed. <Col N="118" /> The Minister has carried out his duties as Minister in a most responsible fashion.</P>
    <P>The day has not finally dawned when all aid is terminated.  The Minister, at the end of his speech, was open-ended. Senator Hussey was realistic in recognising that the Minister had done a considerable amount in putting the case before Brussels.  I have no doubt that the fears and apprehensions of Senator Ellis in relation to maladministration and the danger that middle-men and grain merchants will get their slice out of the resources will not materialise following the assurances of the Minister that the new scheme will be well administered.</P>
    <P>I feel very proud to be a member of a party whose Minister for Agriculture devoted his entire holiday period to continually appraising the situation, taking positive measures to rectify it and, indeed, has tonight brought before the House a package which will give fodder to Irish farmers.  I am confident that the Minister will, come next spring, be seen to have taken measures to alleviate the difficulty, the worry, the hardships and apprehensions that many farmers in the west thought was going to spell doom, gloom and damnation as regards their farm and their farm welfare.  Furthermore, I am confident that the farming organisations who have not been appreciative of the role played by the Minister for Agriculture will in time come to see the folly of their ways and to see that, just as Deputy Clinton as Minister for Agriculture in 1973-77 helped to build up farm incomes to an unprecedented level, Deputy Deasy as Minister for Agriculture helped to salvage their livelihoods and put them back on a solid footing for what is hopefully the boom years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak in favour of the amendment, asking Seanad Éireann to call on the Government to declare a nationwide agricultural emergency. There is no doubt that there is cause for the Government to declare such an emergency.  We all know how agriculture is very dependent on weather conditions for survival and for farming to make a profit.  This year farmers experienced the <Col N="119" /> worst conditions in living memory. People have asked me if I remember weather as bad and my reply was that I was sure the oldest person living never remembered a summer as bad as the summer of 1985.  Such conditions affect no community more than the agricultural community.  Silage may have been made when we got a few fine weeks towards the end of June but in the case of some of it the water content was immense. Any silage with immense water content is definitely very poor.  Good silage makes good fodder but until it is opened up and the cattle are being fed on it during the winter months we will not know whether it is of good or poor quality.  That will have to be supplemented because the hay crop was a complete disaster.  I doubt if any hay was good this year.  Many small farmers depend on hay as feed for their cattle.  In many counties in the west, and where I come from, farmers depend on hay but the hay they saved is only fit to go into slurry pits.  There is a case for declaring a nationwide agricultural emergency.  We have heard that the Minister is doing a good job but I do not think the package is good enough.  When there were similar emergencies before Fianna Fáil Governments doubled headage payments straight away without ever acquainting the EC.  The money will be available from the EC because they have to match on a pound for pound basis anything the Irish Government gives.</P>
      <P>In parts of the country farmers are 50 per cent dependent on hay and they may have to supplement that with rolled barley which can be very expensive. Some cereal growers might say it is cheap but after the costs of processors, millers and transporters are taken into account it can be very costly.  The Government have to give a cash injection to ensure that farmers can maintain their cattle at their present levels and not have to sell them at giveaway prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some areas in the last three weeks the weather was good and the ground has dried up but in other areas the rain has not ceased.  In the west, Cavan and other areas, there has been continuous rain. <Col N="120" /> Silage cannot be cut because due to the adverse conditions heavy silage machinery cannot enter fields because of the danger of getting bogged down.  Green fields can look very deceptive in wet weather but some of them are so wet that even cattle cannot graze on them.</P>
    <P>There is now panic selling of cattle. It started in mid-July.  I understand that one of the Government's proposals is to grant headage payments on the production of receipts for cattle sold in marts but that should go back to July because there was panic selling as early as July this year because of weather conditions.</P>
    <P>There is also a silage problem in my area where we have good dry land, better than some of the areas that we are referring to.  Cattle have been kept in yards eating silage since mid-August.  If they started eating silage in mid-August what will the position be like at Christmas-time? There will be a long winter from Christmas until the time when cattle are put out on grass next year, unless we get favourable weather in spring.  In some areas cattle can be put out early which is an advantage to farmers but in my area where the land is heavy there is no hope of putting them out early.</P>
    <P>Cereal farmers are suffering severe losses also.  Yields are down; they are all under two tonnes.  The Minister of State, a cereal farmer, may not have been subjected to the bad weather experienced in other areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Just as bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">

      <P>In that case the Minister of State knows the seriousness of the problem.  The moisture content is very high and, therefore, the price for barley will be low.  The winter wheat crop was severely damaged.  There was a lot of lodging during the bad storm.  The Minister and his Department should see if it is possible to obtain cereal seed that would not be subject to sprouting.  If that was possible it would help farmers to deal with bad weather conditions such as we experienced this year.  Farmers would not be experiencing such terrible losses or be asking the Government to compensate <Col N="121" /> them.  If something could be done in that respect it might help in some way.</P>
      <P>I am not familiar with the growing of cereal &mdash; I grow enough cereal on my modest farm that is sufficient for my own feed &mdash; but I am aware that barley was making £120 per tonne in 1983, £108 a tonne in 1984 and in 1985 it is £100 a tonne, that is for barley with under 20 per cent moisture.  That is very poor compensation for the people who invested a lot into growing cereals.  The yields will be lower, there will be higher moisture content and farmers will get a lower price.  That is something I am sure the Minister is aware of and recognises.  I understand that 70 per cent of malting barley has been rejected for malting and must be used for feeding.  There was panic harvesting of peas in July because of the bad weather.  Farmers thought when the bad weather came that they would not be able to harvest them and panicked and as a result the peas were not fit for processing. They were fed to cattle resulting in a terrible loss.</P>
      <P>The harvesting of sugar beet is beginning and it appears that the sugar content will be very low.  The heavy hailstones, as big as apples, in the recent storm blew the leaves of the sugar beet thereby curtailing growth.  As a result the sugar content will be less than in normal conditions.  In other counties farmers are more concerned about the potato crop. Farmers in my area who grow potatoes will be at a great loss because of the weather.  The seed rotted and did not germinate at all.  I am sure that happened in other areas also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who are most in need of fodder are the small farmers, especially farmers with holdings of between 20 and 60 acres.  They may have 20 cows and a few weanlings but they do not have silage for winter feed.  If hay or straw was made available at reasonable prices it would help farmers.  There are areas where hay and straw are available, for instance in the south, but the hay crop is rotting and being put into slurry pits in other areas. Some pool, through the co-operatrive movement, should be arranged so that farmers do not have to pay a big price for <Col N="122" /> hay.  There is widespread exportation of hay and straw to Northern Ireland.  That is a disgrace.  There is an old saying, if we can be happy to do with what we need and forget about our greed we would be a fine country, and some people can be greedy in circumstances like this.  The exchange rate of sterling can be very attractive to some people who would like to jump on the band wagon and sell straw and hay at high prices.  That is going on. We are asking the EC to ensure that aid should apply to all Ireland but we cannot buy hay or straw from the North and bring it across the Border because of disease restrictions.</P>
    <P>The Government have done an injustice to agriculture by abolishing subsidies, met pound for pound by the EC.  They could be used now to alleviate the problems. I am referring to AI subsidies, lime subsidies and grants under the farm modernisation scheme.  The abolishing of the farm modernisation scheme was the greatest disaster to hit the agricultural community. Housing for cattle is completely inadequate.  There should be proper housing in winter.  The provision of good housing would be a source of employment to builders.  It would be better to put money to productive use than to ask the taxpayer to subscribe to those who are unemployed and drawing the dole. The greatest mistake the Government made was the abolition of the farm modernisation scheme.  I should like to ask the Minister of State to ensure that the scheme is restored as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Seanad should call on the Government to declare a nationwide agriculture emergency because of the hardships the farming community are suffering.  While I accept that the weather has a lot to do with the problems of farmers I believe the Government must accept some of the cause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate, because the topic is foremost in the minds not only of the people in rural Ireland but also in the minds of those in urban areas, who work in the agricultural <Col N="123" /> related industries.  I should like to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Deasy, and the Minister of State, on their unfailing efforts to minimise the loss to farmers. They made tireless efforts to assess the extent of the disaster.  It is wrong of the Opposition, the media to some extent, and, more particularly, certain sections of the farming community, to attempt to make political gain out of this. It is very easy to do that as we can see from the suggestions made on a daily basis at the beginning and now on an hourly basis.  Such people are outstepping each other in the schemes they are concocting. They hope by embarrassing the Government to raise the expectations of farmers.</P>
      <P>The sad fact is that the Opposition are attempting to raise falsely the expectations of farmers.  That tactic was used in the past for political advantage and it is unfortunate that in 1985 it is being used again.  Some of the statements of the leader of the IFA, Mr. Rea, have been totally misguided.  His demands were totally unrealistic and completely unbecoming to the leadership of a national farming organisation.  I hope farmers will come to realise sooner rather than later that they are being misled in this crisis.  The media are giving a slanted view of the problem. The PAYE person who heard the president of the IFA on television say farmers stood to lose a lot of money up to £100,000 in one harvest, may, considering his weekly take home pay of £50 or £60 ask what such people contributed to the national Exchequer in the good years. Farmers have had their good years.  I should like to take Senator Kiely to task for saying that the Government have reduced the standard of living of farmers.</P>

      <P>Farmers' incomes increased by 5 per cent last year, despite all the rumours to the contrary.  During the period of the Fianna Fáil Government, from 1979 to 1981, the real incomes of farmers declined by 40 per cent and if <Col N="124" /> Senator Kiely can change that figure he should be outside helping farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I also thank very sincerely the Minister of State for his attendance here tonight.  I know he had another commitment this evening and I am sorry that I had to take him from it. Had I know that the House would be sitting so late, I would have left this matter over until some other time.  However, I will be very brief.</P>
      <P>The grave and urgent need for proper and clean water supplies, both for domestic and agricultural use in the north Meath area, has long been recognised by both Meath County Council and the Department of the Environment.  When I was elected to Meath County Council in 1967 I put on record as a major priority that a scheme be implemented to provide the supply to cater for the needs of the Kells-Oldcastle area.  It was mutually agreed among all the councillors for that area that the best source of supply would be from Lough Bane, or Lough Bawn as we call it down there, which is situated on the Meath-Westmeath border.  From 1967, slow but steady progress was made in the implementation of a proper scheme to cater for the needs of the north Meath area.  After much to-ing and fro-ing &mdash; and, indeed, the holding of a public inquiry to determine the capacity of the supply from the source in Lough Bane &mdash; it was agreed that the entire area would, in fact, be best served from that source of supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was elected to the Dáil in 1982 I immediately pursued this matter and I was delighted to have that scheme sanctioned. Since that time, the supply to the town of Kells has been completed and it is now working satisfactorily, much to the delight of the people there.  The water has been privately tested by one doctor <Col N="125" /> and it is regarded as probably the best source of supply of fresh water in Ireland today.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that stage two of this scheme might be delayed unduly.  Consultants have prepared contract documents and I understand these were submitted to the Minister's Department some time in mid-July.  Officials and staff of Meath County Council liaised with the consultants in the preparation of these documents.  All the head works at Lough Bane for the Oldcastle scheme are completed and we now require a pipeline to serve Oldcastle, with storage reservoirs at Crossakeel and Oldcastle.  The next stage is to advertise for tender and my request here this evening is to pursue this matter vigorously with a view to having this scheme implemented in early 1986.</P>
    <P>The present supply to Oldcastle comes from Lough Creevagh, which is situated in the Knocklough area of the Lough Crew hills.  It is a very small lake which tends to go dry in the summertime, at which stage we usually find ourselves with very low pressure and many times, indeed, with no water at all.  The old piping in this scheme is cracked, broken and corroded and, indeed, one can read factual reports in local newspapers of wriggly things and worms coming through the taps.  It is almost impossible to maintain a proper pressure from the existing supply.  The fire fighting units of Meath County Council are very perturbed.  With the continued development of the Oldcastle area and the extra number of houses being built there this supply could now be regarded as totally inadequate and obsolete.  In the interests of the health of the community and to help further development in this area, it is imperative that stage two which is the provision of a supply to Oldcastle, should commence without any further delay.  I appeal to the Minister to use his influence to have the scheme advertised for tender immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister came down to Oldcastle when he was Minister of State in 1981 and opened a lovely fire station there.  At that time I reminded him that I hoped he would be a Minister, when I would be <Col N="126" /> coming back to him to help us out with a few other problems we had in north County Meath.  I am glad that the relationship that started at that time has existed since and I am sure it will blossom even further after I get a reply from the Minister tonight.  I am now asking the Minister to fulfil the promise he made at that time.</P>

      <P>As a Senator from the same constituency, I would like to concur with Senator Lynch.  There is a great need to have this scheme speeded up as much as possible and everything that Senator Lynch has outlined here is correct.  I join with him in the call to have this scheme speeded up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to Senator Lynch's contribution to this debate and I will take his comments into account when deciding on the scheme.  I would like to assure the House that I am aware of the importance of the scheme to the people of Oldcastle. Before commenting in detail on the scheme, I would like to inform the House of the progress which has been made in the sanitary services programme in general.  The provision of an adequate infrastructural network of water supply and sewerage disposal facilities is one of the functions to which I attach great importance.  This Government have shown through the substantial capital provision and the record value of schemes released over the past two years, in particular, their recognition of the importance of the sanitary services programme as a whole.  The exceptional progress made in recent years can be gauged from the fact that, during 1983 and 1984, the value of schemes released reached record levels of £98 million and £101 million, respectively, as compared with £34 million in 1981 and £53 million in 1982. The total value of schemes in progress or at tender stage at the end of 1984 stood at £515 million, compared with £300 million at the end of 1982.  This undoubtedly reflects the increased activity in the programme that has been generated by <Col N="127" /> the policies of this Government and the substantial capital investment.</P>
      <P>The county of Meath has received its fair share of capital allocation to local authorities.  The allocation for sanitary services in the years 1983 and 1984 totalled almost £5.5 million, compared with as little as over £1 million for the years of 1981-82.  I have already made allocations of over £1.3 million to local authorities in the county this year on top of the funds provided in the past two years. These allocations have enabled the local authorities to complete such major schemes as the Oldcastle-Kells regional water scheme, stage 1, at a total estimated cost of £2.4 million and the east Meath regional water supply scheme, stage 4, at a cost of around £1.4 million. They have also made it possible for the local authorities to progress work considerably on an important scheme such as the Kells sewerage scheme, stage 1, at £1.2 million, the Longwood sewerage scheme at £340,000 and the Stamullen sewerage scheme at £210,000.  Other major schemes which I have approved are the Rathoath sewerage scheme and the Dunshaughlin sewerage extension scheme at a combined estimated cost of £708,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Oldcastle-Kells regional water supply scheme, preliminary proposals for this were received in my Department on 12 April 1977.  The scheme proposed would augment supply to Oldcastle and Kells where existing water supplies were inadequate and would serve the intervening areas. Approval to the preliminary proposals and to the preparation of contract documents for stage 1 of the scheme to serve Kells was issued to the local authority on 16 September 1977.  Stage 1 consisted of intake works and pumphouse at Lough Bane, rising mains and reservoir at Seafin Hill in Kells, trunk mains to Skerry, distribution mains to Kells.  Contract documents for this stage were received in my Department in 1978 and were approved <Col N="128" /> on 23 January 1981.  As I have already indicated, work on this stage of the scheme has been completed at an estimated cost of £2.4 million.</P>
    <P>Contract documents for stage 2 of the scheme to serve Oldcastle were received in my Department on 18 July 1985.  This stage consists of reservoirs near Oldcastle and Crossakeel, trunk mains, a distribution main and a rising main.  The contract documents submitted, however, are being revised to take account of design changes agreed between my Department and the council.  The revised documents are now awaited from the council.  It would also be necessary for the local authority to complete fully the preliminaries relating to the scheme, such as acquiring the land for the reservoir sites and publicising their intention to provide two large reservoirs in the scheme.  It will be appreciated that until these matters have been attended to I will not be in a position to say when a decision may be made on the proposal.  However, as I have already indicated, I am fully aware of the need for this scheme and the House may rest assured that consideration of the proposals in my Department will be expedited as soon as the council have dealt with the outstanding matters to which I have already referred.  I should point out, of course, that the implementation of the scheme, when approved, is a matter for Meath County Council.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that there is no question of lack of will or, indeed, finance from the Department's point of view.  There are matters, such as land acquisition and documents that require changes and are awaited in my Department.  As soon as we receive these we will be only too anxious to serve the people of Oldcastle with a good water supply.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26 September 1985.</P>
