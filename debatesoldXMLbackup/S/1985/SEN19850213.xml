      <P>I have notice from Senator Joachim Loughrey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment's proposals in the immediate future to co-ordinate and direct the implementation of road development programmes in County Donegal arising from his Department's recent report Policy and Planning Framework for Roads.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>
      <P>In allowing this matter, I direct the attention of the Senator to the fact that the maintenance of roads is a matter for local authorities and not the Minister and may not be raised on the Adjournment this evening.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 in that order.  It is proposed to adjourn for tea from 5.30 to 6.30.  In regard to the previous agreement <Col N="218" /> reached with the Leader of the Opposition, the debate on No. 2 will depend on the contributors offering.  No closure time applies to No. 2.  Regarding No. 4, this matter will be dealt with in the normal manner in which a Bill is dealt with.  The time constraints that apply to a Private Members' motion will not apply so there will be an open debate on No. 4.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask a question about No. 3.  The Independent group are entitled to put down a motion. It is their turn to have a motion debated today.  They have used that time to bring in a Bill.  I am not objecting in any way to their Bill.  We are allowed three hours to discuss a motion.  If a group change from a motion to a Bill Senators could talk about it for the next three months.  I wonder if it is fair that a Bill can be brought in as a motion?</P>

      <P>I would like to support the point raised by Senator Ryan.  It seems to me, in my short time in this House, that it has been usual to raise in the one and a half hours at the end of business, matters appearing as motions on the Order Paper.  It seems to me that today we are having two matters which are both Private Members' Bills.  I would like to ask if that is usual or is that within Standing Orders?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am the proposer of No. 4, which Senator Ryan raised initially, perhaps I should answer this.  First of all, there is obviously a precedent for this coming up in Private Members' time, which is No. 3, but what is far more important is that any objection to Private Member's time, especially Independent Members, bringing up a Bill in this time, must then raise the question, when can an Independent Member bring up a Bill at all?  If the suggestion from Senator Durcan, and Senator W. Ryan is correct, there will be no time whatsoever and no opportunity whatsoever for anybody but the Government to put a Bill down in this House.  That would be quite ridiculous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader of the House could help us here.  I do not really want to wave this poster around too long but it is a good indicator of the frustration of many people dealing with the homeless.  If Private Member's legislation was dealt with in any sort of reasonable time we would have no problem, but there is a particular item, No. 3, which has been on the Order Paper of this House for two years now.  If that had been dealt with in a reasonable time and if the Government had kept their promises of how they were dealing with that, we would have no problems.  We would simply have one item of Private Members' legislation, which is hardly unreasonable.</P>
      <P>I do not have a great deal of sympathy with Fianna Fáil.  They are a major grouping and if they wish to introduce a mass of Private Members' legislation of a reforming nature they can have the full support of the Independent Members of the House.  There is no point in quibbling because three of us in the back row here are able to produce more legislation than the entire membership of Fianna Fáil have done in the last three years.  There is no point in quibbling with us about it, with respect, and I have voted with them on many occasions and will probably do so again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is a matter for the Order of Business of this House. The last major Private Members' legislation consisted of the Rape Bill and the Family Planning Bill.  In both cases those matters were dealt with and disposed of in a reasonable period of time by anybody's standards, reasonable being about 12 months from the time they were first introduced.  If there is a problem about too many Private Members' Bills on reforming issues from Independent Members, there are two reasons for that. One is that we are not dealing with them when they come up and, secondly, the <Col N="220" /> Government do not seem to be able to introduce reforming legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I raised the initial point to ensure that as a Member of this House I can approach the business of this House with some certainty.  It seems to me that one is faced with the situation that there are two Bills. My understanding is that the time is not limited.  They are two rather major Bills. One does not know whether either of them will come up tonight.  My understanding was that normally motions were moved during the period for Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been trying to maintain a consistency in the way I have ordered the business of the House when that responsibility has fallen to me.  Last week there was condemnation that we were not facilitating Private Members and that we were moving Government Bills, which to them were not important. I held then, and I still hold, that the function of this House, first of all, is to ensure that the Government are facilitated in their business of ordering Bills. That is why No. 1 is ordered as the first item today.  I have no control &mdash; only the House has control &mdash; over how long that Bill will take.  Item No. 2 is resuming a debate from last week dealing with the disadvantaged areas.  I have ordered No. 3 in the hope that I will get to it today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness to Senator Brendan Ryan, he has had his Bill on the clár for some time.  I gave a commitment that we would try to reach it as soon as possible, taking into account the preference of the Government's Bill.  There is a precendent for having taken a Private Member's Bill in Private Members' time.  This was done in the case of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill.  The reason there is no time limit on the Bill is that I do not want to pre-judge what the House might decide to do with any particular Bill or how many people will be offering to speak on it.  It would be very unfair if I put a time limit on No. 4.  I am asking the House to agree &mdash; it is a matter for the House &mdash; that No. 4 would be given one and a <Col N="221" /> half hours of the time allotted to Private Members time this evening and one and a half hours next week.  That would at least give the Bill a chance to be debated. I have no idea when that Bill will be taken again or, indeed, the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, because it depends on the availability of a Minister and it also depends on what Stage the Bill will be at on any particular day.  So taking items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 is trying to be consistent. It is a fair Order or Business and a matter for the House to agree.</P>

      <P>It is with great pleasure that I commend this Bill to the House and I am particularly pleased that it has fallen to me to introduce this Bill and to introduce it in the Upper House.  The transfer of the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal to the Commissioners of Public Works equates the canals as a public amenity, with the national parks, the Shannon Navigation and other major heritage items already <Col N="222" /> under their expert care.  At the same time, the transfer will relieve Córas Iompair Éireann of a burden totally unrelated to their essential function as public transport provider nationwide.  The transfer of the canals is thus a further important step in the fundamental reorganisation of Córas Iompair Éireann proposed in the national plan.  It is for those reasons that the Government wish to have the canals transferred quickly after enactment of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The two canals involve more than 250 miles of waterways and have been in existence for about 200 years, much of the time as vital transport arteries.  The canals have significantly benefited wide areas of the country, less obviously in recent decades, perhaps, with the ending of commercial traffic and some deterioration of facilities.</P>
      <P>The intention now is that the canals should continue to contribute to the wellbeing and development of the community, but in new ways as a public amenity, whether for fishing or navigation or otherwise for the enjoyment of the public.  This Bill is designed to give the canals this new role and to enable the Commissioners of Public Works to do what is needed to attain these objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is gratifying that there is general public welcome for the transfer of the canals to the Commissioners of Public Works.  The Grand Canal is the older of the two, having been begun in 1756.  It was actually proposed over 40 years earlier, in 1715, as part of a comprehensive plan to improve navigation and drainage throughout the country.  However, little construction work was done until 1772 when the Company of Undertakers of the Grand Canal, as the company were so quaintly named, comprising major landowners and other notables, were formed by statute to undertake the construction of the canal from the River Liffey in Dublin city to the River Shannon near Banagher, County Offaly, and began the work in earnest.  It took more than 30 years to complete the construction, about 1805, before boats could complete the 80 miles from Dublin to the River Shannon.  In the meantime, an <Col N="223" /> alternative link with the River Liffey in Dublin city was provided in 1791 at Ringsend, instead of the original link from James's Street, and extensive docks were constructed at Ringsend by 1796, at very considerable expense.  As well, lengthy off-branches to the main line of the Grand Canal were provided to Ballinasloe, Killbeggan, Monasterevin, Mountmellick and Naas, and eventually the Grand Canal was linked to the River Barrow at Athy.  Navigation on the River Barrow from Athy to St. Mullins, County Carlow, was the responsibility of the Barrow Navigation Company, established in 1790, and remained so until 1894 when the Barrow Navigation became part of the Grand Canal system and that company were dissolved by Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>In all, the Grand Canal system, comprising the main line and off-branches and the Barrow Navigation, involves more than 160 miles of waterways.  It appears that over £1 million, an enormous sum of money at that time, was spent on the construction of the Grand Canal system, much of it from private sources.  The Company of Undertakers of the Grand Canal were restructured in 1848, losing their grandiose name, to form The Grand Canal Company.  The new company operated until 1950 when they were dissolved and the Grand Canal system was transferred to Córas Iompar Éireann by the Transport Act, 1950.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal was begun in 1789, to link the north bank of the River Liffey in Dublin city to the River Shannon at Tarmonbarry.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal Company, comprising major landowners and other notables, undertook the construction of the canal in competition with the Grand Canal, which was already well under construction and open to traffic for some distance. From the start, the Royal Canal was a doomed commercial enterprise, largely because it was too close to the main line of the Grand Canal.  Even so, it appears that over £1½ million was spent on the construction of the Royal Canal system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> The Royal Canal Company experienced considerable financial and physical difficulties in undertaking the construction of the Royal Canal and, despite repeated parliamentary assistance, had to be dissolved by Act of Parliament in 1813. The completion of the canal was entrusted to the Directors General of Inland Navigation, the predecessors of the Commissioners of Public Works, who completed the link to the River Shannon by 1817.  They were replaced in 1818 by the new Royal Canal Company established by Act of Parliament.</P>
    <P>The new company took over the completed waterway and made a modest success of its undertaking yet the tonnage carried was still only a fraction of what was carried on the Grand Canal.  The coming of the railways marked the end of the Royal Canal as a transport artery. In 1845, the Royal Canal was acquired by the Midland Great Western Railway Company of Ireland with a view to constructing a railway line along the bank of the Royal Canal.  This it did and the railway runs alongside the Royal Canal for about 53 miles from Dublin city to beyond Mullingar in County Westmeath.</P>
    <P>In 1877, the Midland Great Western Railway Company opened Spencer Dock on the Royal Canal near its link with the River Liffey.  This greatly benefited the railway undertaking but the Royal Canal continued to decline.  This was ironic as in 1792 Parliament authorised the Royal Canal Company to construct Spencer Dock as part of the Royal Canal system, and had grant-aided the company for the purpose.  The work could not be done by the company because of the difficulties referred to.  The Royal Canal has remained in railway company ownership since 1845.  It has done so through the 1924 amalgamation of the Midland Great Western Railway Company with other railway companies to form the Great Southern Railways Company which in turn was dissolved to form Córas Iompair Éireann under the Transport Act, 1944.</P>
    <P>The main relevance of the foregoing brief historical picture to the Bill is that Córas Iompair Éireann have owned the Royal Canal system since 1945, and have <Col N="225" /> owned the Grand Canal system since 1950.</P>
    <P>Commercial traffic on both canals continued to decline and became negligible. The result was that the Transport Act, 1958 gave Córas Iompair Éireann power to close the canals, or any part of them, to navigation which had not been used for public navigation for three years or more, while the Transport Act, 1960 gave Córas Iompair Éireann power to close the entire Royal Canal to navigation. Some Senators may recall that in the early sixties proposals were advanced to construct new roads over long stretches of both canals in Dublin city.  There was considerable public objection to such proposals.  Happily those proposals were not implemented and this Bill provides against such developments.</P>
    <P>The virtually unbroken continuity of ownership of the canals for about 200 years means that there is in existence a considerable wealth of records relating to the canals and surrounding areas which would be of general public interest.  Like the canals themselves these records can be classified as a national asset giving us a fuller picture of the social and commercial life of the period.  In my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for Arts and Culture, I have a special responsibility for the preservation of important records and, as far as is possible, making them available for inspection by the public.  I, therefore, propose to discuss soon with Córas Iompair Éireann and the Commissioners of Public Works how best to deal with the records relating to the canals before their transfer to the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I return to the community development aspect to which I referred earlier. Many imaginative suggestions have been made as to how the canals might assume their new role as a public amenity and generate worthwhile local employment. I have no doubt that the Commissioners of Public Works will welcome and carefully consider all such suggestions and any suggestions which Senators may wish to make will be welcomed by them.</P>
    <P>The new public amenity role of the canals calls for a caring response from <Col N="226" /> the public at large and local communities in particular, so as to safeguard and improve the amenity value of the canals. Much has been done to improve and restore parts of the Royal Canal by way of voluntary local effort and with the assistance of Córas Iompair Éireann, An Chomhairle Oiliúna and local authorities but, of course, much remains to be done, not only for the Royal Canal but also for the Grand Canal and Barrow Navigation.</P>
    <P>The first task of the Commissioners of Public Works on taking over the canals will be to make a thorough assessment of the structural condition of the canals and their potential for development.  It will be for the commissioners to decide and tackle priorities in the light of available resources, including assistance from local groups and other public authorities.  The Government have decided that adequate resources will be made available to the Commissioners of Public Works to implement this Bill.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the general provisions of the Bill itself.  The purpose of this Bill is to transfer the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal from Córas Iompair Éireann to the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland.  The Bill gives the commissioners the responsibility to maintain the canals as a public amenity, whether for navigation, fishing or otherwise for the enjoyment of the public.  The transfer of the canals will mean that the commissioners will be taking over the ownership and care of more than 250 miles of waterways together with the canal banks, towpaths, lockhouses, docks and harbours.</P>
    <P>As regards the actual date when all this will happen the choice of vesting day, to be appointed under section 18 of the Bill, for the actual transfer of the canals to the Commissioners of Public Works, this will depend primarily on when the Bill is enacted, and also on the completion of any practical arrangements for transfer. For the reasons which I have given, the earlier the transfer takes place the better, so that the canals can assume their new role as a public amenity and be cared for and fostered as such.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal and the Royal Canal <Col N="227" /> need a new and flexible legislative framework in which to flourish.  I believe the Canals Bill provides such a framework and guarantees that their future will be assured by the Commissioners of Public Works for the nation.  Therefore, I look forward to the support of Senators in securing early enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the moves that are being made to rationalise the operation of the canals.  Indeed, there is hope in this Bill that not alone will rationalisation take place but that there will be co-operation between various bodies in this country to see that the canals are used to the maximum benefit to all interests, whether they be commercial or for pleasure purposes. For too long our canals have been neglected.  Even though there have been hundreds of Bills enacted on various aspects of the operation of canals the canal system has been run down but not because of any lack of interest on behalf of the people who have been working on the canals.  We should compliment them for the excellent work they have done in their professional capacity and for voluntarily going along to committees, giving information about the canals and how best they might be used.</P>
      <P>The canals have played a very important part in our transport system for very many years.  It is said that the first canal was built in Galway in the year 1200. Since then we have seen throughout the length and breadth of the country attempts made to link up north, south, east and west by a canal system, initially for commercial purposes for the transport of goods from one place to another. It was only with the running down of the canal system that people began to understand that the canals could be used for other than commercial usuage, that they could also be used for amenity purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 18th century seems to have been the time of greatest interest in the development of canals in Ireland.  It is significant that in the statistical survey of County Kilkenny, which is one of the best <Col N="228" /> statistical surveys of any county that was carried out by William Tighe in the years 1800 and 1801, there is more space devoted to canals and their development than to any other aspect of life in Kilkenny during those years.  If one reads the history of canals one will find too, that it is not only in the last couple of years that there have been overruns in public expenditure or the misuse of public money in the development of a public amenity.  Indeed, one of the things that forcibly strikes one when reading about the attempted development of canals in the Kilkenny, Carlow, Laois and Kildare areas is the amount of money that was voted for the development of canals and, indeed, the lack of progress in this development.</P>
    <P>The area that I have interest is in the Barrow system and it is significant that tolls on the Barrow in the year 1797 came to £767.14.11½, in 1798 £742.16.7½ and in 1799 £1,511.1.11½.  Those figures are significant because in 1800 the average wage for a man was £5.  If one considers that in 1797, £1,766 was taken in in tolls it gives an indication of the importance of canals on the Barrow.  There were 60 boats belonging to the town of Graiguenamanagh in 1790.  In 1800 there were only 40, but these were of a larger size.  When one considers that there is not in Graiguenamanagh at present any boat of reasonable size except boats used for pleasure one can see that the usage of canals has dropped enormously.  The statistical observations said that to establish a navigation from Kilkenny to the sea had been long considered an object of importance.  Much money was once expended in the attempt, many plans have been proposed but none adopted. All information therefore under this heading may be useful as the subject is still under consideration.</P>
    <P>At that time the gentlemen of the area were considered to be the merchants, farmers and inhabitants of the county.  In 1755 grants were given of £10,000 towards the development of canals, in 1759, £4,000, in 1763, £1,500, in 1763, £3,000 and in 1767, £2,750, giving a total for the Barrow of £25,250.  If we could <Col N="229" /> bring the £25,250 up to present currency values I reckon that would be far in excess of what has been expended by CIE on the Grand Canal Company since the State was founded.  In those five years more was expended in the Barrow area alone than has been expended on the complete canal system.  With regard to the overruns and failure to carry out public works, the statistical observations stated that in 1775 £3,000 more was granted but nothing had been done.  A sum of £3,000 was granted in the session of Parliament of 1775 of which, it was stated, £558 was still due to the contractors and that no part of the £2,750 granted in the session of 1776 to the commissioners for &ldquo;carrying on the inland navigation of this kingdom to be done has been expended but the whole of said sum remains to be applied or accounted for&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In other words, typically, somebody got the money and ran.</P>

      <P>The Statistical Survey of County Kilkenny in the years 1800 and 1801 sold by Archer, Commercial Buildings, bookseller to His Excellency, the Earl of Hardwicke.  What the Earl of Hardwicke had to do with it I do not know.  I want to make the point that throughout the mid and late 18th century moneys were given by the Parliament to people with names which have historical conotations.  The Rothes of Kilkenny, who are very well known in the historical context, got money and it would seem it was misappropriated.  The Collis family, who are very well known because one of them was the first man ever to treat the fracture now known as the Collis fracture also got money.  I came across the information in an appendix, that there was an estimate of £14,344.10.0 in April 1793, which was spent for the navigation from Thomastown to Inistioge, but that stretch of canal was never built.  According to Tighe, the next estimate of the probable expense of the navigation from Thomastown to Inistioge is founded on the plan and observations made by Mr. Lanigan. I am certain that Mr. Lanigan, at the <Col N="230" /> time, was quite capable of misdealing with money and plans as certain Lanigans might be at present.</P>
      <P>There were a number of canals proposed at that stage.  There was a canal from Monasterevan to Castlecomer and there were canals throughout the midlands. The up-to-date situation is that the canals &mdash; I would say due more to lack of money than anything else &mdash; have been allowed to fall into disrepair.  However, in the last few years, because of the interest in amenity use, the canals seem to be coming back into their own.  It would be foolish of anybody to suggest that the canals will ever again be used for commercial purposes.  In the future it would seem the canals will be used mainly for amenity.</P>
      <P>Amenity use of canals can create problems as between the various interests which can become involved.  We will have the interests of people who are involved in boating in conflict with people who are interested in fishing.  We will have the people involved in fishing possibly in conflict with people who want to use the canals for amenity use in terms of swimming. Therefore, there are a number of conflicts that could arise.  Section 5 (1) of the Bill reads:</P>
      <P>... it shall be the duty of the Commissioners to undertake the care, management and maintenance of the canals and other canal property as a public amenity for use by the public for navigation in such parts of the canals as are open to navigation from time to time for fishing or otherwise for the enjoyment and recreation of the public and the Commissioners may designate particular parts of the canals and other canal property for particular purposes including purposes incidental to such purposes as aforesaid.</P>
      <P>Section 5 (1) is very vague:</P>
      <P>the care, management and maintenance of the canals and other canal property as a public amenity for use by the public for navigation in such parts of the canals as are open to navigation from time to time ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> Does this mean it is intended that the canals will be closed to boats from time to time?  How does the Minister envisage these closure orders being made so that the canals can be used for a particular purpose?  I can foresee the situation arising where somebody might want to hold a major fishing competition on the canal and during the time that fishing competitions was being held you might have somebody coming up the river in a boat which could create more than tension in the area.</P>
    <P>The principal thing the Bill fails to do is to give the 75 employees of the canal the protection they need.  In every other Bill I have seen coming through the House &mdash; where workers are being transferred from one semi-State or State body to another &mdash; the workers' conditions have been laid out in full and the workers have known what their status would be in terms of remuneration after the change-over.  When one considers the canal situation, the Transport Act, 1950, made it quite specific in section 37 (a).  It reads:</P>
    <P>... an officer or servant of the Board, shall be deemed to suffer a worsening of his conditions of service as an officer or servant of the Board if, by reason of the transfer effected by section 36 ... he suffers any direct pecuniary loss or is in a worse position in respect of the conditions of his service as a whole (including tenure of office or employment, remuneration, gratuities, superannuation, sick fund or other benefits or allowances, whether obtaining legally or by customary practice and whether applicable to himself or his widow or children or other dependants) as compared with those obtaining in respect of him before the transfer;</P>
    <P>One of the anomalies of this Bill is that that guarantee is not being given to the workers on transfer from CIE to the Board of Works.  If this Bill is to have the support of this side of the House the Minister must spell out in detail what the conditions of service of the people <Col N="232" /> currently employed are going to be.  The current situation is that there are two executives, five supervisory people and the rest are general workers.  Some of these workers have varying degrees of perks which go along with their jobs. These perks were granted to them by virtue of the fact that they were negotiated perks, they were negotiated through their trade unions.  I cannot see why the guarantees which were given to workers who were transferring from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post cannot be given to the workers who will be transferring from CIE to the Office of Public works and why the same protection is not being given to these workers as was given under the Transport Act, 1950,</P>
    <P>It is my information that this Bill has taken approximately four years to draft and that the section which would give protection to the workers was in this draft Bill right along the line until the Bill itself was published.  I would like to know why the protection of workers should be taken out at this stage.  It may be that the Minister will say that the commissioners will sit down with these workers and negotiate after the vesting day.  I do not think that is satisfactory.  Any worker in CIE at present, who will be transferred, should know exactly the conditions under which he will be transferred.  He should know that he will not suffer any direct pecuniary loss, including remuneration, gratuities, superannuation, sick fund and other benefits.  There is no doubt that there are substantial benefits accruing to the canal workers in CIE at present which it would seem they will not have when they transfer to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>It seems also, since the number of people involved is much smaller than the number of people who were transferred on the break up of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, that the amount of money involved should not be such that it would inhibit the Minister from putting into the Bill the same statement as that contained in section 37 of the Transport Act, 1950.  There is no need for me to run <Col N="233" /> through the actual gratuities, the overtime, the travel concessions, the various other things that are at issue.  It would appear, even though these are points of issue with the workers, that the workers welcome the transfer in the sense that it might give them an opportunity to be involved in an exciting development of the canal system.  One of the reasons why these workers were frustrated to a degree over the past number of years was that even though they were under the aegis of CIE and their conditions of employment were quite good, the canal system was not getting the amount of money that it needed to provide any type of amenities.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that when this Bill becomes law the main thrust of the development will not be towards the Shannon only and that the Barrow and the midlands area of Kildare down to south County Carlow, into Kilkenny and down to New Ross and St. Mullins, will all be areas which will be given the attention they deserve.</P>
    <P>Of course there are a number of different types of canals or different types of navigation systems.  From Lowtown to Athy you have a man-made canal.  From Athy to St. Mullins you have a canalised river, and from St. Mullins down the estuary you have an estuary type of waterway.  To many people canals are man-made river systems that go through relatively flat countryside which is, generally speaking, uninteresting.  Anybody who travels on the Barrow system from Lowtown or Robertstown down to Cheekpoint or New Ross will see a canal system which is of tremendous beauty and which goes through many many different types of countryside.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister said that it is going to be an all-embracing development and that there will be consultation with people other than the Office of Public Works and that there will be cooperation because when I look at the area with which I am most familiar, we have the Barrow Awards Scheme which has been going now for a number of years and which has been of tremendous benefit to small towns and villages in County <Col N="234" /> Carlow, Kilkenny and up to County Kildare. I do not think 20 years ago anybody could have foreseen that in places along the Barrow we would have mooring points, that at Goresbridge in County Kilkenny there would be a crafts shop which is there because the River Barrow is being used.  We have a restaurant development in Leighlinbridge, and it is hoped that very shortly there will be a marina behind that restaurant.  We have a boat slip at Bagenalstown which is of tremendous use.  The river has given to St. Mullins a life that it had not got until there was a certain amount of development in the last ten years.  Anybody who has been to St. Mullins will consider it to be one of the most attractive and most unusual areas of antiquity and historical value in County Carlow or in the south-east.  I suggest that it is because of the development and use of the Barrow valley that this interest in and knowledge of that area are being developed.</P>
    <P>These are only some of the developments that have taken place.  You have a small boat building enterprise in Goresbridge, County Kilkenny, and also in Bagenalstown.  The tourism interests are well catered for and the scenery from New Ross up to St. Mullins, on the one side, and up to Inistioge in County Kilkenny on the other side, with the development of the Galley restaurant, has given to many people a further interest in developing their knowledge of the waterways of Ireland and indeed has possibly given an impetus to bringing in this Bill to try to ensure that our canal system will develop.</P>
    <P>We should not forget the great value that the canals and the inland waterways can have in the development of fisheries. Thousands of people have come from Great Britain and from all over the world for the coarse fishing, for eel, bream, roach, tench, pike, trout, the various fish that are generally available in our canals. I hope there will be a further development over the next few years in this aspect of usage of our waterways.  We must ensure over the next few years that the local authorities, who have a major input into how the canals and waterways <Col N="235" /> will be developed, will get sufficient funds to ensure that they will be creating a pollution free water environment because apart from farm effluent the major source of pollutants in the canals has been pollution coming from small towns which have not yet got sufficient funds from central Government to instal proper sewage treatment plants.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Carlow town sewage treatment plant is virtually in operation and that will play a big part in helping to alleviate the problem in that area.  We will be tabling an amendment for Committee Stage suggesting that the employees will be protected fully in regard to their remuneration and gratuities and in every aspect of their employment.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill reads:</P>
    <P>The Commissioners shall have all such powers as are necessary for the performance of their functions under this Act and shall, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, have power to undertake the care, management, control, maintenance, repair, improvement and development of the canals and other canal property and to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>It does not mention that the commissioners can join with other bodies in such developments.  I think that is a weakness in that section.  I feel that included in it should be that the commissioners should be able to join with bodies such as Bord Fáilte, the Barrow Awards Scheme people, or whoever, to undertake works which would benefit both the canal and the amenity value.  Section 6 also states that Commissioners will have power to:</P>
    <P>close to navigation any part of a canal not required for navigation and reopen and declare navigable any part of a canal previously closed to navigation;</P>
    <P>The old Act was specific in this in that if the canal was not used for three years CIE had power to close it.  This created a lot of hassle in the sixties.  That section gives the commissioners a good deal of <Col N="236" /> power without defining what the power is.  It does not state the conditions under which the closure can take place.  It does not say that it can be closed because it has not been used at all.  There is no specific reason given or there is no set of values which might pertain to the closure.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give us an indication as to what exactly &ldquo;not required for navigation&rdquo; means.  If the Minister is going to allow the commissioners to close any particular stretch and he does not give us the specifics he should at least be able to tell us to whom an appeal should be addressed or in what circumstances an appeal might be addressed to somebody.  The whole section is extremely vague and it gives the commissioners powers which I think they should not have unless the Minister specifies the extent of these powers and equally what right anybody might have to appeal against these powers.</P>
    <P>In section 7 we have by-laws concerning care, maintenance and control and the regulation of the use of canals.  I do not think anybody would disagree that fines of up to £1,000, and for a continuing contravention, fines not exceeding £100 a day, should be imposed on summary conviction and that the £5,000 together with the continuing £500 a day or imprisonment should be imposed for damage that might be caused to the canal perhaps by people driving along beside the canal on the towpaths, or dumping deleterious matter into the canal, or leaving boats there and so on.  However, the section also provides for summary conviction for anybody who might bathe in the canal without having permission.  It does not seem right to me than somebody who bathes in the canal without permission should be under threat of the imposition, on summary conviction, of a fine of £1,000.  I can understand the closing to navigation, the opening to navigation, the alteration of water levels but the regulation of bathing in canals surely should not be one of the things in that section.  In many cases the people who use the canal for swimming do not have any place else to swim.  In many cases they might not have any place else to <Col N="237" /> have a bath.  I do not think you are going to get them to go along to the commissioners to get permission to swim in the canal.  Section 7 (1) (e) should be changed or removed.  Possibly a summary fine of £5 could be imposed if it is found that a small amount of damage is done to the top of a lock or a lock gate, or something like that.</P>
    <P>The development of canals can play a major part in the future development of our tourism industry.  The Minister has, in the main, the right attitude towards this development.  I believe he will get the co-operation of the legislators, of the various tourism and cultural bodies in the orderly transfer from CIE to the Office of Public Works, but he will only get that if the rights of the employees are protected to the fullest.</P>
    <P>We should not allow this Bill to pass without paying a tribute to CIE for the work they have done in the past years in trying to protect our waterways as best they could in a situation where they were not getting adequate funding.  On the transfer to the Office of Public Works success will only be achieved if sufficient funding is given to the canals section of the Office of Public Works.  Under the financial constraints we have at present value for money does not seem to be the criteria by which money is spent. Government cuts are made willy-nilly. There are cuts in staff; people who are essential to the development of particular areas are not replaced.  It is no use making this transfer and making a lot of pious platitudinous noises about it unless there is sufficient money given to allow the development to take place in a reasonable fashion.</P>
    <P>I can see the excellent work that the Office of Public Works have done around the country in the restoration of old buildings. The craftsmen involved in the Office of Public Works do fantastic work but the work is being done under financial constraints.  I sincerely hope that when this Bill is passed we will see an extra input of moneys into the canal section of the Office of Public Works to ensure that our canals will be of the greatest use to the greatest number and that they will <Col N="238" /> not be allowed ever again to fall into the state of disrepair that they have been allowed to fall into over the past years.  I welcome the Bill with the proviso that the staff situation should be looked into and resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaMcAuliffeEnnis" hpid="Mrs. McAuliffe-Ennis Mrs. McAuliffe-Ennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McAuliffe-Ennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this move to transfer the ownership of the Grand and Royal Canals from CIE to the Office of Public Works.  The canals represent to me a valuable amenity which can be of tremendous value environmentally and socially across Ireland to both city, town and rural village alike.  These cities, towns and villages stretch along the route of the Grand Canal which is totally navigable and the Royal Canal which, in many places, is in a sad state of disrepair and therefore not navigable.</P>
      <P>Coming from Westmeath and knowing other speakers will have specific interests in the canals I will address my contribution to the area of the Royal Canal.  The Royal Canal in my view should be regarded as a potential national park comprising as it does some 1,000 acres of waterways, banks and towpaths stretching for 95 miles.  To fulfil the prime role of the canals' restoration to navigation is also desirable.  The Royal Canal could provide and has provided in areas where work has been carried out, valuable recreation and leisure facilities for rambling, nature studies, fishing, swimming, canoeing and so on.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill charges the Office of Public Works &mdash; as is outlined in section 5&mdash;to &ldquo;undertake the care, management and maintenance of the canals ... as a public amenity for use by the public for navigation in such parts of the canals as are open to navigation from time to time: or fishing or otherwise for the enjoyment and recreation of the public.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Lanigan, while I welcome the fact that the Bill charges the Minister in charge of the Office of Public Works to perform specific duties, the section outlining his duties is very vague.  It is especially vague in that it does not establish the priority in terms of the role of the <Col N="239" /> canals.  I might say that in Longford-Westmeath failing to establish the priority role of the canals can cause problems. I will give you an example.  In County Longford plans for a new bridge with full navigational clearance, have been prepared by the roads engineer. There are no engineering reasons why such a bridge should not be built.  Yet the point has been well made that as the Royal Canal in County Longford has already been culverted at six other road crossings, the extra cost of this bridge might not be justified.  That is a valid point.  In Westmeath, on the other hand, you have a situation where Westmeath County Council have completed the construction of the new high-level road bridge over the Royal Canal at Ballinea. They have planned for a full navigation-clear bridge on the Mullingar-Lanesboro road at Shandonagh.  There is an obvious concept here in that one cannot justify, for example, building another culvert in Longford while at the same time building these more expensive bridges in Westmeath or, on the other hand building expensive bridges in Westmeath as opposed to culverts.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to establish exactly what the priority of the canal should be.  If it is to restore it eventually to navigation, then the section is not strong enough; if it is to go into the fishing amenity area, it is still not clear.</P>
    <P>The section does not clarify at all that the Grand Canal is regarded as navigable. Under the law, the Grand Canal is open to navigation, but there is a change in the section whereby the Minister can at no specific time&mdash;or no specifics are given&mdash; close any of these canals.  We do not even know if the Minister can make a decision to say; &ldquo;Close the canals for navigation&rdquo;. It is not clear.  I would look for a further commitment.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal which was closed to navigation in 1961, was not totally abandoned in that CIE carried out limited repairs and maintenance, particularly in the eastern section between Dublin and Mullingar.  They carried out repairs to upper gates of locks which were in a state <Col N="240" /> of disrepair and cleared a certain amount of weeds and other materials.  Short stretches of bank are now the responsibility of local authorities.  The western section of the canal, however, is in a rather worse state of repair, the main problem being, as I have already mentioned, eight culverts&mdash;six on the mainline and two on the Longford branch&mdash;which have effectively closed off the Royal Canal to navigation.</P>
    <P>There are many works &mdash; this is the difficulty in terms of establishing whether we are talking about the canals as a navigable entity or not &mdash; that would need to be done.  For example, lock replacement, dredging, the repairing and clearing of banks, landscaping, the repairing and cleaning of lock chambers, repairing harbour walls and other retaining walls, the removal of minor obstructions from navigation, for example, cattle passes and low level footbridges are all matters which require attention.</P>
    <P>Perhaps at this stage it might be worthwhile having a look at what has happened over the last five years in the context of the Royal Canal.  The Royal Canal amenity group in particular have, on a voluntary basis and with the help of CIE and local authorities, carried out a considerable amount of restoration work on the canal.  In addition, they have received the full co-operation of AnCO in organising community youth training projects. Indeed, one such project involved the construction of new lock gates, repairs at various canal structures, including building bridges and harbours.  The success of all these projects has clearly demonstrated that the restoration in part at least of the Royal Canal might well be achieved by combining voluntary work and youth employment training, for example, and also obviously involving the local authorities. Of course, with the co-operation of the OPW and with this transfer I expect that there will be considerable co-operation from the OPW.  In a relatively short period it is possible that the Royal Canal will become navigable in part.  The longer term view, of course, would be that the problems which exist in Longford could <Col N="241" /> be sorted out, but I know that at this stage they are well in the future.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to elaborate more fully on works carried out within my own county. The works which I have seen carried out there demonstrate three different approaches and exemplify what commitment and interest from different groups of people can do.  If anybody has driven through Mullingar lately he will have seen that there has been considerable improvement and upgrading of the canal with the assistance of an environmental works scheme grant.  The grant which was given specifically for youth employment on the scheme converted the canal from what it was previously regarded as, and indeed was, a dumping place for all kinds of accumulated rubbish dumped there by people driving into the town, by residents, or whoever.  The project converted what was in effect a dump to a local amenity.</P>
    <P>The value of this local amenity is that it is being used more and more by the local inhabitants.  You can take a trip down there and you will see old people out walking; you will see families strolling with their children and they are doing it in peace and without fear of being pushed off footpaths or of children running out on roads.  The other activities which are taking place down there and which are of immense value to the community include fishing and there is liaison with the local VEC to organise at a later part of the year activities like canoeing and so on.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to congratulate the officials of Westmeath County Council on their initiative and for their commitment to restoring the Royal Canal, if not to navigation then certainly to a very important and useful amenity status.</P>
    <P>Eight or ten miles from Mullingar we have a small village called Ballinacargy. Ballinacargy could best be described by saying that it is on the back road from Mullingar to Longford.  Therefore it does not have large numbers passing through. Ballinacargy, on the other hand, has a harbour of its own.  With a grant of £1,000 the local community in Ballinacargy spent £10,000 clearing out that harbour and providing for the first time there an <Col N="242" /> amenity of value to the children and to their parents.  It has become the focal point of community activity and of community functions.  This was done basically and in the main as a result of hard work by individuals on a voluntary basis.  There was a very small commitment in terms of grant aid, but amazing work was done.</P>
    <P>In Killucan, County Westmeath, you had a combination of factors.  The initial happening was that the Royal Canal Amenity Group formed a branch.  The reaction from young and old alike again was tremendous.  Before the meeting took place the comment was, &ldquo;Who is interested in the Royal Canal?&rdquo;  But there were over 100 people in Killucan who were interested enough to join the branch of that organisation, to give up their evenings and to do what could best be described as hard graft in terms of pulling weeds and cleaning debris and so on.  The young and old were there, children, teenagers and so on.  There was general and committed community involvement.  AnCO were also involved at Killucan in that there is a community training project which is involved in repairs to the walls and to the locks and so on.  The local authority is also involved in that in recent times it allocated a grant of £2,000.</P>
    <P>What I am really saying is that in so many different ways, by a community of its own in its own interest, or with the help of local authorities, or with the help of the Department of Labour, much can be done without any major allocations of money.</P>
    <P>Having listed the difficulties which do exist in terms of the Royal Canal and its ultimate restoration which I personally would like to see, I am very strongly of opinion that many of the problems which now face anybody intending to restore the Royal Canal occurred because of lack of planning.  If you drive from Dublin to Mullingar you will see in areas like Kilcock, Enfield, Killucan, Mullingar etc. that works are going on.  There is no liaison between one group and another. While the works are well worth doing and are to be admired it is absolutely vital that planning should occur so that the works are done in conjunction with one <Col N="243" /> another.  I, therefore, appeal to the Minister who is present &mdash; it is a bit awkward appealing to the Minister because the Minister here today is losing the canals and the Minister who will receive the canals is not here &mdash; to pass on to the other Minister what has been said and ask for an assurance that despite the existing difficulties that in the long term interest of the Royal Canal no further hinderances will be allowed in the context of navigation.  That is absolutely vital.</P>
    <P>I also feel that it is vital that a liaison group be set up within the Office of Public Works.  This liaison group should certainly include representatives of Bord Fáilte, the Office of Public Works, the local authorities, the Department of Labour and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  The IDA could have an input in it.  Harbourwise, there is no reason why if one wants to be optimistic one could not see harbour development in the form of small enterprise centres. Relevant voluntary and community-based groups like the Inland Waterways Association and the Royal Canal Amenity Group should also be facilitated with a place within this liaison group.  It is a credit to these voluntary organisations that so much that has been done can be accredited to them.</P>
    <P>The picture I have painted seems bleak in terms of the Royal Canal being fully restored.  I believe that with more co-operation and liaison with various Government Departments much could be done.  For example, there is no reason why further community youth training projects could not be initiated, and there is no reason also why the social employment schemes should not be used to full advantage.  The Labour Party have taken the initiative on the youth side to secure some lasting value of this social employment scheme.  We have asked Labour councillors in the five counties through which the Royal Canal passes to submit this motion at council level for adoption. The motion calls on the manager and the county engineers to prepare a programme of work to bring about the <Col N="244" /> restoration of the Royal Canal in the functional area of the local authority by the following measures: to establish direct contact with the Board of Works and the Inland Waterways Association; to outline the works required; to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> group representing the six local authority areas through which the Royal Canal passes and to establish contact with the National Manpower Service to tap into this social employment scheme. While the question of finance is obviously a thorny subject there is no reason why local authorities cannot take up this scheme to put scarce funding into the works.</P>
    <P>I now come to the difficulty which has already been outlined by Senator Lanigan relating to section 3 and the transfer of staff.  The section which provides for the transfer of canal staff to OPW does little more than that &mdash; simply provides for the transfer of staff.  In the interest of good labour relations and in the interest of the people involved it is not enough to say that we will transfer you to what is in effect a new boss without telling you what the terms of your employment are going to be.  The terms of employment &mdash; if one examines the situation which exists within the OPW and for the current staff of CIE who will be transferring to OPW &mdash; are somewhat different.  In some cases in the OPW conditions are better.  Likewise, with some CIE employees certain advantages make their conditions somewhat better.  It will have to be clarified and included in the Bill that the staff are assured that they will not have less beneficial scales of pay or conditions than those they presently enjoy.  That is a reasonable approach, and it is one that the Labour Party would support strongly in view of our most recent work in this area in the transfer of Post Office workers. I ask the Minister to recommend strongly that that section be amended to include such provision.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech it was stated that the Government have decided that adequate resources will be made available to the Commissioners of Public Works to implement this Bill.  I am back again to my point of establishing exactly <Col N="245" /> what the prior role of the Bill is.  Is the prior role of the Bill to establish the canal as nothing more than an amenity <i>per se</i>, ignoring its prime role, which is navigation? If the Minister is in a position to assure me that the Bill is committed to the restoration of navigation to the Royal Canal then I am delighted.  I am sure the county manager in Longford will be delighted to see that the Government have decided that adequate resources will be made available to the commissioners to implement this Bill.  I would like clarification of that.</P>
    <P>I see also that fishing and navigation seem to have equal standing within the Bill.  I would say that there could be a clash of interests here.  To avoid such difficulties arising as to who has rights and who has not and what is the purpose of the Bill and the canals, the role of the canals should be established.</P>
    <P>The powers of closure are referred to in section 6 and also in section 7.  It is not quite clear for what purposes such powers of closure would be required.  Is it for permanent closure?  One could think that the three-year regulation which was there before is no longer contained in the Bill. Section 6 (e) and section 7 (b) make reference to closing to navigation.  Perhaps that could be clarified.</P>
    <P>I welcome the spirit in which the Minister presented the Bill to the House.  I am sure that the Minister in the interest of promoting one of our most extraordinary and valuable amenity areas, will have sympathy for the points that I have made and perhaps ensure that they are acted on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be said that as a people we are very strangely shortsighted in recognising our national assets in a way in which they should be exploited for the national benefit.  I do not have to remind the House that we import vegetables in huge proportions, while at the same time much of our land remains unused.  We poison our lakes, like Lough Ennel and Lough Sheelin.  Some of the finest fishing lakes in the world have been totally destroyed through sheer carelessness on our part.  The list is endless.  We could go <Col N="246" /> on with many other examples.  If you like, a Chathaoirleach, in this context the Canals Bill, 1985 is to be welcomed.  Here we have a plan to save the Royal Canal. The Royal Canal has been dead for years. It was closed in the sixties by CIE.  Any work to save the canal must be seen as a welcome development.  As Senator McAuliffe-Ennis said, for far too long it has been used as a dumping place for dead dogs, bicycles, prams and so on.  I believe that with some imagination, some hard work and some Government cash it can be made a worthwhile tourist attraction and it might well repay the cost many times over.</P>
      <P>The campaign over the five counties through which the canal flows by various people involved in the environment and by various community groups has at long last been recognised and approved by the Government.  We all know that this has been on the cards for many years with different Governments and different groups.  We all welcome the publication of the Bill which came to us some two weeks ago.  The plan is to restore the canal.  It will be restored with the help of unemployed youngsters.  That Bill has been promised by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, regrettably we have not yet seen it but we know that this type of scheme will form part and parcel of that Bill.</P>
      <P>In the sixties, CIE saw it as a waterway providing a means of commercial transport. Regrettably when it ceased to be this, CIE lost interest.  Hopefully, the Office of Public Works will see it as a major tourist attraction, where stretches of the canal can be developed for boating, fishing and other water sports, swimming, canoeing and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own view is that it will be almost impossible to make it totally navigable. Unless finance of huge proportions is given by the State for this work, it will never be navigable.  Even in County Longford alone to remove the bridges and make the canal navigable could cost from £5 million to £7 million.  However, despite the engineering problems and despite the economic reasons why I think it might never become totally navigable, <Col N="247" /> much worthwhile work can be done. Work is being done.  For example in my own County Westmeath, I would have to welcome the general clean-up that is taking place.  I would like to welcome this and congratulate the officials of Westmeath County Council.  The question I would ask is: are we going far enough?  I would hope that we would go for a long-term plan.  This would mean a commitment in millions of pounds to take away the bridges.  Rather than just clean the canal we would need to go to the basin of the canal to remove the two or three feet of mud that is there, clean it away, put it on the side of the banks to make proper footpaths suitable for walks for the people of this country and for tourists.</P>
    <P>I believe that with a long-term plan, backed up by a commitment of cash from the Government, much important work can be done which over the years will be repaid.  Again let me come back to this possibility which is very much in my mind, that it will never become totally navigable. As I said many stretches of it can become worthwhile.  This is eventually what I believe will emerge.  It can become very important for boating, fishing and for water sports.  For every one boat on the Royal Canal there are as many as 90 or 100 fishermen.  With a bit of work and foresight it could become a fisherman's paradise.  With so much leisure time on our hands, fishing will always be a pastime loved by the Irish people and by tourists.  Although other European canals are no longer used for commercial purposes, they have proved to be major tourist attractions.  A restored Royal Canal could generate employment and much-needed tourism in the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Grand Canal is different.  Many people feel it is as good today as ever it was.  While it needs dredging, it is totally navigable from Dublin to Shannon.  We should encourage more boating on this canal.  At the moment it is used in the early part of the year to get boats onto the Shannon and then bring them back in the autumn for repair or to be locked <Col N="248" /> up for the winter months.  We should endeavour to have it used more for boating. It is quite close to the River Shannon and people like to get out onto the bigger waterways.  I hope more and more such efforts will be made.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the question of dredging, and in the area of the Royal Canal this is very relevant.  CIE have not got the dredging machines necessary whereas the Office of Public Works have.  Dredging both canals under the control of the Office of Public Works is very appropriate and could be done at little cost.  The Office of Public Works are the proper authority to deal with these two canals. It seems that CIE have not the interest or, indeed, the money and they see themselves as not being in this business any more.  It is a pity they have adopted that approach, but we must not forget that we have a very good canal staff.  While the CIE staff have expertise in the navigation and in the drainage of the canals, it seems a logical step to transfer the operation of the canals to the Office of Public Works. If the canals are ever to be totally navigable many millions of pounds will have to be provided by the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister meant when he said: &ldquo;The Government have decided that adequate resources will be made available to the Commissioners of Public Works to implement this Bill.&rdquo; That is not spelled out sufficiently to my way of thinking to satisfy us that a worthwhile navigation job will be completed. We should be told exactly what kind of money we are talking about.  Another criticism is that in the Bill the staff have been forgotten, and natural justice demands that they should not be forgotten. It is well known that in the draft Bill some months ago provision was made for suitable staffing transfer arrangements. Section 3 refers to &ldquo;after consultation with the Commissioners.&rdquo;  To me that is extremely vague.  I would not like to be one of the staff transferring over with that section hanging around my neck, as it were.  I would feel I was entitled to far more knowledge of what was about to take place.  I do not know why it was <Col N="249" /> taken out of the draft Bill.  I do not know who took it out.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>
    <P>When An Bord Post and An Bord Telecom were transferred, transferring staff got their full rights.  I wonder has this anything to do with the future developments we hear talked about in CIE. To me it is a very worrying feature of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Transport Act, 1950, provides in section 36:</P>
    <P>Every person who immediately before the establishment date was an officer or servant of either dissolved undertaker shall as from the establishment date be transferred to and become an officer or servant of the board.</P>
    <P>Other sections of the 1950 Transport Act deal with the transfer of approximately 500 staff from the Grand Canal Company to CIE.  In the Act the conditions of service of the Grand Canal Company staff were fully protected under sections 36 to 38.  Many of the employees who made the transfer then are still with CIE.  In 1985 with so much talk of rights transferring staff should have the same conditions as they have in their present employment. I ask the Minister in his reply to say whether the existing staff who are affected by the transfer will be fully compensated for the loss of conditions which they presently enjoy.  It is a very reasonable question.  Will the Minister present, or the Minister for Communications, or the Minister for Finance who is responsible for the Office of Public Works, pay that compensation?  As I said, the staff appear to be forgotten.  There is not sufficient emphasis on how much the whole operation will cost and where exactly the money is coming from.  Generally I welcome the Bill.  It is a straightforward Bill. It is a logical step to transfer the canals from CIE to the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo.  Tá a fhios agam go maith gur thosnaigh sé cúpla bliain ó shin nuair a bhí Rialtas eile i bhfeidhm agus theip orthu é a thabhairt ós comhair na dTithe anseo.  Tá áthas orm gur éirigh leis an <Col N="250" /> Aire é a thabhairt go dtí an Teach agus tá áthas orm freisin gur cuireadh fáilte roimhe go ginearálta.</P>
      <P>It is nice to see legislation coming through which is changing the old system and to find that in general it is welcomed by the people involved.  While there are certain worries, I find in discussing it with different people that the Bill seems to be a good piece of legislation.  I welcome it. It sounds logical to me that the Office of Public Works should be in charge of the canals.  CIE did good work for the canals under their own system.  They are basically concerned with transport.  The canals are not used for transport and we now regard them as an amenity which is very important for the country but which is not a concern of CIE.</P>
      <P>The people involved in the maintenance of the canals have done a good job. I was talking to some of my friends who were involved in the boating scene and they were very complimentary about the way people had managed to do the dredging and keep the weeds at bay with weed cutters, and even bushes.  I hope that with the Office of Public Works managing the canals and the River Barrow, we will not have any deterioration in the standard of the waterways.  I hope that with the skills the Office of Public Works have and the facilities they have, they will make sure that things will improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Senator spoke about the amount of money which was pumped into the canals 100 years ago.  That is understandable. They were setting up the canals. They were of commercial value at that stage.  The demand for a commercial canals system no longer exists.  While I have every sympathy for the people of Longford, where the bridges have taken away the usefulness of the canals, we must not blame engineers who were building roadways when the Royal Canal was of no use.  We should not condemn the people who made those decisions.  As I was listening to other speakers I thought of people who threw out pieces of old furniture long ago thinking they were useless. If they had them back now they would be delighted because of their antique value.  The canal is much the same. <Col N="251" /> It has a lot of value now because of the people who use it.  The canal system has a tremendous value from our tourism point of view.  People like to come here. I was delighted to hear about a man who was born in Belfast but lived in Chicago for years.  He and his wife and daughter-in-law took a 33 foot boat across the Atlantic and arrived at St. Mullins, at the mouth of the Barrow, and decided to come inland and see the country.  He came through the Barrow, the Shannon and down through Limerick.  The canals have the advantage that they open up the internal part of our country and people who are lucky enough to have the time and facilities, in the words of the song, to go messing about in the river can enjoy the pleasure of boating.  They can see the country as they go along and can do it slowly.  If some politicians, including the Minister, could take an odd weekend away from clinics and go boating on the rivers, we would be saner and able to see things in a much better light.</P>
    <P>Many speakers took us on trips to different countries.  Coming from Carlow I consider that the River Barrow is very important.  St. Mullins is a place of beauty and a joy forever.  It is renowned.  It is the start of the inland trip for those who come in from the Atlantic and want to come through the Barrow.  There is an award scheme for the tidiest place on the River Barrow.  People deserve our thanks for keeping going a facility that is very important to us.  We want to cater for leisure and for visitors and, above all, we want to cater for our own people.  Many of the people who go boating on the Barrow and on the canals are Irish people taking a break.</P>
    <P>The question of the workers has been raised.  Workers' rights have always been taken for granted.  The Minister will be dealing with that on Committee Stage.  It would save a lot of worry if the wording was there explaining that they will be protected in the normal way and that they will not be at a disadvantage.  Even if it is the Minister's intention that they will not suffer any disadvantage, it would be foolish to leave that out.  It would be <Col N="252" /> advisable to get advice from the Inland Waterways on sections 6 and 7.  While they may not have an overruling say, they could be consulted.  The other problem is the question of fines.  One solicitor with whom I was speaking thought that the fines were slightly absurd.  On Committee Stage we can discuss these things.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a Bill to transfer responsibility for running the canals from CIE to the Office of Public Works.  That has been accepted.  I am glad it is being done.  I welcome the Bill and I thank all those who have made boating on the rivers and canals possible.  Many did it of their own free will.  Some of the people on the boats got out and cut the bushes themselves.  I hope we will have an improvement in the canals now that they are being taken over by the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>My contribution will be brief on Second Stage.  Like other Senators I welcome the Bill.  I am sorry we did not have more time to study the Bill, because there is a wealth of information and published works on canals.  In the time we had it was impossible to go into them in any great depth.  When making any study of this subject, one very important work is the Report by the Canals and Inland Waterways Commission which was presented to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1923.  The terms of reference of the inquiry are:</P>
      <P>To inquire into, and report on, the utilisation of inland waterways for purposes of transport, with particular regard to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the service rendered to the community at present;</P>
      <P>(2)  conditions and rates of employment incidental to upkeep and operation;</P>
      <P>(3)  measures necessary to secure maximum utility, having due regard to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  sound national economy;</P>
      <P>(b)  the relation of the waterways to other means of transport;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> (c)  their functions in respect of drainage, fisheries and power.</P>
    <P>The conclusion was a very positive one. I will quote from it:</P>
    <P>To revert to our terms of reference, we feel as the result of our examination of the general question of utilisation of inland waterways for purposes of transport, that we are fully justified in recommending the adoption of a definite policy having for its object speedy and active development of this economic factor.</P>
    <P>The report went into all the aspects and included very comprehensive maps.  It stated at one stage that where speed was not an important factor canals would be less costly than other means of transport. In situations where speed was important the railways would win out.  Indeed, who could foresee at that time that, in a very short period, even the railways would become obsolete?</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us a very comprehensive report on the canals.  I should like to quote from a paragraph in the report regarding the Grand Canal:</P>
    <P>An Irish Act of 1772 authorised the Commissioners of Inland Navigation to open a subscription of £60,000 for carrying on and completing the navigation begun by them about the year 1753, from the City of Dublin to the Shannon, or so much therof as should seem expedient to the Commissioners. The subscribers were authorised to be a &ldquo;Company of Undertakers of the Grand Canal&rdquo; and to carry on and complete the canal and make connections with the River Liffey and the navigable parts of the River Barrow.  They were also authorised to undertake the navigation of the Barrow from its sources to the Bridge of Athy and to make a junction with the River Boyne if they thought fit.  All the powers, privileges, advantages and authorities of the Commissioners in respect of the projected navigation were transferred to the Company.  They were authorised to take water from the River Liffey above the ford at Millicent, County Kildare, <Col N="254" /> for the purposes of navigation only, and to sell redundant water for industrial or other purposes.  The soil and water of the canal, together with the banks, were vested in the proprietors of joint stock.</P>
    <P>This is the introduction to the Royal Canal:</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal, 96 miles in length, including a short branch to the town of Longford, connects with the Upper Shannon at Tarmonbarry, provides a fairly direct water route between Dublin and the mineral area of Lough Allen, and connects Limerick by water with Longford, Mullingar, etc.  It was constructed under the provisions of a Charter granted to a joint stock Company in 1789.  The formation of the Company is said to have arisen out of the dissensions of the Grand Canal directors (of whom there were originally forty-one) and to have been actuated by motives of competition for the traffic between Dublin and the Shannon.</P>
    <P>The history of this Company is similar in many ways to the early history of the Grand Canal Company &mdash; a series of mistakes, ineptitude, maladministration, frequent Government grants, and payment of dividends out of capital. The Grand Canal Company persistently opposed the work throughout its progress by way of petitions and protests to the Government.  In 1813 the Royal Canal Company was bankrupt and the canal was taken over by the Directors-General of Ireland Navigation, who completed its construction.</P>
    <P>Like all other Senators who have spoken I believe that the implementation of this Bill will be a great help to tourism. In the area of fishing after the netting of salmon at sea and in the estuaries of our rivers, the fish is sold for perhaps £4 or £5 per lb. and then fetch a price of perhaps £30 or £40.  When we consider the value coarse fishing has for the country through tourism, the equivalent value <Col N="255" /> could be £1,000 when we take into consideration the money spent by tourists, on boat building, in provision of fishing tackle, and value to our hotels.  Fishing in all its aspects, particularly coarse fishing, is very important for tourism.</P>
    <P>I can recall going outside my home in Kells in the spring or summer and seeing cars passing early in the morning with boats and fishing tackle on their roof racks.  They were on their way to the fishing areas of County Cavan.</P>
    <P>The leisure and boating aspect for our young people who have time on their hands is important.  It strikes me that in winter when the canals are frozen over, we might be able to extend the pike fishing on Lough Caragh which seemed very enjoyable and attractive to look at. The only objection I have to it is that it seemed to include sex discrimination. There were males of all ages taking part, and no females.  However, I suppose this could be overcome.</P>
    <P>Like other Senators I should like to pay tribute to the voluntary workers who, over the years, have done tremendous work on parts of our canals.  I wonder what will happen where we have low culverts, low bridges, where roads have interfered with the proper functioning of the canals.  I hope that the transfer of the employees will be looked after in a proper manner.  I also hope that finances for maximum benefit will be available.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal runs through parts of County Meath but I feel the Bill could be perhaps extended to take in all our canals.  In that report also there is a full list of all our canals as follows: Shannon Navigation from Limerick Harbour to Lough Allen, including branches to Scarriff, Strokestown and Boyle 157 miles; River Maigue, from the Shannon Estuary to Adare, County Limerick, nine miles; River Blackwater, County Waterford, from Youghal Harbour to Cappoquin, 18 miles; River Bride from the River Blackwater to Tallow, seven miles; Suir Navigation from Waterford Harbour to Clonmel, 29 miles; River Slaney, from Wexford Harbour to Enniscorthy, 19 miles; Boyne Navigation, from <Col N="256" /> Drogheda Harbour to Navan, 19 miles; Lough Corrib Navigation, from Galway Harbour to Lough Corrib piers and quays, about 50 miles; Grand Canal, including Barrow Navigation, 208 miles; Royal Canal, 96 miles; Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal, 38 miles.  There were three which were not included in the report: Tralee Ship Canal, 1½ miles; Lismore Canal, 1¼ miles; and River Nore, 16 miles.</P>
    <P>I notice two things from that.  The total mileage of the Grand Canal, including the Barrow Navigation and the Royal Canal, is 304 miles.  The Minister told us in his introductory speech that the extent of these two canals to be taken over is over 250 miles.  I presume that the Barrow Navigation section is not included.  Also included in that list is the Boyne Navigation.  This is referred to very briefly at the start of that section as follows:</P>
    <P>The Lower Boyne Navigation, from Drogheda to Slane, was commenced by the Commissioners of Inland Navigation in 1759.  After the dissolution of the Commissioners, Irish Acts of 1788 and 1789 incorporated the River Boyne Company and conferred thereon all the powers, privileges, benefits and advantages in respect of the Boyne Navigation that were vested in the Grand Canal Company by their Act of 1772.  It was stipulated that unless the Company, within five years after the navigation had been completed up to Navan, extended it to Trim, the Lower Boyne Navigation from Drogheda to Slane should revert to the Government. The extension to Trim was not completed, and a projected branch to Athboy, through Kildalkey, and a canalisation of the River Blackwater from Navan to Kells &mdash; to which the inhabitants of the latter town were prepared to contribute &mdash; also failed to materialise.</P>
    <P>I would dearly love to see the Boyne Navigation included in this scheme.</P>
    <P>The River Blackwater has been dredged and cleaned between Navan and Kells and many people feel that the only difference now to its appearance and a <Col N="257" /> real canal is that it is not possible to use it for boats because the banks are very steep and the bed has been interfered with.  As I said, fishing is most important and I hope that the spawning beds will be restored as soon as possible because fishing has been interfered with.  I know that the work has been carried out in a very efficient manner and that hundreds of acres which until then grew nothing but rushes have since grown first class crops.  I ask the Minister some time in the near future to look at the situation with the Boyne Navigation and see if this could also be included in a similar Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief contribution to the Canals Bill, 1985. First of all, I want to welcome the principle involved in the Bill, that is the transfer of responsibility from the Department of Transport to the Office of Public Works.  I welcome it in view of the fact that Senators who are fortunate enough to have the facility of a canal in their area realise that it is a tremendous amenity.  I am not fortunate enough to be one of the Senators who have the privilege of having that amenity.  I know the Leas-Chathaoirleach looked at me to see if I had water on the brain suddenly when I was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was aspiring to reflect the views of the previous Senators who enjoy the beautiful amenity of these canals.  It is a tremendous amenity.  For that reason I welcome the fact that the Government made a conscious decision that because of the amenity value of the canals their transfer to the Commissioners of Public Works was a desirable thing to do.  That decision was based, first of all, on the confidence they have in the Office of Public Works to maintain this tremendous amenity throughout the country. Those of us who have had dealings with the Office of Public Works, no matter how slow and tedious at times we consider their work is and how difficult it might be to get them to move in to do a job, know that once they attempt to do a job they <Col N="258" /> do it admirably.  The end result is always something that all of us can be very proud of.  To hand the responsibility in this area to such a responsible authority as the Office of Public Works is something to be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I want to put on the record of the House today my tribute to Córas Iompair Éireann who dealt with the canals over many years.  It is to their credit that in spite of various pressures that had arisen from developing authorities, particularly in Dublin city, they did not accede to the pressures in relation to the closing of canals particularly in Dublin.  The Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, whom I welcome to this House, mentioned that even though the commercial traffic on both canals continued to decline and become negligible the result was that the Transport Act 1958 gave CIE the power to close the canals or any part of them to navigation which had not been used for public navigation for three years or more. The Transport Act, 1960 also gave power to CIE to close the entire Royal Canal to navigation.  We all recall the tremendous concern that was expressed by the public in case this happened and that through some decision of any authority these canals would be closed, they would be drained out and be used for either roadways or laying of pipes for gas, water or other things.  I am delighted that either CIE or those responsible did not take what they had the power to do, to go and misuse what I consider a tremendous amenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That leaves us then with a whole network of waterways throughout the country which are a tremendous amenity for boating, fishing and bathing.  I am sure the Commissioners of Public Works will keep this in mind and that we want them not alone to maintain the canals but to improve the facilities that are there and make them available to more people who would want to use them.  They are a tremendous national asset.  They have a cultural asset which the Minister of State recognises by his presence with us today. In addition to that we hope that, because they will be still in public ownership, the public will have the right of access on to <Col N="259" /> them without in fact infringing in any overall rights that the Commissioners of Public Works might want to maintain.  I am sure the sections of the Bill that deal with fines for the abuse of them are intended to be a deterrent to people throughout the country who tend to use waterways as areas of pollution.  It is a tragedy that during picnics and other outings of people areas like this tend to get polluted.  I hope the local authorities, with the powers of the 1981 Water Pollution Act, will ensure that is implemented to protect the amenity of our canals.  I do not envisage for a moment that anybody who wants to swim in them except possibly in the nude &mdash; then perhaps some of the councillors in Dublin will want to put an order on sections of the canal to have nude bathing &mdash; will be prevented.  I do not think Senator Lanigan should have any worries about having £1,000 fines initiated on somebody that might want to use canals for that amenity.  People use these waterways for that purpose.  I have no doubt that the Commissioners of Public Works will maintain that amenity.</P>
    <P>I want, having complimented CIE for the way they have maintained the canals in spite of the changes that have taken place in their usage, to put on record particularly the appreciation of this House to the staff involved in that section of CIE.  It is in that regard that, following discussions I had with members of the staff and members of trade unions representing the staff, I had a discussion last week with the Minister for Communications and his Minister of State, Deputy Nealon and pointed out the reservations I had about various sections of the Bill which did not include the existing rights of the workers involved there to transfer to their new employer with existing conditions. It is imperative that any legislation that is enacted in this House should reflect the existing rights of workers.  I, representing the Labour Party in this House, am quite confident that our wishes will be met by a suitable Government amendment to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I concur with Senator Lanigan, the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, and <Col N="260" /> indeed with Senator McAuliffe-Ennis, who has done a lot of work in the preparation of her contribution on this Bill, that it is essential that the workers' rights are protected.  It is a minimum requirement in the Bill.  I know that in previous legislation members of my party ensured that existing workers and their rights were protected by legislation in the transfer to various other semi-State bodies or indeed as in the case of An Post or Bord Telecom we put into legislation the protection of workers in those areas.  Experience in the meantime has proved how imperative it is for the workers that their future conditions are enshrined in the legislation that we enact here in the actual transfer.</P>
    <P>I know that in the preparation of this Bill and in various stages of preparation of the heads of the Bill for Government this particular regulation was written in and it was only for some reason at the eleventh hour that they were not included in the final draft by the parliamentary draftsman.  It is because of that that I decided to bring to the Minister's attention our disquiet at the exclusion of this very important section and to ask him in his response to the Second Stage of the debate today that he might put on record the fact that what I have said is true, the reservations I have expressed and his own views on this particular subject.  I have every confidence that this problem can be properly dealt with by amendment, and I have no doubt that when we come to deal with Committee Stage we will be able to deal with this aspect of the Bill, which is one of the few remaining contentious items in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are about 75 people involved and they are quite pleased with the new challenge that will be given to them in the enactment of this Bill.  The fact that there is Government commitment to ensure that sufficient funds are available to do the job properly gives them a new dimension to their future employment under their new employers.  Even though they are still working for the State they will have a new direction.  The Bill from that point of view is welcomed.</P>
    <P>There are some areas in the Bill about the protection of fisheries.  I am quite sure <Col N="261" /> consultation will take place between the relevant Ministers in this regard and that there will not be an incompatibility but the fullest possible use will be made of the canals, and there is no reason to believe that any boating, swimming or fishing will interfere with one another. The only area that I could ever envisage an interference with fisheries is if there was a major dredging or anything else taking place in the canal.  I have no doubt that consultation will take place then with the Minister for Fisheries who has a responsibility in this area to protect fish stocks.  That section is in the Bill, and it gives me pleasure to know that we are also conscious of that amenity.  I do not think any particular amenity should have a superior right to another one.  Consultation is important to overcome any particular problems that might arise in the area of fisheries.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill.  It is certainly to be welcomed by people like local authority members who are involved in protecting amenities like this throughout the country. I have no doubt that the Minister will get widespread support in this House for the Second Stage of the Bill.  We look forward to discussing with him our amendments so that we can proceed to Committee Stage of the Bill at another date.  I want to welcome the broad outlines of the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also, like the other Senators who have spoken, like to welcome the contents of this Bill.  The intention of the Government in introducing this Canals Bill, 1985 is a follow through of the announcement by them as far back as 1978 that the transfer of the canals would take place and the present management of the canals by Córas Iompar Éireann would become the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  I have some doubts, although I am prepared to accept that the correct decision was made in 1978, that in fact it has been the right decision to transfer these canals to the Office of Public Works.  That is not to say that the Office of Public Works are not responsible in <Col N="262" /> many areas of our national life from our national parks to the restoration of buildings like the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>There are very commendable works on public buildings, parks and areas of leisure but I am inclined to think &mdash; I know this is shared by others &mdash; that perhaps the best solution might have been seen in the programme of reform of local government and in returning the canals to the management of the local authorities who are responsible or at least whose areas these canals are in.  If some co-ordinating authority had been set up to manage the canal system as a whole that might have been a preferable decision in the interests of the canal system. That may be a somewhat academic point in that I am certain there will be considerable consultation with the local authorities who will have an interest in the development of the canals over the coming years.  I feel sure that the Office of Public Works will use their position under this Bill to the fullest extent.</P>
      <P>A number of things occur to me in relation to the canal system as I have known it.  Senator Ferris in his contribution mentioned that he was not one of the lucky ones who live close to a canal. I live within about two minutes walk of the Grand Canal.  Seemingly more Senators live by the banks of the Royal Canal than by the banks of the Grand Canal.  I cannot fathom why that is happening, but certainly there seems to be much more knowledge of the Royal Canal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Grand Canal system, the one I know best, is, of course, the earliest of these and, commercially, was the most viable of the canal systems built some centuries ago.  It was only commercially viable for a period of about 30 years.  In more recent times we had the closing of the Royal Canal to navigation.  In the case of the Royal Canal the commercial viability was even more shortlived than on the Grand Canal.  One thing that strikes me as extremely important from a public emphasis point of view in this whole transfer, is that it is not just a <Col N="263" /> cosmetic exercise of changing the management of the canals from one public body, CIE, to the Office of Public Works. It is also an important time when a marker should go down to the people of Ireland and, in particular, to the people of Dublin, about the way in which they make use of the canals and the way in which they appreciate the canal system.</P>
    <P>I will not reflect on the activities of CIE and Dublin Corporation who have been working together to try to look after the canals within the Dublin area in recent times.  There is a marked contrast in the way in which the Grand Canal and other canals are treated.  For example, if you visit Amsterdam or other European cities you will see the canal system is such a major area of attraction in its urban life. We seem to be quite happy to throw virtually everything that is not of any use to us any longer in the home into the canal.  You will see frequently in parts of the canal that are not as conspicuous to the vast majority of the public the number of old bedsteads, mattresses and rubbish that ends up in the canal quite indiscriminately.  It also happens on disused railway lines, an area where legislatively we will have to start acting in the near future as to who is responsible for many of the old railway lines that have been closed and which receive very little maintenance in terms of giving a tidy appearance environmentally.</P>
    <P>The experience has been that far too much indiscriminate dumping has been going on by people living in Dublin and by people living elsewhere into our canal system which, at the same time, I suppose, is to be contrasted against the increasing number of people who use the canal system for enjoyment and for pleasure. The number of people using the canal system for various areas of leisure and pleasure has grown enormously.  The boating potential of the Shannon system, just to name one figure, is of the order of 1,500 boats at present using that system. The number of young people who use the better known parts of the Grand Canal, for example, through the areas along <Col N="264" /> from Huband Bridge right up to Inchicore, has increased over the years.  The number of people who use that now for boating and indeed for canoeing is a very pleasant sight, particularly during summer weekends.  The potential in this area is enormous.</P>
    <P>From the tourist point of view, with the possibility of connecting into the much larger river and canal system throughout the country it must lead to enormous benefits to our people.  The fact that Bord Fáilte are able to record a figure of £30,000 earned in the area of Prosperous, County Kildare in one year from those who engage in fishing and the coarse fishing potential of the canal system are things to be highlighted.  Dublin Corporation last year encouraged a competition for young men and women interested in fishing who decided that they had sufficient interest to get out on the canals. Some 353 youngsters, based in Portobello and Phibsboro, took part in a very interesting and well run competition in the height of last summer.</P>
    <P>It is also fair to say that the growth in interest in fishing on the canal systems in the United Kingdom and in Europe generally brings large numbers of people of all ages to the canal banks.  It is said that 3.7 million people in the United Kingdom have an interest in the coarse fishing activities that are available in the canal system there.  There are some 12 million people who have a particular interest in fishing in the canals that are near to their homes and which give a great potential for leisure and pursuits such as coarse fishing and the boating potential that exists there also.</P>
    <P>The future of the canal system is, of course, one of the major themes of the Bill which is before us today.  I have no doubt that the Commissioners of Public Works will be consulting and co-operating with Bord Fáilte, with the central and regional fishing boards, with the local authorities and with those who have an investment already in the canal system.  I hope at the same time that we will come up with ways of developing the canal system that will appeal, not just to the areas that are known to us already but to <Col N="265" /> much greater areas of scope in terms of use for leisure and pleasure and for developing the canal system as an amenity and particularly, as far as I am concerned, in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Those who live in rural areas have many attractions, be they the seashore or the outskirts of the village.  When you live in a city one of the few ways of getting away from urban life and having a break is to walk along that canal, it is fundamental that we see the canals with the kind of potential that I believe they have.  It must be possible in the foreseeable future for us to develop something similar along the banks of the Royal and Grand Canals within the Dublin region to what Dublin Corporation have developed along the banks of the Tolka and the Dodder in the form of walkways, which will provide a much greater amenity for those who want to use them for walking and for cycling.  It is not inconceivable that one side of the canal could be available for those who are walking or fishing, and the other side of the canal could be available for those who are cycling.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous increase in the number of cyclists in our community in recent times.  I gather the figure from An Foras Forbartha is something of the order of 900,000 bicycles in this country at the moment.  Some of those are not used so often.  But certainly the experience in Dublin in the last five years is that there is a greater degree of interest in cycling. It is not just because of the heightened consciousness of healthy pursuits, but because people are leaving their cars at home and are much more concerned about having facilities laid on such as parking areas for bicycles and the development of cycle ways.  The corporation and county council are under some considerable pressure now to get on with developing facilities for cyclists.  One of the most appealing developments they could have within the Dublin region is to see the canal system worked into the cyclist programme and worked into a very healthy outdoor pursuit which could be availed of by so many.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the extent of coarse <Col N="266" /> fishing that could exist along the canal system.  I would also like to mention in this regard that the National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland have a membership of 2,500 people, and some 5,000 people who would not be exactly sleeping members of the federation, but would not be as active as fishermen as they were in the past.  There are nonetheless between these two figures a considerable number of people who would have an interest in the development of the canal system and in the close working together of the Office of Public Works and their interests in relation to the development from a fishing point of view.</P>
    <P>I understand one of the concerns they have in recent times has been the use by Córas Iompair Éireann of a herbicide called &ldquo;casserone G&rdquo; which is used to deal with weeds within the canal system. I understand also that whereas this may be used to clear the central passage of the canal for boating purposes, it has the effect of working its way into ruining a lot of very important biological and ecological life in the canal system.  It is harmful to fish life.</P>
    <P>Many of those who know this area feel that the degree to which the Office of Public Works in the future can use these chemicals must be dictated by an all round understanding of the range of values the canal system has.  It is not just that walking and fishing may be under some threat due to the use of this important drug from Holland, which is supplied in this country; there is also the important value, which I mentioned earlier, of boating and the importance in all of this of getting some kind of understanding with all those concerned.  This would mean an adequate degree of consultation with the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>When we come to Committee Stage I intend to move two amendments and to consult with the Minister in relation to them.  These are in relation to section 5 (2) which reads:</P>
    <P>Where it appears to the Commissioners that any works of improvement or development of the canal property would be likely to seriously affect fish <Col N="267" /> stocks in the canals they shall consult with the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>I propose that it should be something along the lines of:</P>
    <P>The Commissioners shall consult with the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry on all matters that relate to fishing, fisheries, management of the canals at all stages of work in the improvement and development of the canals and canal property.</P>
    <P>They seem to have, in the drafting of the amendment, a form of words that would give the Commissioners of Public Works a way out in many instances.  The words used are, &ldquo;would be likely to seriously affect fish stocks...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not up to the Commissioners of Public Works to decide what will affect fish stocks.  It is up to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry on any matter relating to the fishing and fisheries management that they should, as a matter of course, be consulted and that is clearly brought under the control of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry in that regard.  I give notice of an amendment that we could be dealing with at a later Stage in this Bill.  Under section 7 (f), which arises somewhat later, we have:</P>
    <P>the regulation of fishing in the canals (other than matters in respect of which the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry may make by-laws under section 9 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959).</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting is that:</P>
    <P>Other than matters in respect of which the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry may make by-laws under section 9 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 the regulation of fishing and fisheries management shall be the responsibility of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and shall include water quality control, biological, ecological and fish stocks management and to regulate and control fishing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> In this area where there is a considerable level of interest and vast numbers of people of all ages using the canal for coarse fishing and with the enormous potential of this as seen by many of our European neighbours we have to get into the business of using the expertise that is available in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry not on a may, may, may basis but on a basis of understanding that they have a very major role in the future development of the canal system and must be consulted at all stages where fish or fish management come into account. That is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise this with the Minister and perhaps he in the course of his reply could give some indication as to the level of capital support that the Office of Public Works may have available in the development of the canal system.  The canal system is, as the Minister outlined himself in a very comprehensive introduction, a system of waterways, canal banks, towpaths, lock houses, docks and harbours. There are certainly over 250 miles of canal.  There is a great deal of masonry, there is a great deal of maintenance in all of this.  Córas Iompair Éireann spend of the order of £1 million annually in maintaining this system.  If we are to get into the business of delivering these canals into an area of major potential from the point of view of tourism &mdash; leisure pursuits, boating, coarse fishing, cycling, walkways &mdash; the millions of pounds you could spend on that seems to me to be endless.</P>
    <P>Nobody expects the Minister to open a box that has been discovered in the Department responsible for Arts and Culture to be released somehow to the benefit of the canal system.  Our national finances are stretched.  Does the Minister envisage the Office of Public Works coming up within a period of time &mdash; he might be able to specify the time &mdash; with some indication as to the programme of development of the canal system and the extent of finance that in the long term, over the next ten or 20 years, might be required to develop that system to the full?  I would also like to know the Minister's view on the important area of developing this system by way of using the social employment <Col N="269" /> scheme announced by the Government recently and in particular in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality.</i>  It seems to offer in many areas of the country a great potential of rebuilding the canal system which was developed a number of centuries ago.  The Grand Canal system was developed in 1756 and the Royal Canal in 1789.  In the interval perhaps it is fair to say that beyond maintenance very little has been done towards major improvements to that system.  We have seen the loss of hotels that existed on it.  Some of them have now become prosperous again in parts of Kildare and elsewhere.  I hope that a programme of development of these canals could be considered and some date given as to when the Office of Public Works in conjunction with all the other public, statutory and other bodies in the country can get down to the business of dealing with it.  I emphasise within the city of Dublin which, <i>pro rata</i> of the population, would have the largest number of people living on the banks of the canal.  Being almost a canal dweller myself I would hope that the development within the city of an environmental use of a major leisure development such as Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have done in relation to the Tolka and the Dodder could be seen as part of that programme.  In doing that they would release a new opportunity to very many hundreds of thousands of people within the greater Dublin area who could use this canal and who would then be &mdash; to get back to my opening point &mdash; motivated to take care of that canal, to refrain from dumping into the canal and to see it as a major potential for development of tourism and leisure facilities.  With a plan of that kind we can look forward to many centuries ahead of the canal system.</P>
    <P>I would have had some different views in 1978 in relation to the Bill and the change to the Office of Public Works. Like many things that happen in the public area when the train goes on the rails there is very little you can do.  It is very hard to disturb it.  The train went on the rails.  It was decided to have this <Col N="270" /> system delivered to the Office of Public Works.  I hope that they will, in the fashion to which we have become accustomed &mdash; we saw it in the opening of the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham recently &mdash; do us proud in the work ahead.  I wish them well in their reign of responsibility for the canal system.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Córas Iompair Éireann for the way in which they have conducted themselves in the laborious and not very glory ridden period they have had.  It has been a pretty thankless task, managing a canal system which has not exactly been funded or spirited from the State generally. It is a miracle that the canal system has survived as well as it has to this day. I will take the opportunity of coming in at a later stage on this Bill.  I have given notice to the Minister of two areas relating to fish and fish management which could be improved upon by way of amendment, with his co-operation, at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Senators for their very interesting and positive contributions throughout the debate.  I have absolutely no doubt that the Commissioners of Public Works will carefully consider all that has been said, because it has been said in a very positive manner, imaginative ideas coming forward during a very limited period.  It goes to demonstrate the enormous potential that exists in our canals. We all look forward to the canals flourishing again under the expert stewardship of the Commissioners as they have proved many, many times in the past over such a wide variety of areas connected with our heritage.</P>
      <P>As far as the Bill itself is concerned, I have carefully noted all of the points that have been made.  That is the proper approach as far as a Bill of this nature is concerned or indeed as far as most Bills are concerned, because anything that has been said was with a view to making a better Bill and ensuring a better future for our canals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan, Leader of the Opposition, mentioned the possible conflict of <Col N="271" /> the users' interests as far as the canals are concerned.  It would be a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works to decide the best use to be made of these, the best way in which they can be operated and safeguarded.  It would be wrong if we went into too much detail on a Bill of this nature.  The Bill is left intentionally wide to give the commissioners the necessary flexibility in their tasks and in regard to new developments that may come forward which we cannot envisage at this stage.  In this respect it is based on previous Acts with which the Office of Public Works are concerned.  A good example of this is the Phoenix Park Act.  There is a great deal of flexibility there and this is thought to be the best approach in this kind of Bill.</P>
    <P>As far as the actual powers in the Bill are concerned, in implementing the various duties they have, the commissioners will be entitled to make by-laws specified in a specific section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators Browne and Lanigan, and in a different context, Senator Ferris, mentioned the range of penalties.  Both Senators Browne and Lanigan thought that they were excessive.  These penalties are modelled on the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 because of the need to safeguard our waterways. Only parameters are mentioned here and it will be a matter for the various courts to decide the actual level of fines.  Unauthorised swimming, which was mentioned, could create major difficulties in certain areas.</P>
    <P>Senators McAuliffe-Ennis and Lanigan and a number of other Senators talked about the powers the Commissioners of Public Works have.  As I have already stated, the Bill is intentionally wide and avoids unnecessary detail.  As I stated in my opening speech, the first job of the commissioners will be to assess the entire network, in excess of 250 miles of waterways, in varying conditions, to see what work has to be done.  They will have to examine the very basic structural condition of the canals.  In regard to any developments, they will take into consideration the local interests and have <Col N="272" /> consultations with them, as is the case at the moment as far as the navigation of other areas is concerned, the Shannon Navigation, for instance.  The Office of Public Works have great experience in this area, as they have in most areas of preservation of our heritage and making maximum use of it in modern times.</P>
    <P>The improvement and the development of the canals will be tackled by the Commissioners of Public Works in the light of the assessment they will make of the structural conditions and depending on the available resources, including assistance from local groups.  There is no way they can tackle the whole lot all at once.  Obviously that type of finance is not available in present conditions.  However, they will have a definite plan of operation; they will have a programme. First of all, they will assess the situation, the condition of the canals, the potential development, and they will then work out a detailed programme.  The Government will make their decision at the appropriate time as to what funds will be made available to the Office of Public Works. The Government have decided that adequate resources will be made available to the Commissioners of Public Works in order to implement this Bill. There is no use in saying that this will happen all at once.  It is a massive task.</P>
    <P>It might be wise if I gave some indication of the kind of work which needs to be done.  Take the Royal Canal, which was mentioned in considerable detail by Senator McAuliffe-Ennis.  It stretches for about 90½ miles, and approximately 30 miles are dry, mainly through the County Longford area.  Six culverts have been built across the Royal Canal at the dry stretch.  Permission was given to CIE in the Transport Act, 1960, to close the Royal Canal to navigation.  This gives us some concept of what is involved.  There are other areas in difficulty also.  There is an enormous amount of work to be done. There is no point in saying it is going to be tackled all at once, that suddenly everything will be put right.  The Commissioners of Public Works will have to work out a programme to which they will work.  This is a public asset.  Everyone <Col N="273" /> realises it is.  It is there to be protected, safeguarded and enhanced.  This will be the approach of the Office of Public Works.  All we have to do is to examine the record of their achievements, most recently in regard to their incredible restoration of the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham, which has come under my aegis now in the area of Arts and Culture. I have every confidence in the canals being entrusted to them.  I have every confidence in them in relation to this task. They are dominated in their thinking by the necessity for preservation and also they make the maximum use of whatever facility they have in modern conditions. I should not like to minimise the task but it is going into very good hands, to people with a caring approach and a view to preservation and maximising the great potential which the House has heard outlined by several Senators.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald, Senator McAuliffe-Ennis and a number of other Senators spoke of the potential of using a variety of means so that the work of preservation and structural work would not become a major burden on the State, for example, the youth employment scheme and the social employment scheme.  All of these are imaginative ideas and they will be taken into consideration by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of the variety of purposes for which the canals might be used.  In this short debate we had several contributions with new ideas of what might be done.  As the debate develops and this responsibility comes under the aegis of the Office of Public Works and as a new interest will be shown in the canals, then those ideas will flow.  I have no doubt there will be a welcome reception for them in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>From what I know of the structural conditions of the canals the approach of the commissioners following their assessment may have to be tackled on a three-pronged basis &mdash; the Grand Canal, the Royal Canal and the Barrow Navigation. These canals are in different conditions and will need a special type of attention. I imagine they will be tackled separately <Col N="274" /> because of the necessity for urgent action in particular cases.  All of this is a matter which can be safely entrusted to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan, Leader of the Opposition, and Senators Ferris, McAuliffe-Ennis, and FitzGerald, all referred to the question of the transfer of staff from CIE to the canals.  At present there are approximately 70 to 80 canal staff with CIE, some at the highest level and some have other duties in addition to canal work.  The detailed terms and conditions on which CIE staff would transfer are matters for negotiation between the staff and the employers, CIE and the Office of Public Works.  The Transport Acts and the P &amp; T Services Acts, which were involved in the transfer of staff between the canals and CIE and the more recent transfer, in Posts and Telegraphs, are not directly comparable to this.  In this case we have people moving from a semi-State into a State body, whereas in the P &amp; T service it was all from the State.  The Transport Acts were between private companies at that particular stage.  They are not directly comparable in that particular respect.  As I have said, all of these details have to be worked out.  I have noted very carefully what several Senators, in a very positive manner, have said about the transfer of staff.  This is something that will be considered by the Minister and by myself between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am extremely grateful for the positive manner in which this was received and for the ideas put forward and for the expressions of thanks to CIE for keeping the canals going under extremely difficult circumstances.  I thank all of the Senators. I think that the only limitation now to what can be done with the canals within the context of waterways is imagination and local initiative and above all co-operation with the Office of Public Works in preventing vandalism and also co-operating and improving the waterways.  This is an extremely interesting and an extremely exciting development for the canal system.  Some of it is in fairly good shape and some in rather bad shape. There is a lot of work to be done but <Col N="275" /> overall, we must view it, even though it was originated, and enormous amounts of money were spent on it, as a means of transport.  Though that has disappeared to a great extent, it is still a great asset. It is an inheritance from the past.  It can be of great benefit.  I believe that with the introduction of this Bill a new era has been inaugurated for our canal system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this matter of the views of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation relating to the classification of disadvantaged areas and related matters, I would like to make a number of observations.  Firstly, I believe that the timing of this review is very appropriate, because at the present stage farmers generally, not alone in the disadvantaged or less privileged areas, but throughout the whole country are, in fact, confronted with a very serious economic situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's outline to us last week we got all the details <i>vis-a-vis</i> the representations which were made to him and to his Department and so on by different groups like the committees of agriculture, farming organisations at national <Col N="276" /> and local level and so on.  All the proposals and suggestions by these various agencies have obviously been taken on board by the Minister.  This review, which is the third one, differs quite significantly from the previous two and indeed from the original designation, in so far as at this stage there is a very significant move away from the district electoral division aspect or concept.  The criterion used here is the townland.  This is a very great advance.  I believe that all concerned with the situation are to be complimented for looking in that direction, rather than staying with the old DEDs which existed where several townlands made up a DE area.  For that reason you had areas in that did not necessarily need to be in and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>I would submit to the Minister that even with the townland as the base for including an area or excluding it there are still major anomalies with regard to this whole question of the classification of the country for the purposes of special aid and so on.  There are vast regions of this country that unfortunately do not get anything like what they require to make them viable.  There are many small farms in various counties that are totally excluded from the various headage payments that we talk about in this whole context.  That is one thing, I would say quite emphatically to the Minister that needs to be looked at again.  We have certain disadvantaged farms, in fact more disadvantaged than many of the farms that are within a disadvantaged area at the present time or indeed even in the future, arising from the Minister's good work and his team in getting an extension of the area.  I am satisfied there will be a lot of areas, certainly a lot of disadvantaged farms in what might seem to be good areas, left out.  I would like the Minister to take very serious cognisance of that, because it is a basic weakness in the whole scene of things.  I feel that until we have a position whereby the actual farm would be viewed in its position in relation to being disadvantaged or not, we have not reached the goal that we should be aiming for.  There are, I am aware, very significant changes that will come about as a <Col N="277" /> result of this review and the extension of the disadvantaged area in the country. We will have more areas in.  A survey was carried out of approximately four million acres and hopefully we will have a fair percentage of that included in the new scheme.  That will be a step forward, but the handicaps and weaknesses to which I have referred will still remain with us.</P>
    <P>I should compliment the Minister for the very in-depth and detailed analysis that was made of this whole subject prior to our submission being made to the EC for consideration.  It is a matter of urgency now that we do have pretty quickly an indication as to what the position is with regard to our proposals and to know where we stand with regard to these new areas.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Abolition of Death Penalty) Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The first section of the Bill: &ldquo;No person shall suffer death for any offence&rdquo;, is the crux of the matter.  In other words, the death penalty should be finally and totally abolished from the Statute Book.  The death penalty was abolished, as some Members will know, in 1964 for all but a very few specified offences.  In 1981 this very Bill was introduced in this House by the Coalition Government of the time.  It was introduced by the Minister for Justice at that time, Deputy Mitchell.  What happened was that this Bill was passed by this House by a substantial majority, by 35 votes to 18.  Before the Bill could get to the Dáil the Government of the day fell and so it could not be passed through both Houses.  Surprisingly, this Bill was not revived by this Government when it came into power in late 1982 nor, surprisingly, is it part of the programme for Government, but I suspect that that is due to <Col N="278" /> omission rather than conviction.  Nevertheless, as far as I remember, it is a part of Labour Party policy and the Labour Party are, of course, a constituent element of this Government.  In 1981 Deputy Mitchell, the Minister for Justice at the time, described this Bill as an essential measure of law reform.  He also said, and I quote: &ldquo;Abolition of the death penalty was right in principle&rdquo;.  I see no reason why the Government should have changed their point of view in that time.</P>
      <P>During the debate on that Bill the Fianna Fáil Party opposed it unanimously, as they have a habit of doing.  They opposed it on various grounds, but the principal one appeared to be what they called the extraordinary circumstances of the time, which were, presumably, the activities of subversive organisations in this country.  That situation remains and it is likely to remain and there is no foreseeable end to that despite the best efforts of the Government.</P>
      <P>The situation is neither better nor worse at the moment.  I do not want to anticipate what the Government's attitude will be to this Bill, their own Bill, but I hope they will welcome it; I hope the Government will not come down with the line that &ldquo;of course we are in agreement in principle with the Bill but just at this moment it does not seem to us to be a particularly good idea&rdquo;, because that is a cop-out.  That will be the case if they do not want to take a stand on it for every hour of every day from now until eternity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is not about a matter of time; it is about a matter of principle and it is about the death penalty.  I hope we do not have from the Government or, specifically, from the Fine Gael element, a holding operation that really their heart is in the right place but they do not want to see this go through just at this moment. What I would appeal for, and what would be the most acceptable solution to this problem, is for all the parties to allow a free vote.  There is no great tradition on the part of the Opposition, particularly at the moment, to allow free votes on matters of public interest or controversy, nor have they had a particularly long tradition of allowing people to take the road <Col N="279" /> of their conscience.  But I suggest that on a Bill of this sort, there is no room for party political conflict; there is no room for the Whip to be used as it was used last time.  It should be non-contentious in party political terms.</P>
    <P>I introduced this Bill because, like so many other people, I believe that in principle and in practice judicial killing on all occasions is wrong.  I see no reason why the State should have the power to execute a man; it is the ultimate form of execution.  The State is condemning someone to a fate of execution because the person has in these specific cases murdered. That is not only degrading; it is hypocritical.  I also find the on-going death cell culture particularly ghoulish and horrifying.  The whole aura of execution culture is a very good and effective way of selling newspapers.  There is continuously and there has been speculation every time a garda has been murdered about whether the sentence will be commuted or not.  We may say that we knew all along it was going to be commuted and execution was not on the cards.  The newspapers have a field day.  In Britain, about a year and a half ago during the death penalty debate the newspapers had a field day with descriptions of the death cells, what people ate for their last meal and so on, all treated in a morbid way.  I would like to see that sort of culture and that sort of mood abolished forever.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons, often the principal reason &mdash; although those in favour of the death penalty are inevitably confused about the reasons for their positive approval of the death penalty &mdash; has always been that it is a deterrent.  There is a strange contradiction in their argument here.  I cannot see how the death penalty acts as a deterrent.  I cannot see how you can justify keeping it on the Statute Book when it has not been used for 30 years. Does anybody who goes out to kill somebody else really believe that they are themselves going to be hanged for it? Because the death penalty has not been used for 30 years it is in some way redundant. It is not, presumably in the eyes of the potential murderer, a real threat. <Col N="280" /> Yet, in the debate in this House three years ago it was maintained that it was a significant deterrent and should be kept on the Statute Book to deter people from killing gardaí, prison officers and other people in the category of section 3 of this Bill.  That does not hold water &mdash; unless the death penalty had been used.  It has not been used.  There is no evidence at all for the deterrent argument which is inconclusive.  There is no evidence that the pattern of crime will change as a result of this.  Expert criminologists will always tell you that it has been a principle of criminal activity down the centuries that detection is a far more effective way of deterring than the severity of the penalty. In the Middle Ages when people were executed for stealing such things as apples, the greatest number of petty crimes such as picking pockets were committed during public executions.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments for not bringing forward this Bill at present has been that all death sentences are still mandatory and have been commuted.  That is tantamount to saying &ldquo;Ah, well, it is a bad law maybe but it does not matter because it is never enforced.&rdquo;  That is absolutely true.  This remains on the Statute Book but if it is a bad law it should be taken off the Statute Book.  Those who want to keep it on the Statute Book must be consistent and say that it will or it might be used. They have to be honest about it.  You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot have it on the Statute Book and say we will keep it there but we will not use it. That shows contempt for the law and a total disregard for the statutes of this country.  There are circumstances in which the death penalty might be used, and that is why I think it is extremely important that it should be removed.</P>
    <P>There is a very disturbing trend in America in certain states towards using the death penalty again.  There is a most unpleasant repetition of these very public executions which are going on and which appeal to the basest instincts of human beings.  They do that.  That trend has not, thankfully, yet spread through Europe. But if we have the death penalty on our books, if we have the possibility of the <Col N="281" /> use of the death penalty, I can see a very realistic scenario when a killing of the most unpleasant and vicious nature occurs public opinion will demand &mdash; public opinion frequently demands &mdash; the death penalty.  I am not at all sure that public opinion is behind me in this. Where public opinion demands the death penalty for someone who has committed a most dreadful crime then I can see a situation whereby a weak Government may decide that the death penalty is on the Statute Book and that therefore it will be used.  They see no reason in that situation why they should not yield to pressure from significant pressure groups.</P>
    <P>It does not matter which way public opinion stands on this issue at present. Indeed, in Britain they have continuously kept capital punishment out while the opinion polls have continuously said that the majority are in favour of it.  We are not here to yield to every opinion poll. We are here to lead public opinion on this sort of matter and on occasions to defy it.  This is an occasion where I believe public opinion should be led and defied if necessary.  It seems that if public opinion demands the death penalty in certain circumstances it will be merely a cry for revenge from public opinion which a Government could yield to.  All we would be doing is perpetuating a violent society. All we would be doing would be increasing the violence which we are ourselves condemning.  We would be murdering the murderers, so to speak, and become murderers ourselves.</P>
    <P>The European trend and the European pressure is very much in line with what I am saying.  I think it is only in Turkey in Europe and in no EC country that the death penalty is retained.  The UN also has made several recommendations urging the countries of the world to reduce the number of offences for which the death penalty is used.  As a Christian, democratic, civilised country we have no right to be out of line with our European counterparts on this.  I would like to know why we are.</P>
    <P>One of the most obvious reasons why those who advocate the retention of the <Col N="282" /> death penalty do so is because of the problem which we have with terrorists and illegal organisations, both in the North of Ireland and very much in the Republic of Ireland.  The issue of terrorism is not relevant to the principle of the Bill.  In Britain in the recent debate they tried to isolate terrorism as a reason, as an exception and as the only circumstances in which the death penalty should be used.  It would be utterly wrong for any Government of this country to execute terrorists for any offence, however heinous. I believe this not just as a matter of principle which I do sincerely accept but also as a matter of practice, because all we would be doing if we executed terrorists for crimes which have been committed against the security forces &mdash; and these are the crimes on the whole to which this Bill refers&mdash;would be to make martyrs of evil men.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the effect of hanging, with all the build-up there is to it, would be to create an aura and a mystique around the people who have done wicked things.  The sight of IRA coffins in this country would become a recruiting agent for the IRA.  We have enough martyrs.  We do not want any more martyrs.  These people should be put away but they should not be executed. There is very little doubt that there is a certain type of subversive, and a certain type of person who wants martyrdom, who will go out and commit a dreadful murder or other crime in order to be executed.  There is a certain type of psychological misfit who is seeking that sort of notoriety.  If we execute such people we will be playing straight into their hands.  That is what is on the Statute Book at the moment and that is what this Bill is intended to prevent.</P>
    <P>This Bill includes &mdash; it would be more appropriate to talk about it on Committee Stage &mdash; what is known as the 40-year rule which is a minimum sentence for the crimes specified in section 3 of 40 years imprisonment.  This was part of the original Bill and it is a part of the Bill which I do not like because I do not like mandatory sentences.  I do not believe in mandatory sentences; I believe that every <Col N="283" /> crime has a specific and a different motive and deserves different, specific treatment. The 40-year rule was put in the original Bill because there is a very powerful lobby which includes the gardaí and the prison officers who for very understandable reasons wish the death penalty to be retained.  The reasons are simple in that they believe &mdash; I think wrongly &mdash; that it gives them some form of protection.  The 40-year rule was introduced as a balance to reassure these people that anyone committing such a crime would go to jail for what was virtually the rest of their lives.  I do not believe in mandatory sentences and if the Second Stage of this Bill is passed, as I hope it will, I will be with my colleagues putting down an amendment to remove that clause.</P>
    <P>The most important reason for abolishing the death penalty is the possibility of a mistake.  There have been several documented cases of mistakes, of people being hanged in error.  Hanging is a fairly final solution: it is also one which cannot be remedied.  There have been attempts to give posthumous pardons in Britain for people who have been hanged wrongly. That is as important a reason for taking it off the Staute Book as any other, because nothing justifies in any way the taking of an innocent human life.  To keep this on the Statute Book will give us the power to do this, and if we exercise it in time we will make a mistake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we are discussing this matter at this time.  It is appropriate that the Oireachtas should discuss the question of capital punishment and its abolition.  The present time is an appropriate time to discuss it.  I do not accept the motives as to why the matter is being raised at this time and I do not laud the apparent lack of ingenuity on the part of the proposers of this measure in putting forward a measure which is identical to a measure which was brought before this House by a Fine Gael-led Government in October of 1981.  Senator Ross is following the parliamentary tactic adopted by him here a little over a year ago when <Col N="284" /> he put down an amendment introduced by this Government in relation to another measure in another place and defeated there.  I suggest his reason for raising the matter at this time is not sincerity, that he is motivated by sensationalism and by reasons which do not necessarily relate to the principle behind this measure.  This Government indicated some months ago that they would be outlining shortly their programme for legislation for the forthcoming Dáil and Seanad session.  At that time, in the latter weeks of 1984, I did not hear any mention of an anxiety to see that this matter should be included in the legislative programme for this session. As a supporter of this Government, and as somebody who will support the Government on their legislative programme, I can understand why at this time the parliamentary session should not be burdened with something outside that programme, bearing in mind the fact that parliamentary time is limited.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it quite clear that the Fine Gael Party in principle favours the abolition of the death penalty.  Prior to the 1981 general election in the programme for Government 1981-86 published at that time, at page 37 under the heading &ldquo;Justice&rdquo;, we stated and I quote from paragraph 6 of that page:</P>
      <P>Legislation will be introduced to abolish capital punishment and substitute long term mandatory prison sentences.</P>
      <P>Following that commitment, given by us prior to the 1981 general election, we speedily introduced legislation to deal with this matter.  That legislation was introduced in this House on 15 October 1981 by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Jim Mitchell.  That legislation was the Criminal Justice Bill, 1981 which fell with the dissolution of the Dáil in the early weeks of 1982.  What the then Minister said speaking on Second Stage in this House reflects the view of this party still.  I quote from volume 96, column 218 of the Official Report of 15 October 1981:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes to abolish the <Col N="285" /> death penalty and to substitute imprisonment for life.  It also provides that a minimum period of imprisonment must be served for treason and certain murders.</P>
    <P>In column 219 the Minister continued:</P>
    <P>For my part &mdash; and I believe I speak for the great majority of people &mdash; I am completely opposed to the taking of life, whether by the State or by anyone else, and I believe that the time has now come for this country to finish the job that was begun in 1964 and to remove completely from the Statute Book the right of the State to inflict death on any person for whatever reason in the future.</P>
    <P>I believe deeply in the sacredness of human life.  The right to life is precedent to all other rights, for when a person's life is ended all other rights of that person are of no further consequence. Moreover, at a time when so many human lives are being taken on this island to the near universal abhorrence of the population, it is timely that the State should give clear expression to that abhorrence by the symbolic act of repudiating its own right to deliberately take life in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>That view expressed at that time reflects the view of this party at this time.  It is no harm to reflect on and recall the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1964 because that is the Act which still retains capital punishment on our Statute Book for certain purposes.  Those purposes are, the crimes of treason or the committing of certain murders, the murder of members of the Garda Síochána or prison officers or murder of diplomats and for certain other offences against military law.  It was the view of the Oireachtas in 1964 that capital punishment in respect of these crimes would have a deterrent effect.  The view was also expressed at that time that as our Garda were an unarmed force they needed this protection.  That view is held by many people today.</P>
    <P>Society has developed considerably in the past 20 years, and the way people <Col N="286" /> think has developed considerably.  The attitude of people to this question has changed considerably.  At present two arguments are frequently propounded. On the one hand we have the person who will say that the protection of the State is of the utmost importance and that the officers of the State, the Garda Síochána, the prison officers and, indeed, people holding elected office although they are not currently covered by statute, and anybody representing the State in any matter of this nature, should receive the utmost protection and that the utmost sanction of the law should be available against anybody who commits the crime of murder against somebody under these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago reading Brian Faulkner's biography &mdash; in fact, I got it from the Library today &mdash; because he had an interesting comment on this.  He held office in another part of this island as Home Affairs Minister.  I quote from page 25 of Brian Faulkner's <i>Memoirs of a Statesman.</i>  He refers to discussions he had with the British Home Secretary who had a similar responsibility in Britain to consider whether the death penalty should be applied or whether the matter was appropriate for the royal prerogative. Brian Faulkner said:</P>
    <P>I adopted a similar approach on the four occasions when this problem faced me.  Two were reprieved and two were not.  They were the four most difficult decisions I have ever taken, but I am convinced they were right.  They helped me to learn the importance in public life of never going back on what one has done.  I have never believed that society should abandon the use of the ultimate sanction, capital punishment, when the safety of its citizens is at stake.</P>
    <P>That reflects one side of the coin.  It reflects the view of those who will say that the ultimate sanction should be available under particular circumstances such as those envisaged in the Act of 1964.</P>
    <P>Most people give expression at times to that point of view when some heinous <Col N="287" /> crime is committed in our society which affects members of the Garda or which affects a prison officer.  We say instantly for a moment that the people involved in such a crime should suffer the ultimate penalty.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the point of view expressed by some that there are certain circumstances where the State may take human life, circumstances related to the State's protection.  I now want to come to the other point of view which, in essence, is <Col N="288" /> the view expressed by the former Minister for Justice in this House in 1981 when he referred to the sacredness of human life. That point of view reflects the acceptance that society cannot ever evaluate the individualism of any person, and society cannot make any decisions which will ultimately adjudicate on the motive of any person in doing a particular thing or in committing a particular act and that the one sanction which society should not adopt is the death penalty for some of the reasons outlined by Senator Ross but for other reasons also.  The view is that, whereas society should take a sanction, it should not be the death penalty but some other sanction such as the 40 year minimum sentence envisaged in the 1981 Act and referred to again today by Senator Ross.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier how one's point of view on this matter can change.  The best way I can indicate how one's point of view can change is by quoting from a book written by Lord Denning, former Master of the Rolls in Britain, called <i>The Family Story.</i>  My quotation is from pages 164 and 165.  This quotation also reflects my own view, which is a changing view because this is a difficult subject upon which to be definite.  Lord Denning says under the heading &ldquo;Is capital punishment right or wrong?&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>I suppose that I am one of the few judges left now who have passed sentence of death.  I have on many occasions, using the formula: &lsquo;You shall be hanged by the neck until you are dead; and may the Lord have mercy on your soul.&rsquo;  The Chaplain says, &lsquo;Amen.&rsquo;  It is never done now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is capital punishment right or wrong?  In giving evidence before the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment I was in favour of it &mdash; for murder most foul.  That was many years ago now.  Some years afterwards I changed my mind.  It is not a legal question.  It is a question of policy.  It is an ethical question.  Is it right that we, as a society, should do a thing &mdash; hang a man &mdash; which none of us individually would be prepared to do, or even to witness?  On such grounds I changed <Col N="289" /> my mind.  Parliament was right to abolish capital punishment.  It was right to abolish flogging.  Those days are past.</P>
    <P>Those views expressed by one of the most eminent judicial personages of the common law world are views which I share and in great measure reflect my attitude on this matter.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by reiterating that the attitude of this party is that the death penalty should be abolished in principle. The fact that this party might not favour this Bill at this time &mdash; a Bill identical in terms to the Bill we introduced three years ago &mdash; does not reflect any change on the part of this party.  It simply reflects the fact that this party were elected with the Labour Party in November 1982 to govern.  In governing it is our job to introduce legislation in various areas.  We have indicated recently what our programme of legislation is for this Dáil session.  That programme of legislation is not going to be interfered with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House discussed this question twice before, in 1964 and again in 1981.  I made it clear on both those occasions that I was in favour of the abolition of capital punishment.  In what I said on those occasions and in what I propose to say today my views are consistent.  I am certainly in favour of the abolition of capital punishment.  I said then that I was in favour of it for crimes which could be described as domestic crimes, the ordinary crimes that take place in a country, that is not in any unusual circumstances, any unusual political circumstances or unusual military circumstances.  Even for such a crime as ordinary murder &mdash; if one can describe murder as ordinary &mdash; I would not favour capital punishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is whether we are in what can be regarded as normal circumstances at present.  Virtually nobody is against capital punishment in time of war.  Every country in the world in such circumstances accepts capital punishment without question, except pacifists who do not agree with the taking of life in any circumstances.  I am not a pacifist.  I believe that people are entitled to defend <Col N="290" /> themselves and their families.  I believe we are entitled to defend our country and, in certain circumstances, the killing of somebody can be justified.  Because there are extreme circumstances, and because life is in danger, and the whole life of the country is in danger, one cannot persist in the normal view that capital punishment should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>What we have to consider at present is whether in this country at the moment we have what could be regarded as normal conditions, whether we are a country with normal political conditions, or whether we are in fact more akin to a country which is at war.  We are all aware of the very very serious position in the North of Ireland.  We are aware of the widespread violence there.  We are aware that life is being taken for political motives by various paramilitaries very regularly.</P>
    <P>Much of this violence has spread down here.  There have been casualties in the Garda and in the Defence Forces.  It can be argued that at present this country is in a state of almost being at war, very near to a state of war.  The position could deteriorate and reach a stage which could be described as a state of war.  In these circumstances there would be no question that capital punishment would be tolerated, much as people disliked it.  It would be tolerated and, in these circumstances, this is an inappropriate time to bring in a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross mentioned that the trend in most countries in the world at present is away from capital punishment.  The proviso is always made in these countries that any moves that have been away from capital punishment do not include a situation of war time conditions and, to that extent, we could say that we would be quite happy to go along with the international trend if we had the same conditions that exist in the countries to which he refers.</P>
    <P>In 1964 we agreed to certain exceptions from the abolition of capital punishment, in relation to reason, to the murder of gardaí, prison officers, certain offences against the State, and the killing of a head of a foreign state or of a diplomat.  These <Col N="291" /> exceptions were regarded as very unusual and very unlikely.  Can it be said in support of this Bill that the danger has passed and that the kind of situations that were reserved have been shown not to have taken place and not likely to take place? In fact, the opposite is true.  Since that time several gardaí have been murdered. A diplomat in this country has been assassinated. There have been serious prison disturbances, although no fatalities actually. Abroad, several heads of State were assassinated.  The arguments for retaining the exceptions as set out in the 1964 Act have been strengthened rather than weakened and, if anything, that Act has been seen to be a reasonable one in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of all the arguments that have been mentioned in previous debates and in the speeches here today against capital punishment and I agree with most of them.  I do not support the concept of an eye for an eye.  I do not accept the concept that, because murder is a serious, abhorrent crime, the way the State should retaliate is by committing a statutory murder.  I am conscious of the finality of capital punishment, that it cannot be reversed and that many innocent people have been executed.  I am conscious of the fact that it is an extremely inhumane operation, something that degrades all those who have to implement it.  All of these are coercive arguments.  All of them would in normal circumstances make an overwhelming case for the abolition of capital punishment. Certainly when one considers them, it makes it very difficult to oppose this Bill.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believe that this is a highly inappropriate time to introduce this Bill. Senator Ross says we should not adopt that line, that we should not adopt the line that this is not the right time, that this merely means we will always be saying the right time has not come.  That is not a valid argument.  I have set out the circumstances in which it would be the right time, when we did not have a situation in this country bordering on a state of war.  When that has gone, then it will <Col N="292" /> be the appropriate time.  I hope this House will be able to support a Bill of this kind in the not too distant future.  I hope I will be here to support it but, on this side of the House, we are unable to support this Bill at present.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill which Senator Ross is sponsoring.  I was interested in the speeches made by Senator Ryan and Senator Durcan.  They have both shown how hard it is to be definite with regard to the measures to be taken in the case of capital crime and also our attitudes to capital punishment.  We heard Senator Ryan pointing out that he supported the abolition of capital punishment in the past and why he felt it was important that it should at least be retained on the Statue Book at present.</P>
      <P>Although I take a contrary view, I respect the integrity of his position on this and I can understand the reasons he has outlined for his position.  Nevertheless I was more than convinced by the argument put forward by Senator Durcan in relation to the need to look at it, and re-look at it, and to contemplate the possibility of a change in attitude in a very difficult area where it is difficult to be definite.  I come from a part of this island, as Senators well know, where there has been a considerable number of murders and assassinations.  Three people in my own home were assassinated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prisoners held for long periods in Northern prisons have found that time has affected their attitudes and has brought about a feeling or a desire to repent, shall we say, what was done, to go out into society with a new motivation and try to redress some of the misery they wrought <Col N="293" /> by their assassinations.  I am thinking in particular of a young loyalist prisoner who has admitted in correspondence that he is in there for murder.  I am also thinking of a young republican.  Great work has been done in recent times by prison chaplains who deal with men who in the solitariness of prison have had to confront themselves.  As their act rises in their consciousness eventually to haunt them as they are no longer able to maintain the justification they had when they performed the original killing they are seeking some way out.  Through the chaplains, the priests and the parsons who have a deep, deep and sensitive undertaking of what has taken place, these people have had a change of heart and a renewal in their spirit which makes them genuinely repentant and gives them the potential to emerge back into society again as useful citizens.</P>
    <P>I know that that is not the position of all people who commit murder.  Should we not address ourselves more to the psychological and redemptive aspects of the rehabilitation process of those who, for one reason or another, either political or criminal, have committed murder?  I think in particular tonight of Mrs. Cobb who lost her husband and who wrote to the assassin of her husband offering her forgiveness.  That is a very hard thing for people to understand who have not suffered in a similar fashion.  Nevertheless it does allow us to hope.  It also allows us to bring into the debate the concept of mercy, of forgiveness, of an understanding that it is possible for people to repent and, if and when they are liberated from imprisonment, to hand back to society something which it lost as a result of their actions.</P>
    <P>We must now consider those actions. Let us look at the social side first.  Increasingly in Ireland young people who have gone through the whole process of education find themselves cornered particularly in our larger towns and cities.  They are cornered without power to participate in society.  They are cornered without employment and without an opportunity to do creative work.  In short they see the development of space technology and an <Col N="294" /> opening up of the heavens while, at the same time, where they live they feel the social space squeezing in all round them and they lash out to deal with this frustration gap between the expectation which has been kindled by the new technology, and particularly by the media, and the reality of living in their own communities. They try to crash through this frustration barrier.  Twice in the course of this year, when this frustration led to these youngsters trying to crash through the barriers, they were shot dead.</P>
    <P>It seems likely that murder and associated crimes will be on the increase rather than on the decrease.  Will they be adequately dealt with through the threat of death rather than addressing ourselves to those things which are involved in promoting the hope and prospect of life? Civilisation in my book is the affirmation of life from the very moment it starts until death, even though we live in the knowledge that life as we know it comes to an end some day.  The question I would ask both of the State and of the individual involved in the mutilation or murder of others, or in the capital punishment of others, is when we violate the integrity of another human being, even when we have the sanction of the law behind us, and we are legitimised in our action by the State, do we not also diminish ourselves in the act or in our association with the act?</P>
    <P>If we take it at individual level, it is inevitable that because we have a shared humanity an act of violation results in feelings of guilt which many of us can suppress by many devices, not the least of which is that we are doing it on behalf of the State in which we live, in the uniform of the State which we serve, or because the forces to which we are opposed are anti-social, anti-national, and so on.  We cling to any falsification of the other man's humanity that we can justify any act of violence towards him.  Now granted that legitimacy is important, at a time like this in a country riven by dissension both national and social, but that legitimacy begs certain other questions as to what it is based on and to what extent all the citizens have reasonable <Col N="295" /> access to the opportunity which exists within the State which seeks legitimacy for acts involved in the keeping of law and order.</P>
    <P>We must then ask ourselves how do we deal with any guilt once it arises in our consciousness and we are no longer able to suppress it.  This certainly applies to the man in prison, but equally it arises in a collective sense in a nation or society which seeks a solution to the problem of violence, particularly violence ending in the killing of members of that society.</P>
    <P>If we could be certain that capital punishment would be a sufficient deterrent to killing and murder then the retention of capital punishment would seem to me to have some justification.  I do not think that people can argue that the retention of capital punishment has produced the effect desired.</P>
    <P>Let us now make a distinction between murder and killing.  Senator Ryan said that it was right that one would, in a final analysis, defend oneself at one's front door.  Certainly there are few of us who would not take that point of view.  One has to make the distinction between defending oneself with a view to a defence of life in the home and undertaking a deliberate premeditated act to ensure that the attacker is killed in the process of one's defence.  It makes all the difference in the world in my opinion in dealing with an attacker and, if necessary, wounding him in order to defend life in one's own home or community and making a determined effort to ensure that there is absolutely no possible way in which the attack can be continued by ending the life of the attacker.  As somebody has said already, it is a very final act.  It is difficult, as I have already mentioned, to redeem such finality, certainly adequately, in this life although I believe it is possible.</P>
    <P>I would ask Senators to consider also the point that Senator Ross made about the need to incarcerate anyone for 40 years &mdash; the mandatory sentence. Anyone who has read about the imprisonment of Rudolph Hess in Spandau Prison must surely be appalled that <Col N="296" /> in spite of the heinous crimes to which he gave his name that 40 years on an old man is still isolated, almost in solitary confinement, for crimes against humanity. Have we not got enough humanity to recognise that there comes a time when enough is enough and the man should be set free?  If anyone feels, as I do, that Hess should have been set free, I believe it would be inconsistent to say that we can support the death penalty.</P>
    <P>The perspective of treason, one of the items mentioned in the Bill, changes as time moves on.  What was treasonable in the Ireland of the 1912-22 period would certainly not be treasonable today, and for very good reason.  What is treasonable in concept in Northern Ireland at this moment I hope will not be treasonable in years to come.  It comes back to Senator Durcan's point that it is difficult.  I accept that to be definite.  We may be dealing with changing perceptions of changing times.  Nevertheless, it is very important that we do not react to the increasing violence by which we are surrounded by retaining this force which the State in the past has deemed necessary because I believe it is inevitable in the changed social climate of today that execution is bound to lead to reaction.  We are going through a period of fundamental change. We are entering a new era.  People are no longer prepared to do as they are bid, so to speak.  There are new social groupings.  There is a demand for a new social community politic.  We must look at the problem carefully and be certain, if we are going to retain this Act, that we are not retaining an Act which will alienate further many sections of the deprived, underprivileged, frustrated people who now live with so much dissatisfaction and confusion in our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I wish to raise.  In a country without a death penalty the onus is on the State to promote life and prevent death.  Let us be clear that once this death penalty goes it has a significant impact on the effect of hunger strike.  I mention that so that we do not overlook it.  I mention it particularly <Col N="297" /> because of the very painful process of rethinking that I had to do at the time of the Republican hunger strike in the North.  At that time I held that while there could be no more justification for hunger strike to the death there were nevertheless political, psychological and social reasons for it, that no democratically elected Government should cave into the threat of blackmail by the threat of death.  The dilemma was that we did not know until it was too late whether we were dealing with death or not.</P>
    <P>Once it becomes clear that one is dealing with death then in a country without a death penalty the onus is clearly on the Government and on the Establishment to promote life and prevent death.  Just as I understand my obligation as a doctor in a casualty department when confronted by a person who has affirmed that he wants to leave this earth through suicide I would have the option to decide whether to save a life or let that person have his choice.  It has that aspect which we need to think about, particularly in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have heard the history from Senator Ross of the gradual dilution of the death penalty in Ireland in the 1964 debate, the 1981 debate and how the 1981 debate failed to come to fruition.  When we look to the future, if we have the death penalty it will rarely be carried out. If we do not have a death penalty and murder occurs &mdash; remember murder is the premeditated, unlawful killing of one human being by another &mdash; we will be forced to address ourselves, perhaps more imaginatively than we have in the past, to the restructuring of Irish society, so that a pro-life philosophy, a pro-life experience is something that can be shared by all.  We will be looking much more acutely, particularly as a result of the Northern experience and as a result of the experience of the chaplains in the prisons, to how we can help people who have committed the most heinous crimes to live with themselves as best they can and to come out with a message to the rest of us about what it is necessary to do and why they were placed or allowed themselves to be placed in the position <Col N="298" /> that they committed the crime which they will carry as their own sentence to their graves.  I have no hesitation in supporting this Bill.  I trust that the remarks which have been made about the untimeliness of it will be put in some perspective. Some of us, perhaps, do not have enough time to look at our timing and when we get an opportunity and are asked if we wish to support something which seems to be right we take it on the spur of the moment.  Perhaps that sounds naive but nevertheless it is a fact of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabh mo leith scéal.  Is beag nár theip orm bheith i láthair.  I will not launch into a long, emotional and detailed description of what happens when capital punishment is actually carried out.  In some ways some of the arguments in favour of the retention of capital punishment are a little like the arguments used in favour of nuclear deterrents.  It is useful, we are told, but we will never use it, but there is an apparent need to preserve the ultimate deterrent in case we might need to use it at some unforeseen circumstance in the future.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion on which capital punishment was debated in this House Senator Magner had in his possession very gruesome and gory accounts of the actual execution of a number of persons. They were Home Office descriptions and they were quite gruesome, gory and unpleasant, but they adequately described and necessarily so, what is done to people when we choose to terminate their lives as a form of punishment.  We choose to terminate their lives.  It is funny the way we develop a separate vocabulary. We do not say that we kill people.  We say that we execute them.  Various paramilitary and terrorist organisations prefer to use the word execute rather than the word kill because, apparently, they believe it conveys a certain legitimacy or an appearance of legitimacy on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm to talk about and think about the whole concept of capital punishment, because capital punishment and the movement to abolish it has been one of the great marks of civilisation.  It is not <Col N="299" /> a long time in human history since a huge range of crimes carried capital punishment. There is a story in my family about an ancestor of mine whom, when we are disposed to be benevolently disposed, is alleged to have been executed for his faith, but in less benevolent moments, on less benevolent interpretations, it is alleged the same individual was executed for stealing a sheep.  We prefer to accept the former, but the latter clearly underlines the extent to which capital punishment was used in a most barbarous way in previous centuries.  One of the horrifying examples of human history is the ingenuity that mankind has actually used to develop methods of killing people as a form of punishment, the long list from beheading people, to garroting people, to hanging people, to shooting people, to, at one glorious stage, 2,000 years ago, feeding them to the lions, to the more recent high technology uses of various lethal gasses of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>There is something inherently repulsive about some things that seem to be associated with capital punishment.  One is the whole religious ritual that is associated with execution, a religious ritual which is visible to us since the United States in their lack of wisdom have chosen to reintroduce capital punishment as part of their penal code.  Repulsive.  I would not deprive somebody of a religious presence but there is a certain appearance of complicity in the presence of a strong religious element.  Even more difficult to accept is the medical ritual that is associated with capital punishment, the fact that members of the medical profession apparently participate to the extent of being available to confirm that a person is dead.</P>
    <P>The role of medicine and of the medical profession is one of saving life.  I am not casting aspersions on individuals in this, but there is a question about the whole idea of having members of the medical profession available to preside over the ritual killing of a member of the human race.  There is a certain element of the ritual killing involved in capital punishment, <Col N="300" /> of the expiation of sin through the punishment of a sinner.</P>
    <P>There is another element that has surfaced again in the United States, the ghouls and the nasties who turn up in great numbers enthused at the idea of witnessing an execution.  I do not know how one can argue that something which assembles large numbers of the most wounded and sick in a society to see what is happening in some way benefits or helps the society.</P>
    <P>Capital punishment is gruesome, it is vulgar and it is a most reprehensible crime against humanity.  It would be simple to dismiss it in those sort of terms, but rational, concerned humane people sometimes argue in favour of capital punishment. It is a fact that probably in every country in western Europe and in North America public opinion is very strongly in favour of capital punishment.  I suspect the only coherent homogeneous cultural groups in the whole of western Europe who may be opposed to capital punishment are the Catholic population of Northern Ireland and the Basque population of Spain.  I suspect every other group would probably indicate a majority in favour of capital punishment. I know it is true in this country, I know it is true in Britain, I gather it is true in France, I know it is true overwhelmingly and tragically in the United States.</P>
    <P>It is a bit pretentious very often to describe ourselves as legislators, because whatever else I have done in this House I have done very little legislating, but we call ourselves legislators so we will use the term for the moment anyway.  Those of us who claim to be legislators have got to face up to that particularly disturbing fact that any movement to abolish capital punishment will be singularly unpopular.</P>
    <P>One could speculate fruitfully on the extraordinary anomaly of a country which worked itself up into a frenzy of pro-life enthusiasm being at the same time in favour of capital punishment.  I am not so foolish or sufficiently dishonest as to pretend that the two positions are absolutely mutually exclusive, but it is <Col N="301" /> interesting that we can have people in a frenzy in defence of human life and at the same time often in an equal frenzy in favour of disposing of people whom they regard as no longer being worthy of human life.</P>
    <P>The more rational arguments and the most widely used are the ones of deterrence. I do not believe any two people who disagree on the question of deterrence could not satisfy each other whether they were right or wrong.  There is so much evidence, most of which is based to some extent, greater or lesser, on supposition, on assumed connections between facts, that nobody would be convinced by it.  This attempt to argue great principles from sociological conclusions is very much in evidence in Ireland today on another issue which faces the country. The attempt to draw one conclusion from the fact that certain things happen together is sociologically very suspect, and even if it is given the <i>imprimatur</i> of the entirety of the Roman Catholic hierarchy drawing a sociological conclusion is a difficult thing to do, and it cannot be proven either on the question of deterrence or on the question of certain other matters that are shortly to come before the other House.</P>
    <P>It is true that I can say from my experience that I do not believe in general that deterrence really works.  I can say from my experience of dealing with people who come into contact with the law that they do not have the remotest idea of what the penalty is.  The children who steal cars are not aware that the penalty for stealing a car is five years in jail whereas it was five months one year ago. I do not believe that the people who rob banks know that the penalties for firearms offences have been doubled in the last ten years.  For all I know a considerable number of the people who are involved in murder do not know that capital punishment does or does not exist on two sides of the Border.  It is an interesting anomaly that those of us who, very often in self-righteous terms, denounce the administration of justice north of the Border singularly omit to advert to the fact that north of the Border they do not <Col N="302" /> have capital punishment and south of the Border we retain it, usually to deal with the same people who are involved in similar crimes north of the Border.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that there is any convincing argument that any penalty is a deterrent.  If you can have an insight into the mind of somebody who commits the sort of serious offences that draw down capital punishment it would be difficult to determine whether 40 years or 30 years was a greater deterrent than execution. It is difficult to see into another person's soul.  Another issue which is very alive in our society now is the extent to which one can read into another person's mind and motives.  It is virtually impossible to be sure whether a mandatory sentence of 40 years or execution is more or less a deterrent.  I shall return to the mandatory sentences later.  It is true that the standard alternative to capital punishment is life imprisonment.  This can vary from country to country and from individual to individual, from society to society and from political environment to political environment.  In the case of Nelson Mandella, it appears to mean the rest of his life in prison.  In our society it means in more human terms somewhere between six and ten years.  This is a much more reasonable approach.</P>
    <P>I cannot find much in the argument for deterrence that would convince me.  It would be dishonest of me to say that if somebody could produce suddenly a mathematically inescapable conclusion which proves that capital punishment was a deterrent it would change my mind.  I will not be convinced if I do not think the deterrent value could in any way justify the fundamental immorality involved in the deliberate decision to take another person's life.  Another argument that is used and which needs to be taken quite seriously and approached conscientiously is that the presence on our Statute Book of the possibility of execution is a support for our security forces, that they feel the need for this support, that they feel that they will be more exposed without capital punishment.</P>
    <P>The then general secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and <Col N="303" /> Inspectors &mdash; he has since returned to police work &mdash; Derek Nally &mdash; was quoted on a number of occasions as saying that he was worried that if capital punishment was abolished there would be an inclination on the part of some members of the Garda to resort more to on-the-spot executions.  He said he felt that that was the experience of other countries.  This is a frightening reflection on the gardaí.  Mr. Nally felt that members of the security forces would in a very profound way feel more at risk, more vulnerable, more threatened and much more less supported by society, if capital punishment were to be abolished.  The circumstances in which members of the security forces are killed are such that it would be inhuman not to feel outrage, anger, and an enormous amount of sympathy for the victims and their families.</P>
    <P>Outrage and anger in particular, are not good bases for logical and rational decisions.  Outrage and anger are not good bases for determining whether a particular proposal is right or is wrong. Legislators have &mdash; again we have heard about this so often &mdash; to examine an issue and judge it on its merits in the light of their conclusions and assessments and, God forbid that I mention it too often, in the light of their own conscience and conclusions as to what is proper in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Therefore, whatever the sense of loyalty we have to the security forces, there are and there should be more fundamental questions that deserve to be approached.  A loyalty to any arm of the State should not allow us to be deterred from doing what we believe to be fundamentally right or fundamentally wrong, whether that loyalty be to the security forces or to a political party which people are affiliated to.</P>
    <P>On this issue of support for the security forces, one of the more extraordinary aspects of the current provision for legalised killing is that it includes the prison staff.  There was a scandalous murder of a prison officer last year.  It was wrong and <Col N="304" /> I hope the people who were responsible will be punished.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the period for reporting back of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown be extended to 21 March 1985.</P>
      <P>I make this request in the full knowledge of agreement reached between all the participating members of the committee that this date will be one that can be met. The committee ran into difficulties because of the inclement weather which prevented us from meeting on a number of occasions, and also we were unfortunate that Dáil business &mdash; the budget &mdash; clashed with meetings which we had arranged.  This threw our work somewhat out of the time schedule which we had set.  We have done an enormous amount of work, the main body of which has been concluded.  We are in the process of finalishing our second draft.  Also we have one chapter left to consider, that is the dissolution of marriage.  We have prepared working papers on which we intend to proceed, meeting for five hours at least next week.  We are very confident when we state that we merely wish to extend our date for reporting by a very small number of days.  We will report on 21 March.  I am asking that that be acceded to.</P>

      <P>First of all, I enormously resent the way this has been sprung on the House.  It is an extremely important matter and it is put before us at the very last minute, without notice.  It is not on the original Order Paper.  I had very little idea about it.  It has just been sprung on me.  It is a very, very important matter for the House and it has been brought in at 8 p.m.  I do not know at what stage the committee knew they were going to be looking for an extension.  I do not know if they knew this three weeks ago.  I certainly oppose, in principle and in fact, that this committee should be given one more hour to sit.  From memory, and because I had no time to prepare this matter, this is the third extension which this committee have looked for.</P>
      <P>I remember the Leader of this House, Senator Dooge, saying in July 1984, when the first extension was looked for, that he would oppose a second extension.  A second extension was granted by this House in December 1984 for three months with the assurances that they had had a lot of work to do but that they would report on 19 February.  The committee have the nerve to come back to us again to ask us for another extension.  We hear that there is one chapter still to write and that chapter is on divorce, on the dissolution of marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let there be no doubt in this House why this committee was set up.  This committee was set up specifically to deal with the dissolution of marriage.  All other matters could be dealt with by the Government and that is what the Government are for.  The committee come back to us at this time saying they have not even considered this matter properly.  They have the audacity to ask us for another three weeks.  No, Sir, I do not believe for a moment they should. Issues like this are for Government to consider.  I said, and I was the only person in this House who said it the day this <Col N="306" /> committee was set up, when every single member of the political parties were congratulating themselves on the setting up of this committee, that it was a bogus committee, that Members would not agree and that they would be looking for an extension.  I was assured nearly two years ago that this was not true.  Yet, they came back in June 1984, December 1984 and they come back to us in February 1985 and ask for another extension.  There is no point in going through this bogus procedure. I will be very interested to see what conclusions they come to on the vital issue of the dissolution of marriage, which they have not even considered at this stage, two years after the Government have taken power.  I shall oppose this and I shall be looking for a division on it.</P>

What is becoming obvious to me &mdash; and this is a good week in which to talk about it &mdash; is that we are not the masters of our own house in this Parliament, that there is a substantial number of people in this House who not only are prepared to accept but want guidance from 15 miles down the road as to how they should act on a number of issues and who are prepared to stand up and salute and say: &ldquo;Yes, sir&rdquo;, even if they must stand on their heads in the process.

The problem is whether other people to whom they give allegiance, politically as well as religiously, are in favour of the dissolution of marriage.  It seems to me that this committee will go on and on avoiding the issue until such time as they conclude that they cannot take a decision because their Lordships elsewhere have concluded that there is nothing to be done.

      <P>I would like to thank you for permitting the motion on the adjournment and I would like to thank the Minister for attending.  I had intended raising under Standing Orders the fact that one Member could call this House to a vote and thereby postpone this motion, but that is not what I intend to do.  I have in my hand the policy and planning for roads as published by the Department of the Environment for 1985 and I will quote from it in due course.</P>
      <P>My main reason for moving this is because of the dire condition of the roads in Donegal in general terms but more particularly as a result of the recent frost. It begs the question as to why the Donegal roads might be worse than they are in any other part of the country.  The fact is that they are worse and have been worse for some time.  The reason is that we in Donegal get prolonged frost.  This year we had a phenomenon known as frost heave.  Frost heave occurs when we have 20 or more successive days of sub-zero temperatures.  I have witnessed the publicity in the media in general and on television in particular when snow falls in Dublin.  When even one flake of snow falls on the mast in Donnybrook or when Wicklow is caught there is an outcry about the travelling conditions and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that, but look who does not.  We in Donegal suffer severe frost annually.  We had at least one month of it this year.  We had snow on Christmas Day and we had snow up to the last day of January.  Frost heave is a chemical reaction under the roads to a <Col N="310" /> depth of up to two feet.  This day week I brought a letter to Dublin from the county engineer in Donegal pointing out the damage that had been caused to the roads in Donegal as a result of frost heave.  I am glad that the motion I put down at that time was not taken and that it was accepted today.  I should like to quote from the amended report from the county engineer:</P>
      <P>Further to previous comments concerning frost damage to roads in County Donegal, while final figures for the damage have not been completed, it is already apparent that they will be in millions rather than hundreds of thousands.</P>
      <P>At present, restoration work is proceeding, in accordance with the following strategy:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  to cut out, replace with a suitable depth of suitable materials and provide a surface on the individual stretches badly affected.  (2) On completion of this work, further necessary works will be considered in the light of available finance.  This necessary work would be the overlaying so that an improvement will be carried out to the frost susceptibility of adjacent portions of the road and also that foundation failures, apart altogether from frost heave, will be rectified.</P>
      <P>It is very unlikely, of course, that we will get very far with Stage (2), but from the point of view of general economics, it would seem to me most desirable that when immediate damage due to frost heave has been corrected, other affected areas nearby should be rendered as immune as possible to frost heave in the future.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Dept. of the Environment will permit repair work to be charged to the appropriate Maintenance Grants and that they will review the position when repairs have been carried out.  However, this will be of no use to Country Roads as there are no Maintenance Grants from the Department funds for these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> This is a situation where Donegal, because of its geographical location has been hit by frost heave much more than any other County.  Most Counties have had none at all.  This has come on top of very heavy expenditure on snow and ice protective measures and it seems that the accumulative burden of both these is well outside the Council's financial capacity.</P>
    <P>The last sentence sums up my reason for putting down this motion.  On top of the very heavy expenditure on snow and ice protective measures Donegal County Council has incurred outlay of up to half a million pounds on protective measures this year.  I am advised that half of this money can be recouped from the Department in the following year.  It is only 50 per cent, and we have the ongoing burden of these protective measures.  You do not have them in many other counties in Ireland.  I can go on talking about frost heave all night but to little avail.  I would like to invite the Minister to do two things.  One is to visit Donegal.  While I know that there would be no great cost involved for himself, being a Minister, I am prepared to stand the cost of his trip to Donegal, to put him up in my own home or the best hotel in the county and we have many good ones.  I am prepared to wine him and dine him in the best restaurants in Donegal, if he stays more than one evening, provided he will travel along the roads which I have referred to. This invitation is standing and I would like the Minister to accept it.  Secondly, I would like the Minister to give serious consideration in view of the large numbers of unemployed in our country, to trying a pilot scheme in Donegal whereby his Department or some Department would make moneys available and that those on the live register would avail of an opportunity to take up employment in Donegal working on our roads.  I would ask if the Minister would reply directly to both these requests, and my invitation will stand.</P>
    <P>In the policy and planning framework for roads, under strategy, it mentions <Col N="312" /> assistance to local authorities by means of block grant for certain work on other roads.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to giving block grant assistance to Donegal County Council not just to repair the roads that have been damaged by frost.  Those roads must be taken out and totally replaced to standard under paragraph 34.  It says that the standards applied to improved roads will be the minimum necessary to provide sufficient capacity for congested traffic flows and to provide a satisfactory level of safety and comfort for road users.  I have not been comfortable on a road in Donegal for years.  If one uses a bus &mdash; it is seldom I do but now and again &mdash; when you leave the roads of Northern Ireland and cross Lifford Bridge, not when you are half a mile across but immediately, one notices a deterioration.  There is no comfort on our Donegal roads and certainly there is no safety on our Donegal roads.  I have seen potholes in which one could have a bath.  I am going to pass to the Minister, with the permission of the Acting Chairman, a photograph taken on the main road approaching Milford town in which I am seen standing in a pothole not because I am photogenic, and I am reasonably so, or not because I feel comfortable in waders, but to draw the attention of the public and now the Minister to the type of roads we have.  That is the main road leading into Milford town from Letterkenny.  That shows precisely what I am talking about.  Does the Acting Chairman wish to look at it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  It says the standard will be the minimum necessary to provide sufficient capacity and to provide a level of safety.  We do not have a level of safety.  If one does not know the road one does not know where to expect potholes.  There is a danger.  I have seen potholes so big that trucks had to swerve to avoid them and the swerving can cause serious accidents.  I am not sure that we have had any serious accidents as a result of swerving to avoid these potholes, but <Col N="313" /> if we have not had it is by the grace of God and the good driving that is being done.  I will cut my contribution short. The county engineer has spelt out our case more clearly today than he did this day week and more clearly than I could. The damage done by the frost heave is apparent.  It will be estimated in millions rather than hundreds of thousands.  I have issued an invitation to the Minister to come to Donegal to deal with the damage that was done.  I thank you, a Chathaoirleach, for giving me this time and I thank the House also.  I thank the Minister for attending.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I have to vote in the Dáil at 8.30 p.m.  I would just like to say as briefly as I can that I am satisfied Donegal County Council have received a reasonable proportion of finance for road grants over the years.  I can assure the Senator that they will continue to receive their fair share of the substantial funds which will now be provided for roadworks over the next three years under the terms of our national plan.  In recent years, the council have undertaken a number of major road projects on national roads with the aid of State grants.  These include the by-passes of Ballintra/Laghey, which I opened in Donegal recently, Bridgend and Newtowncunningham. If I had time I could mention further major roadworks that are going ahead.  A further improvement <Col N="314" /> scheme is scheduled to commence this year between Port Bridge, Letterkenny and Manorcunningham which will also be financed from road grants.  In the current year the level of road grant allocations notified to Donegal County Council is exceeded by only two other county councils. In the case of the block grant, which supplements the council's own resources for works on roads other than national roads, Donegal received the highest grant payable to any county council.  I am aware of the particular problems caused in Donegal by the recent spell of severe weather which has resulted in frost damage to some roads.</P>
      <P>Steps have already been taken to remedy the roads affected following consultation at engineering level between my Department and the county council. The remedial works may be financed from the council's own resources (including rate support grant), from the block grant, and from the appropriate road maintenance grants already notified to the council for 1985.  The funds available to me for road grants this year have already been fully allocated and I am not in a position to notify an additional grant for the work.  However, I will keep the position under review during the year having regard to the actual cost of the remedial works, progress on the council's overall road programme and expenditure in other areas.  Certainly, if I can at all, I will take the opportunity to go to Donegal. I think I will use my own transport and the facilities that are provided for me to make that visit.  I spent a number of holidays there during the seventies.</P>
      <P>I would like to return to the area and see the problems for myself, but at the moment we are busy and I cannot say when I will be able to do that, Senator.  I do assure you we will make that visit and we will take a look at the situation on the ground.  Thank you.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 20 February 1985.</P>
