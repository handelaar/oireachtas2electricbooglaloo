      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order, 1985</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 12th February, 1985.</P>

      <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, contains a list of investments in which trustees may invest funds unless expressly forbidden by the instrument, if any, creating the trust.  The chief purpose of the legislation is to protect the interests of the beneficiaries of trusts by providing trustees with a range of suitable investment outlets.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the 1958 Act provides that the list of authorised investments may be amended by order of the Minister for Finance.  Before the Minister may make the order a draft must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and a resolution of approval must be passed by each House.  Over the years changes in the list have been put forward when deemed appropriate, and the most recent order was made in December 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the draft order now before the House, I propose to authorise trustees to place trust funds in interest-bearing deposit accounts in Barclays Bank Ireland Ltd.  This will bring to 35 the <Col N="433" /> number of licensed banks in which trust funds may be deposited.  The Central Bank have recommended that trustee status be granted in this case.  The criteria on which the Central Bank base their recommendations are:</P>
    <P>(a)  The bank are, or are owned by, an institution in which the Central Bank have a high level of confidence,</P>
    <P>(b)  The bank has gross assets and gross domestic assets in excess of the minimum qualification of £25 million,</P>
    <P>(c)  The bank have a satisfactory capital level,</P>
    <P>(d)  The bank are in compliance with the Central Bank's licensing and supervision standards.</P>
    <P>The 1958 Act requires the Minister for Finance to consult the following referees about the terms of the draft order before it is laid before the Oireachtas: A judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, the Public Trustee, the Governor of the Central Bank, the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, the Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee, and the President of the Stock Exchange &mdash; Irish.  All of the statutory requirements have been complied with and the referees are in agreement with this draft order.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the bank named in the draft order are suitable for the investment of trust funds.  Therefore, I commend the motion for approval by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is the last in a series of measures aimed at terminating the quantitative licensing restrictions on road freight haulage for reward which were imposed by the Road Transport Act, 1933.</P>
      <P>The first major step towards freeing the industry from those rigid restrictions was taken in 1971 when the weight limitations on vehicles operated under merchandise licences were abolished and licence holders were permitted to use the size of vehicle best suited to their business.  Restrictions on areas of operation and on commodities which could be carried were also removed from licences issued to hauliers who were in business before licensing was introduced thus increasing from 100 to 841 the number of licences authorising carriage of general merchandise throughout the State.  The Act of that year also freed from licensing control the carriage of cattle, sheep and pigs and provided for the grant of restricted road freight licences to foreign operators engaged in the transport of goods to or from the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Road Transport Act, 1978 brought the process of liberalisation a step further. Prior to its enactment more than 500 licences were restricted to one vehicle each while some 150 licences authorised the use of only two vehicles.  The 1978 Act increased six-fold the number of vehicles which a haulier might operate on each licence subject to an overall maximum of 80 vehicles for any one business.  In order <Col N="435" /> to encourage the development of the Irish international road haulage industry and to lessen the country's dependence on foreign hauliers, the Act provided for the grant of restricted road freight licences to Irish hauliers to enable them to engage in international haulage.  To qualify for such a licence a haulier had to satisfy the EC requirements of good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence in accordance with the European Communities (Merchandise Road Transport) Regulations, 1977.  Furthermore, the 1978 Act exempted from licensing control haulage in vehicles not exceeding 2.5 tonnes unladen weight and haulage of grain in the harvesting season.</P>
    <P>Those measures were intended to give the existing licensed hauliers, who had hitherto been impeded by the restrictive nature of the legislation, an opportunity to expand their business and to prepare themselves before the industry was opened to new entrants.  It was, of course, made clear during the passage of the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas that the ultimate objective was the complete removal of quantitative restrictions on haulage for reward.  The phasing of the final step, which is the substitution of qualitative for quantitative controls with the effect of admitting new entrants to the market subject to a specific system of quality control, was considered in depth by the Transport Consultative Commission established by the then Minister for Transport in 1978.  In their report of July 1981, which was laid before this House, the commission outlined the following course:</P>
    <P>&mdash; A first phase restructuring of the existing licensing arrangements in a way which would permit existing hauliers entitled to operate under the Road Transport Acts to compete on equal terms as regards the area of operation and type of goods to be carried &mdash; this restructuring to take place during a two-year transition period commencing on acceptance by the Government of the Commission's recommendation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" />&mdash;In the second phase, at the end of the transition period, general haulage licences to be made freely available to all applicants including own-account operators who satisfy the EEC requirements for access to the profession of road haulage operator.</P>
    <P>The frequent changes of Government following publication of the report have had the effect of deferring adoption of these measures and prolonging the existing restrictive regime, which is really of benefit to no one, least of all, in my view, to the licensed haulier.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government was that the liberalisation measures should be implemented but with the modification, in response to representations from the Irish Road Haulage Association, representing the existing licensed hauliers, that the total abolition of quantitative control would begin two years after the beginning of phase 1 and not two years after the date of the Government decision, as recommended by the Transport Consultative Commission.</P>
    <P>The developments within the industry such as employment growth as a result of the gradual easing of restrictions are a fair indication that the industry has had, and used, in its more businesslike sector, the opportunity presented to prepare for complete liberalisation.  I believe that the further liberalisation measures we are now proposing will enable hauliers to develop their services in line with users' requirements.  At the same time, the operation of quality controls will serve to raise the standards of safety and efficiency throughout the industry.</P>
    <P>I have a varied responsibility in relation to road freight transport.  I must do all I can to see that users of the service have the best professional transport industry that can be provided.  I must also strive to ensure that, overall, national transport operates as efficiently as possible.  In my view one essential requirement for this is an increase in the amount of traffic carried by the professional hauliers and a fall in the own-account element.  I am satisfied that liberalisation to date has improved the share of traffic handled by <Col N="437" /> the professionals.  The statistics in this area are not complete but we do know from a survey carried out by the Central Statistics Office that, in the year 1964, the licensed haulage industry including CIE accounted for only about 17 per cent of ton miles compared with 83 per cent for own-account business.  The next full survey was for 1980 and it showed that the licensed haulage share had more than doubled to about 35 per cent.  There was a further slight increase to 36 per cent for 1982 which is the last year for which survey results are available.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I believe that licensed professional hauliers have yet to reap the full potential of the market so as to reach the stage reached in several other EC countries where professional hauliers have typically a share of the order of 60 per cent of the traffic.  The thinking of the Transport Consultative Commission was in line with this view.  The commission observed that own-account transport was becoming more complex and costly to operate and that the willingness of own-account operators to reduce the level of their own commitment to transport offered an opportunity for the enterprising professional haulier.  Frankly, I do not think that the hauliers can ever secure their full share of traffic until we have divorced ourselves totally from the intensely strict regulatory provisions which came into force over 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>My multiple responsibility includes also a responsibility to those hauliers who over all the years have served faithfully and in some cases with outstanding efficiency under a system which was so restrictive as to be almost punitive in effect.  The livelihood of these carriers is something we have to take into account. I do not accept the argument that liberalisation will destroy that livelihood. The hauliers of long standing have an edge in the market.  They are the people who have been in the business for years. They are on the ground floor.  They have the contacts and they have the expertise. They have a head start on all potential new entrants and they must win out.</P>
    <P>The livelihood of long established hauliers <Col N="438" /> will not be protected by unthinking opposition to change on the part of either Government or the industry.  Entrenched opposition to change in the past has resulted not alone in an unduly high share of the market for own-account hauliers but also in the growth of illegal operators. Their very existence is a symptom of the failure of the legislative system to keep up with market needs.  Sad to say that it is licensed hauliers themselves who have offered most resistance to the adaptation of the legislation to the conditions of today.</P>
    <P>The restrictive licensing arrangements imposed by the Road Transport Act, 1933 were designed to protect the railways. They did not succeed in this and the road vehicle has long since replaced the railway as the favoured mode of conveyance for most goods.  The trend towards greater use of road vehicles for such transport is not an exclusively Irish development; the same can be said of most European countries.  We have to face the fact that the principle of quantitative control on licensed road haulage dates from the incredibly different world of over half a century ago.  It has ceased for years to be relevant to our needs.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives effect to the Government decision to implement the recommendations of the Transport Consultative Commission.  Section 3 provides for placing all existing holders of merchandise licences on an equal competitive footing with each other by standardising licences.  It also contains the provision which after about two years will open access to haulage for reward to all qualified candidates.  The purpose of the phased approach even in this final stage of the liberalisation programme is to give all existing lawful operators a further period to strengthen their operations. Furthermore there would be an element of inequity in putting hauliers who, up to now may have been running illegally, on the exact same footing, from the start of the new regime, as operators who have respected the law over the years.</P>
    <P>There are three categories of licensee each of which will be entitled to get the new standardised licences, called road <Col N="439" /> freight carrier's licences, immediately the licensing provision becomes operative, namely: (1) holders of merchandise licences covering haulage of general merchandise throughout the State, (2) holders of merchandise licences restricted by area or type of operation e.g. Achill Island, car conveyors, and (3) holders of licences restricted to international operations.</P>
    <P>Hauliers operating in the exempted areas, that is areas within a specified radius of the principal post office in Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway, who, when the Act becomes operative hold, as required by the law, a current road freight certificate, being evidence that they have satisfied the EC requirements of good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence, will also be eligible for the new general standardised licences in the first phase.</P>
    <P>The standardised licences will be classified as national or international licences. Both classes of licence will authorise holders to engage in carriage for reward within the State without restriction as to the type of merchandise carried or number of vehicles used.  The international licence will be valid for international and home operations subject of course to compliance with the laws of any other State concerned.  International licences will be granted only to applicants who satisfy the more stringent EC criteria for international operations.</P>
    <P>Two years after the new licensing system commences any person or firm whose principal place of business is in the State will be able to get the standardised road freight carrier's licence subject only to meeting the qualifications laid down in the EC directive on admission to the occupation of road haulage operator. One of the consequences of this will be that suitably qualified own-account operators will be eligible for a licence to carry for reward.  There is some apprehension on the part of the existing licensed haulage industry that this development would result in unfair competition.  I do not think the licensed hauliers need have any <Col N="440" /> fears in this respect; the present licensing system does not preclude own-account operators from holding licences to carry for reward but they have not availed of that facility to any great extent.  In Britain, where own-account people have had for quite a long time now the facility to be licensed for reward, the swing from own-account to professional haulage has been very limited.  The indications in Ireland as I have said and, indeed, as I read every day, are for a swing away from own-account operations.  In any case to exclude own-account operators from carriage for reward would run counter to the whole idea of full liberalisation of the haulage industry which is designed to achieve a more competitive, economic and flexible transport system.  The existing high level of empty running of vehicles increases costs; backloading for reward would help reduce costs and improve competitiveness.  Many own-account operators would find it impractical to carry for reward of course.  Nevertheless there is a lot of unladen mileage, for want of forward or back loads, in the own-account sector and the facility to put that mileage to use ought to be available to all involved as is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition to restructuring the licensing system the Bill contains a provision in section 9 whereby own-account operators would be able to use hired vehicles for carrying their own goods; this would enable them to avail, <i>inter alia</i>, of financial leasing arrangements from which they are excluded by current legislation. This facility to use hired vehicles will apply only where the vehicle is hired without a driver; where vehicles with a driver are to be engaged carriage for reward would be involved and the licensing requirements would apply.</P>
    <P>Leasing arrangements give the operator flexibility in settling the level of his own commitment to transport and relieve him of the need to have capital invested in spare vehicles to meet any short term upturns in business or emergencies.  Long term leasing under contract has the further attraction that the leasing company relieves the operator of many of the operational problems associated with running <Col N="441" /> a fleet of vehicles.  I would hope that this new facility would enable many firms in the industrial and commercial sectors who must for one reason or another have their own fleets, to release capital for productive investment rather than have it locked up in vehicles.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements, where after about two years any applicant complying with the EC requirements will be entitled to get a general haulage licence, there will not be a need for transfer of existing licences and the existing transfer provisions are therefore being repealed. Special arrangements are, however, being made under section 12 to enable family businesses to be carried on where the holder of a licence dies or becomes incapacitated.  In such cases a new licence may be granted to a relative of the licence holder or the husband or wife of such a relative, who has had three years experience in the conduct of the business and who meets the EC good repute requirement. Where even these requirements cannot be met by a relative and in other cases where a licensee, or the manager of a licensed business who is designated as the person who meets the professional competence requirement, dies or becomes incapacitated I may, if necessary to avoid hardship, grant permission to enable a business to be carried on for a maximum period of 18 months.  This will allow for disposal of a business or give a relative or manager time to obtain a certificate of competence.</P>
    <P>The Transport Consultative Commission recommended that penalties for offences relating to road haulage should be increased and that the question of introducing on the spot fines should be examined.  The licensed haulage industry has also been critical of the penalties under the Road Transport Acts many of which have not been changed since they were introduced in 1933 and can no longer be regarded as penalties.  Provision is made in section 14 to increase penalties to a more realistic level and in the case of the most serious offences a maximum of £5,000 is proposed compared with £500 at present.  I hope that these increases combined with the <Col N="442" /> recently increased penalties introduced by the Minister for the Environment for road traffic offences will be a deterrent to serious breaches of the legislation and contribute to a safe and more efficient haulage industry.  I am taking power under section 13 to introduce on the spot fines for certain offences to be prescribed by regulation.  I have not yet decided what these offences might be.  They would not, of course, be the major ones but rather those of minor character which could be established on the spot.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is for the purpose of continuing in operation provision for the licensing of foreign hauliers who conduct part of an international haulage operation in the State.  The existing provision relates also to Irish hauliers engaged in similar haulage operations; such Irish hauliers will, under the new licensing provision subject to meeting the relevant qualifications, be eligible for the general haulage licence which will also entitle them to engage in point to point haulage in the State and therefore will not need the special restricted licence for international operation.  Foreign operators will not be allowed engage in point to point haulage in the State.</P>
    <P>The repeals being provided for in section 15 are mainly consequential on the other provisions of the Bill.  They relate to such matters as abolition of the exempted areas which are now being subjected to licensing control, termination of the licence transfer arrangements because qualified applicants will be eligible for new general licences, termination of renewal arrangements because the new licence will expire after three years and will not be renewable and removal of the restriction on use of hire or leased vehicles by own-account operators.</P>
    <P>To allay any fears that the proposals in the Bill will impose restrictions which do not apply I want to explain that no existing doors to lawful haulage operations are being closed.  Thus, in the two years after the new licensing code is introduced, restricted road freight licences will continue to be issued to persons wishing to engage in international operations and, also, persons wishing to commence <Col N="443" /> haulage operations in the exempted areas may still do so subject as now to compliance in both cases with the EC requirements. This will be achieved by deferring the repeal of the relevant existing provisions until after the end of that two year period.</P>
    <P>As I have said earlier, this Bill is long overdue.  It is the culmination of a process started almost 15 years ago.  I believe it will be welcomed by people both inside and outside the road transport industry. I also believe that efficient and enterprising operators have nothing to fear and indeed much to gain from the removal of unrealistic and harmful restrictions and that a more competitive haulage industry will develop as a result of the proposed measures, to the benefit of the national economy.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Minister to the House I am not sure that we can give an unqualified welcome to this legislation.  Unfortunately, over the past number of years we have seen this country swamped in all types of legislation but we have not attempted to ensure that legislation brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas is monitored. We had the situation over the past number of years where family planning clinics were being operated totally illegally throughout this State.  We have pirate radio stations broadcasting on every type of wave band.  The legislation to control these has not yet been implemented and even when it is implemented I wonder will there still be pirate stations around or will there be a proper monitoring system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a certain amount of chaos in the road transport industry for many years.  I do not think, unless we see a better attempt at enforcement adopted when this Bill becomes law, that it will be of any benefit in eliminating the chaos that exists in certain parts of the industry at present.  Legislation has been in force for many years which attempts to bring order into road transport, whether it be private road transport, private cars or the <Col N="444" /> haulage area.  If one goes back to the areas in which legislation exists, it is more in the absence of enforcement that it has been successful than in the enforcement. We see speed limits which are supposed to be enforced.  We see breathalyser limits which are supposed to be enforced. Every vehicle is supposed to have proper identification, proper lights and indicators. If one drives down the country at night at present I guarantee that every second vehicle one meets, either coming against one or passing one out, will either have a badly adjusted light or a light missing.  If you check the private cars on the road at present, possibly 90 per cent of them would not pass a road test because of the lack of maintenance and, indeed, of supervision of transport generally.</P>
    <P>The major legislation that was introduced in the past few years in relation to the haulage system was that which provided for tachographs. There is no doubt that the tachograph legislation is not being properly operated.  The main reason why it is not being properly operated is because we do not have sufficient people to check out the tachographs in the vehicles that are on the roads.  In many cases the people who are checking tachographs are gardaí who have had no instructions on how to check a tachograph. In dealing with this legislation, which is supposed to be an attempt to liberalise and make the transport industry more efficient, we are bringing a Bill into an area where up to now the enforcement procedures already there are not being utilised.  We are bringing in this Bill five years after the Transport Consultative Commission report came out.  When that report came out it was suggested that there would be a growth in the need for road haulage and that there would be an annual market growth of 30 per cent by 1985.  Anybody who looks at the road haulage needs in this country will see that not alone has that figure not increased by 30 per cent from 1981 to 1985 but there has been a total decrease in the demands that people are making on the road haulage system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> The needs of industry are being very well catered for at present by the number of licences and the number of vehicles that we have.  We have a very efficient road haulage system which is the licensed part of that system.  Since 1981 we have seen a major growth in the parcels and freight end of the business which has been taken away from CIE and which is being operated efficiently by a certain number of people who are licensed.  There are a huge number of unlicensed people driving around the country in &ldquo;bangers&rdquo;.  We hear of people getting telephone calls at 12 midnight or at 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the morning to know if they would take a delivery from so-and-so's freight service.  The reason these telephone calls come at those hours is because the people organising these services are probably illegal hauliers who should not be operating in the areas they are operating in and, to a degree, in a large number of cases they are using red diesel, which is illegal.  They are probably using red diesel and therefore their rates are highly competitive. With the present level of fines if a person uses red diesel and is fined £50,000 a year for using it &mdash; £1,000 per week &mdash; he is probably saving money even if he is caught every week.  The likelihood is that he will get through the year without being caught and save an enormous amount of money.  Therefore, his illegal profits are enormous.  The loss to the State is enormous because if he is hauling illegally we can be sure that he is not involved in the VAT or tax net.</P>
    <P>The Minister states in his last paragraph that he believes that efficient and enterprising operators have nothing to fear and much to gain from the removal of unrealistic and harmful restrictions and that a more competitive haulage industry will develop as a result of the proposed measures to the benefit of the national economy.</P>
    <P>It is laughable to think that there is much to gain from the removal of unrealistic and harmful restrictions and that a more competitive haulage industry will develop.  The haulage industry in Ireland is the most competitive industry.  The <Col N="446" /> rates that even the illegal hauliers are charging are rates that were in vogue between 1977 and 1978.  When one considers the increased cost of transport since 1977-78 it is unbelievable to think that anybody could suggest that they have much to gain and nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>The number of road transport vehicles standing idle in garages around the country because the operators are not able to keep up hire purchase payments, the number in various yards around the country which cannot be put on the road because the operators cannot produce the insurance premiums &mdash; they have not got enough work to pay them &mdash; is considerable.</P>
    <P>There are a number of good provisions in the Bill if enforcement policies are followed through.  There is no doubt that anybody who gets into the haulage industry should be of sound financial standing. Sound financial standing today is one thing but the day after a person gets a licence he might well not be of sound financial standing.  The industry believes that there is need for an assessment of the person's means in order that he will be able to stay in business.  As in other industries, a better way might be to suggest that a bonding system be brought in, such as exists in the air transport industry, the insurance industry and in various other industries.  The only way to protect the customers in terms of financial standing is through a bonding system.</P>
    <P>Much thought will have to be given to own-account haulage.  Own-account haulage, it is suggested by the Minister, has dropped over the past number of years and the slack taken up by the Irish road hauliers operating as a body.  But this is not true.  The percentage of people using their own-account haulage is still the same, at possibly, 70 per cent, with 15 per cent being carried by the licensed hauliers.  I wonder if the Minister could come up with figures that are up to date because I do not think I could accept the figures that we have here.  I have not seen any statistics which would give me the impression that licensed hauliers have increased their percentage of carriage <Col N="447" /> over and above what it was in or about 1980.</P>
    <P>The question of hauliers from outside operating inside this country is one to which the Minister should address himself very carefully.  The increased penalties for contravention of various parts of this Bill are very welcome.  They will be welcomed by anybody who uses the roads.  Everybody wants to see that the vehicles which are on the road are safe and roadworthy.  Up to now, it did not really pay to keep vehicles in a roadworthy condition because the penalties were too small.  I am glad to see that there is an increase in penalties in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister, before this Bill goes through both Houses, address himself to the problems that the Garda and people who are enforcing the legal restrictions on road vehicles are faced with daily, of not being able to take a vehicle off the road and impound it? There is no other country in Europe &mdash; I am not too sure about the rest of the world &mdash; in which a vehicle cannot be impounded for a traffic offence.  When I say a traffic offence, I am talking about overloading, bald tyres, bad lights and so on.  If an Irish vehicle goes over to the United Kingdom and is found to be overloaded it is pulled in immediately.  The vehicle is impounded until such time as either the load is brought down to the necessary weight if that is the problem, or if it is a question of bald tyres it is held until the tyres are changed.  If it is a question of the tachograph, the vehicle is held in Liverpool or at the docks and the driver is not allowed out of the dockland area unless he gets his tachograph properly calibrated, sealed or fixed.  I cannot see why companies can come in here from outside the State and compete at totally unrealistic rates in comparison with rates in the Irish road haulage industry and get away with it.</P>
    <P>The licensing of road vehicles is to remain within the ambit of the Department. It would be better if an independent licensing authority was set up to which all applicants for licences would have to apply.  It could be done in the very same way as when the Department <Col N="448" /> of the Environment ask people to place advertisements in the papers to state that they are making a planning application for a house or for a change of use, etc. At least the general public and the haulier in an area, who might feel that his livelihood might be taken away, would be able to put to this licensing body the pros and cons of increasing the licence numbers in a particular area or of giving a licence to a person where there are enough vehicles to do the type of haulage that is needed in that area.  I should like the Minister to look at this before the Bill passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that in future people would be able to lease vehicles for the purpose of own-account haulage. Again, that is reasonable enough but he did not mention the short term lease.  This is where an own-account person could go out and lease a vehicle for a week.  That is something we could not agree with.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he intends that on-the-spot fines would be brought in only for minor offences.  I was talking in terms of foreign vehicles getting away with murder within the State. If we had a system of on-the-spot fines for foreign vehicles we would be doing much better than what is proposed here, where we are talking about on-the-spot fines for possibly minor contraventions of the Act.  If we had a system where the fine was substantial for foreign vehicle owners, or operators within the country, then we could hold the vehicles until the fine was paid and that would make them deal with whatever problems they had.</P>
    <P>The road haulage industry is a peculiar industry in a way.  It is the only industry that I have ever heard of coming up with a suggestion that they would put up the money for the control of themselves, when they suggested to the Minister that they would put up £10 per vehicle per year for the introduction of a specialised road traffic corps.  It was suggested by the Minister that it would take about £350,000 to set up this specialised road traffic corps and that after that, it would probably cost about £180,000 a year to run.  If we take it that there will be a payment of £10 per vehicle, in the first <Col N="449" /> year enough money will be taken in from the industry to support the traffic corps for quite a number of years.</P>
    <P>We must pay tribute to the road traffic corps that we have in the country at present.  They do a magnificent job under very difficult circumstances in the sense that they are working in support of the general public to ensure that vehicles on the road are in a reasonable condition and that the people driving the vehicles are in a reasonable condition.  The road traffic corps are not trained in the special arts necessary to control road traffic.  We expect our road hauliers to do a very specialised course in the regional colleges so that they can get a licence to operate a road haulage business but we do not send gardaí away to do a specialised course in the operation of whatever legislation we have at present.</P>
    <P>I am not clear on the matter of giving a licence to an own-account applicant.  I presume the Minister will bring in the same type of rules and regulations for the own-account holder as there are for the independent road haulage industry.  If in a limited company there is somebody who has the competence to run a road haulage business and he leaves that company, does the own-account company lose its licence and, if not, how does the Minister suggest that an own-account company can run a business if there is nobody in that company who has a licence of competency to run the business?</P>
    <P>The road haulage industry performs under very difficult circumstances.  It performs on roads which are not suitable for the type and size of vehicles being used. Our road system is a fragmented one. There are very few cases in which a vehicle can travel for any great distance on reasonably good roads.  Much of our haulage comes from the part of the country which has the worst roads.  Trying to get materials to the main ports is a major cost factor for the Irish industry but it is equally a factor which has to be taken into account when we talk about the road haulage business.</P>
    <P>The people who are operating transport <Col N="450" /> here operate at a disadvantage compared with every other country in Europe when one considers the cost of insurance. The licence fees might be a little lower in other countries but our insurance costs are higher than in any other country in Europe.  Our maintenance costs, which have been increased recently by 5 per cent, are very high.  The cost of spare parts is enormously high in comparison with other countries.  As somebody who knows something about the spare parts business I know it has nothing to do with the fact that there is an inordinately high profit being made on spare parts; it is purely and simply because import duties and VAT are so high that these items are extremely dear.</P>
    <P>The revenue for the State from the road haulage industry is enormous.  It has been suggested that it is one of the biggest industries that we have in the country in terms of the &ldquo;take&rdquo; to the State.  The &ldquo;take&rdquo; to the State is an ongoing thing, day after day after day.  The State &ldquo;take&rdquo; on road diesel must be enormous.  I have not got the figures but we will have them before Committee Stage.  It has to be emphasised that we have to protect the people who are running a very efficient business at present for this country, not alone for themselves.  They are running into cash-flow problems.  Those who bother to do the job properly are running into problems every day.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that there is not the odd licensed road haulier who does not contravene the rules and regulations on occasion.  That industry is the same as every other industry and you will have people who will go outside the rules. Generally they do a fantastic job in getting exportable goods to the ports and in transporting our goods outside the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not going to do what the Minister suggests &mdash; develop a more efficient haulage industry.  It is suggested that enterprising operators have nothing to fear but I fear for them unless they are given an area of operation which allows them to have their business controlled in a logical manner.  This Bill would be more appropriate in boom times than for the present time.  The Bill is as a result of a <Col N="451" /> Transport Consultative Commission report.  If we are to have a proper Road Transport Bill and proper legislation we should go back to the TCC and up-rate the figures and the suggestions that were made in that report.  We should have another TCC report before we implement this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by welcoming this Bill.  There are aspects of it on which I would like to seek clarification but in general, the Road Transport Bill, 1985 deals with a programme of liberalisation in relation to road haulage and road transport that has been going on since the passing of the 1971 and 1978 Acts.  I would like to refer to what Senator Lanigan said about the difficulties with our road system.  We are all prepared to share his view that finance for the road system throughout the State at the moment &mdash; there are many very good exceptions to that &mdash; is in need of upgrading.  I would like to mention to Senator Lanigan in case he has not thoroughly read the <i>Building on Reality</i> document published by this Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we have increased by 50 per cent the finance for the roads programme over the next number of years.  If one is a member of a local authority, and I know that the Senator who has just spoken is, one would be aware of the way in which the local authorities have stepped up their programme of acquisition and of financing. The matter concerns road transport. Yesterday, I spent some time at an oral hearing relating to a six-lane motorway outside St. Patrick's Cathedral in the centre of Dublin.  That is just to give one illustration of the positive mood that is coming into the area of road development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would Senator FitzGerald get back to the Bill? What he has just said is not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say to you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that your good colleague, Senator Lanigan, spent a great deal of time speaking about the country's inadequate road system and that is a matter which directly affects the road haulage industry.  Therefore I would suggest that I am perfectly in order.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it clear to Senator Lanigan that these proposals, both in regard to acquisition and to financing the roads system are very heavily enshrined in <i>Building on Reality</i> and will be seen over the next three years, if the Senator read the programme on road development, to match the document that has been published in relation to the specific roads that have been mentioned for improvement, upgrading and for major investment in that three year term.  I would say also to Senator Lanigan that by the time we face the people at the end of this period in office there will be a very different road system in many parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to the Bill and the direct question that affects those in the haulage industry, the Bill does a number of things to improve the existing situation.  It is a very comprehensive Bill and it is following the recommendations, as Senator Lanigan said, of the consultative commission on road freight haulage, the Transport Consultative Commission.  It deals with the question of issuing licences to all applicants who satisfy the EC requirements of good repute, sound financial standing and professional competence. In many respects it will bring licensing in the road haulage industry into a much more equitable state.  The cost of purchasing road haulage licences at the moment causes some concern throughout the community.  The controls, on the other hand, that would be necessary in the establishment of whatever licensing authority the Minister intends to have in relation to the issue of licences is an important matter.  Whereas one would like to see the freeing-up of licences to <Col N="453" /> have them more widely available &mdash; the cost of a licence at the moment is pretty prohibitive for many people who would like to enter this industry &mdash; there is equally a need to seek a standard of qualification from those who are applying.</P>
    <P>The whole question of applications for road haulage licences should be subject to much the same kind of qualifications that may exist in the insurance industry but certainly exist in the auctioneers industry, where an applicant has to insert an advertisement in the public press stating the intention of applying for a licence. There should be some attempt to make public the matter we are dealing with so that objections to the qualifications of an applicant could be provided by those in the industry and elsewhere, by those who feel that the applicant is an unsuitable person to drive a heavy vehicle, such as those extraordinarily long vehicles that we see on our roads at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill generally in the case of own-account hauliers, those who operate a vehicle belonging to a company, will make such vehicles much more costeffective than they are at present.  My understanding of the situation is that if an own-account vehicle ends up in another part of the country it cannot collect goods there and take them back to base.  There is a difficulty in that respect.  The costeffectiveness of our road haulage system at the moment is harmed by the fact that there are unladen vehicles travelling the road system.  That problem could be resolved in the relevant section of the Bill and would bring these own-account hauliers into the position in which everybody else will be in about two years time.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, in his general role as Minister for Communications, to comment on the effects on Córas Iompair Éireann of the passing of this Bill.  I understand that Córas Iompair Éireann operate a cage system.  There are other institutions which operate cages also. Members of these Houses were down in Spike Island a few days ago and I suppose there are cages of one kind or another there, but there are cages operated in the freight system of CIE which apparently cause problems for those who want to use <Col N="454" /> that service in that if the merchandise is too big for the cage and does not fit properly there are difficulties in taking the merchandise on the rail system.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who would have preferred, if I had the opportunity of contributing in this House 15 years ago, to have seen much greater development of the Córas Iompair Éireann freight system but, unfortunately, the country, albeit it is something we cannot do much about now, has to a large degree gone from rail haulage to road haulage.  I say that because of the effects on our road system, on tourists and on our community generally of freight vehicles operating on roads which are unsuitable for the size of these containers.  It is not a matter we can deal with now.  It has long passed that point.  I make this point because when we look at the position of the Italian, or any other European, rail system, we see that they seem to have been able to maintain their system in a much more viable way than we have been.  I do not know how viable they are but certainly the services are available.  Freight is carried by them on rail as well as on road and it would seem to me to be proportionately higher than the freight carried here.</P>
    <P>The area of safety was mentioned by Senator Lanigan.  It is an area which should call for the greatest attention and pursuit by the Garda Síochána.  Those involved in the road haulage industry recognise the need to step up the areas of enforcement.  It relates in some cases to driving heavy vehicles without licences and to those who, in one form or another, flagrantly abuse the code that exists.  I know the Minister referred to the fact that he intends to raise to a realistic level the fines for serious offences to a maximum of £5,000, compared with £500 at the moment.  Equally, the Minister for the Environment, in regard to road traffic offences, recently introduced increased penalties which will act as a deterrent to serious breaches of legislation, contributing to a safer and more efficient haulage industry.  Interestingly enough, the Minister for Communications is also considering taking power under section 13 to introduce on-the-spot fines for certain <Col N="455" /> offences prescribed by regulation.  I will be interested to see those regulations at a later stage.</P>
    <P>My concern is about the vehicle that the ordinary road user meets in this country at present.  Senator Lanigan mentioned vehicles that are badly lit. Sometimes they are so dirty that one would not know whether they had a light at the back of the vehicle or not.  I met a vehicle outside Leinster House today and I would not like to tell Senators about the altercation I almost had with the driver. Those vehicles simply abuse the road system because of their size.  This is a matter of importance for the Garda Síochána.  I might qualify my remark by saying that I am quite certain that the vast majority of heavy road haulage drivers drive with great care and decency but there are some who cause real problems. I do not think the Garda Síochána travel after them to the extent they should.</P>
    <P>I remember passing through Maynooth three or four years ago and escaping by seconds instant death by overtaking a vehicle seriously overloaded with a load of roofing tiles.  I do not suppose it was the effect of the car in which I was a passenger but the material came crashing onto the road.  Anybody who happened to be in the immediate vicinity at that time would have been a &ldquo;goner&rdquo;.  The Garda Síochána will have to become much more vigilant about controlling heavily laden vehicles that are totally unsuitable for our road system.</P>
    <P>I am moving slightly away from the point when I speak of vehicles used for the building industry but there could be vehicles used in some form or another for road haulage.  Vehicles used in the building industry are so heavily laden that they are a danger to the public.  A great deal more attention should be given to them.</P>
    <P>I would add that this matter also relates to very many farm vehicles which travel on our road system, for example, balers, tractors and so on, which often use our roads without proper licences or sufficient care.  These are a cause of distress on our road system.  I know this is the <Col N="456" /> Second Stage of the Bill and I hope to speak again on Committee Stage.  The Bill is a reforming measure which must be welcomed in this House.  Hopefully the Bill will receive due consideration. Perhaps we may have a fresh look at sections which may require attention on another Stage.  The Bill will be very welcome and a very useful measure to have on the Statute Book.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I might not be in total agreement with some of the ideas put forward by Senator FitzGerald on the Bill but it is necessary that we modify our road transport legislation from time to time. Much of the chaos which has come to the transport industry in this country has come via CIE.  For too long CIE were in a position to have an overall grip on all types of the road transport business in this country.  We all know the problems that private owners and those who wished to get into the haulage business had in the fifties and sixties when it was common to see people prosecuted for road haulage offences.  The net result was that our road haulage industry never developed and still has not done so.</P>
      <P>A situation has arisen where the road haulage industry in Northern Ireland has developed using Southern Ireland as a base for extra finance and work to develop their own businesses.  At the moment much of the heavy freight from this country is carried by carriers from Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  We see this every day.  If one looks at the number of juggernauts travelling on any ferry from this country one will see that the number of them registered in the State is much smaller than the number of those registered outside it.  The net result is that we are now trying to make up the ground that was lost in those years to private transport and to a licensed haulage industry which now finds itself without the necessary revenue to allow it compete against outside influences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to develop our road haulage industry, the first thing we must do is to strengthen those who are already in it.  I was one who would have agreed with the increase in the number of <Col N="457" /> licences per plate which was changed in 1978 when it was increased from one to six.  Many of those extra licences have not been taken up.  At least 25 per cent to 30 per cent of extra licences made available under that Act are not being used at present.  The number of owners who at that time had &ldquo;one plate&rdquo; as it was called and who would have increased to six would be very small.</P>
    <P>The licences under this law, for which many people had to pay a very high price in order to get into business, are now of the same value as the daily newspaper, or will be very shortly.  It is sad for those people that they are not to be compensated in some way or another, perhaps by allowing a longer period before the proposed changes come into effect. The Minister should have a look at this and see what he can do to help those carriers who invested in the belief that the licences which they were buying would have a reasonable market value for quite a number of years from the time they bought them.</P>
    <P>The problem of outside carriers coming in here is that extra power will have to be given to the Garda to deal with them. I would like to know how many vehicles leaving this country in the past year or so have been taken in and weighed.  I would also like to know the number of Southern vehicles impounded in Northern Ireland because they have some minor defects.</P>
    <P>I know of one case where a Southern carrier was taken in and held in the North until he took off 50 kilos of excess weight. He did this by letting diesel out of the tank of the lorry to bring him down within the weight.  Yet we here are not enforcing the regulations with regard to weight, tachograph hours or anything else to the extent that they are being enforced in other EC countries.  The net result is that outside interests see Ireland as the bonanza place to go to do business because they can take chances in the Republic which they cannot take outside of it.</P>
    <P>When these new regulations are being implemented and enforced they should be enforced to the last letter of the law to protect the people who are already in the haulage industry and to protect the <Col N="458" /> jobs that are in it.  They are competing against outside interests who have very great advantages over them.  They have the advantage of cheaper vehicles.  The import duties an Irish company will pay on a new heavy vehicle, in comparison to that paid by their counterparts in Northern Ireland, Britain or Germany, leaves them at a total disadvantage from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  Maybe it is time to look at the rate of import duties and VAT on heavy vehicles.  We know that the VAT is refundable to the purchasers of these vehicles, but it is still a burden which they must carry for a certain length of time.  It is only a paper exercise having it transferred. They pay it and then claim it back.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will ensure that there are more mobile patrols provided within the State to check on the heavy haulage business.  It is mentioned here with regard to the proposed changes for own-account haulage.  The very reason that many firms have not used public haulage companies is that they found they were not in a position, due to the restrictions that were placed on them for quite a length of time, to give the service.  They also found that the reliability of some of the cowboys in the business was so bad that they just had to provide their own fleet, which meant they had to tie up extra capital in many cases.  This was depriving their main business from developing.  If we had a proper, well-run road haulage business we could, I believe, free capital from private individuals and companies which would then be available for them to reinvest in their direct businesses rather than having to invest it in what could be classed as a side business, namely, the provision of their own transport.</P>
    <P>The Minister should, before he puts this Bill through the House, examine the comments made by the Irish Road Haulage Association.  They made quite a number of comments in the past few years.  That organisation is not there to operate the closed shop, in my opinion, but to safeguard those people who are already in the haulage industry and to safeguard the jobs in the haulage industry. <Col N="459" /> After all, what we want to see develop from this and any other such legislation is a more efficient system which will provide not alone a better service but also employment for people.  It should mean rather than having a large percentage of our freight carried to and from this country by outside hauliers that we would have the opposite situation developing, where we would have 80 per cent at least of freight haulage within this country done by Irish hauliers employing Irish people, giving them jobs, rather than having Irish money leave this country in freight charges.  Such money could be better used at home to provide jobs for our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take a very hard look at this Bill in relation to existing legislation in order to ensure that the changes are implemented with the full rigour of the law and anybody found operating outside those regulations should pay the penalty.  I would ask him to ask his Department to make sure that the cowboy element which has crept in to road haulage in this country in the past few years is removed as soon as possible. The sooner those mavericks who operate on red diesel or use other illegal methods are put out of business the sooner the Minister will be in a position to develop our own haulage industry.  As I said earlier, the development of this will mean more jobs for Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill.  Senator Lanigan made a few points with which I do not agree.  He spoke about the leasing of vehicles and the short term leasing that would create a problem, particularly if people could lease a vehicle for a week.  If people wanted to lease a vehicle for a day they should be allowed to do so because in every country &mdash; it happens with cars and trucks on a smaller scale in this country &mdash; they have car or truck replacement vehicles for people whose vehicles have broken down.  The vehicle might be on the way from Kerry to Dublin, or vice versa, and the haulier may not have a spare vehicle and would need to lease a vehicle.  Private people <Col N="460" /> might also have breakdowns and they would need to lease a vehicle.  Vehicle leasing on the whole is something that is very important to the people.  Because of the high costs of vehicles today all the bigger companies in the State, such as the oil companies, the distillers, Guinness's and others, have gone in for leasing.  They have actuaries, accountants and experts and I am sure they would not be doing that if it was not a worthwhile proposition.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan spoke about the faulty vehicles one sees going down the country, particularly those with faulty lighting and bald tyres.  I think that was true of commercial vehicles up to about a year or two ago, but since the MOT testing came in all these vehicles have to be tested by an approved station.  They have to be certified by the local authority.  They are tested once a year.  I am sure that any reputable company &mdash; and they would not be testing if they were not reputable &mdash; will ensure that vehicles are all right. Senator Lanigan referred to cars, which are not mentioned in the Bill, but he was right about that point.  All he was doing was making a very good case for MOT testing for cars, something we will have to have in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan also made a point about unfair competition from vehicles outside the State.  Any vehicle outside the State coming in here has the same freedom.  That is one of the benefits of the EC.  They have the freedom to deliver their goods into this country just the same as we have the freedom to deliver in any other EC country, but do not have &mdash; nor would we have &mdash; the right to use those vehicles in the State for local deliveries. He also spoke about the cost of spare parts, excise duty and VAT.  He said he was in part of that business, just as I am. He was not correct when he spoke about, first of all, increases in VAT on the cost of repairs which was increased from 5 to 10 per cent.  The Minister made that increase at the time he was trying to rationalise VAT charges.  He reduced the excise duty from 25 per cent to 10 per cent.  Everyone in the vehicle business <Col N="461" /> knows that the cost of parts far exceeds the cost of labour.</P>
    <P>As regards people with commercial vehicles, I do not think the VAT comes into it at all.  All these people are registered for VAT and VAT is reclaimable. In actual fact they are not paying VAT. It is a question of a paper exercise &mdash; you pay it and you get it back.  Then there are also VAT credits.  If you are in business you are collecting VAT money that you do not pay in for two months.  So one balances out the other the whole time.</P>
    <P>The Minister also spoke about the high cost of fuel.  I understand from my experience of last year &mdash; not this year, but last year &mdash; in the North and in the UK that diesel fuel costs around the same price as it does here.  I know petrol prices are different but there is no difference in diesel fuel.  The fact is that VAT is recoverable on diesel fuel to the commercial users.  They are paying 23 per cent VAT, but they are getting back the 23 per cent VAT, so they have no complaint in that respect.</P>
    <P>In regard to the people who have own-account vehicles, there was the recent case of Irish Distillers who are disposing of their own vehicles and are going over to hauliers.  They find that hauliers are more satisfactory and there is no capital tied up in the purchase of vehicles.  They know that there is no disposal problem at the end of the year with vehicles.  On 1 January they know exactly what their costs will be right up to 31 December.  In that way they are proving the point that the Minister has made that the hauliers can only benefit from this.</P>
    <P>The matter of compensation for people who had plates was raised, and it was said there is no provision for compensation.  I do not think that there is any case for compensation in this case.  When these plates were first issued under the Road Traffic Act, 1933 &mdash; and I remember it quite well &mdash; anybody who applied for a plate at that time got a plate for the sum of £1.  A number of people who were wise at the time applied for more plates than they required, They were able to put on extra vehicles after a few years.  Then the plates became collectors' items and were <Col N="462" /> sold for very high prices.  There were people who came in in later years, when there was a high increase, who bought these plates and paid a high price for them.  That is true.  But they had got value for that in the meantime in so far as the capital laid out was reduced by a ratio of 6-1 when the people who had bought those plates were entitled to get six plates for every plate they held.</P>
    <P>By the time this Bill comes into force &mdash; it is two years from the date of the regulations &mdash; they will have their money back.  It can only lead to a better system of transport.  It is going to mean a cheaper system because there will be organised back loading.  The biggest problem in this country is the waste of transport.  Trucks come from Kerry to Dublin to collect their loads while trucks go from Dublin to Kerry delivering loads.  There are vehicles doing a run each day without a load.  These are professional people and when the traffic is there to collect it, they will collect it.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned by the Minister, with which I am entirely in agreement, is on-the-spot fines.  The Minister is bringing this in for the commercial business.  All I am sorry about is that it is not coming in for every vehicle.  I was in Canada recently and if one comes out of a side road and there is a stop sign and one does not stop one is fined $30 and the fine is paid on the spot.  The result is that everybody stops at the stop sign.  In this country because there is not an on-the-spot fine system nobody stops at the stop sign unless some other vehicle stops. I would like to see that system in operation here.  I fully support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main reasons I am speaking on this Bill is because of an incident that happened yesterday on my way to Dublin on the main Cavan-Dublin road.  A huge lorry which appeared to me to be empty passed me out at about 70 to 80 miles an hour.  A huge plank flew off that lorry and missed my car and an oncoming car.  It did not land on a hedge but went straight through it.  The impact would have been about 150 miles an hour had it hit my car.  I made a decision that <Col N="463" /> I would try to bring to somebody's attention the fact that there are people, even in the haulage business, who have no care for other users of the road.  That lorry driver was carrying a load of death.  I failed to catch that man from the Cavan boundary right into Navan and he escaped me in Navan.  He took some other turn.  I could not catch him.  I estimated that he was doing well over 70 miles per hour.  There is much to be said for what Senator FitzGerald said.  A similar incident happened in his case.  Two Members of the Seanad today related their experiences in a debate with regard to improper use by lorry drivers and negligence, so the problem is widespread.</P>
      <P>With regard to the legislation, I would support any legislation that would eliminate what are termed as the &ldquo;cowboy operators&rdquo; in any industry.  In this case we are speaking about the ones who have no respect for other road users, those whose vehicles are not properly taxed, insured or maintained, or who use fuel that is subsidised for the farming community. I suppose it is elimination by legalisation in effect.  If we look at the Bill a good many of these will be brought into the licensing net and subjected to the restrictions, standards and guidelines that apply to properly licensed hauliers.</P>
      <P>This problem was created to a large extent by the monopoly held by a major State body in this country over a number of years, namely CIE.  At the same time, I would say to the Minister when we talk about liberalisation we should be careful not to let the business get out of hand. We have the experience in this country, and the building industry in one case, where we allow it to &ldquo;over-heat&rdquo;, and when the &ldquo;valley&rdquo; period comes, which we are in at the moment in that business, there seems to be no answer to the problems. We could end up with a monopoly situation where many of the firms might &mdash; hopefully not &mdash; end up going out of business.  We have enough businesses &ldquo;biting the dust&rdquo; in this country at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to protect those business people who are heavily in debt and who <Col N="464" /> have given commitment and service to the industry over a long number of years. I feel rather sceptical when I get a letter from the Irish Road Haulage Association &mdash; a body of repute.  They totally oppose the legislation.</P>
    <P>Will the Bill in some way damage the business or do people who are experts in the business see that it has damaging qualities?  I would like to ask if the Minister in his reply would give some indication whether we have proper facilities in this country to comply with the EC standards. We talk about EC standards.  I would like to list one, weights for heavy vehicles. Have we weighing scales to weigh lorries properly?  I do not believe we have.  The weighing scales are not fit to take the very long heavy vehicles that are using our roads at present.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for the holders of plates, as they were known, because they will not receive any compensation.  A good number of plate holders have been unable to get business for the last number of years.  It was their mistake that they did not sell them when they were worth money some years ago.  Prior to the Bill they felt that they had something of value, but they will become valueless in two or three years' time.  I would ask the Minister to bring to the attention of the Minister for Justice the need for more mobile patrols and on-the-spot checks on these large vehicles on the roads.  Having said that, I know that many of our licenced hauliers are very good drivers, and we all have the experience of their courtesy on the roads, where they will move over to let a heavy stream of traffic flow by.  We have the odd instances and, unfortunately, these are the ones that bring trouble and death to our roads.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I would like to thank Senators for their contributions, and it was very clear notwithstanding the circulation was only a few days ago that Senators were well prepared for the debate.  I would like in the course of my reply to try to deal with some of the questions raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> Senator Lanigan raised the question of increasing standards.  The EC competence criteria have already been raised through the exam system; both financial and other criteria are under review with a view to raising the standards.  Senator Lanigan also raised the question &mdash; it was raised again by other speakers &mdash; that the fall in licence values suggested that we should compensate people for not being able to sell their licences.  It is something that I could not accept.  It is a scandal that licences issued by the State were being retailed at very high prices.  That indicated in itself that there was something wrong with the existing system.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point made about statistics, it has often been acknowledged in this House that road freight transport statistics were weak.  However, since 1980 that situation has dramatically reformed through the adoption of EC practice and an improvement is continuing.  There is no ground in this context for casting doubt on the 1982 statistics as an indicator of trends over a long period.  I regret that Senator Lanigan does not accept the Central Statistics Office statistics.</P>
    <P>Points were made about external hauliers. External hauliers must be admitted, otherwise Irish hauliers cannot gain access to external territories.  The more efficient industry this Bill seeks to promote will be a better instrument than any other for ensuring that our own people can compete with hauliers from outside.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan suggested an independent licensing authority.  There is no case for an independent licensing authority in the context of qualitative control. It helps to balance supply and demand, and is not on anywhere at all because of measurement difficulties.  We have had a supply and demand provision in the Act since 1944 but it has been completely unworkable.  Under a qualitative licensing system there is no distinction by which the Minister could make fish of one and flesh of another.</P>
    <P>There is already a cross between the provisions on this.  Licenced hauliers can engage in their own account or can carry forward their licences.  No one in the future will be entitled to sell a licence and <Col N="466" /> no one will be entitled to hold a licence without the appropriate qualifications.</P>
    <P>In relation to competition, a point made by Senator Lanigan, the Bill is intended to eliminate cut-throat and cowboy competition which I acknowledge to be a problem.  Free access subject to quality controls will gradually eliminate the fly by night and the cowboy who can do so much damage.  These are the effects I see from this Bill.  As I pointed out at the outset, there has been opposition to the updating of the law which has permitted the growth of illegal haulage, which is something I want to stop.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan did make a very valid point about the non-implementation or non-enforcement of legislation.  I am aware of the widespread concern about this, articulated by many Senators in this debate.  I will be taking their views under notice and will consider them further during the consideration of this Bill in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As regards many offences of a traffic character, I would have to remind Senators that the Road Traffic Acts are not within my province.  This does not invalidate the considerations raised by Senators.</P>
    <P>There have been some allegations that the legislation in relation to tachographs is not being enforced.  This legislation is monitored carefully by my Department and also by the EC.  I have been able to report to the EC that there is about 90 per cent compliance with the requirement to have a tachograph fitted and, within that bracket, a high proportion of compliance with the requirements as to use.</P>
    <P>There was also a point raised about vehicle leasing.  It would not be practical to provide for ever against short term leasing once long term had been allowed. The idea of phasing between long and short term has been considered but, on balance, it was thought better and more realistic to deal with the whole matter in one provision.  The TCC saw no significant danger for licence holders in the abolition of the ban on leasing.  The removal of control on smaller vehicles in 1978 and the fact that in the exempted <Col N="467" /> areas control on haulage vehicles never existed renders the leasing question marginal anyway.</P>
    <P>I hope I have dealt with all the points made by Senators.  I thank them for taking this Bill today and for their contributions.  I look forward to going into more detail with the Senators on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The general function of &ldquo;advising and making recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty in the State&rdquo;&mdash; to what extent does the Minister anticipate that the Combat Poverty Agency would have freedom to assess matters themselves?  If we take the first one, they advise and make recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty in the State.  Would they have a function to recommend to the Minister some change in the social welfare legislation?  That could be a very obvious one.  What about a change in property rights within the State?  For instance, if property rights within the State were found by the agency to be contributing to the problem of poverty in the State, would the Minister accept recommendations from the Combat Poverty Agency along those lines?  What parameters does the Minister intend to have for this kind of advice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) (a), which the Senator is referring to, can be seen as outlining the policy role of the new agency.  An anti-poverty programme cannot be drawn up in isolation from economic and social planning as a whole but must concentrate on the broader aims of national policy, for example on a more just distribution of wealth, income and power in line with the Government's programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency must be seen as not just a source of supportive funding for localised actions by individual communities, or groups but must be capable of having an input into policy making at national level. <Col N="469" /> The detailed policies and programmes which are adopted at any time in pursuit of the objective of combating poverty will depend on the particular situation.  The involvement of the agency in this area, with its expertise and its direct involvement in combating poverty, will be of considerable benefit in terms of helping to define policy and determine priorities for effective action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Minister says, that the agency will make recommendations from time to time on Government policy, and try to relate to matters in line with Government policy. What I am trying to establish is, will it be open to the agency to issue reports which are against Government policy?  Do you understand the point I am making?  The issue of a report is dealt with as well under (2) (g) and I have a separate question later on in regard to the issue of reports, on section 11.  Is it the intention that they will issue reports, maybe in controversial areas and maybe in areas and in a manner not supportive of the Government in the same way as the Economic and Social Research Institute issue reports in the economic area?  Is that what the Minister has in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

      <P>The paragraph in question is, to my mind, quite clear, &ldquo;advising and making recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty in the State&rdquo;.  They will be free to make whatever recommendations they see advisable in certain circumstances and these recommendations may very well be, from time to time, against what the policy would be at that given time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and I thank the Minister for that information.  What I am trying to get at, and the Minister might like to take time to think about it, is whether or not the agency will have the right to publish reports independent of his annual report and independent of reports to the Minister, that it could issue reports to the general public.  In other <Col N="470" /> words, if you like, to go over the Minister's head and say these are the policies which we believe will make a contribution to the reduction or elimination of poverty, even though those recommendations may not be in conformity with the present Government or any Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard, I would like to congratulate the Minister.  It is very important that in bringing in an agency like this, even though I am sure from time to time they will issue reports which I will not agree with, and with which the Minister and I might not agree, it is important if you are going to create this new organisation that they will be given the maximum possible opportunity of expressing their views, of course, always recognising the fact that the Government are under no obligation to accept those views.  But we must give an organisation like this the maximum possible freedom to operate.</P>
      <P>In that regard, in view of the additional information which the Minister has given us, it does mean that there could be a very significant role to be played by the Combat Poverty Agency in creating the climate to tackle the problem of poverty. In that regard I would like to say that I support section 4 very strongly.  I think that if it does fulfill the general functions outlined in section 4 it will make a very significant contribution towards the tackling of poverty which, after all, is not an insoluble problem.  Certainly, it may be insoluble to say it will eliminate differences between people, but the elimination of poverty as such should not be beyond all our capacities at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I briefly make a comment to the Minister and also make my apologies for being late?  I referred to section 4 in my Second Stage contribution and, indeed, many people I spoke to since in the field of poverty and generally helping socially deprived areas and so on, agreed with my sentiments.  Section 4 (a) <Col N="471" /> refers to aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty in the State and sub-section (c) refers to the nature and causes, the extent of poverty and so on, and for that purpose the promotion and the interpretation of research.  Personally, and I say this from a very real, practical knowledge, I feel that we can overdo, if you like, the research, the examination and overdo all of these things.  I feel that what is needed, having regard to the unemployment situation, the cost of living, the way people are living, many of them on the breadline situation, is not more research. I argue that St. Vincent de Paul and all the other organisations have that knowledge. They can spell it out on the ground where real areas of poverty are.  I would hope that we would not spend hundreds of thousands of pounds seeking information that has been there for so many years.  It is vital that we get down to the root cause and eliminate all the research because it has been done.  Use what you have, and I certainly would hope that the Minister would be able to assure me that as little as possible will be spent in this area and that we will, in fact, get down to the important aspect of any combat poverty programme, which is the practical achievement of combating poverty in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised on Second Stage &mdash; and I would still like to pursue further &mdash; why the Minister has felt it necessary to have such a broad power in subsection (5) of section 4 which refers to the fact that &ldquo;the agency shall in the performance of its functions comply with such directions as may from time to time be given to it by the Minister.&rdquo;  What kind of directions would be envisaged there and to what extent might the exercise of that power by the Minister prevent the agency from being both independent and, perhaps, sufficiently strong in discharging its functions?  I would agree with Senator O'Leary.  The functions as defined are very broadly and adequately defined, but if the Minister can by direction direct the agency, for example, not <Col N="472" /> to pursue a particular area or examination or not to continue work in a certain field, then might that not seriously hamper the work of the agency?  I am interested to know why it was found necessary to insert this in the section.  I am still not happy that it has been adequately justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Robinson in that regard.  It was against the background of the observations which I was going to make on subsection 5 and I asked the Minister for the earlier quotations.  I gave the Opposition an opportunity of expressing their views.  Senator Robinson said that it appeared to her that it was a very extraordinary power to give to the Minister. She said she could understand why no Minister liked to establish something which might in due course be a stick to beat over his head or his successor's head. I think I can understand that.  At the same time it would appear that the Minister here today has not told us sufficient to indicate that the agency will be free to do these things, will be free to issue reports which are against Government policy, if you like.  There would be a natural temptation over a period of years to limit the authority or the work of the agency by the threatened use of the powers contained in subsection (5) rather than the actual use of the power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the way things work in State-sponsored organisations and bodies like this agency.  Very often there will be a departmental representative and the departmental representative will convey to the members of the board, members of the agency, from time to time the departmental view on the matter.  That is a good thing.  When that departmental view is backed up by the suggestion that, after all, the agency has under subsection (5) of section 1 to conform with the directions of the Minister which can be given if necessary, I feel that the independence of the agency is seriously questioned.  I questioned the Minister earlier with regard to the powers of the agency and the output of the agency and referred to the Economic and Social Research <Col N="473" /> Institute.  I am quite sure that the ESRI's independent reports are not subject to the same qualification.  I am quite sure that the Minister cannot ask the Economic and Social Research Institute to comply with and give directions to comply with the wishes of the Minister. In those circumstances, I think the point which has been raised is a very valid point.  It is contrary to the very open and whole support which the Minister has already given to the idea of independent reports even where these independent reports are contrary to Government policy, and for that reason I wonder would the Minister consider looking at subsection (5) before Report Stage.  I think it would be very handy if he did that.  It would be very appropriate if he did that.  I would like to recommend that first action to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that subsection (5) is a standard provision and it is included to enable the Minister for Social Welfare, as the Minister responsible to the Government for the agency's action, to give specific directions to the agency with regard to the performance of its function.  It is considered that the responsible Minister needs some power of this nature to meet particular situations which may arise.  It refers to the performance of the agency's functions only and does not extend to the functions themselves.  These functions are set out in the Act to guarantee ample independence and scope for innovation to the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us some information when he says it is a standard provision.  Perhaps he would indicate what other statutory agencies or State-sponsored bodies it applies to as a standard provision.  Secondly, perhaps the Minister would further clarify what type of direction in the performance of its functions the Minister might envisage giving to the agency, perhaps taking an example under (a), (b), (c) or (e) of the section, as to what type of direction on the performance of the function would be envisaged.  At the moment it does <Col N="474" /> seem to be very broadly framed, and I would echo a point that Senator O'Leary made.  Indeed, I referred to it myself on Second Stage.  This combat poverty agency is only going to be successful if, in fact, it does create quite a considerable stir in the establishment, to put it that way.  If it does, in fact, have the capacity to show the changes in policy that will be necessary and identify these and have the independence to make specific proposals in the area without being hampered or curtailed or without being, in effect, directed in the performance of the function in such a way as to prevent it from discharging that type of function, it will not be able to adequately discharge the statutory role and functions which we are giving it in this section and which, I think, the House very much approves of.  I am not entirely or even sufficiently reassured by what the Minister has said.  I would like a further explanation, and he might take up the suggestion of Senator O'Leary and have a look at this provision on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision we are discussing here in subsection (5) of section 4 is a standard one.  It is in the National Community Development Bill and also in the National Social Services Board Bill.  The Minister will not have any power to change the functions that are contained in subsection (1) once the Bill is passed.  They can only be changed by amending the legislation.  I would like to assure the House that there is nothing sinister in this subsection.  The principle reason why it is there is not to limit or to put any kind of harness on the agency but to help the agency rather than to hinder it.  That is the purpose for which we envisage that section being used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only speak for myself, but I can assure the Minister I do not think there is anything sinister about subsection (5).  It is not a question of it being sinister, but we propose to improve the Bill and to try to make sure that this agency will get the best possible start. This agency and this type of approach has had a chequered enough history between <Col N="475" /> various changes of Government and it appears, from listening to the contributions from both sides of the House, that there is a general welcome for the Bill and for the activities of the organisation. We all consider it on Committee Stage from a positive point of view.  We are trying to improve it a little but so as to give it greater independence.  I understand what the Minister says about not being able to change the functions of the agency.  That is quite true.  The Minister will not be able to eliminate the functions which are outlined in subsection (1) (a), (b), (c) or (d) or all the functions that are outlined in subsection (2).  It will enable the Minister to do other things.  I want to give the Minister an example of the power he or his successor would have under that legislation.  If the Combat Poverty Agency prepared a report and submitted that report out of courtesy to the Minister prior to its publication &mdash; I am not talking about the annual report, I am talking about an ordinary report, a report on some aspect of poverty and which it intends for the general public &mdash; or because the Minister will have some representative on the agency it would come to the attention of the Minister. Under subsection (5) the Minister would be in a position to order the agency not to publish that report.  That is not changing the function of the agency.  It does fall within the definition of directing the agency in the performance of its functions. In other words, the Minister could issue a direction to the agency not to publish that report.  The danger is that the agency might in time become a powerless extension of the Department of Social Welfare.  In that regard the very real powers contained in subsection (5) should be looked at.  I would have no objection to the Minister issuing directions to the agency from time to time to do or even not to do certain things.  They could be more precisely defined, and in the event of them not being more precisely defined any directions given by the Minister should be of a public nature. That would be quite sufficient.  It might not be quite sufficient but it would be <Col N="476" /> better than what is envisaged under sub-section (5).</P>
      <P>If, under the example I gave, the Minister decided that it was not in the public interest to publish a particular report he should be willing to place on record the fact that he had issued a direction to the agency and that direction would itself be the subject of public scrutiny.  In all circumstances the power contained in subsection (5), which I accept is just put in as a routine matter, is however, because of the essential conflict which must exist between the Government and the agency, and there must be conflict between the two bodies if the Combat Poverty Agency is to be any good at all, not routine in the context of this Bill.  For that reason I ask the Minister to look again at the question of subsection (5) and to give further consideration to it before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>May I make one further comment arising from the Minister's reply to the comments which we have made on subsection (5)?  The Minister said it is not intended to limit in any way or to put a harness on the activity of the agency.  It is meant to be helpful.  It would appear that the Minister has more than adequate opportunity and power under this Bill to be helpful in that sense.  Under an earlier subsection of this section the Minister can modify, withdraw or confer additional functions on the agency.  The Minister can increase the scope of the functions of the agency under subsection (3) of section 4.  Equally under section 5, the agency is required to prepare strategic plans and to review these plans and the Minister has a very significant role in relation to that as the Minister has a role in relation to the appointment of members to the agency.  It is very difficult to see how this power is needed in a specific way other than potentially to hamper and curtail the agency and deprive it of the necessary status it should have as an independent agency in this area.  That is particularly in view of the functions given to this agency and the importance of those functions.  If the matter was put in as a routine subsection <Col N="477" /> it is not appropriate to this particular agency.  I urge the Minister to look at it and, if it has only been included as a routine matter, to examine the implications of it and hopefully to withdraw it entirely or, at the very least, to provide that any exercise of his power to issue directions will be something which will be made public.</P>

      <P>I am a little puzzled about the functions of the Combat Poverty Agency Bill.  For example, subsection (d) refers to the promotion of greater public understanding of the nature, cause and extent of poverty.  It would seem to me that if the causes happen to be the nature of the society, if somebody decides that the reason poverty exists is because there is inequality in all the structures of society, should the Combat Poverty Agency make a recommendation that we change the system of society, that we go on to some other sort of order, say a Socialist order in our society rather than a private enterprise society?  If the causes happen to be the system then the right thing to do is to recommend a change in the system.  We all know that that is not going to happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have decided to set up the agency.  The Minister for Health and Social Welfare is the person responsible to the Government for the agency's actions.  He would also have the function of giving specific directions to the agency with regard to the performance of its functions.  Again, in similar legislation it is a standard provision. It was felt, from experience, that Government direction would be helpful. As I said previously, it is not envisaged that that function would interfere with the independence and scope of the agency.  It is felt that there is sufficient independence guaranteed, particularly in subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point raised by Senator O'Leary, in section 4 (2) (g) they have the function of the publication of an annual report and such other reports as the Agency may from time to time consider appropriate.  It is not envisaged that the <Col N="478" /> power of the Minister would be used to stop the publication of such a report.  In reply to Senator Harte, the agency will be free to advise and make recommendations to the Minister on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I appreciate the Minister's point and we all appreciate with regard to power that it is not the intention of the Minister to use it, but we are legislating for the future, for other Ministers of this persuasion and other persuasions.  We must constantly bear in mind that fact.  The Minister has the ultimate power to dismiss this agency if he so desires and that is right.  I am in favour of that.  I do not want the State to establish something which has an existence over and above the State.  That is the kind of power the Minister should have, the power to actually fire the agency if he is not satisfied with it, because by doing so he will have to justify himself in public. That power is contained in section 7 (5) which provides that any member, and all members I am sure, can be removed if it appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance of the agency.  That is the ultimate weapon the Minister has and I support that, but the Minister is cloaking himself with an additional power which can only be used to stifle the agency and the agency's independence. I want to say to the Minister, as I said before, that it is my experience of State enterprises that the influence of representatives of the Minister is disproportionate to their numbers.  That influence will be even stronger in the event of their having the power or suggesting that the Minister is considering in any particular case utilising the power contained in subsection (5).  I appeal to the Minister to give further consideration to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be kept in mind that the responsibility for the elimination of poverty will rest with the Government and with a particular Minister.  It is not envisaged that the setting up of this agency will mean that whenever questions <Col N="479" /> of poverty are raised in the future Ministers will answer them by simply saying that they have no further function in the matter and that it is a matter for the Combat Poverty Agency, that they have done this great thing of setting up the agency and therefore it is the job and the responsibility of the agency and that Ministers no longer have to provide the answers.  For that reason the Government and particularly the Minister who is answerable to the Government in that direction must hold this power, to be able to expand the work of the agency.  Ultimately the Government are responsible to see that the work is done.  That is why this responsibility in subsection (5) is still placed on the Minister.  It is necessary.  It is not to limit the agency, because it is in the Government's interest, no matter what Government are in power, that this agency succeeds.  No Government Minister will use the power in this to hamper or hinder the work of the agency.  That would not be a motive of any Government Minister or any Government at any time.  It would be a pity if a Minister for Health and Social Welfare at any given time felt that the agency could do more or could expand their role and that Minister had not the power to direct them to do that.  In view of this ultimate responsibility we should leave that subsection there because the Minister should be free to give directions from time to time to the agency.  It is only natural to assume that these directions, if they have to be given, will be the ones of help and assistance directed at an expansion of the work rather than a hindrance of it.  The ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the agency must be carried by the Government and the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether we can pursue this much further at this stage.  It may be something we will have to come back to on Report Stage.  I am still waiting for a convincing explanation of how this power would be exercised. The Minister talks about the need for the Minister under the Act to be able to expand the functions of the agency. <Col N="480" /> That is under a different subsection, sub-section (3).  We approve of that and there is no problem about it.  The Minister can review strategic plans, he appoints the members of the agency, but it is giving a direction on the performance of the functions of this particular agency that worries us.  It worries us because this agency &mdash; Senator Harte pointed this out &mdash; is going to be delving very deeply into our society.  It is going to be looking at the causes and the structures of our society in so far as they perpetuate poverty, and if a Minister politically disagrees with the approach of the agency and starts giving directions about the performance of the functions then the agency is gone down the Swannee.  That is the problem.</P>
      <P>What can the agency do if the Minister directs that they stop this approach and carry on in a different way in discharging their functions, that he does not want to hear any more talk about examining structures of our society, let them go and do some research of a university nature? I am not saying any particular Minister in office at the moment would do that.  I am not even pointing the finger at any particular administration.  What I am saying is that we are legislating for the future, we are legislating to establish an agency to combat poverty.  As was said by a number of Members of this House on Second Stage, combatting poverty in our society means radically altering the basis of our society because of the kinds of structures we have which perpetuate poverty in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much agree with the Minister when he says that establishing an agency is not of itself going to combat poverty. It is the kind of policies which are going to emerge, it is the attitude of the Government towards those policies, that is going to be crucial.  The Minister has taken a very benign view and says that this power will only be used to encourage the agency, to support it, to enlarge on its role.  That might be, but we have no guarantee.  Indeed given the subject matter I would venture to suggest it is more likely that the power will be used in the future by a Minister to direct the agency away from an approach which <Col N="481" /> might, in fact, threaten the establishment, which might, in fact, cause waves, which might, in fact, require radical policy changes and approaches.  I am not sure whether we can pursue this any further at this stage, but I certainly have not as yet had any convincing example or convincing explanation from the Minister as to why this power, which the Minister has said is a routine type of control by the Minister, is introduced in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to agree with what other Senators have said but also to point out that this kind of direction power by the Minister may not, in fact, be exercised in an overt and very public kind of way but it is quite usual in agencies of this type, under Departments, that at least one member of the agency is a civil servant out of the Minister's Department.  While the Minister may not overtly or directly say: &ldquo;I am directing the agency not to do this or not to do that&rdquo;, when he is represented on the agency by someone from his Department one can get into the situation where suggestions coming up, say, at a meeting of the agency, will be discouraged by the Department person saying: &ldquo;Well, you know, if we get ourselves into that kind of area we may find that the Minister might not like it and a direction could be issued&rdquo; and so on.  It does not necessarily have to be an actual overt direction or overt interference but the kind of atmosphere that is thrown over the work of an agency like this by the fact that in the background there is a subsection like this and that warning noises can be made from time to time.  Like Senator Robinson, I have not yet heard any convincing explanation as to why this particular power is needed in addition to the other powers mentioned by Senator O'Leary and Senator Robinson that give the Government ultimate control over the agency.  By and large agencies of this sort should be free to work in as open and as free an atmosphere as possible, and this kind of envisaging of directions from the Minister from time to time seems to be putting an additional and unnecessary <Col N="482" /> and rather dangerous shackle on the activities of the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister is very concerned about this because I have known him for quite a while now and I know where his particular concern would go.  It is only right that we deal with the question of the function of the agency well because there is a lot involved here. Poverty assails the dignity of the individual and it does not stop there.  We are talking about something that is a social condition which involves the individual's relationship to the whole community and to its structures, to its institutions, its need, its lack of opportunity, its helplessness to cope with hostile or uncaring, exploitive situations or institutions. Overall it is a lack of dignity and above all it is the vulnerability to injustice of the individual that has to relate to the social conditions that I refer to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to understand this in the sense that any Combat Poverty Agency will have to be very, very penetrating.  As Senator Robinson pointed out, if there is too much interference and if there is not enough put on the record today about the problems of this section then for political reasons, no matter which Government are in power, there is a chance that the actual purpose of the agency can he hampered to a very large extent.  The poverty report which we got in Ireland some years ago said that the existence and extent of inequality in Irish society is evidenced by the available data on such matters as the distribution of wealth and incomes, regional imbalances, educational and housing problems and rural underdevelopment. The report then went on to say that 24 per cent of the entire population were on the poverty line and that no less than 21 per cent of these were children under the age of 14.  On those points I would like to stress how deep poverty goes, how extensive it is and how investigative the Combat Poverty Agency will have to be and how much freedom they will need to do that investigation, and if there is too much constraint put on them by the powers of the Minister, who may get himself into a <Col N="483" /> political situation where he has to take a certain course of action, then the whole purpose of setting up the Combat Poverty Agency can, in fact, be very badly hampered. This is my major concern on the Bill.  I can live with the rest of it but I have difficulty with this particular section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing further to add to what I said about the section.  I am amazed at all the points made in relation to that subsection.  It might come to the notice of the Government that some area of poverty or deprivation should be looked at and under this subsection the Minister could give a direction to the agency to examine and report on that particular area.  I am sure we have not yet seen all the forms that poverty can take and will take in the future.  It is necessary to enable the Government of the day to look at these new areas that will undoubtedly come to light as time goes on.  As Senator O'Leary said I hope the legislation will be there for a long time.  Again I would ask the House to agree to that subsection as there is absolutely nothing unusual in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again urge the Minister to consider the possibility or I would be prepared to consider the possibility of an amendment for Report Stage which might allay some of the fears which we have in relation to this very general power in the subsection.  For example, I suggest the direction referred to be made a more formal direction so that it does not have the potential informal impact that Senator McGuinness was talking about, a sort of cramping of the scope of the agency in relation to a wide area of performance of its activities by a sort of threat that there might be a direction from the Minister.  Secondly, the direction made in that more formal sense by any Minister should be published &mdash; this could be done by a requirement that any directions made by the Minister to the agency would be published in the annual report of the agency at the end of the given year &mdash; or some provision of that kind to ensure that the power in so far as <Col N="484" /> it would be exercised, would be exercised in the manner which the Minister feels confident would be the way in which it would be exercised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 deals with the plans and review of the agency.  Assuming that this particular agency will be formed within the next two or three months and that it will take two-and-a-half years to prepare a plan, which seems to me to be an unusually long time &mdash; I shall not say this is a waste of time, I know that a certain amount of work will have to be done &mdash; in the meantime the problem of poverty will be with us and we will not be tackling it as envisaged.  Having regard to the fact that the EC Council of Ministers met last December, have their programme prepared and are willing to contribute to 50 per cent of whatever programmes are available, the loss of money in that way, as a result of a two-year delay, seems to be far too long.  I wonder if the Minister would comment on that and perhaps bring some hope by suggesting December 1986 rather than December 1987.  The fact that 25 million ECUs have been provided by the EC is something we cannot overlook and should be looking for as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I would hope, rather than have reviews, plans or records prepared, with all the work of voluntary organisations and health boards throughout the country that we should be able to come up with a plan much sooner than December 1987. Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, on section 5, I welcome the fact that the agency will be required to prepare strategic plans. This is a good step and desirable in the particular context but I am not entirely satisfied with the structure as envisaged in section 5.  It requires the agency, within quite strict time limits, to prepare strategic plans and submit them both to the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance for their approval, a programme outlining the agency's suggested activities.</P>
      <P>There is no requirement on either Minister to approve the plan within any specified time and there is no procedure for doing so.  I would be gravely worried that it could become a serious problem for the agency if it were to prepare a strategic plan, submit it for the approval of two different Ministers with no indication of what the time scale would be in which the plan would be approved.  This could seriously hamper the work of the agency. Does the section require that there be approval before the plan is implemented or is it just simply the submission for approval which allows the agency or prevents it from putting into practice the kind of strategies that are envisaged?  It is not clear to me as to how that will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I could come to the time limits of the first strategic plan contained in subsection (2), again it is necessary to be clear on precisely what that subsection means.  As I understand it, the strategic plan is to be drawn up by the agency.  It will be a plan in respect of a period which will end on 31 December 1987.  I would assume that section was drafted in the hope and expectation that it would be a period of at least two years, commencing on 31 December 1985 to 31 December 1987.  It would envisage the agency itself being established &mdash; hopefully this side of the summer &mdash; and having between then and 31 December to finalise, presumably with approval, the strategic plan for the first two years.  I would like the Minister to say if this is the correct interpretation and whether he is confident that the agency will be established on the operative date <Col N="486" /> and soon enough to enable it to prepare a plan within that time.</P>
    <P>What the plan envisages is the projected activities of the agency over a period.  One has to be clear on the plan before one can implement the projected activities in that plan.  It is of vital importance that, by the end of 1985, at the latest, the first plan, which is for the period ending two years later, would be fully approved and, in effect, in a position to be implemented by the agency.</P>

      <P>This section obliges the agency to draw up a strategic plan every three years, the first within six months of its establishment. This provision is necessary both to ensure that a coherent programme is devised against poverty and to provide a yardstick for testing its results.  The section also gives the Minister power to review the agency in all its aspects in the light of experience.  The report of such review is to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  This provision is in keeping with the Government decision of July 1983 requiring commercial State enterprises to produce corporate plans and a further Government decision of March 1985 requiring the major non-commercial State agencies to produce programmes setting out future activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the section is to ensure that a coherent programme is devised by the agency, and, as I have stated, to provide a yardstick for testing its results. Pending approval of the agency's strategy plans, the agency will, of course, continue with the performance of its functions under the Act and will not be left in a limbo, so to speak.  The approval of the strategic plan is not a pre-requisite for the carrying out of the functions outlined in section 4.  It is essential that the Minister and the Minister for Finance approve the strategic plan because of the <Col N="488" /> possible financial implications.  It will be in the interests of the agency that it has a strategic plan approved as it will give it the assurance that it can continue in the knowledge that it has received approval from the responsible Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome further clarification from the Minister as to the timescale within which the Minister will exercise the functions which he has under this section.  Under subsection (3) there is provision that the Minister shall, from time to time, review the purposes, functions and activities of the agency. This does not give any clear indication of whether there will be a regular review or when the first review, for example, might emerge.  Is there any reason why there should not be a specific provision that when the first strategic plan is drawn up by the agency, which would be submitted not later than six months after the date of the first meeting &mdash; hopefully, by the end of 1985 &mdash; there should not be a review produced by the Minister of that plan, within, say, six months of when it is submitted to him?</P>
      <P>I am worried that the way section 5 is drafted may hamper the work of the agency.  The agency may comply with the requirements for it to submit to the two Ministers &mdash; the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance &mdash; the proposed strategic plan for the first two years: it may do so on the timescale given it, that is within six months of its first meeting, and then the whole thing may go into limbo.  What is the agency to do, once it has submitted the plan to the two Ministers?  Are the Ministers required to respond within a particular time?  Otherwise, how does the agency know whether it can then get to the stage of implementation?</P>

The agency will, however, be able to continue to perform its functions within the limits of the <Col N="489" /> financial provisions made for it under section 9, as subsection (3) (a) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall, from time to time, review the purposes, functions and activities of the agency under this Act, in particular by reference to the strategic plan and shall cause, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, a report of such review to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered my question.  This is an important question because it relates to the capacity of the agency to function.  Under subsection (2) the agency has clear obligations to draw up a strategic plan, to do so within six months of the first meeting of the agency and to do so for a period ending on 31 December 1987 &mdash; hopefully, it would be for a two year period, say December 1985 to December 1987. This is fine, but the agency must then submit the plan for the approval of the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare under subsection (1) &mdash; submit a programme outlining the agency's projected activities: this is what is meant by the strategic plan.  If the plan is not approved, or if there is a delay in approving it, what can the agency do?  What steps can the agency take in relation to implementation of the plan, or is there not a real danger, as the section is framed, that the work of the agency could be brought to a halt or placed in limbo, whilst awaiting an approval for which there is no timescale or provision made?</P>

Perhaps I might preface my contribution by saying a word or two about the fuel schemes as a whole because part of the problem &mdash; and I know well that the Minister is aware and conscious of this problem and indeed is well disposed towards trying to solve it &mdash; is that there are two fuel schemes in operation and that there are various anomalies arising under both of them. Mrs. McGuinness</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original fuel scheme was what is known as the urban fuel scheme and it operates, as I am sure many Senators know from their own local knowledge, in some 17 cities and towns throughout the country.  This scheme was originally introduced in 1942 during the Emergency so as to ensure a supply of fuel for urban <Col N="491" /> dwellers who were not living in areas where turf was readily produced.  Those of us who can remember the Emergency will remember that turf was the only fuel readily available at the time.  Basically, this urban fuel scheme has been in operation ever since.  It applied to non-contributory, old age and blind pensioners, to both contributory and non-contributory widow pensioners and to unemployment assistance recipients with a dependant but not to those without dependants.  To begin with, the scheme involved collecting the turf, but at present it is done by means of the issuing of weekly vouchers to those who qualify for it.  This scheme gave rise to considerable anomalies, particularly because it was introduced at a time when the towns involved may have been small. There has been a great deal of urban spread since then.  You get the sort of anomaly that, for instance, Galway is not included presumably because it was thought in 1942 to be closely in touch with turf-producing areas and therefore the scheme was not needed.  Now when Galway is much more of a city it seems strange that it should be left out.  Outer Dublin areas like Tallaght and Clondalkin, which are quite definitely areas of urban population but which did not belong to the area when the scheme was originally introduced, are therefore excluded.  This kind of anomaly arose. Partly on account of that and partly because it was necessary to have a more nationally based scheme, there is in addition the national fuel scheme.  It is to the national fuel scheme that these present regulations refer.</P>
    <P>The national fuel scheme is administered by health boards.  It is administered as part of the supplementary welfare scheme and generally it is for persons who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  It has been, certainly in the past, the practice to give this to people who are depending on what are called long term social welfare or health board payments.  There is, as in most of these things, a means test but up to recently at any rate, one of the <Col N="492" /> anomalies of this scheme was that recipients of what are called short term social welfare payments, that is payments like unemployment and disability benefits or unemployment assistance were excluded from the scheme so that if you were an unemployment assistance person and if you lived in an urban area and had dependants you benefited under the urban free fuel scheme, but if you lived outside an urban area you could not get it or if you lived inside an urban area and had no dependants you could not get it.</P>
    <P>Apart from anything else one must ask oneself what are long term and what are short term welfare benefits in this day and age.  There are quite a number of people on unemployment assistance who could be very well forgiven for thinking this is, in fact, a long term position.  Apart from that, the difficulty that I see in the present regulations is that these regulations are made under section 209 of the Social Welfare Act and the criterion under that section is not a criterion of what type of social welfare benefits you have, but a criterion of need.  The section itself refers to the possibility of adding to the ordinary weekly amount of supplementary welfare allowance.  It states that under subsection (1) where the weekly amount of supplementary welfare allowance, if any, payable to a person pursuant to section 207 and any other income, including any payment under the Act or under any other statute, of that person, is not sufficient to meet his needs, then&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in any case where that person is in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance, the weekly amount of such allowance payable to that person may, subject to this section, be increased, or</P>
    <P>(b)  in any other case, a weekly payment of supplementary welfare allowance may be made, subject to this section, to supplement that person's other income.</P>
    <P>In subsection (2) it goes on to state that the Minister may prescribe the circumstances under which a payment may be made, the amounts of the payment for particular classes of persons, and so on. <Col N="493" /> It also provides for the possibility of allowances in kind as opposed to allowances in money, but the main thing as far as I am concerned is that the criterion set down in section 209 is that where a person's weekly income is not sufficient to meet his needs that is the basis on which any interpretation of this section should be founded.  Up to fairly recently the national fuel scheme was administered under a departmental circular. This circular actually confined the scheme to long term social welfare recipients. Specifically, the circular excluded people in receipt of what were called short term benefits, that is, as I have said, disability benefits, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, and so on.  On account of the regulations in this circular, persons who might be very much in need and, indeed, who might have been in greater need than some people on long term benefits and certainly might have been more in need than, say, some of those in receipt of the non-contributory widow's pension &mdash; people who benefit under the urban scheme &mdash; were refused any benefit under the national fuel scheme.  They were refused the benefit straight away without any consideration of their means simply on the grounds that they were short term social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>On account of this, one of these people who had been refused any help under the national fuel scheme took a High Court action to establish whether this exclusion was lawful or not lawful.  She, in fact, succeeded in her action.  The judgment in the High Court was given on 12 November 1984 by Mr. Justice Finlay who is now the Chief Justice but was then the President of the High Court.  Having considered all the sections of the Act, the circular, the various schemes and so on he came to a conclusion that having regard to these statutory provisions he was satisfied that the position of the prosecutrix &mdash; this was the lady who brought the case &mdash; at the time of her application for supplementary welfare allowance for heating needs was that she was a person who if she could establish that her means were insufficient to meet her needs and <Col N="494" /> the needs of any child dependent on her had the statutory right under section 209 of the Act of 1981 to supplementary welfare allowance and that that right was governed by section 209 of the Act of 1981 with which must be incorporated Statutory Instrument No. 168 of 1977.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Finlay then went on to describe the functions of the Minister with regard to section 209 and felt that the Minister was correctly exercising his functions under Statutory Instrument 168 of 1977 and that in so far as the circular issued on his behalf on 22 June 1983 &mdash; this is the circular I am referring to &mdash; formed advice and guidance to health boards carrying out the national scheme it was clearly a proper and valid administrative act.  However, Mr. Justice Finlay went on on the following page of the judgment to say:</P>
    <P>In so far as the circular purports to exclude absolutely from the discretion of the deciding officer whether on the initial application or on appeal concerned with applications for supplementary social welfare allowances the discretion to grant such an allowance to a person in receipt of unemployment or disability benefit or unemployment assistance, it seems to me to be <i>ultra vires</i> the Minister.  It was not contended on behalf of the respondent nor does it seem to me that it could be contended that the issuing of this circular could possibly be an exercise by the Minister of his power to prescribe matters in relation to social welfare supplementary allowances which is now contained in Section 209, subparagraphs (2) and (3) of the Act of 1981.  I am quite satisfied on the very full and candid affidavit filed by Mr. Donoghue on behalf of the respondents that neither he deciding to appeal it with his function nor the officer deciding the initial application, considered the general question as to whether the prosecutrix's means were insufficient to meet her needs and the needs of her dependant child but rather that their decision was solely based on their understanding that they were <Col N="495" /> excluded by the terms of the circular of 22 June 1983 from granting her a supplementary welfare allowance once they were satisfied that she was in receipt of unemployment benefit.  For these reasons I am satisfied that a valid decision has not been reached on her application either initially or on appeal and that the two orders by way of decision must be quashed and the cause shown disallowed.</P>
    <P>To sum up the meaning of this, it is simply that the then President of the High Court judged that the criterion under section 209 was &ldquo;need&rdquo;, and that in purporting to exclude certain classes of person without any consideration of their needs the circular was <i>ultra vires</i> the Minister. That remained the position for a few months.  On 18 February 1985 Statutory Instrument 49 of 1985 was issued. This was putting into the form of a Statutory Instrument the regulations which covered the national fuel scheme without changing them in any way.  I am quite prepared to admit that it did not worsen the situation.  I am quite prepared to admit that it did not change anything and that what it did was to keep things going on the same level as they had been before.  It does not state, in terms, that the people on short term benefit are excluded.  By the way in which it is drafted it excludes them.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 2 of the Statutory Instrument it defines the Act as being the Social Welfare Act of 1981.  It defines the fuel allowance as being an increase of supplementary welfare allowance under section 209 (1) (a) of the Act, or a supplementary welfare allowance under section 209 (1) (b) of the Act for the heating needs of a person.  It then goes on, in paragraph 3, to amend the original Statutory Instrument by the addition of sub-articles such as No. 7 where it states that a fuel allowance may be paid for the period of 30 weeks beginning on the first Monday in October of each year to a person where he is in receipt of any one of the following payments, and it lists old age pension, blind pension, and so on. <Col N="496" /> Subsection (b) provides that such person should be living alone or with no person other than a dependent spouse or a dependent child or children, or with a person or persons who would otherwise be qualified for fuel allowance, or a person who resides with him for the purpose of providing constant care and attention when he is considered by the health board to be so incapacitated as to require such care and attention, or where he is considered by the health board to be unable to provide for his heating needs. In other words, by listing out the people who are eligible it, by implication, excludes the same people again.</P>
    <P>I feel that this Statutory Instrument, while it may be argued that by putting the matter in the form of a Statutory Instrument rather than in the form of a circular the Minister is acting more legally than he was by putting out a circular, is a very poor way of getting out of the situation.  This Statutory Instrument is not in the spirit or the letter of section 209 any more than the previous circular was.  It still avoids the basic criterion of need, which is the criterion which is set out in the section.  It still excludes people on short term social welfare payment, simply because they are in receipt of these, without considering whether they may be or may not be in more need than some of the classes of persons who are allowed to have free fuel.</P>
    <P>The reissue of the circular in the form of a Statutory Instrument is simply a way of perpetuating a scheme which was inherently unjust, inherently unfair, not in the spirit of section 209 and certainly not in the spirit of Mr. Justice Finlay's judgment in the High Court action.  I am sorry that the Minister should have seen fit to do this.  I appreciate that the Minister has his difficulties in administering this scheme.  I am grateful to the Minister in that he has made himself available to deal with this matter in a very rapid time since we put down the motion on the Order Paper and that he has, indeed, been most helpful both to Senator Robinson and myself in discussing the background of the situation with us.</P>
    <P>I certainly accept that the Minister <Col N="497" /> would like to see a full-scale, thorough reform of the whole fuel scheme.  I would suggest to him that this is the course to take.  In the meantime, I would ask him to withdraw this particular Statutory Instrument.  At the moment we are coming to the very end of what is known as the heating season in free fuel terms. The free fuel scheme will be in abeyance during the summer months.  It will not be coming in again until the heating season in October of this year.  Now is the time over the summer period to have a look at the whole scheme and to try to introduce a genuinely national scheme which will bring in both the urban people and the people in the rest of the country together and which, indeed, could well be administered under section 209 in the way that the present scheme is through the health boards.  Very often they are the people who are administering all sorts of different social welfare aid and probably are the best people to do the work.</P>
    <P>Such a scheme should purport to exclude, in particular, people on unemployment assistance who may have been on unemployment assistance for years and who are only by courtesy, as it were, described as people on a short term social welfare payment.  Such a new scheme should rely completely on the criterion of need and should be administered in that way so that persons, regardless of their social welfare status who are in need of this free fuel help, should be able to get it. What the Minister has done by bringing in this Statutory Instrument is simply to introduce an artificial legal distinction between what he did by circular and what he is trying to do by Statutory Instrument. I still think that he is certainly outside the spirit and letter of section 209.  I would imagine it would still be open to legal challenge in bringing forward this Statutory Instrument.  I understand and appreciate the Minister's commitment to the need for change and reform in this particular area.  I would urge him now to withdraw this Statutory Instrument and to use the months of the summer to create a new scheme of the type I have outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion.  It has very important underlying principles. There are aspects of the history of these regulations which are worth focusing on. The position since 1980 when this fuel scheme was introduced has been governed by departmental circular.  That is worth pondering on in itself, because a circular issued by the Minister in this way is not published.  It is not known to anybody outside the addressee, the person to whom the circular is sent and the officials of the Department.  The existence of the particular circular which predated these regulations was not known, for example, to applicants for the fuel voucher.  They did not know that there was a circular saying that certain categories were not to be considered as being eligible to apply for a fuel voucher under the national fuel voucher scheme. Social workers did not know that this circular existed.  Lecturers in our universities on social welfare law did not know that this circular existed.  There is an important issue there about the way in which we regulate particularly in this area of access to social welfare benefits. We are talking about people with very real needs.  We are talking about their access to knowledge and information and the way in which they can know of their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not, in fact, until this High Court case and until the circular was produced in the course of it that its existence became known to a wide number of people who would regard themselves as being informed of the whole area of operation in social welfare.  As Senator McGuinness said, the intention, indeed the direct language of the circular, was to exclude from eligibility under the scheme three categories as expressly stated in the circular itself as persons on short term social welfare payments e.g. unemployment and disability benefits and unemployment assistance.  The circular had before that stated the categories of persons who would be eligible for inclusion.  These are the general categories of persons in receipt of pensions, benefits and allowances.  It is very difficult to try to understand the rationale behind <Col N="499" /> the exclusion because the categories who are eligible are, I think without exception, categories who are in receipt of a higher weekly benefit or allowance or pension than the three categories who would be excluded.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the three categories excluded by the circular as being ineligible and now excluded by these regulations, are three categories where the benefit or allowance is lower than any of the categories who are included as being eligible, such as old age non-contributory pension, old age contributory pension, retirement pension, widow's non-contributory pension, widow's contributory pension, blind pension, invalidity pension, deserted wife's benefit, deserted wife's allowance, and so on.</P>
    <P>The argument is not that these categories should be themselves excluded, but rather on what basis or what criterion could any fair and just society say these categories will be eligible although those on them are in receipt of a higher level of weekly benefit or allowance than the categories which we are saying are expressedly excluded from being considered. That is the first point.  The term is used in the circular that the categories excluded are persons on short term social welfare payments, but to use the term &ldquo;short term&rdquo; now in relation to unemployment assistance, or indeed, disability, is to have no regard to the reality of Irish life.</P>
    <P>We know that Ireland has a very high unemployment rate.  We know that there are the long term unemployed.  Indeed, in the social welfare code there is a category now, a long term unemployed, and therefore the words &ldquo;short term&rdquo; are completely deceptive.  It is completely contrary to the reality for the recipient and their families.  Many of the categories of persons are in receipt of long term allowances, unemployment assistance. The period of unemployment benefit for all but married women would be 390 days, and when we get round to amending the law on that it will be 390 days for married women also.  That is a substantial period.  It is at least one full winter, and the needs of such families could well be <Col N="500" /> that they would require to be considered for the benefit.</P>
    <P>As Senator McGuinness emphasised, it is difficult to understand the reasoning behind that circular and the previous circulars which excluded these three categories in view of the clear intention of the 1975 Act, as it was initially, and now the provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981.  Section 200 makes crystal clear the basis of a person's legal entitlement to be considered for supplementary welfare allowance.  The fuel vouchers scheme would be such an allowance.  Section 200 says:</P>
    <P>Every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant of his shall be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>On what basis could a Minister decide either by circular or by regulation that categories of persons are ineligible from having their needs considered and still comply with that requirement of the legislation that every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet the needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant of his shall be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance?</P>
    <P>It appears that the circular in so far as it excluded these three categories flew in the face of the clear language, not just the spirit, of the legislation.  In assessing the basis of need it would be much more understandable if the Minister said that anybody in receipt of an allowance or benefit under the social welfare code which gave that person a weekly income of above a certain amount would be ineligible. That could be on the basis that the State did not have enough money or that the budgetary provision was only so much and had to be divided on some sort of fair and just principle.  That is not what has happened.  It is not the categories at the top end who have been excluded once they get above a certain income.  In the case of a number of these benefits a person can also be earning income so the person could, in fact, be quite substantially well off in comparison to the other categories.  No, it is not at the upper <Col N="501" /> end of the scale that the cut-off is.  It is at the lower end of the scale.  It is the three categories on the lowest level of weekly benefit or allowance who are as categories deemed to be ineligible from consideration.</P>
    <P>That is the position under the terms of a circular which was not known and not publicised, and not a matter which social workers or lecturers in social welfare law or others were aware of.  That position was challenged successfully in court in the manner that Senator McGuinness has described.  The Senator referred to the judgment in the court.  What happens after that?  After that, within a very short period a step is taken to reintroduce the position which existed prior to the High Court decision.  This time the step taken is to do it by way of ministerial regulations.</P>
    <P>Again, when we think about that, regulations of this kind do not receive advance publicity.  The Minister does not have to come into the Seanad and say: &ldquo;This is what I propose to do for the following reason&rdquo;.  The regulations are made. Granted, once made they are published. They are accessible but it can take quite some time before even lawyers become aware that the Minister has made a statutory instrument.  That, in itself, is worth reflecting on.  A significant policy decision was taken without any debate in either House of the Oireachtas, although there had been considerable public discussion and debate about the outcome of the High Court decision, and the effect it had on access to the fuel voucher scheme for applicants based on their needs and the needs of their dependants.  The Minister in the regulations has, in effect, restored the position which obtained under the circular and has in the regulations excluded the three categories in question.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness in her remarks said, first of all, that she felt that the regulations were in conflict with the spirit of the legislation and she then remarked that in her view it was possible, indeed, that the regulations could be open themselves to legal challenge.  I would tend to share that view.  It is difficult <Col N="502" /> to see how the Minister could have the power, in effect, by way of statutory instrument to make an important policy decision in relation to access to the entitlements to supplementary welfare allowance which is governed by section 200 of the 1981 Act.  It is governed there on the basis of establishment of need and the present means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>Any exclusion from that, it would appear to me, should be in the primary legislation and is a matter of such fundamental policy and principle as not to be succeptible of being achieved by way of the exercise by the Minister of power to make a statutory instrument.  That is a legal point that is not appropriate to a debate of this kind which is really raising the values and the principles behind the step taken.  I think the worrying aspect of the matter is that, once again, it is those most in need on the basis of their weekly income by way of benefit or allowance who are excluded by the statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>As Senator McGuinness said, the Minister has both met Senator McGuinness and myself and also communicated with us by letter in which he has set out the background.  I am sure he will elaborate on this still further when he makes his contribution.  In the course of a letter of 10 May he concedes in effect.  I am going to quote one sentence from it.  He says:</P>
    <P>I quite accept that many of those now excluded from the scheme may be in greater need than some who are entitled to a fuel allowance including some who have automatic entitlement under the urban fuel scheme.</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to say that</P>
    <P>to extend the entitlement would cost money and that money is not available.</P>
    <P>I think there is a fundamental point of principle here.  If some who are excluded are in greater need, why are they excluded, how can we exclude them? How on the basis of principles of equality and justice can a fair society, a society which is seeking to remove the kind of barriers and the kind of poverty traps <Col N="503" /> which are all too prevalent in our society, possibly accept that and preside over it?</P>
    <P>It is not a matter of excluding categories in some equitable way.  It is a matter of including the categories most in need.  It is extremely important that the Minister does take to heart the points emphasised by Senator McGuinness.  We do have time now for the whole rationalisation of the fuel voucher schemes to be considered.  The fuel voucher schemes do not operate during the summer months.  The regulation prescribes the 30 weeks from 30 October, and, therefore, there will be time in which to examine the whole position and hopefully introduce a new statutory instrument before next October which deals with access to the fuel voucher schemes on the basis of means and in a just and fair manner which does not exclude in particular the three categories at present excluded who are most in need.  I support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion to have this regulation annulled.  I have always believed, quite apart from what has happened now, that a number of factors dealing with the free fuel scheme should be amended.  Certainly, I feel and always felt that the free fuel voucher was totally inadequate having regard nowadays in particular to the price of the bag of coal, briquettes and turf.  Certainly I think it can be said that there should be a massive increase in the free fuel voucher for people who are in receipt of that voucher.  In that area it can be said &mdash; and it has been said by previous speakers &mdash; that there has been a total discrimination against many, many people who are in receipt of other forms of social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, the previous speaker said &mdash; and I have a note taken of it too &mdash; that people who are on short term unemployment benefit, because of the massive unemployment, because the scene has changed so drastically, quite definitely many of these people will be long term unemployed, that their income will be far less than what people who are now qualifying for the free fuel voucher <Col N="504" /> receive.  Certainly I think there is a need for a change in this area.  I do support the view that, irrespective of what category of social welfare benefit one is receiving, the main criterion should be the need of that person and if his income is not sufficient to provide him with heating requirements then he should be given the free fuel vouchers.</P>
    <P>The judgment of the High Court some time ago was referred to.  As we know, it went against the Minister for Social Welfare and certainly there, again, one would not have to be a High Court judge to consider and make the point that need, and basic need, was the main criterion for such a judgment.  People nowadays because of the hardships they are finding are certainly troubled in regard to their heating requirements for the 30 week period during the winter months.  I would hope that the Minister would accept the spirit of the High Court judgment and irrespective of the type of social welfare benefit that they are receiving come along and offer a free fuel voucher to people who are very much in need.  That, as I said, should be the criterion.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that there are thousands and thousands of people who are recipients of social welfare benefit of whatever kind who are unable to provide for their heating requirements for the winter months.  I think for a Government who say they are a caring Government that should not be allowed to happen.  If a change is required a change should take place.  As I say, many, many people who are now excluded are in greater need than those who are getting the free fuel voucher. That situation is totally incorrect and unfair.  I support the view.  I hope that the Minister will accept it.  I know it will cost extra finance, but it is money for the weakest sections of our community. There are many, many people who just had not the money to buy coal, turf and so on on the coldest nights of the winter months of last year.  That should not be allowed to happen, and I would hope that the Minister would see fit to extend the social welfare beneficiaries to allow all who are in need irrespective of the type <Col N="505" /> of benefit they are receiving to benefit from the free fuel scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief, indeed.  I think we on both sides of the House would concur that there are quite a number of anomalies in the operation of the free fuel scheme.  Collectively, again we owe a debt of gratitude to the joint sponsors of this motion for highlighting such anomalies, and I am also confident, from what has been said by both Senator McGuinness and Senator Robinson as a result of their dialogue and correspondence with the Minister, that the Minister is receptive to their ideas and that in fact something positive will have to be done in order to eliminate such anomalies.  We all are aware of the importance of the scheme because there is no doubt whatever about it that it has contributed largely to reducing a certain degree of hardship in relation to basic heating requirements of people in need. If we are honest about it, apart from those anomalies which have recently been uncovered, the scheme has operated relatively well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a circular which was sent out by the Western Health Board prior, in fact, to the High Court decision.  It is quite clear from this circular, which incorporates an application form for the scheme, that in effect the particular categories in question will not be considered. It states who is eligible &mdash; persons who are unable to provide for their heating needs from their own resources.  Normally, these would be people who are receiving one of the payments listed below who have no other means.  I agree that &ldquo;normally&rdquo; does indicate a certain degree of flexibility or the possibility of the inclusion of others.  In addition, it says that applicants must be living alone or (a) with a dependent spouse and/or child or children, (b) with another person receiving one of the payments listed below, (c) with an incapacitated person, (d) with a person providing constant care and attention for the applicant.  Down through the list &mdash; blind pensions, disabled persons's maintenance allowances, deserted wife's benefit, deserted wife's <Col N="506" /> allowance &mdash; there is no mention whatever of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit to qualifiers.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge it has never been interpreted by community welfare officers that these people have had any entitlement.  I cannot fully accept that there was any misapprehension or any misconception as to the exact and specific categories of people who would qualify. I concur entirely that many of the people who do qualify, those people who are deemed to be long term beneficiaries of various schemes are in a far better financial position than those who are debarred. I agree that in the intervening period, because the scheme has now terminated for this year, the Minister should look seriously at the scheme to see if anything could be done to redress the imbalances and the anomalies.</P>
    <P>I, like everybody else, dislike categorisation. There is a danger in categorisation. That is, that you are excluding genuine hardship cases.  If the Minister at some stage could see his way to include in the scheme people on unemployment benefit or assistance, then he could rely on the judgment and the discretion of his community welfare officers and the community welfare officers of health boards to apply discretion in relation to determining who is or who is not in need. If there is one category of social welfare officer, community welfare officer or social assistant that I would like to praise, it is the community welfare officer who operates within and under the aegis and umbrella of the health boards.  These people have generally, where guidelines permitted them, used their discretion very admirably.  In the majority of cases very few people, if any, have gone in want or in need because of over rigid application of the guidelines.</P>
    <P>I would exhort the Minister that over the summer period in the interregnum between the termination of the existing scheme to the introduction of the new scheme he would have a serious look at the particular qualifications of people and the categories who are debarred.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Senators who are sponsoring this motion that rather <Col N="507" /> than ask the Minister to withdraw the statutory instruments in question they would consider not pressing this issue in order to afford the Minister the necessary time and to give him the necessary opportunity to look at the problem that has arisen.  I believe that there is need to have a thorough look at it, because you cannot simply open the floodgates and allow in all people who are on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance schemes.</P>
    <P>I am generally identified as being one of the stronger advocates of what is known as the small farmers' dole.  These people also come under the umbrella of unemployment assistance.  Nobody could seriously suggest that somebody who is eligible for small farmers' dole or unemployment assistance could seriously be considered &mdash; there are something like 13,000 of them &mdash; to be determined eligible for the free fuel allowance.  The vast majority of them have holdings, land and turbary rights and access to the supply of fuel for themselves.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of validity in what the sponsors of the motion are saying.  I believe that long, hard and thorough reappraisals should take place.  I would exhort the sponsors of the motion, to whom we are very grateful for highlighting the anomalies, rather than pursuing the matter vigorously in the House to the stage of a vote that in fact, they would consider withdrawing it in order to afford the Minister ample opportunity to reexamine the position before the November reintroduction of the new scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House. There is agreement on the time factor. The position is that there are three areas involved here.  There is the legal concern, the common concern and the reality.  As to the position with regard to the legal concern, I would agree with Senator Higgins. He could see the validity of both Senator McGuinness and Senator Robinson pursuing this.  Most of the public would look on it as a dangerous sort of means by which a Minister can get over <Col N="508" /> the law.  That is the way the bulk of the public would look at it.  Quite frankly, I do not think it was done in that spirit.  I would have a different view to that.  In the area of commonsense we have to look at it with regard to what we have been talking about earlier.  Everybody is concerned with the question of poverty and how to go about combating that poverty, the areas one would get into, which would include this type of area.  I am not suggesting for one minute that you can wait for this issue to be handled by the Combat Poverty Agency.  I am merely drawing the analogy between the problems we have been discussing and the type of contribution that has been made where concern has been shown.  For us to ask that the motion would not be pressed is not showing a lack of concern.  I am very concerned about it.  In the circumstances that the Minister was caught in and having regard to how the Minister when he was last supporting a Coalition Government behaved there is a clear evidence between 1973 and 1977 of all the improvements that were made in the social services and social welfare scheme. Very extensive improvements were made in that area.  One of the greatest advocates at that time was the present Minister for Social Welfare.  He would not have excluded the free fuel or the short time benefit people in that scheme.</P>
      <P>Again at this time there was some difficulty with regard to giving full recognition to the decision of the High Court. The Minister does appreciate the need for an enhanced access of the public to the benefits.  The Minister also has a recognition of the potential of beneficiaries to claim.  They are there to obtain their rights, to see that the implementation of those schemes through the social welfare code becomes reality, for example, programmes such as free fuel, travel etc.  The Minister has got a full awareness of the problem.  It is consistent with what we have all been talking about earlier, combating poverty. Therefore, it presents a sort of dilemma when it comes to the question of how to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is to leave the decision as <Col N="509" /> it was where it would cost approximately £7.5 million to meet the matter.  If we were to let it go immediately we would be dealing with 50,000 extra claimants.  It presents a problem.  But it is not a reason. I do not accept it as a reason for not extending it.  I accept it as a good reason for the Minister's dilemma in trying to get over it.  Therefore, he needs some time for further consideration so that he can look at the whole question of rationalisation, of regulating the whole concept of free fuel in the sense of the urban and rural dwellers.  Overall, having regard to the fact that he has met the mover of the motion, that he has expressed his concern about the social rights, it might be of more benefit to the House if the Minister could, in fact &mdash; he will be making a statement &mdash; give some strong indication that the matter will be gone into in much greater depth and that, as a consequence, we would not push the vote here tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be particularly concerned that in the event of this statutory instrument being annulled there would be no scheme at all.  This is the net effect of it.  We would have to revert to the supplementary welfare allowance of the health boards.  That scheme is extremely restrictive in terms of the payment of allowances for support, and I quote:</P>
      <P>It is only payable where a person is living alone or only with persons who are dependent on him for support and such person has, due to his ill-health, or infirmity...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effectively, if you annul the regulations or the statutory instrument today, there is no national fuel scheme.  We would have to start afresh and the only thing we could operate in terms of the past would be the restrictive supplementary welfare system.  There might be some confusion. I think Senator Robinson may have implied that the national fuel scheme provided for now derived from the Supplementary Welfare Allowances Act, 1975.  There was no national fuel scheme in existence then.  The scheme was introduced <Col N="510" /> in 1980 and it was then considered more appropriate that the scheme should be administered as part of the SWA scheme.  Therefore, if the regulations were annulled the question arises, do we have any fuel scheme at all?  We probably would not.</P>
    <P>There are considerable difficulties in this aspect.  If the regulations are annulled, there will be an automatic entitlement by another 50,000 people to have entry into the schemes.  The additional cost will be £7.5 million.  The cost has rocketed in recent years.  When we started off under the old Eastern Health Board scheme in 1979-80 we were talking about 15,000 people and a cost of about £1/2 million per year.  When the schemes were introduced in 1980-81 105,000 qualified. Today there are 158,000 people qualifying and the cost has gone up to £19 million from a £1/2 million in 1979-80 and from about £4 million in 1980-81.  It is now £19 million and if we are going to add on another £7½ million &mdash; that £19 million takes into account raising the voucher for July onwards &mdash; there will be an additional cost extra to the £2.5 million or £3 million because the value of the voucher will go up from £4 to £5.  The whole scheme would have to be recast within the limit of budgetary framework. Here I come to the point in which I concur very much with the two Senators who raised the issue.  The schemes are anomalous and quite discriminatory.  But why did my predecessors who examined the schemes refuse to grapple with them?</P>
    <P>It is a very serious problem whereby under the urban scheme, for example, one could have a widow with a contributory pension who could be at work, having a wage and work, and who could be simultaneously living at home with her family with a reasonable income.  She qualifies for the free fuel.  The person next door on long term unemployment or the person down the road in a country area does not have automatic entitlement. Equally, you can have a contributory pensioner or a non-contributory pensioner living at home with his family in relatively comfortable surroundings who automatically qualifies and the long <Col N="511" /> term unemployed person does not.</P>
    <P>I have been very strenuously examining the situation but there is no way that we can expand the schemes across the board to include the smallholders mentioned.  We cannot do it.  The cost would rocket up to about £35 million overnight.  There is a clear limit to the amount of public resources available.  I assure the Senators that I am examining the scheme.  I suggest that I should be given an opportunity of doing that.  There are a number of ways in which it can be done.  We can remove from automatic eligibility a number of persons.  All hell would break loose on that issue because 20,000 people would automatically lose if we were to go down that road.  There would be several motions in Seanad Éireann to restore total automatic entitlement.  Simultaneously, if we removed automatic entitlement to a large number of people and brought in, as I think we might well and should bring in, say the 40,000 long term unemployed into the scheme we could afford to do so at some small additional cost.</P>
    <P>I am not necessarily suggesting that it is the easiest way to do it, but one could shorten the period of the payment by, say, two weeks and bring in more people. There are a number of ways of doing it. In the budget this year we increased the value of the voucher from £4 to £5 and that was a 20 per cent increase in the value of the fuel voucher.  I am not in any way trying to do a circumflexion.  The High Court did not decide whether or not an applicant was entitled to a fuel voucher in that case.  The High Court did not decide that at all.  The only thing the High Court did was that it affirmed that any decision was a function of a health board and the decision referred only to the manner in which I, as Minister, exercise my powers in relation to the supplementary welfare allowances and how the health board arrived at their decision in the case in question.  It was only on that basis that the judge reached his opinion relating to excluding certain classes, the classes which have always been excluded under the scheme, since 1980.  I would <Col N="512" /> stress, the two schemes have run side by side.  It was crazy, with due respect to my predecessors, to allow two parallel, anomalous and quite different schemes to run side by side, a national scheme and an urban scheme.  My predecessors shirked and ran away from rationalisation because if they had taken it by the scruff of the neck and rationalised it unquestionably some people would lose automatic entitlement, others would be brought in and the cost would be contained in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to go ahead with the provision here.  I have left the conditions of the fuel scheme exactly as they were since 1980.  The statutory instrument does not rule out the reconsideration of the schemes as they stand at present.  I do not consider the schemes satisfactory as they stand.  I am having them reviewed. I had them before the Government a year or two ago and I withdrew the proposals I had with a view to coming forward with further proposals.  In August 1984 or thereabouts I indicated that I would have a further look at them during this year. In those proposals I suggested that we should spend more by raising the value of the fuel voucher from £4 to £5, and that was accepted.  I am now doing a review of the general question of eligibility. I ask our Senator colleagues to allow me the opportunity of doing that review because the current season is coming to an end.  The new season does not start until next October, and I will carry out the review dispassionately having regard to the available resources and I will submit appropriate proposals to the Government in due course.</P>
    <P>I would stress, however, that it is a scheme which is now running at well over £20 million a year from about £4 million in 1980-81 and it is a quite chaotic system. If you were to annul the regulations now you would provide automatic entitlement in the spirit of annulment to 50,000 extra persons at a cost of an additional £7½ million which I simply do not have in the framework of the budget provisions for 1985.  Equally you would introduce a system whereby we would have no <Col N="513" /> scheme because there would be no regulation in existence.  We then would have to re-frame the regulation.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to detain the House further, but I can assure both Senator McGuinness and Senator Robinson that I am quite prepared to discuss the prospects of a rationalised scheme with both of them in the months ahead in preparation for the next season.  I am quite prepared to consult with any other Senator on what should be one simple national scheme of fuel vouchers, widely known and above all delivered to the persons in need, with need being the actual requirement rather than status having automatic entitlement.  That would end a running administrative sore in the past five years whereby we are inundated with inquiries.  The administration is chaotic and the health boards are in great difficulty explaining many of the schemes to persons, and innumerable PQs and inquiries come in this regard.  I can assure the Senators that I was not circumventing a judicial finding.  I was restoring in a more legal framework the existing position which, as I have conceded here, is anomalous and is in need of very urgent reform.</P>

      <P>In reply to what the Minister has said, I would welcome his commitment to introducing a scheme where the criterion would be need and he should be given an opportunity to do so.  Therefore I would not wish to push the matter to a vote and accordingly would withdraw the motion with the consent of my seconder.  I am very glad to hear that this is the Minister's attitude to it, and we will look forward hopefully to discussing the matter with him in the coming months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the designation of 1985 as International Youth Year; welcomes it for highlighting <Col N="514" /> the needs and abilities of youth and commends the Government on their policy of facilitating the fullest possible development of our young people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to bring this motion on International Youth Year before the House.  The United Nations has designated 1985 as International Youth Year with its three themes of participation, development and peace. These offer suggestions for debate and development in planning for the future of our young people.  These three issues have never been more relevant to the needs of our nation and to our young people in particular.  Recent surveys have suggested a strong antipathy towards politicians among young people and perhaps a similar attitude to the political process itself.  This trend is indeed worrying, and we politicians must seriously analyse our own behaviour and actions. Our political behaviour should always be motivated towards the national interest and must never be for party advantage and worse still for personal self interest. If politicians fail to give the lead then we cannot blame young people if they feel disillusioned and opt out of involvement in society.</P>
    <P>On the theme of participation I would like to emphasise that young people must get every encouragement to involve themselves in their local communities, local youth clubs, sports organisations, local voluntary organisations, environmental and cultural groups.  Such involvement would present and foster an attitude of respect of the democratic process.  Furthermore the benefits in personal development are numerous.</P>
    <P>Participation in education and training must be increased, particularly for those who are disadvantaged.  Research has shown that the length of time spent in the education system is positively related to employment.  The range of training offered by AnCO, CERT, ACOT, the National Manpower Service, the Department of Labour and the Youth Employment Agency is very extensive. Approximately 15,400 people participated <Col N="515" /> in such schemes in 1984. However, we must look for increased participation in these services and this may mean a change in the format of the services and in the type of education and training being provided.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to participation in leisure activities and the powerful influence such involvement can have for many young people.  I am concerned that many young people may shy away from competitive sports for a number of reasons. However, I feel that competitive outdoor pursuits have a strong influence on young people, and as a contribution to International Youth Year I will continue to urge the development of outdoor pursuit centres.  It has been found that about 68 per cent of young people participate regularly in outdoor activities.  These tend to be male, teenaged, single and at school.  In such centres young people and adults have scope for enjoyment and relaxation and will get a deep appreciation of the environment.  For example, recently young people from Tarbert Comprehensive School, County Kerry, where I was a member of the teaching staff before entering politics, reacted very positively and favourably following a visit to Cappanalea Outdoor Activity Centre at Caragh Lake in Killorglin. They were at one in stating that it was the most enjoyable and significant experience of their lives.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister of State, who is present here tonight, for sanctioning a substantial grant towards the staffing of Cappanelea.  However, I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister of State to allow the manager the freedom of choosing his own personnel for the running of the centre because it needs trained personnel, not just ordinary youth workers.  If the Department of Labour stick to the requirements the people in charge will not be able to take on the type of personnel that are suitable for employment in the centre.</P>
    <P>I was rather shocked to discover, during a recent visit to the centre, that <Col N="516" /> equipment such as wetsuits, canoes, raingear and other equipment that is used in the centre were, through usage, disintegrating and falling apart.  These have not been replaced since 1980, and a centre that has attracted so much attention and support from young people should not lack such servicing.  I would like to urge the Minister for Education, maybe through the office of the Minister of State, to sanction immediately some aid for the replacement of existing equipment there as a gesture for International Youth Year and as a recognition of the effort that is being put in by the manager, Mr. O'Dowd and his co-workers.</P>
    <P>The most popular spare time activities for young people are, sport, 48 per cent; reading, 25 per cent, watching TV, 23 per cent.  However, a recent survey carried out in Waterford city found that 47 per cent of young people felt that the local youth services had no role to play in tackling youth problems.  Organised youth activities and clubs are only attractive to about 32 per cent of the youth population.  It is imperative then that we create opportunities for a much larger number to participate in leisure free time activities.</P>
    <P>As regards political involvement, a minority of young people are involved in the party political process.  This is unfortunate though not surprising as it is through such involvement that real change can be brought about in society. We should consider how best to engage young people in the political process in Ireland.  We might consider inviting young people to address us or at least advise us from time to time.  I must say that the two main political parties are making every effort possible in this respect.  I would like to commend our own party for the way Young Fine Gael have been allowed to develop.  We should encourage our political parties to be more positive towards young people and to involve them in party matters.</P>
    <P>However, I am not pessimistic.  It has been my experience that various international youth committees throughout the country have been very successful in harnessing the involvement of young <Col N="517" /> people in their own communities.  To illustrate this I would like to refer to the local international youth committee in Listowel which has done tremendous work in a short space of time.  A laundry service has been set up for old people. Various events have been successfully organised.  A very significant series of seminars on job creation has recently been completed.  Many of the members of this committee have not previously been active in community organisations. I would hope now that their commitment and willingness to participate will not be lost to the community.  I would also like to urge the Minister to sanction a teamwork grant towards the cost of running the laundry for this particular group.  He might take note of it.  The involvement of so many young adults who have not been actively involved in community affairs before is the most remarkable aspect of International Youth Year.  An abundance of talent is being awakened which will bear fruit for many years to come.</P>
    <P>The level of unemployment among young people is, undoubtedly, a cause of concern in the communities in Ireland.  It is now running at a rate of 18 per cent to 20 per cent of the youth labour force or approximately 70,000 people.  This figure is frightening and must be regarded as being a potential time bomb.  The vast majority of unemployed people are desperately anxious to obtain employment. Consideration must be given to helping the young unemployed overcome the frustration and boredom that comes with unemployment.  I, therefore, welcome the introduction of the new scheme and the Teamwork scheme for people under 25 years of age.</P>
    <P>The range of opportunities for employing young people is unlimited, especially when one considers that so much work needs to be undertaken.  These schemes obviously will not solve the youth unemployment problem, but the benefits to society in general and to the young people themselves could be significant.</P>
    <P>As regards the theme of development, there is no doubt the development of young people by increasing participation <Col N="518" /> in a wide range of social, personal, economic, cultural and political activities is essential.  If we are to gain from the size of our youth population and if we are to avoid the creation of a dependent and disillusioned time bomb, each avenue of development should be explored and exploited in order to give young people the opportunity of exercising freedom and responsibility while increasing their life experience and building up positive relationships and ideals.  It is highly significant that the International Youth Policy Committee should have issued its final report in 1985 as a very important part of the Government's response to International Youth Year.  Its very recommendation that a comprehensive international youth service be initiated is crucial to the out-of-school development of the young people of Ireland.  The greatest contribution the Government could make in International Youth Year would be to launch an international youth service. I would like to ask the Minister here tonight to urge the Government to implement this as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The third theme of International Youth Year is peace, peace among the people of the world, peace within countries, peace within the communities. Young people must be encouraged to respect old people and to condemn any form of violence be it political or any other form of violence.  It is hardly necessary to spell this out in great detail in Ireland but we should be building the blocks of tomorrow, tomorrow's peace, with the young people of today.  Prejudice and mistrust among communities are the hallmarks of conflict and must be rooted out from the minds of our young and not so young people.  It is adults who instil perverse attitudes in our young people. We must show the way.  All young people must be encouraged by adults to have a greater sense of pride in their communities and a respect for their environment. a very positive sense of patriotism should be instilled within our curriculum process in the schools.  Young people should be taught that self-sacrifice is very important if we are to survive as a nation.  Of course, if this example is <Col N="519" /> not forthcoming from the politicians, it is very hard to expect young people to behave in this manner.  This can only be achieved by involving young people to a greater degree in community affairs and promoting many different types of schemes.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome the Government's support and their commitment to International Youth Year.  A sum of £240,000 has been provided for the International Youth Year Committee. Individual projects initiated in response to International Youth Year, such as the ones I have mentioned in Listowel, are being funded from the teamwork scheme, and I understand the Minister of State is making an announcement on the amount of money that will be allocated towards these very soon.  The Government will also be launching the President's award scheme at the end of the year in conjunction with private businesses. I would like to point out also that even before the United Nations called for a serious response from the Government to International Youth Year, our Government had already responded positively by establishing an International Youth Policy Committee.  We have already discussed their report at some length in this House.  I would now urge the Government, as I have said already, to implement the recommendation of the committee that a comprehensive international youth service be initiated as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Also, I would like to point out that the passing of the Age of Majority Bill and the introduction shortly of the Children's Care and Protection Bill and the Status of Children Bill are positive signs of the Government's commitment to right the disadvantages from which certain young people suffer.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope that International Youth Year will create an atmosphere of support, trust and recognition for our young people who will be the leaders, legislators, parents, workers and citizens of tomorrow.  I would like to thank the Minister of State for coming here tonight and for his commitment to the youth of <Col N="520" /> the country and to International Youth Year in Particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I have much pleasure in coming into the House and addressing myself to this motion.  I had the privilege last night of speaking at the annual general meeting of the Ferns Diocesan Youth Service. The FDYS, as the Minister of State will be familiar with, is the co-ordinating body of some 30 youth clubs and youth groups in County Wexford.  It was a very stimulating and interesting task for me to be present.  I cite them as an example of the work done under the Minister of State and under this Government and the vision they have brought to the development of youth services and the facilitating of future citizens of this country.  It was very stimulating to see the array of topics being tackled by young people now.</P>
      <P>A few very important pointers to the commitment of this Government were underlined to me last night.  One was that 12 months ago the Ferns diocesan youth service had one full-time worker and three part-time workers.  They now have 13 full-time workers, they have opened offices in all the major towns in the county where heretofore they were restricted to a base in Wexford town.  This sort of development in a single year underlined the thrust of Government policy, the support of the Minister of State and the enthusiasm of young people to care for one another and to involve themselves in the issues facing us as a people and as a nation.</P>
      <P>There are various subcommittees that address themselves to the topics that confront young people.  I was stimulated to find discussions under such headings as international affairs, whereby they involve themselves in informing young people throughout the county of the problems of the Third World, the divide between North and South, the inequality inherent in the economic order, and I think the commitment and the enthusiasm of young people for bringing about peace will be a force for change and development in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear that we are in a state <Col N="521" /> of flux as a nation.  There are major challenges facing young people, foremost probably the need for employment. There is a growing realisation among young people that they have to face that challenge themselves to provide for themselves.  There was a feeling for many years that they could look always to the State to provide for their needs and there was a clamour always to central Government: if you needed something, it must be provided from on high.  A realisation has dawned on people &mdash; young people in particular &mdash; that their best way forward is self-help and co-operation.  In that spirit it is so encouraging to see them involve themselves in groups like the youth employment schemes.  Youth employment schemes have been established in various centres throughout the country and their objective is to establish employment schemes directly themselves to employ young people.</P>
    <P>The initiative of Coalition Governments in recent years in the area of youth affairs is very relevant to the motion under discussion and the development of the Youth Employment Agency and various schemes under it.  The three objectives of the International Youth Year are participation, development and peace.  Obviously, they are three very important aims.  It is quite clear that there is participation and that many thousands of young people are involving themselves in clubs, activities and in community support. Development, hopefully, is on the cards.  I concur with the proposer of the motion when he says that the report we debated in this House recently must be implemented.  Several reports have been produced over the years and have lain on shelves.  It is important that this report and all its recommendations be implemented by Government.</P>
    <P>Finally, I concur with the mover of the motion in complimenting the Minister for the way he has taken the task of youth affairs which, I think, for many years has been a sideline issue and certainly not one &mdash; although we always paid lip service to it &mdash; that was high on the agenda of politics.  In recognition of the balance of <Col N="522" /> population in this country, he has brought it to the centre of the stage, and I compliment him on that.  It is a privilege to second the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>As speakers have said, we had a debate here in January and February of this year on the final report of the National Youth Policy Committee. That covered very well the subject matter of this motion on the agenda today.  Since then I cannot think of anything that has happened that would justify a further debate of this kind.  The most generous thing I can say about it is that there has been no improvement.  The motion refers to the fullest possible development.  I always looked on development in the positive sense, the development of talents and so on, but we have young people in crime who are developing in certain ways but not in ways that we would want them to develop.</P>
      <P>I question that two young Senators, Senators Jimmy Deenihan and Jim Higgins, could uncritically congratulate and commend the Government.  I do not want to be overcritical and I know the problem is a big one, but I am sure the youth of the country would feel that two young men would have something more positive to say in this respect than just a bland congratulation to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment is unquestionably the biggest problem we have.  We have 234,000 registered unemployed and a further 14,000 not on the register because of their parents' circumstances.  I believe that 30,000 people have emigrated, although I am sure the Minister would not agree with that figure, and there are around 20,000 doing various courses. That amounts to at least 300,000 unemployed at the present time, which is a horrific figure &mdash; 300,000 people with nothing to do but walk around idle.  I spoke before in this House about job satisfaction which is denied to all those unemployed and I stated that job satisfaction is, by and large, a measure of the gap between expectation and reality by people in their work, because for many people their expectations are not very <Col N="523" /> high we would have a high level of job satisfaction.</P>
    <P>We have also been told that we must change our concept of work from the way we were taught and the way things were when we started, and I do not doubt this, but I believe that full employment is possible.  We must strive to have full employment and it is defeatism to say it is not possible.  Whatever is necessary to achieve this must be done and, of course, the concept of work will be one step in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke about that in a very general sense because the unemployment is something which relates particularly to young people.  We have 60,000 people coming on the labour market each year, which is an enormous number of people for whom to find work. We are educating our children to a very high standard.  For many of them there will be no employment.  Today, I had 120 school children visiting Leinster House from one of our schools in Kells, who will be sitting the Intermediate Certificate soon and the thought crossed my mind as to what is in store for them.  They came to see the workings of Leinster House. We have 60,000 young people unemployed. This is a horrific figure.</P>
      <P>I should like to speak briefly about the dole, in a general sense.  It is the greatest device we have to deal with the problem of youth unemployment. The concept of the dole is out of date.  It has been brought up in the House many times by various Senators: young people signing on and having to queue outside the labour exchange, exposed to the weather, and no work for them.  I recommended here before that we should have courses to enable people to change to a different type of employment if it were possible. The dole prevents this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emigration is growing again.  In the last year 30,000 people have emigrated.  This problem is so great that next Friday Mr. Gay Byrne will have an expert on his <Col N="524" /> programme to talk about emigration to America &mdash; long term and short term &mdash; for young people.  We are going back to the situation we had many years ago where young people had nothing to look forward to but the boat.  Very recently a close friend of mine called on me: two of his sons were emigrating and the man was heartbroken.  It brought the problem home very forcibly to me.  Luckily, it transpired that something else turned up. We have this problem on a massive scale.</P>
    <P>I have spoken before on unemployment, our housing needs, bad roads, fuel requirements and the problem of emigration.  I suggest that we marry the problems of unemployment and housing, to solve the problems for our young people.  We have the situation of a young boy and a girl who want to get married; they are unemployed and instead of having the State provide a house for them, it would be better to pay these people to provide a house for themselves. There is no return from the money that is given out on the dole.  This is not what the people want.  These people should be in productive employment.  This idea would not be impossible to implement. We have many, nearly if not all <i>ad hoc</i> schemes which are responses to situations to get the Government and Ministers off the hook at particular times.  We do not have a proper policy in this area.  Take the social employment scheme, for example, which gives two and a half days employment to young people who are 12 months on the register.  I welcome this scheme. As Senator Howlin has stated, there is plenty of work to be done.  There are also young people who are unemployed and who do not want to go on the register. They want to stay away from the dole and they are not entitled to avail of this scheme.  This is wrong.  As I have stated, I welcome the scheme, but it is encouraging people to avail of the dole.</P>
    <P>We have an enormous crime problem among our young people which stems from unemployment.  In order to take the radical decisions necessary to implement a policy to tackle the roots rather than the symptoms of such a socially crippling problem, we look forward to our early <Col N="525" /> return to government.  In the meantime we are analysing the situation in the broad area of youth affairs and are completing a programme to have ready for implementation.  Great strides have already been made in this regard.  My party are committed to the development of a comprehensive youth service in which volunteerism will continue to have a special role with the supporting input of professionalism.  Youth organisations providing mainline youth services will receive 100 per cent funding for full-time youth workers at present employed in permanent positions in the youth service.</P>
    <P>We intend to raise the status of youth work in local communities with a comprehensive nationwide youth development programme involving voluntary and statutory organisations.  We shall seek increased voluntary input from professions dealing with young people, such as teachers and gardaí.  We will respond to such increased activity with significant improvements in facilities and resources for youth work.  It is our intention to make available existing resources, such as schools and school buses, for the further development of a youth service.  In government we will introduce immediate initiatives to assist disadvantaged youth areas, including: (1) the introduction of a Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill and provide accommodation for homeless young people through HOPE and Simon; (2) tackle the problems of school truancy through the appointment of school attendance officers in specified black spot areas particularly in urban districts; (3) expand the youth encounter project scheme to give special attention to disaffected young people.</P>
    <P>The important place of sport must be recognised.  We, on this side of the House, recognise the therapeutic and health care value of sport in addition to its recreational value.  Increased expenditure on sport can be justified by the benefits accruing from a healthy and fit society.  We will support voluntary sporting organisations in the development of sports programmes encouraging greater participation among young and old.  We are committed to significant Government <Col N="526" /> support for community sports organisations such as community games.  My party recognise the demand for adequate amenity and leisure facilities in response to increasing free time due to unemployment and increasing leisure time due to changing work practices.</P>
    <P>When we return to government we will establish the previous Fianna Fáil Government's programme for the development of sport and leisure facilities. It is our intention to examine the role of sport in second and third level education with a view to increased participation and improved standards.  We believe it is necessary to provide training facilities to international standards for athletes representing Ireland in all sports. We are at present examining the most effective methods to finance the preparation of our most talented young athletes to enable them to compete successfully in international competitions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion. I should like to take issue with Senator Fitzsimons who castigated Senator Deenihan and myself as being two of the younger Members of the House for our bland congratulations on Government policy.  If one reads the wording of the motion itself one will see that we merely commend the Government on their policy of facilitating the fullest possible development of our young people.  I believe that we are justified in putting down a motion to that effect because I believe that for the first time ever we have seen a concerted, purposeful approach to youth development.  We are not claiming in fact that there are any tremendous grandiose successes.  There has been no spectacular breakthrough in relation to unemployment, but I believe that for the first time ever a Minister and a junior Minister have been appointed and a Government Department has been set up specifically to be cognisant of and to assist in every possible way the development of facilities for our youth, all aspects of youth development, multi-dimensional.  I believe we are on the way towards that aspiration.  After all for fifty years of our <Col N="527" /> existence it did not figure in our policies, good, bad or indifferent.  Youth policies were non-existent.  At least it now has become part of accepted Government policy that a junior Minister &mdash; and hopefully in time a senior Minister &mdash; will be designated for this all-important area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the motion and the fact that it focuses on the year that we have, and particularly on the theme of that year, and that is participation, development and peace.  They have already been more than well elaborated by the proposer of the motion, Senator Deenihan.</P>
      <P>Senator Deenihan mentioned the development of outdoor pursuit centres, and in the past number of years we have seen the emergence of such centres in increasing numbers, made available to all at a nominal sum in order to ensure that people of all classes and without distinction can use them.  Young people, in fact, for a nominal sum have ready access to outdoor facilities of a high standard under excellent supervision and coaching. In my own county, just as in County Kerry, we have the Achill outdoor pursuit centre which for £7 provides a weekend of orienteering, mountaineering, swimming, scuba-diving, surfing etc.  I want to congratulate this Government for the imagination they have shown, at least in showing a capacity to break out of traditional moulds and norms and thinking and to show that there is justification for mobility of resources and for transferring resources from the Department of Social Welfare and paying people for doing nothing, into the Department of Labour and paying people for doing something and, in most cases, doing something useful.</P>
      <P>If we had more of this imaginative, forward, progressive type of thinking right across the board, and if we had it in the past, we would not find ourselves in the sorry state and dilemma that we find ourselves in at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social employment scheme has been castigated by Senator Fitzsimons on the basis that it does not in fact reflect true figures.  He mentioned that young people, by and large, have too much <Col N="528" /> pride to acknowledge that they are entitled to unemployment assistance and therefore we are not getting a true reflection of the number of unemployed.  I cannot accept that.  I think that financial compulsion after a while forces virtually everybody on to the dole queue and indeed I would say this, that if anything the dole figures are exaggerated, that the number of 234,000 which is deemed to reflect the number of people ready, willing and able to work is exaggerated.  One scheme in particular that has caught the imagination of people and taken off with a vengance has been what was previously the youth employment scheme and is now the teamwork scheme.  I welcome in particular the manner in which the people who are promoting this scheme have sought to ensure diversification.  Heretofore, the vast majority of schemes undertaken were (a) male-orientated and (b) of a manual nature.  Now excellent work has been done in relation to cemetery restoration, the provision of community facilities etc, but I would say that 90 per cent of the beneficiaries therefrom in fact &mdash; I am talking in terms of labour content &mdash; have been male and that little if anything has been done to try to alleviate the female unemployment problem. That is why if you look at the cover on the new application form and memorandum for Teamwork you will see depicted there in design and graphics etc., scope for the setting up of musical co-operatives, drama groups, vegetable co-operatives, groups working with the elderly, doing social work, etc.  It is this type of integration into the community and diversification that is to be commended and, again, that should be further developed and amplified.</P>
    <P>Near where I come from in County Mayo, actually in the village of Knock, a jewellery and craftwork class under the aegis and auspices of AnCO is starting there this week.  It will employ a dozen young people manufacturing high class, high quality jewellery and souvenirs of the area.  I have no doubt whatever that at the end of this period, given that the people on the course have the necessary aptitude for the training, a co-operative <Col N="529" /> will in fact emerge therefrom.  This is the type of undertaking that should be encouraged by AnCO, by the youth employment scheme and by the National Development Corporation.  I take issue with people who would say that nothing has been done for youth.  I would maintain that the schemes are there but that they are not being exploited and that in fact it is the communities that are blameworthy and culpable for not taking up the numerous schemes, offers and opportunities that are being presented by different Departments.  I know that many of them are short-term and that many of them are treated in a derisory fashion by politicians of different views and persuasions in that they do not immediately offer long-term scope and employment. But what they do is (a) expose people to a work situation (b) try to capture expertise and (c) provide the necessary follow-up if such people wish to set up a business as a result of the experience or the market research which is taking place within the scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons mentioned 234,000 unemployed.  The last figures were 226,000.  For the third month in succession we have seen at least the downward trend begin.  It is nothing mind-shattering or world-shaking but at least the corner has been turned.  Again, in relation to the emigration of youth I would maintain that the figures are largely arbitrary and that we are not on the brink of the precipice or of seeing the mass exodus from this country that we experienced in the past.  I come from an area that was sorely afflicted by emigration, where they said in days gone by that there were three trains from Ballyhaunis with one engine pushing and the other pulling, taking the human cargo on their way to cross the water.  I think we are a far cry from that day and I sincerely hope we are.</P>
    <P>One of the major pitfalls, or one of the major drawbacks or discriminatory factors as regards the existence of young people particularly in rural Ireland, is lack of access to cultural facilities.  We have, not very far from here, a National Museum which is in a state of semi-decay <Col N="530" /> and which certainly has not anything like the accommodation that is needed and yet, in the basement of this museum and in other centres around this city we have artefacts and items of historical and archaeological merit which have been discovered in the bogs and the moorlands of rural Ireland and which would lie buried and hidden from the people who found them or from the environment in which they were found.  That is why I would urge that something purposeful and positive should be done in this respect to decentralise facilities such as the National Museum, to set up regional county museums, regional county art galleries, regional county folklore theatres where the people, and the young people in particular, of rural Ireland can enjoy, appreciate and absorb the culture from which they themselves have come.</P>
    <P>Again, I want to congratulate the Government on what has been done so far.  I think significant strides have been made.  I think significant strides will be made and I look forward with a certain degree of expectation and anticipation to the emergence of a report shortly regarding the Curriculum and Examination Board as again giving further testimony and evidence of the commitment of this administration to youth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before us reads:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the designation of 1985 as International Youth Year; welcomes it for highlighting the needs and the abilities of youth and commends the Government on their policy of facilitating the fullest possible development of our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, there are some parts of that that I could not disagree with, for example, the fact that it is International Youth Year.  The last line is certainly one that I would have to query and query in a very strong way.  I do not feel, and many of the youth do not feel, that the Government should be congratulated on their policy of facilitating the fullest possible  <Col N="531" /> development of our young people, because we have failed and failed miserably in this area.</P>
    <P>We are looking at this motion here tonight in the knowledge that almost 100,000 of our young people are out of work.  Normally, in good times they should be at work.  Many thousands of young people are attending our third level institutions.  Again, they are there due to the fact that they could not find work.  So, our third level institutions are bursting at the seams for the simple reason that our young people cannot find jobs.  When we talk about our young people, we have to talk in the knowledge that what they want most in life is a job, a permanent, worthwhile job in which they can organise themselves and &mdash; hopefully &mdash; in time get married and organise a family.  That is their main priority, and the Government have failed miserably to tackle this terrible evil of unemployment.</P>
    <P>We had a report recently from the National Youth Council, a very worthwhile and responsible report.  They came up with a number of conclusions.  The first important priority for those young people was the fact that they should enjoy good health, a most responsible aspiration. Their second priority was that they should have a permanent job.  The third priority was that there should be peace in our country &mdash; all very worthwhile and noble aspirations and ones that you would congratulate any youth group on preparing and presenting.  I do not think the Government have come up with anything to fulfil the aspirations of that report.  What have we?  We have training schemes by the score of one kind or another.  Training for what?  Why train for six weeks or six months when at the end of the day there are no jobs available? That is the yardstick by which the youth are judging us and are judging our Government.</P>
    <P>They have a plethora of training schemes.  Some of these are excellent schemes if there was something at the end of them, but many, many young <Col N="532" /> people are disillusioned, fed up and totally shattered by their experiences. Having got the training, they find that they have no jobs.  The previous speaker referred to various schemes like teamwork &mdash; all important.  Many of these community schemes find difficulty in getting off the ground because public liability insurance and employers' liability insurance are so difficult to obtain at the moment for that type of scheme.  This is something on which the Government should consult with the various insurance companies.  Otherwise they will fail totally. Again, there is the social employment scheme.  It is not for the young people; it is for long-term people who have been out of work for 12 months or more.  If the Government were worried and concerned about our youth they could well have extended that social employment scheme to apply to young people so as to give them an opportunity of actual work, even for two-and-a-half days a week or one week out of two, as the scheme allows for.  We have not been seen to do anything positive, worth while or practical for the youth.</P>
    <P>Again, we have the question of crime and the breakdown of law and order. Many people associate the fact that unemployment is so high with this problem &mdash; that is why we have the crime and that is why we have the breakdown in law and order.  If the main problem of jobs was tackled once and for all, much of the crime and the breakdown in law and order would disappear also.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the role of recreation for our youth and for our people generally.  Certainly, I would have to support any effort at improving the role of sport, and when we talk about sports it is important that we talk about sports that have not mass spectator audiences, sports like canoeing and rowing and minor sports that unfortunately are dependent on their own members and work to raise funds.  The Government should come to the aid of this type of sports and ensure that they continue, because many of them, I know, are finding it extremely difficult to survive with the cost of upkeep of premises and the <Col N="533" /> purchase of canoes and outriggers.  The Government should also help the other sports that are finding survival so difficult. It would be a pity if, through lack of funds, they were allowed to fail in any part of the country.  It is vital that we continue to have a worthwhile sports policy for our youth because of the fact that they have no jobs and that they have much recreation time on their hands.  It is important that they be given an opportunity in the area of sport.</P>
    <P>Outdoor pursuit centres are something that should be encouraged.  It is a new form of sport; it is not everybody who can win all-Ireland medals, and many young people are very interested in this type of pursuits, and they should be encouraged actively through the various vocational education committees or indeed any community group who feels that they can involve themselves in that type of activity.  Sport generally should be helped.  I know much of it should be done by the sport organisations.  The Basketball Association of Ireland have made great strides because of the ambitious policy they adopted a few years ago.  Basketball is now very much a thriving sport, and certainly they are getting crowds that a few years ago they never thought possible.  The most important thing that this Government can do for our youth is to ensure that at the end of their training programmes, when they come out of school, whether it be second level or third level, jobs would be there for them.  That is what they want most in life, and until that situation becomes a reality then this motion before us is one that will have a question mark after it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to say that it was not my intention to intervene in the debate on this occasion. I had hoped to save my remarks for next week.  I understand that as no Member of the House is offering on this occasion it falls to me by default.  Members of the House will be aware that I have had an opportunity in the recent past to address myself to the report of the Costello Committee <Col N="534" /> on Youth Matters.  It would be helpful if I updated Members on some developments that have taken place since then.  There are two things that will be of interest to Members of the House.  The first is the progress of the response to the report.  Members will recall that I indicated on that occasion that I was anxious that we would have the widest possible response and that we could hear the considered views of youth organisations and other interested parties.  I am happy to say that we have received a very wide number of responses.  Indeed, the great bulk of them if not all of them supported the central thrust of the Costello report.  Those have now been considered within my Department and I also had the opportunity of considering the approach taken to the report by the other Government Departments.  As a result of that, I have been able to complete my own consideration of the report. I am now in the process of submitting to Government a considered response to that report.  I am happy to say to Senators that we are ahead of target on our commitment of producing a youth policy within International Youth Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that may be of some interest to Senators is the fact that today I took the opportunity of announcing the annual grant scheme awards allocation.  I was pleased to be in a position to announce today a package of support for the youth service in all totalling some £6.6 million.  It is by far the most substantial package ever presented by any Government or any Minister of State.  Perhaps one of the most significant aspects of that was the fact that it showed the range of resources now available to the youth organisations and the number of channels through which they can now expect to receive support.  I realise that Members of the House will be anxious to compare like with like, and that is not easy, because the package is quite different to any that has come before.  On the basis of doing the best that one can, I think Members will immediately focus on the provision in the Estimate for the youth service grant-in-aid.  I am pleased to say that that particular subhead has been <Col N="535" /> increased from £2.2 million last year to £2.95 million this year, an increase of 33 per cent, which I regard as a very satisfactory contribution by this Government to our celebration of International Youth Year.  That figure of £2.95 million needs to be examined a little more closely.</P>
    <P>First of all, it contains provision within it for cost of living increases and it improves the cost of living increases for all the 27 or 28 youth organisations previously grant-aided by the State.  In addition, it has allowed the admission to the scheme for the first time of some additional organisations such as the Young Environmentalists group and the Peace Corp, who have now been admitted to the system of youth service grant-in-aid. It also provides for support under a number of other headings, for example, support for the common training programme, support for in-service training for youth workers, support for North-South exchange, an aspect on which I personally place a great deal of priority, support for British-Irish exchange, which again is a subject very close to my own heart.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most significant point is the fact that that sum of £2.95 million allows me to take initiative in the coming weeks in areas of particular disadvantage. In doing that we are very close to the central thrust of the Costello report with its demands to all of us that in social justice we must respond to those areas of greatest need.  I am happy to say that the funds for it have been made available to me to enable me to support on a continuing basis and on a more generous basis the mainstream youth service. In addition, they also give me an opportunity to take initiative in this area of particular importance and urgency in regard to the question of support for the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I mentioned, too, that the package I announced today provided for and made clear the extent to which youth organisations were now in a position to draw down support from a number of different channels.  One of those channels was the <Col N="536" /> re-introduced capital grant scheme.  I was delighted in the closing days of the work of the Costello report to anticipate their view that the State should support local communities and local youth organisations in providing themselves with community and recreational facilities. Even before they had completed their work I was able to anticipate that and present to Government an argument for the re-introduction of those grants.  I am happy to say that the Government have responded to my request and in the context of the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, have made available a sum of £1 million this year and each of the subsequent years of the plan.  It is my intention that as far as possible those funds will also be directed towards areas of greatest social need.</P>
    <P>In announcing today's youth service grant allocations I took the opportunity as well to announce a number of capital grants which will be of benefit to the headquarter organisations of the bodies involved.  For example, the National Youth Council will be receiving some £15,000 towards the provision of their new headquarters.  The Catholic Youth Council in Arran Quay will be receiving support towards theirs.  Likewise, a number of scouting and guiding organisations will be receiving support.  Today we were concerned only with the question of support for headquarter organisations. The great bulk of the £1 million this year and the £1 million next year and the £1 million the following year will, of course, be spent at a community level and will aid particular local organisations.</P>
    <P>The other area of new opportunity for youth organisations has come through the Teamwork programme.  A number of Members have made reference to this programme in the course of their contributions. I thank Senators for the general welcome they offered the scheme.  For my part I am delighted with the response that has been forthcoming in the couple of months since I first announced it.  I speak now from memory and I cannot guarantee the accuracy of my figures, but my recollection is that in the comparable scheme last year &mdash; the grant scheme for <Col N="537" /> youth employment &mdash; some 700 queries were received from organisations around the country.  So far this year, on the basis of applications processed, we have got some 1,800 applications, indicating, I think, the degree of enthusiasm there is within the community to play a part in the fight against unemployment.</P>
    <P>I accept that the problem of unemployment is the single greatest burden that weighs on our young people.  I think what is of particular interest here is the extent to which that programme is of interest and of benefit to youth organisations in supporting them in their work. It is of interest and of benefit to sport bodies.  I was interested to hear Senator Fallon praise the work of the Irish Basketball Association.  I share his views and commend that organisation for the highly efficient and highly progressive way in which it has gone about its business in the last few years, and the way in which it managed to give the lead in taking advantage of the Teamwork programme is one that can usefully be followed by a number of other sporting bodies.  For example, in my own constituency they have a coaching programme going in Killester involving the Killester basketball club which provides employment for a number of young people locally as coaches.  It is obviously of benefit to the widest population of young people in the area who benefit from the coaching provided.</P>
    <P>A particular interest to the Members of the House is the fact that now as the first approval comes towards an end a number of the people involved in that programme have identified in it the opportunity for sustainable employment. In particular, a number of them have come forward and are in the process of establishing a co-operative aimed at putting the skills that they have acquired during that programme to work in providing themselves with a living.  I welcome that very much indeed.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon commented, in passing, on the difficulties that a number of organisations who were anxious to participate in that programme were finding with the insurance obligation.  I would say to them <Col N="538" /> that I am aware of the fact that that is indeed a difficulty or has in the past been a difficulty.  I am pleased to say to Members of the Seanad that my Department have been very active on that front in recent weeks.  While I cannot say that we have crossed every &ldquo;t&rdquo; and dotted every &ldquo;i&rdquo; in relation to it I think we are in a position to provide support to any individual group who may find themselves in difficulty.  If any Member of the Seanad is aware of a group which is holding back from proceeding with an approval because of concerns about the level of employer liability insurance or because of concerns about the difficulty of obtaining it, if they make contact with my office we will be glad to give them some advice.</P>
    <P>Another initiative taken in the context of International Youth Year that has been mentioned by Members and, in particular, by Senator Deenihan in his contribution was the question of the President's award scheme.  I regard this scheme, closely modelled on a number of other schemes overseas, as being very important and very worthwhile.  I do so for two reasons.  First of all because valuable as the work is of all the organisations that we support we have to accept that they reach only a minority of young people.</P>
    <P>The survey taken by the Costello report established beyond any doubt that the majority of young people do not in fact join the local youth club or the local boy scouts troop or whatever.  We have to reach out to those young people who are unattached.  The experience overseas has been that programmes like the President's Award Scheme which challenge young people as individuals and give recognition to objective excellence have been very successful in attracting young people to participate who had not up to then been drawn in by any of the preexisting youth organisations.  That is why I regard it as important.  The other reason why I regard it as important, of course, is the further opportunity that it provides for international contacts.  In that regard I particularly hope that participants in it will avail of the opportunity for close <Col N="539" /> contact with their peers taking part in similar programmes in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>One matter that may have escaped the attention of the Senators is that in the other House in the course of the last hour an amendment to the Finance Bill moved by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, was approved.  The terms of that amendment were designed to encourage private sector investment.  The amendment holds out the prospects to the private sector of tax relief, on any contributions.  I hope that with that inducement and that encouragement this will be seen as a unique partnership between the State and the private sector in the interests of young people and that, in particular, it will succeed in reaching out to those very many young people who have to date not been attracted to the work of existing organisations.</P>
    <P>I know that a number of the Members of the Seanad addressed themselves to the themes of International Youth Year &mdash; peace, participation and development. Obviously, those themes are of burning interest and relevance to young people in Ireland at the moment.  A number of steps taken by this Government are designed to support young people in each of those areas.  I have mentioned already the support that we have given to the youth service &mdash; the greatly increased support for the youth service &mdash; which I believe addressed itself to the question of the development of the youth service. Certainly, the last word has not been written there.</P>
    <P>On the question of participation, too, this Government have been concerned to respond.  We have been determined to establish the right of the voices of young people to be heard at the highest level where decisions are taken.  We have taken the initiative in appointing young people to the board of the Youth Employment Agency.  We have taken the initiative in seeing to it that young people will be heard as of right in the councils of the National Economic and Social Council. We have said that on a body such as the Local Interim Radio Authority, <Col N="540" /> clearly concerned with an issue of considerable interest to young people, it is absolutely essential that young people will be in there and will be heard.  We have determined in the context of the Planning Acts that the voices of young people will be heard within the planning process.  Within the prison system, where unfortunately so many of those who find themselves committed are in fact young people, we regard it as desirable that young people will be involved in the administration too.  We are taking steps to appoint representatives of young people to the prison visiting boards of the various institutions.</P>
    <P>On the wider question of participation I think that &mdash; and this was a comment that was made in the debate tonight and has been made on other occasions when we have discussed youth affairs in this House &mdash; the challenge in the Costello report is addressed not just to Government but to all parties in this House.  It is clear that young people adopt a somewhat cynical and sceptical approach to politics and to the political system.  While it is right and proper that they should be sceptical &mdash; because anyone who would seek to rob young people of their scepticism would leave them defenceless and at the mercy of any knave &mdash; the extent to which young people feel isolated from the political system must be a concern to any practicising politician.  I have taken the initiative with the approval of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of The Workers' Party and registered political parties represented in Dáil Éireann, of making available funds to assist them in employing an education officer designed to address the question, identified as so important by the Costello report, of political education.  I hope that that is an initiative that will enjoy the support of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I think there is a further question.  I have no desire to stir controversy at this stage.  If we are to be serious about asking young people to participate and to say to them that we want to create a society that is welcoming and inviting to them to participate then we have to look to our <Col N="541" /> laurels and see how we have responded when issues have been presented to us. The performance of many Members of this House and of the other House, when faced with the choice on the Family Planning Act, was no encouragement to and no vote of confidence in young people. The paternalism and the extent to which the values of a new generation were ignored by so many Members of both Houses in their contributions, cannot be but a slap in the face to young people who seek to participate in our political system.  Happily, the fact that a majority of Members in this House and in the other House saw fit to follow the lead courageously offered by the Taoiseach will, I think, be seen by young people as being a vote of confidence in them, in their maturity and in their responsibility to lead and to make decisions for themselves.</P>
    <P>The question of peace arises, peace within our community and the whole question of the role that young people play and continue to play in striving for social justice, social justice at home but also in their magnificent response to the needs of the Third World.  Obviously, in that context the whole question of cooperation between this part of the island and Northern Ireland arises.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that in International Youth Year a very substantial number of events have been organised in youth organisations with this North-South dimension, the most dramatic of which, of course, will be the Scout Jamboree in Portumna in August when some 10,000 scouts from the three scouting associations in this island &mdash; the Catholic Boy Scouts, the Scout Association of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Scouts &mdash; will come together for the first time to camp together.  For my part, I hope that the links forged during International Youth Year will prove to be enduring ones and that the contacts established this year will not be allowed to wither at the end of the year but that they will go on to prove the basis of lasting friendship.</P>
    <P>I conclude, Chairman, by thanking the Senators who have contributed to this <Col N="542" /> debate.  Given the fact that Ireland is one of a small and quite select band of countries that have been invited by the United Nations to serve on the organising committee for International Youth Year I think it is proper that the importance and the uniqueness of the occasion should be marked by a debate in the House.  I thank the Senators who have taken the initiative to have the debate and the other Members of the House who have contributed to the discussion.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Senators who contributed and supported the motion.  Unfortunately, I feel that on the Fianna Fáil side of the House they did not do the motion the justice it deserved.  The theme is International Youth Year.  I feel it is a very important year for all of us.  Again, to bring politics into it to the extent that Senator Fitzsimons brought politics into it, I think is rather sad.  The youth of this country need direction.  They need example from politicians and to look at politicians as people who are interested in problems as a whole rather than looking at them from the property aspect.  It is unfortunate that both Senator Fitzsimons and to a lesser extent Senator Fallon took this line.  No doubt as the year progresses and as International Youth Year gathers momentum politicians from all sides will be trying to get on the bandwagon and associate with the event.  Unfortunately, the debate in this House tonight does not reflect the amount of interest that is within the community for this special year.</P>

    <P>I would like to thank both Senator Howlin and Senator Higgins for their contributions.  Senator Howlin mentioned that there was a great spirit of co-operation and community sensibility present at a meeting he attended recently.  I also found this at meetings I have been at.  Senator Higgins mentioned that it would be important to expose national archives and some of the many archives that are at present hidden away in the National Museum to our young people.  This is a very important point. This year should be one where patriotism, respect and pride in our country <Col N="543" /> will be revived among the young people.</P>
    <P>I feel very disappointed that the people on the other side of the House who put so much emphasis on patriotism could not see the point that Senator Higgins and I were trying to make in bringing the motion before the House tonight.  Again I would like to repeat that this is where we as politicians are falling down.  It is no wonder that young people see and address us in such a cynical fashion as was mentioned by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>To the Minister of State I would like to say that he is probably the first Minister who has really responded to the need of the youth of this country.  He has made enormous attempts and efforts to stem the growth of youth unemployment. From contemporary schemes in other countries on youth employment and the efforts that are being made there I feel that we are leading in the world with respect to youth employment.  I was looking through a book recently which was produced by the Victorian Senate of Australia which compared various youth employment initiatives around the world. I feel that the initiatives that have taken place in this country are far ahead of <Col N="544" /> anything that was set down in that book. For that the Minister of State must be commended.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that the Minister has announced an increased allocation towards youth funding.  This would help support the very many schemes that are being initiated and applied for at the moment.  With the proper support and enthusiasm this year, the international youth year, could prove to be of immense benefit to all of us.</P>
    <P>I would like to end by sincerely thanking those people who contributed.  I would like to thank the Minister for being present.  Hopefully before the end of the year we will have more positive feedback from international youth committees around the country.</P>
