      <P>I have notice from Senator Jack Daly that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The widespread disruptions and irreparable damage caused by the airline pilots strike.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 5 p.m. to 5.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and for safety's sake to add No. 6.  It is proposed that we should suspend the sitting from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and that No. 4 will be taken at 2 p.m. if not earlier reached.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, I am glad that today we are discussing legislation rather than reports of committees.  Until today, it would appear to outsiders that we were discussing reports of committees which had no relevance at all to what will eventually <Col N="1318" /> happen in legislation.  Having said that on the Order of Business, it may be out of order, but could I pay a compliment to a person who has been made an honorary member of the Press Gallery, Noel Conway, who has served this House very well over the years?  He has been made an honorary life member of the Press Gallery of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Sometimes we may not agree with what he has reported from this House but, in all fairness, he has had the interests of this House totally at heart.  He is one of the people who have kept this House in the public eye in a certain sense, particularly in the written media.  He has not been here for the past couple of weeks. I sincerely hope that the members of the press have not moved him sideways so that we will not see him again in this House.  Whatever area he has gone to, I would like to say that he has served this House extremely well and whether he is here as a visitor or a working journalist he will be very welcome in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Government side of the House, I would like to be identified with the remarks made by Senator Lanigan about Noel Conway.  He has been a faithful attender in this House. Recently I talked to him and he told me he was demoted to the other House.  His preference for this House was obvious in his remarks.  He always reported fairly what happened here and it was not his fault if the editorial staff in the newspapers did not always print what he recorded as having taken place here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard I suppose it might be appropriate to say that the Seanad gets a very poor showing in many of the papers. There are a couple of exceptions.  I do not want to name papers.  It is not the fault of the journalists who are sitting here because they record dutifully what takes place here.  Much legislation has been initiated in this House, and debated here at length, but it is only when it arrives in the other House that it seems to be recorded by the media.  It is rather a pity that the media treat this House in that way.  Noel Conway was a believer in this House and recorded it faithfully.  It <Col N="1319" /> was not his fault if the paper concerned did not always carry it.  It is appropriate that the media should take account of the importance of this House and Members should respond and show their appreciation by their attendance here.  That does not apply to anybody who is here now. People should show by their attendance here at all times the importance of the House.  I refer particularly to our absent colleagues who normally are very active on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>Is it proposed to take all stages of the Combat Poverty Agency Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>First, Senator Lanigan welcomed the fact that we have legislation today.  We have legislation because it is Wednesday.  We have been operating the system for some time past with an attempt to deal with legislation on a Wednesday and normally deal with Motions on Thursday.  Because, in fact, we were sitting on Tuesday rather than Thursday this is the reason why in this particular week we dealt first with Motions.  Certainly it is intended that this should be the pattern that should continue and we will endeavour to arrange the business in such a way that legislation will be discussed on a Wednesday.  On Thursday there may be an overspill of legislative work from Wednesday.  But along with that the House will be dealing with Motions.  I think it is important that the new committee system of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be fully operated and that the reports of the Joint Committees should be debated.</P>
      <P>Regarding the query from Senator Fallon, it is proposed to take only the Committee Stage of the Combat Poverty Agency Bill, but it is also intended that the Report Stage will be taken before the end of this session.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am <Col N="1320" /> not totally out of order I also endorse what Senator Lanigan and Senator Ferris said about Mr. Noel Conway.  I was a colleague of his in reporting the proceedings of the Houses.  I am very fully aware of his interest not only in accurate reporting but also in the workings, the traditions and the prestige of the Houses.  I am also very interested in the fact that he was able to become an honorary life member of the Press Gallery and I wonder if such facilities might be extended occasionally to Members of the Oireachtas.  All of us would welcome that and we would be in competition for that honour, if such were available.</P>
      <P>We had a very valuable examination of the Bill by the Seanad on Committee Stage and a number of points were raised which I promised to have examined further. Senator Lanigan was concerned that the reference to &ldquo;a financial arrangement&rdquo; in a Department form might have unduly restrictive implications for genuine licence applicants who, for example, have merely an overdraft arrangement with a bank.  I explained, and Senator O'Leary further elaborated on that occasion, that this was very much legal technical language.  It deals with the case where a person has made an arrangement with creditors with a view to avoiding bankruptcy.  I have had the question of using some other wording examined, but I am advised that this is the proper form. In any event, as I said the last day, the question relates only to an administrative form used in the Department and does not actually arise on the Bill.  I have in the Department other representations about the establishment of suitable financial criteria and, when decisions have been taken, I will take steps to eliminate ambiguity in the Department's forms if it should be apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also very impressed by the point made by Senators about the use of distinctive vehicle plates as an aid to enforcement.  It was first introduced by Senator M. O'Toole and then by a number of other Senators.  The specifications of vehicle plates are contained in ministerial regulations made from time <Col N="1321" /> to time under the 1933 Act.  Various practical problems arise about vehicle plates. We took powers in 1978 to have them made of plastic or metal rather than just metal only as was the situation up to then. Unfortunately, the plastic plates are not entirely satisfactory because it is difficult in some cases to attach them to some types of vehicles.</P>
    <P>The design of the plates will have to be altered anyhow when we get through the impending transitional period and have only two basic forms of licence.  What I have in mind, having regard to the suggestions of Senators, is to continue with the old plates for the present, so as to avoid having too many types, but to have enforcement aspects especially considered, for example, as regards colour differentiation, shape or size when the new specification for vehicle plates is being prepared and, when of course, we have only two types to deal with.  That would be the more appropriate time rather than during the intervening period, the two years' transitional period, specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A point of considerable substance was also made by a number of Senators in relation to the obligations of licensed hauliers under the law.  I want to make it clear that I would regard insurance offences, particularly if persistent, as offences which would bring into consideration the question of revoking a licence. I am satisfied that the text of the existing provision, which is merely being reenacted here from the previous law, would cover that case.</P>
    <P>It would, however, copper-fasten the question if we provided that the licensee was expressly answerable for an insurance or other serious offence in relation to the vehicle.  This point was brought up by Senator Lanigan.  This might, however, deprive licensees of a certain flexibility as to the use of vehicles that they have, in fact, enjoyed since the 1933 Act &mdash; that is, under the present law &mdash; which does not require them to be the owners of vehicles used in their business.  This means that borrowed, leased or, indeed, sub-contracted vehicles can be used if it suits the licensee.  All of this could be a <Col N="1322" /> quite complicated matter and one in which other Ministers would be involved. Nevertheless, it will be further examined and if we can make better provision than exists now then an appropriate amendment will be introduced in the other House.  As I said, it is an extremely complicated matter and it involves other Ministers as well.</P>
    <P>There appears to be some impression that, in the case of a company, the licensee would be the designated manager and the company might thereby escape certain legal obligations.  The licensee in such cases will always be the company.  They will, of course, have a designated manager but the company will have the normal legal responsibilities of the licensee and will not be able to shift them to a designated manager except as regards managing the business.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion as regards enforcement aspects was made in relation to the need for provisions for temporary detention of vehicles.  This illustrates the value of a debate and, indeed, the introduction of a Bill in the Seanad even a highly complicated and technical Bill of this nature.  These are the kind of things that might not be anticipated but certainly give food for thought.  Major offences in relation to insurance and safety aspects are involved.  I will suggest to the Minister for the Environment that he might consider introducing provisions in this respect in traffic law at the first suitable opportunity.  All of us have an obligation to all road users &mdash; indeed to the entire community &mdash; to ensure that vehicles driven without insurance are not facilitated in any way and that they are put off the roads with the greatest alacrity. Of course, this applies to all vehicles.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied after examination of the text of the existing legislation, particularly section 112 of the 1944 Act, that it would be superfluous and possibly confusing to insert a reference to &ldquo;own goods&rdquo; in section 9 of the Bill.  I very much agree that the existing text is very difficult to follow.  This, however, is one of the effects of legislating by reference to previous enactments and a further <Col N="1323" /> endorsement of the case for consolidation, a measure very clearly recommended by Senators and I know very strongly supported within my own Department.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, have made it clear to Senator Lanigan that the contents of sections 11 and 12 are determined in all the essential respects under relevant provisions of the European Community law and we cannot, therefore, make any significant departure from what the law provides. Therefore, sections 11 and 12, as we have them here, are just about as far as we can go to deal with the special cases.  I can assure the Senator, however, that in the case to which he referred, a person or a company left high and dry by the unexpected departure of a designated manager would not, in practice, be required to cease business at once.  EC law gives some limited discretion in this respect.  The firm concerned would be pressed by the Department to rectify matters as quickly as possible.  If there were undue delay or unwillingness about doing so, then the question of revoking the licence would come up.  It would, incidentally, be an offence for the firm not to notify the Minister of the departure of the designated manager.  Within that context and taking into account the European law that exists, there is sufficient flexibility to meet the case mentioned by a number of Senators during the discussion.</P>
    <P>I hope Senators will be satisfied that I have given their points the consideration I promised.  Indeed, I was very glad to consider these points.  I can never understand the resistance by a Minister in either House which sometimes is apparent. I am not talking about any particular regime but I have seen down through the years a sort of resistance to any new ideas that came up during the course of a debate which might have been received with alacrity if they came up during the actual planning period.  It is a very false position from which to operate.</P>
    <P>I am always delighted to hear good points being raised during a debate and the Seanad has a variety of Bills that <Col N="1324" /> are particularly suitable for that type of thing.  I have given consideration to these. Most of the items called for either clarification or action of an administrative or regulatory nature outside the scope of the Bill.  Some, indeed, deal with the forms that are used in conjunction with the existing legislation and will be used in conjunction with the new legislation.  I will follow up on the lines I have indicated. I will be giving urgent consideration to the possible amendment of the Bill in relation to the legal responsibilities of licensees.</P>

      <P>I will not have very much to say later on.  I thank the Minister for the comments he has made in relation to the queries we raised on Committee Stage of the Bill.  The Minister has covered most of the queries that were raised and he has promised that anything that has not been clarified now will be clarified by him and his officials before the Bill goes to the Dáil.  On Report Stage, we have very little to say about the Bill except that we are thankful the Minister took note of what we said.  I sincerely hope that the other House will be able to carry forward the suggestions which we made and that at the end of the day the Bill will be the type of Bill which is needed to reorganise the road transport system in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the way he has examined our queries.  He has been very methodical. We are here to legislate.  Very often in this House Ministers resent the fact that we try to bore holes in legislation.  It is our duty to do so and to give the best legislation to the people.  That is what we are doing.  The Minister, Deputy Nealon, has examined every point methodically. It is evident from his remarks that he is on top of his work.  I would like to compliment him sincerely for doing that. <Col N="1325" /> I would also like to compliment the members of his staff who, I am sure, were very helpful in bringing about reasonably explanatory replies to the many questions we raised.  We do not get that type of treatment from all Ministers in this House.  I am sure the Minister did not get it himself in his time.  This is a breakthrough.  I compliment the Minister on the way he has examined and tackled this and it is a credit to him.  I hope the Ministers who will come after the present Minister will take cognisance of the way that he methodically examined this legislation with a view to providing the best legislation.  We are happy with the Minister's explanations.  With regard to the queries we have raised with the Minister for the Environment, such as the identification plates, we know that the Minister will pursue them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Minister has said with regard to a point that I raised in connection with section 5, that is, that the holder of the licence will, in fact, be the registered company and as such will be held responsible for any offences which they might commit under the Road Traffic Acts or any other relevant legislation.  I am grateful for that information.  I also note that the Minister is to give further consideration when introducing this Bill in the other House and, indeed, when considering the question in the road traffic context, to making the absence of insurance a very special type of offence which would give rise to disqualification from the operation of a carrier's licence.  I support the Minsiter very strongly in that regard.</P>
      <P>The other points that have been raised by Senators on the other side, and particularly by Senator O'Toole, regarding the shape, size, description and identification of the carrier's licence are also very important.  I am sure they can be looked after in ministerial regulations made under the Principal Act.  It is important that they should be raised here and ventilated.  This is our opportunity to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am similarly impressed with the Minister's open approach to the matter. <Col N="1326" /> I realise that it is not always easy to explain to Members of the House the full background to the decision to make a particular section operative and to draft it in a particular way.  The Minister has gone as far as we could reasonably expect him to go in ensuring that, for a technical piece of legislation like this, we are satisfied that it is now in a sufficiently good state to send it to the other House, confident in the knowledge that they, in their usual efficient manner, will also examine it and that it can be enacted as a piece of legislation which not only has had the benefit of the parliamentary draftsman's input and the ministerial input but has had the benefit of the input of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister is to be congratulated on that.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stage today.</P>
    <P>Bill received for final consideration and passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a very detailed debate on section 15 arising from the amendments which were put down by Senator Robinson.  I would like to thank the Senators for their contributions to this debate.  The section, as it <Col N="1327" /> stands, provides that a member or employee of the agency would cease to be such a member or employee if he were nominated as a Member of the Seanad or nominated as a candidate for election to the Dáil or Seanad, or nominated as a candidate for election to the European Parliament except that, in the case of persons who might be nominated as replacement members of the European Parliament, the disqualification would take place only when he was actually regarded as elected to the Assembly to fill a vacancy.  In the case of an employee of the agency the section provides that he would, in such cases, be on secondment from the agency until he either fails to be elected or withdraws his candidature or ceases to be a member of the body in question.</P>
      <P>The amendments put down by Senator Robinson do not seek to alter the principle of disqualification of members of the Dáil or Seanad or of the European Assembly from membership of or employment by the agency but seeks to provide that such persons would cease to be members of the agency or be seconded from employment with the agency only when actually elected to the Dáil or Seanad or elected to the European Assembly.  On Committee Stage the proposed amendments were strongly supported by several Senators.  It was contended that valuable people might be lost to the agency because of nomination for election, whereas they may not, in fact, be elected.</P>
      <P>It was also mentioned by Senator O'Leary that a person may be nominated for election to the Seanad without his consent and that once nominated he has no right to withdraw.  In the light of the discussion of this section, the matter has now been reconsidered and I am in a position to accept the principle of the amendments put down by Senator Robinson. It will be necessary, however, to give some further consideration to the precise wording of the amendments in consultation with the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> I propose, therefore, with the agreement of the House, that these amendments should be dealt with on Report Stage.  I should also mention at this stage, even though it is not strictly appropriate, that I propose also to introduce an amendment to section 5 taking into account the views expressed by Senator O'Leary on that section.  I propose that these amendments should be dealt with on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Doubts, too, were expressed about the exclusions mentioned in that section.  In future, parliamentary draftsmen should not be the people who will decide who should be excluded.  Possibly parliamentary draftsmen should be excluded from running for any public office.  We saw in the recent local elections that people who were working for local authorities and who were elected had to make a choice as to whether they held their jobs or resigned their seat.  Somebody with a position in a local authority who runs for elective office should not lose his job.  Anybody who has the necessary ability and the skills to sit on any board should be allowed to do so.  They should not be excluded because of the fact that they ran for elective office at any level, whether or not they were elected.</P>
      <P>The parliamentary draftsmen seem to be the people we are running away from and I sincerely hope that the statement by the Minister that he is considering a revision of the rules will be carried forward into every Bill.  For this House and the other House that is one of the most important statements made for many years.  The Minister said he is prepared to reconsider the situation regarding the nominations of people who are eligible for any board.  Nobody should be stopped from standing for elective office irrespective of what the parliamentary draftsmen think.  I hope it will not apply only to Seanad or Dáil Members, and that it will go right through society in general. Anyone, irrespective of his position should be able to stand for any office without losing his job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister very much as one of the people who contributed to the discussion on the amendment to section 15.  The Minister's suggestion is very practical.  It is another example of a very enlightened approach towards this House.  The Minister can be assured of a welcome when he introduces an amendment to section 15 and, indeed, to section 5 on Report Stage.  We understand the difficulties the Minister had with regard to drafting section 15 in particular, and the amendments to section 15.  There are difficulties involved and we recognise and understand that.</P>
      <P>Having listened to what Senator Robinson said, I think it is true to say that what she was interested in establishing was the principle rather than the individual words.  The Minister has quite accurately reflected the views of the House.  The House is not stuck with these words or these amendments in any way whatsoever.  We want to make a statement that a slight change in the disqualification of Members and candidates for both Houses of the Oireachtas is overdue. The Minister should be congratulated in this regard.  Senator Robinson is not here but I certainly will not be pushing any of these to a vote at this stage because the Minister's undertaking to the House more than meets the difficulties and problems which were presented here on the last occasion.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, not moved.</P>

      <P>Section 21 (1) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the consent of the Minister, the Agency may accept gifts of <Col N="1330" /> money, land and other property upon such trusts and conditions (if any) as may be specified by the donor.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why this is included? Is it anticipated that the agency will be the recipient of gifts?  Is there a source which is being covered there, or is it only a general provision?  It says that the agency shall not solicit gifts or donations. Would the Minister indicate the reason for this rather unusual section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a standard provision. There is no particular reason for it in this Bill except that it is a general standard provision to enable gifts of money, land or other property to be accepted by the agency subject to the consent of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 21 (4) states:</P>
      <P>Any funds of the Agency, being a gift or the proceeds of a gift to it, may, subject to any terms or conditions of the gift, be invested in any manner in which a trustee is empowered by law to invest trust funds.</P>
      <P>Will the agency be liable to income tax or corporation tax in respect of their income in that regard?  I do not expect the Minister to have an answer now. Obviously, somebody will have to decide whether these things will be taxable.  It is a point which will be met sometime in the future.</P>
      <P>Secondly, is it intended that gifts given to the agency should be liable for capital gift tax, or how is the taxation element of that gift going to be dealt with?  I do not think it would be necessary to amend section 21 but the Minister might examine it so that those who establish the agency will be in a position to deal with these problems when they arise and be able to advise people who might give gifts to the agency what the taxation implications of their decision would be.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister comment on and define what is really meant by &ldquo;not consistent with the functions of <Col N="1331" /> the Agency&rdquo;?  If somebody gave a donation or gift out of the goodness of his heart, how do you define what is not consistent with the functions of the agency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>To get back to Senator O'Leary's point, I arranged to have that aspect of the matter examined and I hope to have this information on Report Stage. On Senator Fallon's point, it would appear that it would be quite obvious if there were conditions attaching to any gift or attached to it by the donor, it should be clear to the board whether the conditions were consistent or inconsistent with the functions of the agency.  I do not think it should be that difficult to make a decision on whether conditions were consistent or inconsistent with the functions of the agency.</P>

Donors cannot subsequently state what their intentions were at the time of making the donations.  If they state them at the time of making them and if they seem to be at variance with the functions of the agency, that would have to be ironed out before the agency could accept such a gift.</P>

      <P>Could I again query section 21 (3) that &ldquo;the Agency shall not solicit gifts or donations&rdquo;?  I would have thought that because of the nature of the area we are dealing with there might be nothing wrong with seeking or soliciting donations, gifts or bequests of some type or other.  I do not see anything wrong with it because of the nature of the agency and the work involved.  I wonder if this would be normal standard practice.</P>

      <P>I have to support the Minister very strongly on that.  It would be quite inappropriate for an agency to be soliciting gifts because they would lose their independence if they did that.  In due course they could become partly funded by a private enterprise.  One of the things which we have been trying to insert in this Bill is as much independence as possible.  Our old discussion on sections 4 and 5 was to try to build up the independence of the agency and keep them separate even from the State.  To try to bring about a situation where part of their funds would in due course be got by solicited gifts would ruin or certainly seriously affect the independence that we were trying to develop and foster on Committee Stage.  For that reason I support the Minister's contention in respect of the Bill.  I understand what Senator Fallon is saying with regard to other pieces of legislation which come before us and might not necessarily apply.  It is important that this agency would have a measure of independence; establishing a link between itself and donations would at best place a strain on and might well destroy it.  For those reasons I support the Bill as drafted in respect of this piece of legislation.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give legal effect to the decision taken by the then Government in October 1982 to discontinue the licensing of bulls.  The Bill will also provide legislative powers to control bulls used for breeding purposes and to make regulations specifying the circumstances in which persons will be issued with a permit to keep an unregistered bull and the fees to be charged in connection with the issue of such permits.</P>
      <P>The Livestock Breeding Act, 1925 was designed to control the quality of bulls used for breeding in Ireland.  Under the Act inspections of bulls were carried out mainly by temporary inspectors who were selected for their knowledge of cattle.  Some 7,000 bulls were inspected annually at over 400 approved centres. Between 85 and 90 per cent of the bulls presented for inspection were passed by the inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1925 there have been many developments in livestock breeding &mdash; artificial insemination, progeny testing, performance testing, changes in animal husbandry and the introduction of new breeds of cattle.  These developments were reflected in the type of bull in respect of which licences or permits were granted over the years.  In all cases bulls had to be inspected visually under the licensing scheme.  Practically all the <Col N="1334" /> applications were for pure-bred bulls entered or eligible for entry in the herd book of the relevant breed society.  In general, non pure-bred bulls were not licensed for breeding.</P>
    <P>However, where and whenever conditions so warranted, exceptions to this general practice were made.  For example, non-pedigree Shorthorn bulls of exceptional merit were eligible for licensing throughout the country.  In the Kerry cattle area non-pedigree Kerry bulls were also eligible for licensing.  Following the first importation of Charolais and Simmental bulls in the early seventies there was widespread concern that the supply of such bulls from the herd-book sector would not meet the demand. Accordingly, as an interim measure, it was decided to inspect for licence, initially, half, or higher continental cross-bred bulls.  As the numbers of continental pure-bred bulls increased, however, the percentage of continental blood required in the cross-bred for licensing was progressively increased to threequarters and seven-eights.</P>
    <P>Under the old licensing arrangements, there were two rounds of inspections annually, in spring and autumn, followed by two rounds of appeal inspections. Additionally, an annual search, more commonly known as &ldquo;the comb&rdquo;, for unlicensed bulls was carried out.  As bull inspections had to be completed by specific dates, and as large numbers of bulls were inspected at over 400 approved centres, bull licensing was quite expensive to administer.  The inspection system, at current prices, cost about £160,000 annually, whereas receipts by way of licence fees amounted to only £4,000.  This left the nett cost of this service to the Exchequer at around £156,000 annually.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the costs involved to the Exchequer, the previous Government decided in October 1982 to discontinue the existing system of bull licensing. The present Government endorsed this decision and announced that licences would not be required for the keeping of bulls in 1983.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> EC Council Directive 77/504 on pure-bred breeding animals provides for the harmonisation of breeding quality standards and for such related matters as the recognition of breeders' organisations and associations, establishment and recognition of herd books, standards governing entry of animals into herd books, etc.  In essence, the directive is stipulating that the quality of animals entering the herd book should be of a good standard and that such quality control should be exercised by the breed society concerned.  However, the directive does not cover the use of non-pure bred bulls.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of the decision to discontinue bull licensing, the practical consequence was that there was no restriction on the use of bulls for breeding purposes.  This gave rise to considerable concern by sections of the cattle and beef industry about the possible adverse effects on the quality of the national cattle herd and on the export trade in cattle, beef and beef products.  It was contended that the absence of controls on the use of non pure-bred bulls for breeding purposes would result in the more widespread use of genetically inferior animals, with a consequential deterioration in the quality of the progeny. Additionally, it was claimed that the abolition of licensing could dilute the effectiveness of other measures being taken to improve the national herd.</P>
    <P>In the light of those views, I requested the Cattle Advisory Committee, who are broadly representative of the cattle industry, to examine the matter.  The Cattle Advisory Committee advised that the interests of the industry as a whole would best be served by the official authorisation for breeding of only pure-bred bulls registered in the herd book of the relevant breed society and the committee urged that appropriate steps be taken to implement that recommendation.</P>
    <P>Agriculture accounts for roughly a quarter of our total exports.  The cattle sector accounts for about 75 per cent of agricultural exports and about 13 per cent <Col N="1336" /> of total exports.  Because of the importance of cattle to the national economy it is essential in the national interest to ensure that the quality of output from the national cattle breeding herd is capable of satisfying the demands of the market &mdash; largely an export one &mdash; and at the same time capable of giving a good financial return to the producer.  The national breeding herd provides the raw material for both the dairy and beef industries. Indeed, a unique feature of the breeding herd is the considerable cross-breeding that takes place &mdash; about two-thirds of the beef output comes from the Friesian cow population.  An important element in the quality of production from the cattle sector is the genetic merit of the breeding stock.  Cattle breeding should be approached on a population basis to ensure that an effective national breeding programme operates.</P>
    <P>As 80 per cent of our beef output and 65 per cent of our milk output are exported it is very important that we remain competitive internationally.  To do this, we must continually improve the quality of our stock and match the progress being made by our competitors. Improvement and changes to meet needs in our livestock can be brought about by evaluation and measurement of the merit of individual animals and by selecting the best as parents of the next generation.</P>
    <P>By repeating the process of identification and selection of superior breeding animals gradual and steady cumulative improvement takes place generation after generation.</P>
    <P>The recording, evaluation and selection to bring about genetic improvement takes place usually in the pedigree sector. It is important that such genetic improvement is disseminated to the wider cattle breeding population, thus ensuring the continuing improvement of the national herd.  Dissemination is carried out efficiently by commercial producers continually using bulls from the improved herd-book sector either as natural service sires or through the artificial insemination service.  Bulls in AI usually undergo an additional phase of selection based on performance of their progeny <Col N="1337" />&mdash; progeny testing &mdash; thus ensuring the highest merit in AI bulls.</P>
    <P>A further reason for concentrating on herd-book registered bulls is the desirability of identifying the genetic make-up of an animal at the various stages of production.  This country has many markets for its cattle and cattle products &mdash; each with its particular specifications. We have currently in the national cattle herd many breeds each with its own characteristics and suitability to fulfill the various market needs.  Many of the requirements for markets are met best by cross-breeding.  It is desirable that the breed make-up of the cattle be predictable from visual assessment &mdash; this is usually done by colour pattern combined with other minor indicators.  Use of pure-bred bulls gives identification with a reasonable degree of accuracy.  The significant widespread use of cross-bred bulls, on the other hand, gives undesirable variation in many traits of importance including colour which makes evaluation of genetic make-up and suitability for particular markets much more difficult.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate in the Dáil on this Bill many Deputies referred to the difficulties that would be experienced by many small suckler herds especially in the west of Ireland in purchasing and using pedigree beef bulls and argued that artificial insemination, because of their farming system, did not always offer a practicable alternative.  In deference to the wishes of the Deputies, I have agreed that for a limited period of three years beef suckler herds with up to a maximum of 20 cows will be granted permits to keep quality non-pedigree bulls.  The bulls must be inspected and passed by officers of the Department of Agriculture prior to the granting of permits.</P>
    <P>There are 58,000 beef herds in Ireland with 377,000 cows in the beef suckler cow scheme with an average cow herd size of 6.5 cows.  I expect, that as heretofore, many of these will continue to use artificial insemination.  Indeed, I now understand that a number of AI stations have introduced a synchronised artificial insemination service resulting in higher levels <Col N="1338" /> of treated cow &mdash; 65 per cent approximately &mdash; proving in-calf.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a person must have a permit issued under the Act if he has an unregistered bull.  The circumstances in which permits will be issued will be laid down in regulations made under the Act.  Permits will be issued for bulls kept for research purposes, bull beef production and similar enterprises, beef suckler herds, as defined by the scheme of premiums for maintaining suckler cows, to keep quality non-pedigree beef bulls for breeding purposes, and for pure-bred bulls registered in any herd book not recognised under Commission Decision EEC No. 84/247.  This decision lays down the criteria for the recognition of breeders organisations which maintain herd books.  For registered bulls, that is those entered in official herd-books, the breed society will issue a certificate for each bull entered in its herd-book.</P>
    <P>The permits or certificates must be produced on demand to Department of Agriculture officials or the Garda Síochána when they are checking on the status of bulls under the Act.  Inspectors and gardaí will have powers to enter land and to examine bulls found on that land.</P>
    <P>If a person is believed to have an unregistered bull or a bull without a valid permit, he will be allowed 28 days to apply for a permit for the bull or else have the bull castrated or slaughtered. He can make representations against a direction to have the bull castrated or slaughtered.  Should he ignore the direction to have the bull castrated or slaughtered, the Minister will be empowered to have this done at the owner's expense. The Bill sets out the maximum penalties that can be imposed for various offences under the Act.  Finally, the Live Stock Breeding Act of 1925 is repealed by this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as it constitutes a contribution to the upgrading of our cattle herd generally, both beef and dairy herds.  The beef industry is of such importance that no effort should be spared in improving and advancing it.  It is a £1,000 million <Col N="1339" /> industry and 65 per cent to 80 per cent of its product is exported.  It is very import-and that we should continue to find new markets for our beef and, having found those markets, that we should be able to supply top quality beef.</P>
      <P>In recent years we have seen a steady increase in exports to countries like Egypt, Libya and other countries unheard of some years ago.  The contracts with those countries have put millions of pounds into the pockets of Irish farmers. The people involved in securing the contracts, the personnel from the Department of Agriculture and the meat trade, such as Larry Goodman and Séamus Purcell, are to be complimented on their success in this area.  If we have a quality product to sell it makes the work of our exporters much easier.  For that reason it is imperative that only the best bulls are used.  As 80 per cent of our beef output and 65 per cent of our milk output are exported, it is very important that we remain competitive internationally.  To do this, we must continually improve the quality of our stock and, even though this may take years and cost much money in the process, it is the only way forward.</P>
      <P>The AI stations throughout the country are doing a good job in making available to farmers bulls of very high quality.  It is unfortunate that the Government should have decided this year to discontinue the AI subsidy.  This subsidy which, I understand, is still available in Northern Ireland, succeeded in making available, even to farmers in remote areas, the services of top class pedigree bulls.  If the Government are really serious about improving the quality of our national herd, they should restore that subsidy immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the dairy sector there is still much to be done, even though the AI service has been available for over 30 years now. The milk yield of our dairy cows is slightly more than half of that of our Danish counterparts.  In this day and age this situation should not obtain and a yield of 1,200 gallons per cow should be the norm. If the Danes can do it, why can we not do it?  Our climatic conditions are suitable <Col N="1340" /> and our pastures are renowned for their production of lush green grass.  Let us get our act together and select the best sires so that we can withstand the challenge in the market place from our competitors.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this Bill will create problems for farmers in the disadvantaged areas who may not be able to afford the service of a pedigree bull or who, because of the remoteness of their farms, may not be able to avail of such service.  In such cases the Minister has power under section 3 to grant a permit to a farmer, on payment of the prescribed fee, to have in his possession an unregistered non-pedigree bull, subject to, and in accordance with such conditions as may be prescribed in the permit.</P>
    <P>In agreeing to insert this section in the Bill, the Minister is accepting that farmers in the disadvantaged areas have special problems and need special treatment to overcome those problems.  The concession allowed under this section may not satisfy herd-owners in the disadvantaged areas and, perhaps, the Minister should go the whole way and exclude from the provisions of the Bill certain areas along the western seaboard where farmers will be unable, because of the financial hardships this new law will impose on them, to provide a pure-bred pedigree bull.</P>
    <P>Farmers in the disadvantaged areas have traditionally provided store cattle for the rest of the country and I believe that will still provide good stores even if this law is never enacted.  Farmers fully realise the importance of having good quality animals with good conformation etc.  It is only by producing good quality animals that they can maximise profits from their farms.  I believe that, with a little modification, this Bill will go some way towards helping farmers to produce top quality animals.  For that reason I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill very strongly and to congratulate the Minister and all concerned with its compilation.  It is very obviously a positive move forward and a positive step towards improving the standard of our <Col N="1341" /> livestock, which at present leaves a great deal to be desired.  There is great urgency about improving the quality of our livestock. The standard of our beef cattle in many instances leaves a good deal to be desired, particularly in the context of an era when we have new classification methods and new standards expected from us.  Farmers selling cattle in some instances are finding themselves in an extremely awkward and difficult position by having a product at the finishing stages which is worth considerably less than it would have been had they got the basic article right on day one.</P>
      <P>Regardless of what is said about visual assessments, appearances and all the rest, there is no way that the genetic aspect of breeding can be left aside.  Feeding, care and so on can give a misleading and distorted picture of the actual quality of the stock, particularly bulls for breeding. In the past with liberal and good feeding practices many bulls were brought to a stage of artificial appearance that did not convey the true genetic qualities of the animals.  For that reason, we could not over-emphasise the importance of adhering, in so far as it can be done, to the concept of the pure bred animal and, coupled with that, all the other aspects that come into play as well.</P>
      <P>We cannot over-state the importance of our agricultural industry.  That has been stated in this House before and, indeed, in other places too.  We sometimes fail to recognise that 25 per cent of our total exports are agricultural produce. That is not always recognised.  A very sizeable proportion of it comes from the cattle sector which includes beef, milk and ancillary products.  We, therefore, could not overestimate that one.  We must also take into account the very high percentage of our total population directly and indirectly involved in the agricultural sector.  We are talking about 45 per cent, or thereabouts, between direct employment, farmers on the land, indirect employment, people involved in processing, marketing, and so on.  That is a very significant number of the labour force involved in the agricultural scene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the modification made by <Col N="1342" /> the Minister in the Bill which allows, through a ministerial regulation for up to a three year period, people to keep non-pedigree animals provided they have been inspected in the first instance, under permit and then licensed.  I also welcome the fact that it applies not alone to the disadvantaged areas but to the entire country.  This is a very important matter because, frankly, many people outside the disadvantaged areas would be very hard hit if the non-disadvantaged areas were to be excluded.  I do not take from the fact that disadvantaged areas have particular problems, but there are many areas outside the disadvantaged part of the country that suffer just as great hardship but because of lines drawn here, there and elsewhere they are excluded.</P>
    <P>I particularly congratulate the Minister for including the entire country in this.  It is a very positive step forward.  It will enable people to have a pure bred bull at the end of three years or make whatever arrangements are appropriate.  It applies exclusively to suckler herds throughout the country.  It leaves the small dairy farmer in any part of the country one likes to choose, in a position where he is not covered by this scene.  The biggest argument, of course, was that the suckler herd was the most difficult problem here. The animals in the suckler herd were the hardest with regard to heat detection, the hardest to get rounded up for insemination purposes, and so on.  Nevertheless there are small dairy farmers who should be considered in the context of some assistance <i>vis-a-vis</i> AI subsidy.  This would help along that route.  After the three year period the Minister of the day can review the matter and see what the needs are.  This has been very correctly done by the Minister and the people in his Department.</P>
    <P>There are a few things that I feel are worthy of mention.  For example, while reference was made in the Minister's speech this morning to Garda Síochána or officials of his Department going to the inspection scene, in so far as it can be done, the Garda Síochána should be left out of this kind of situation.  It is my understanding that only in extreme cases <Col N="1343" /> would that be entertained in any event and it would be a matter for the Department officials to be involved in inspections.</P>
    <P>The other point that strikes me very forcibly is the last part of the Minister's speech when he talked about the 28 days grace allowed to people who may have broken the law in this regard.  Frankly, that is fairly liberal.  While I am not suggesting a more penal approach to it, it should be acknowledged for what it is, a very generous approach to the matter in so far as everybody is being given an opportunity to put his house in order under that provision.</P>
    <P>I want to again stress very briefly the question of quality because we are finding that for beef and beef products we have loads of markets but the price in many of these markets is not very good.  We have markets in Libya and other places but at a price.  May I stress at a price?  It is easy to sell something at a giveaway price. Quite frankly, while markets are always welcome, if the price level is not reasonably satisfactory, it is of little value to the person producing the article and the person handling the article and selling it. For that reason, I believe we must not concentrate and rely too much on places like Libya for the exportation of our stock where, in fact, standards expected and asked for are very low but, may I hastily add, so are prices.</P>
    <P>We must bear this in mind and we must not get very excited about doing great deals with the Libyans and others who are not prepared to pay prices for our produce.  We must hit at the markets that are most demanding of us <i>vis-a-vis</i> quality, which are most lucrative.  It is very important that these markets are aimed at, that we live up to the requirements of these markets, that we are in a position to supply these markets and that our farmers, in the first instance, have the raw material to produce, that our produce is catered for and treated in such a manner that at the end of the day it will hit these markets.  I am talking of European and other non-third world markets in this regard because there has <Col N="1344" /> been too much highlighting of third world markets.  The Libyan trade has been exaggerated out of all proportion.</P>
    <P>As a person with involvement in the trade, with a knowledge of the difficulties of the trade and what is required at any given time, I know there is no point in having an outlet for a product unless you get a reasonable price for it.  I would like to stress the point that achieving a market in itself is not the answer.  When we achieve a market we pay the price.  You must accept that if you get a good price for something you must produce good quality.  This Bill certainly sets out to do that.  In fact, as was indicated earlier, it is updating the livestock regulations and ensuring that what we produce will meet the challenges which we are facing.  Since 1925, when the first Livestock Act was introduced until fairly recently, we had little movement of regulations or changes although we had certain shortcomings in our livestock regulations.  We have seen in recent years dramatic changes.  By recent years I mean ten, 12 or 14 years. We have seen dramatic changes in the last ten, 12 or 14 years.  We have seen many excellent continental breeds coming into this country, of the beef type in particular, and we make the best use of those breeds.  We must not allow scrub bulls to be used for getting cows in calf.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this new regulation emanated from the Cattle Advisory Committee.  I have every confidence in their recommendations and I fully support the views that they have put forward to the Minister with regard to cattle breeding.  One could speak <i>ad nauseam</i> about this but one is also reminded, as the Minister said of the EC requirement that as a member of the EC, we have got to adhere to certain rules and regulations in various matters, including livestock breeding.  We know that a big proportion of our livestock exports come from the dairy herd and, therefore, we must have the right article coming from that source. There is also the desirability of increasing the suckler herd or the beef herd, which is extremely important.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to be welcomed.  It is a very positive step forward on the part of our <Col N="1345" /> Minister and our Government in endeavouring to upgrade the quality of our livestock for whatever market is available to us.  It is absolutely vital that we are never confined to selling in a market that accepts only inferior type stock.  It is very serious if farmers get it into their minds that there is an outlet in such and such a place.  We must recognise that high standards have been acquired and in return for them we will get worth-while prices.  I warmly welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister and all concerned with its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few things to say to the Minister's officials.  The Minister is just a rubber stamp in my view.  I have had experience of this down the years.  Very few Ministers get through to the civil servants in the Department of Agriculture.  Some of the personnel here today worked with some of the Ministers and more of them have never worked with them.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill to repeal the 1925 Act.  Of course, it is a necessity.  I was never in favour of the discontinuation of licensing in this country.  Letting farmers run amuck with all types of unlicensed animals tends to reduce the standard of the stock and affects the store trade more than the dairy trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from the west where I can say categorically that the standard has dropped considerably since the thirties, forties and fifties.  While we have had the introduction of continental breeds, progeny testing and AI, which tended to give a better type bull to the farmer, any breeder or any cattle exporter will tell you that the breed in the west has dropped considerably from the standard we had in the thirties, forties and fifties.  Why did that happen?  It happened for two good reasons.  The west of Ireland farmer had access to a good stock bull after the reintroduction of the 1925 Act and there was a good selection of good type quality bulls available in close proximity to small farmers.  You brought the animal to the bull that suited your cow or heifer, whereas later on you rang up the AI and an inspector arrived with a number of <Col N="1346" /> bulls identified by GLD, TCP, or whatever you want to call it under these headings and the farmer had no visual assessment of what type of animal was in that tube.  As a result it very often did not meet the requirements of the farmer and when the progeny arrived it was not a suitable animal to mate with that type of animal.</P>
    <P>Breeding needs experience in any type of livestock.  It is very important in the horse industry.  If you bring the wrong sire to your mare you will have the wrong type of foal.  The same applies to cattle. There is no screening at all on the maiden heifers going to the bull.  If you have a good trade for beef heifers and for store heifers in an area, you tend to give the bull to the one you do not sell at the mart or heretofore, the heifer you did not sell at the fair.  For that reason you are giving the bull to the lesser type maiden heifer you have in your herd at any given time. That, of course, gives you a calf that is not up to standard.  While we introduced a Bill to cover the breeding of bulls, we have never done anything as regards scrutinising the heifers mated with this bull. There is no selection whatever except the private selection of the farmer.  That is geared to those left over after sales of beef and stores.  It does not tend to give you the proper type animal.  I regret to say this but I have experience in this field of activity.  Senator Ellis will bear out what I have said.  He knows the trade very well.  Continental breeds have fast maturity and if the new type hormones that are being introduced, which I am not too keen on, for fast production are not properly administered they can give you an animal that can go screwy.  It looks worse after a considerable length of time when the hormones are not given at the proper time.  I have had experience of that also and I am totally against giving hormones to any animal for slaughter especially in the case of the heifer breed where the meat is for human consumption within the State.  I think hormones should not be used at all, but they are used very effectively in some cases with bullocks.  For that reason we have quick growth, not always in the <Col N="1347" /> continental breeds but the continental breeds tend to give you bigger conformation and faster-growing animals but do not always give you the required quality for a store trade.  You sell your store cattle on visual assessment and conformation. If you are going for beef, you are selling on the hook and you are selling by weight and the conformation does not come into play as much as if you have to go into the ring with a store animal where you must sell through visual assessment and quality and conformation.</P>
    <P>I would welcome this Bill if it does anything to give you upgrading of the quality in our store animals.  I say to the Department officials: you do not run a scheme from Kildare Street and if you try to run an effective scheme from Kildare Street you are wasting your time.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that his staff go down the country where the operation is taking place and see it for themselves.  They are too much in the office administering by the pen.  They should go down the country and be practical and see what is happening and I can assure them that they will have the best possible results coming back.  They will get the best results from practical experience in the field of activity.  That is where you learn it all: you learn nothing in offices.  You only administer the legislation that is before you and you do not know if it is working because you do not see it in operation.  I appeal to the Minister to let his Department's officials go down the country to find out for themselves how these schemes are operating on the ground.  That is the best advice I could give the Minister at this time.</P>
    <P>You have to be very selective in beef breeds.  You have to be very selective in the selection of bulls and maiden heifers but in the dairy produce you are going on the milk, lactation period and butter fat. Statistical progeny testing will bring that about.  In beef breeds it is a different matter and I think procuring the proper bull for the proper animal is something we should pursue through An Foras Talúntais and use that means of giving <Col N="1348" /> the farmers the best knowledge possible to ensure that he is getting the best type of animal and the best breeds mated to each other.  I am sorry that the Shorthorn breed have gone off the market.  I would love to see their return for a base stock in this country.  We should never have lost them.  With the introduction of the Friesian herd, for greater volumes of milk the shorthorn was the best dual purpose cow and I think that is well known to everybody.</P>
    <P>I want to mention two things that may be regarded as personal.  I experienced a certain amount of embarrassment in the purchase of bulls for export at Ballsbridge.  When you purchased a premium bull at Ballsbridge and exported it to Scotland, under the licensing classification laws there the Scottish Department did not accept the classification and licensing of this country.  If you wanted to keep that bull in Scotland you had to take him to England, have him licensed there, then reimport him into Scotland before he was eligible under the Scottish Ministry regulations.  I think that is an embarrassment to our veterinary authorities here and I ask the Department officials does that still obtain?  Are our licensing regulations not acceptable to the Scottish Ministry?  If they are not, and if you still have to take a bull from Scotland into England to have him relicensed to import him into Scotland, then it is about time that our officials pursued the matter to ensure that we can have EC standardised licensing that would be the same throughout the EC countries.  I think what I described is a disgraceful situation &mdash; to have Irish exporters purchasing premium Hereford bulls, or any type of bulls, in Ballsbridge, exporting them to Scotland and England and they are found not to be up to the standard because they have a different type of standard in Scotland and England.</P>
    <P>I would also point out to the Minister, while we are introducing this Bill, that we have a number of islands off the west coast where they are now using unlicensed bulls.  They have no other bulls; they have no access to AI.  Because of the small number of cows on the various <Col N="1349" /> islands it is not profitable for anyone to keep a stock bull and unless there is some trained person on the islands to administer the AI services in a do-it-yourself scheme, or employed by the north-western AI station in Sligo, there will be no pedigree progeny.  It has happened over the last three years that Clare Island had no pedigree bull.  About 20 cows there at the moment are being served by their sons and by other scrub or unlicensed bulls and that is a dreadful situation because they live in an isolated area.  I ask the Minister to take particular interest in the islands of Inishturk, Boffin and Clare as regards breeding because they have no access to AI, they have no stock bulls and they have to use whatever is available.  I have seen the cattle coming from the island; they are all right when they are calved but when they start to grow they get more non-presentable for markets and they do not fetch good prices when they come to the mainland.  In the islands where there is not access to AI, or it is not profitable to have a stock bull, something should be done by way of compensation to give the people in these islands the same facilities as the people on the mainland have.  Under the Constitution they are entitled to that.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to move Department officials or to tell them this.  I am saying it publicly today; somebody might hear me and somebody might heed.  There is no licensed bull on any of the west of Ireland islands at the moment and they use unlicensed bulls because they must do so.  It is the duty of the Department of Agriculture to see that something is done in that regard, whether it be to increase subsidisation for AI or to send in a stock bull and pay someone to hold him there and upgrade the stock on the islands.  I welcome anything that will improve the standard of cattle.  We have gone back rather than forward.  I agree with Senator Hussey about the introduction of garda.  What young garda would know whether an animal had been squeezed on a farm or a commonage from his visual assessment?  He would have to take an animal in for examination off a commonage. First of all, he is not qualified <Col N="1350" /> to examine an animal and secondly, by the time the animal is examined by a proper veterinary inspector the animal will have been treated.  So, you are wasting your time talking about Department officials running around commonages in cars, or bicycles, or whatever, trying to assess visually whether that animal is over six months, whether he is in proper condition to serve a cow in the commonage, and if he is licensed.  First, they will not get near him to see if he is tagged or if he is a properly licensed bull.  It is a waste of time.  That is why I am saying to the officials that they must be practical and get out of the offices in Kildare Street, come down the country and see the terrain the farmers have to breed their animals on.</P>
    <P>I would welcome an exemption for the greater parts of the foothills.  A great case has been made here by the Sneem people in connection with a three-quarter or half-bred bull to run with animals.  It is necessary to give some exemptions in these areas.  This is happening anyway and this Bill will not cure it or clear it. You are as well off to legislate for what will be a reality tomorrow.  All we are asking you to do is to legislate for a practical situation that we cannot avoid and will not avoid under the circumstances in which we live in this type of terrain and in isolated island areas.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to take into consideration these isolated areas and to do something to deal with a three-quarter bull or a seven-eights bull.  These bulls are much better than bulls that are unlicensed in which case you may have inbreeding and produce nothing.  I appeal to the Minister to examine these isolated areas and I welcome any improvement in the Bill that will improve our stock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the decontrol of the registration of bulls some years ago was indeed a retrograde step. For that reason, I welcome the Minister's decision to introduce registration again and to make a determined effort to upgrade the quality of the national herd. However, I am not happy with several aspects of this Bill.  I support what the <Col N="1351" /> Bill sets out to do but, on reading section 8 and parts of section 6, one would be inclined to question the national order of priorities.  For instance, how important to society is the scrub bull or the problems of scrub bulls when we see stronger powers being given to the gardaí and Department inspectors than were given in the very controversial Criminal Justice Bill last year?</P>
      <P>A number of problems arise.  If we take the ordinary commercial, well-organised farmer, there is absolutely no reason why he should not have a top class stock bull on his farm if he is in the top echelon of farmers in the dairy industry.  The AI service have for some time now provided a do-it-yourself kit.  Not only do they provide the kit and the semen but also the training necessary to use it.  Certainly that development improves farm management and the economics of it.  But when one comes down to small farmers, especially where a farm is run by a widow or an elderly spinster, to talk about penalties of £250, £500 or £600 is outrageous. In the main, it is a small category of people who are not able to tackle these problems or have someone to castrate calves in time, who always create the problem.  This is not new.  We had the problem of scrub bulls in the country when registration was there.  It is the same people who are in trouble year in, year out.  I do not think the Department have learned anything from their experience of 20 years ago.  It is nothing new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points that were very clearly made by the previous speaker are valid.  Subsection (1) of section 8 mentions a fine not exceeding £600 and subsection (2) mentions a fine of £250 for not producing a permit while you can drive around any part of the country in an untaxed or uninsured car and you will not be fined £250 for not producing a certificate of insurance, not will you be fined £600 even if you are convicted.  I would like to know exactly why the Department find it necessary to do that.  On the other end of the scale they make things very easy for themselves.  Under section 7, service of notices, they take it on themselves to <Col N="1352" /> identify a 16 year old person so that they can serve notice on anyone they meet in the place.  Why did they pick 16 years of age?  Has the age of majority gone done another two years since the Bill came in a few months ago?</P>
    <P>If they cannot find the owner of a scrub bull subsection (2) of section 7 states:</P>
    <P>If the name of the owner of a bull to which a notice under section 6 of this Act relates is not known and the name of such owner cannot be readily ascertained by reasonable enquiry, the notice may be addressed to the owner of the bull without naming him and may be served&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) by sending it by post to the lands on which the bull to which the notice relates is normally kept...</P>
    <P>If that is not the most stupid subsection I have read in 25 years in this House, it beats me.  It is really stupid and I am absolutely shocked that we have three Ministers in the Department of Agriculture and they should decide on that.  In the last number of years the Department have had an office in every county.  I compliment the Minister on that.  They know the farmers.  They know the herd numbers.  They are kept up-to-date and that service is excellent.  You can go into the office and you have the blue card.  In my own county since the present Minister took over, the Department introduced a service and has an office there.  There is one in every other county.  The service has been improved and there is no such thing as saying that the Department inspectors do not know the farmers, or do not know where they are, or do not know exactly what the situation is.  I see no reason for serving notice on kids or writing directly to the bull himself.</P>
    <P>That is unfortunate.  It is terribly important when we think of the value of the cattle industry that an all-out effort should be made to increase the quality of our beef and to produce beef which meets the requirements of and is regarded as palatable in the markets we now have.  I was impressed recently on a visit to the livestock breeding station in Enfield <Col N="1353" /> where such excellent work has been undertaken and where great strides and progress have been made in cattle breeding and the introduction of some new herds.  They have recently introduced bulls whose progeny will yield well over 2,000 gallons.  The result of the progeny testing of the recently introduced Canadian Hereford breed will give a great boost to the conformity and the general make-up of our breed.</P>
    <P>Many years ago I was disappointed at the change the then Government made &mdash; in the former Deputy Smith's time, I think &mdash; in demoting the dual purpose cow.  We had the two tried and trusted Shorthorn breeds at that time.  The Government took a decision to support and to promote the dairying breeds by introducing, in particular, the Friesians to this country.  That policy has served the farmers and indeed the national economy extremely well.  In latter years with the recognition of the grant importance of our beef exports, it is encouraging that the breeding units, such as that in Enfield, have worked so hard and have so successfully introduced bulls that will enhance the quality of beef and also improve the economics of producing beef.  That is something we must very clearly welcome.</P>
    <P>This Bill is entitled an Act to make provision for the regulation and control of bulls used for breeding, etc.  I assume the practice of rearing bull beef does not come under the scope of this Bill.  A semi-State organisation, Bord na Móna, have experienced a very prosperous season and have produced excellent results in producing top class bull beef on an experimental farm in Clonsast on what was formerly cut-over peatland.  Such units I assume do not come under the scope of this legislation.  Their results last year show very clearly that producing bull beef was much more profitable than using the implantation of hormones in the cattle that they were housing in the beef lot.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke of the difficulties on the islands.  The AI people may very well be able to supply the farm AI kits to some of those stations.  That would <Col N="1354" /> be quite an improvement, time-wise, for those people.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 6 (3) where a person has 14 days to make representations, I feel that 14 days is too short a period to make representations to the Department of Agriculture.  For that reason I should like to see that period extended.  It is not possible to get back the blue cards even from a local office in 14 days in my experience.  If you make a representation to the Department in Dublin, by the time it gets back the 14 days are up.  The elimination or eradication of scrub bulls is not of such great importance that this Bill should be as tough as drafted.  I want very clearly to record my dissatisfaction with that.</P>
    <P>Back in the fifties and early sixties when we had the registration of bulls, we also had very clearly defined and recognised rings associated with the passing of pedigree bulls.  This was all tied up with the economics of producing bulls for the various shows.  I hope the Minister will take every step to ensure that there is not a reintroduction of the same type of abuse.  In those years a limited number of people could produce any sort of a rig and get a certificate.  To get into the system then &mdash; I am speaking of about 20 years ago &mdash; was extremely difficult.  The inspectors who were passing these bulls at the bull shows in the town squares in every part of the country were in the main from the Department.  While it is possible to get away with some of those things the public are much more enlightened at present and I hope the same thing will not be attempted under this new legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to reintroduce the control of bulls.  It is important that we should not only breed cattle with greater capacity for milk production and should be able to compete with the 2,500 to 3,000 gallon cows that our competitors in Europe have at their disposal, but that we should also ensure that we are able to provide the best quality beef available. I should like to re-echo the sentiments expressed by some speakers on the question of the difficulty of the suckler herd-owner in getting his cows in calf again at the earliest possible opportunity.  The AI <Col N="1355" /> service is not a reliable service for the suckler herd.  The duration of heat is not as noticeable.  It is certainly more economic to let a stock bull run with a suckler herd.  For that reason, perhaps, the Minister may consider reintroducing the bull premiums that were operated by the Department through the county committees of agriculture for many years.  This was a system of subsidising the high cost of bulls &mdash; proportionately &mdash; in those years.  If it proves difficult for the smaller owners of suckler herds to acquire pure bred pedigree bulls, the Department should consider, rather than allowing those people to go out of business or to have the space between one lactation and another grow too wide, looking at some way of subsidising bull owners.</P>
    <P>In section 11 the Minister has very wide powers indeed so that he can introduce regulations to meet whatever problems may arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I welcome this Bill from the point of view of the national herd that it concerns.  It is important that we look at what the purposes of livestock breeding are, namely, to improve the quality of our cattle.  That is, to improve the dairy herd as far as lactation, butter fat and protein content are concerned, or to improve the beef herd as far as beef production is concerned.  In doing that, we want also to look at what our market needs are at the moment and to see what is required by our customers.  For the past five or six years the Irish beef producer has found that his biggest market has been in the third countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hourigan referred to the fact that they wanted an inferior quality product at a lower price.  The third countries are now becoming quite sophisticated in their demands.  They want cattle which are of a certain age, of reasonable conformation and with a minimum of fat content in the boned-out beef which is to be supplied to those contracts.  Therefore, it is important that we should look to see if we can improve our national herd and improve the quality of our beef production in order to go for the markets <Col N="1356" /> which are more lucrative, namely, the European markets, where there is quite a market for top-quality beef which we are not producing at the moment.</P>
    <P>The number of EIs killed in any factory in Ireland in any one week are few.  The numbers of E2s, U1s or U2s are very small, due to the fact that we have in the past 20 years allowed the standard of our cattle to drop considerably.  We are now in a situation where we have to go back and start to rebuild.  We have used the third countries for the past nine to ten years.  We are finding that their changes in requirements will mean that we will have to improve the sort of products with which we are going to supply them.  This is mainly due to the fact that we are now facing competition there from our European partners.</P>
    <P>We saw recently that the Minister for Agriculture had to go to Egypt to use his power to see that Ireland got a share of a contract which it was going to lose.  We see today that the price quoted is very low.  There is nobody to blame for those low prices, as far as seeking those markets for our beef products is concerned, except ourselves.  The CBF publish a weekly bulletin which is circulated throughout the world telling what prices have been accepted for particular contracts. This is something that is wrong. The net result is we have seen that our beef, which was worth 1,600 dollars a ton a couple of years ago is now worth 1,100 dollars to 1,200 dollars a ton.  We are bringing down the market around ourselves because we are allowing a State agency to circulate information which, in my opinion, should be confidential to the person who signs the contract and to the customer.  In doing so, we want to take a hard look at the operation of our beef marketing.  Having said that, it may not be that relevant to this Bill but it is important that somebody should say to us that it is time we stood up and looked at where we are heading.  We are going into a situation where we are becoming a nation of dumpers of Irish beef on third country markets.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be better if we had left this Bill on ice for three years because <Col N="1357" /> some of its proposals will not be implemented for three years.  The Minister stated that herd owners with up to a maximum of 20 suckler cows will be allowed to keep a quality non-pedigree bull.  Let us look at a quality non-pedigree bull.  If you take the cost of a non-pedigree bull to the farmer in comparison with the cost of a pedigree bull, the net result of the produce is false economy and very false economics on the farmer's part.  If the farmer decides that he is going to go out and buy a top-quality Charolais weanling which he wishes to use as an upgraded bull the following year, he will pay in the region of anything from £600 to £650 for that weanling.  He will feed him for six or eight months before he is of any use to him for service.  At that stage he can put on another £100 to £150 to him.  This means that before he uses the bull it has cost him £800.  If he wishes to go to a pedigree sale and buy a pedigree Charolais bull he will not have to pay more than £1,200 to £1,400.  The calves produced by the pedigree bull will be all Charolais whereas those produced by the mixed breed will show only 50 per cent of the true conformation of the breed.</P>
    <P>This is false economy because the other 50 per cent of the calves would be worth in the region of anything from £60 to £100 less than what the true-bred calves would be worth.  Here we are allowing farmers to shoot themselves in the foot by allowing them to use inferior quality bulls for their herds.  If one looks at the average herd size of the suckler herd it is at 6.5 cows.  The number of farmers who will be going in to buy pedigree bulls now will be so small over the next three years that no improvement is imminent as far as this Bill is concerned for at least five to six years.  Five or six years are being thrown away.  Three of those years could be saved if the proposals in the Bill had been implemented as and from next year.</P>
    <P>We can all understand the position of small farmers in the west.  I come from the west.  Those are the farmers who traditionally have bought pedigree bulls. They are the men who have borrowed and begged to be able to go out and buy <Col N="1358" /> a pedigree animal.  The farmers who have not used the pedigree bulls are the farmers in the south who are only worried about the milk.  All they want to do is get their cows in calf.  The calves did not matter.  They were thrown in to the trailer and sold at two days old.  As far as the farmer was concerned the calves were to be sold then and anybody else who wished could rear them into beef.  That is what we are up against.  It is a very serious situation.  The theory with the southern dairy farmer was &ldquo;bring the cow to her milk as quickly as possible in the following year and to hell with the calf&rdquo;.  For many years the calf was classed as being of little or no benefit.</P>
    <P>It is time that we took this livestock breeding situation seriously.  Not alone must we start with the bull but we must also look at the type of heifer that is being introduced into our beef herd.  Senator O'Toole said that it is &ldquo;the shakings&rdquo; that end up going into the next generation. The good heifers are sold for beef at 12 to 15 months old.  It is the weak ones that are left behind.  The inferior quality stock is what we are being left to breed from. The net result is that our livestock quality is going downhill at a rapid rate.  New schemes are being introduced now.  There are schemes with regard to suckler schemes.  It might be no harm if Department inspectors were to take random checks and look at some of the cows on which those grants are being paid.  We have adopted a system where we pay grants per head rather than pay grants for quality and ability to produce the article that is required in the market place.</P>
    <P>A way of getting over the hardship that might be imposed on farmers with regard to having to pay the extra cost for pedigree bulls would be to give them a subsidy.  For years in this country we had a premium bull scheme.  Some people might not have agreed with it, but it did a great deal for livestock breeding, especially in the west, where small farmers were able to go out and buy bulls and draw back the few pounds of a subsidy which they got annually.  It amounted in the latter years to £30.  If we paid a <Col N="1359" /> decent premium now of £150 or £200 per annum, they would then go out again and buy superior quality bulls in the market place.  If one looks at the old special terms system which was operated also by the Department and which has been allowed to lapse, one feels that the lapse was another retrograde step.  This was a means by which a farmer could buy a bull on hire purchase.  He could pay for him over four or five years.  That also did quite an amount of good work.</P>
    <P>We are now bringing this in without giving any incentive to people to improve.  I said earlier that when you look at the proposals in it and the period of three years being granted, it is wrong. The first section of the Bill is defective. It states 15 months in section 1.  That should be nine months.</P>
    <P>The man who can tell the difference between a beast that is 15 months' old and one that is 20 months' old has a better eye in his head than I have.  I know I could not do it and I have been involved with cattle every day of my life.  The Minister should bring in his own amendment on this.  At nine months the beast will not be a yearling but at 15 months he could pass as being 20 months' old.  He can do the same damage at ten months as he can do at 15 months.  Many farmers have found that their prize heifers were in calf because the neighbour's weanling came across the fence.  A major loophole in the Bill could be closed.  Also the 28-day period of grace should be omitted. Senator McDonald said that the period of grace was too short.  Seven days' notice is enough to give to anybody.  Under the old Act, once caught you were caught and you had to suffer the consequences.</P>
    <P>If we are genuinely to tackle and to improve our livestock we have to start with the type of bulls that are introduced to AI stations.  Down the years we have seen numerous animals being put into AI stations which did not have the desired results.  They were used by farmers without having any test carried out.  The AI station should not be allowed to issue semen from any bull which has not, at least, had one herd of calves produced <Col N="1360" /> and inspected to see if they are of the quality desired.  We can understand that they have to carry out their progeny testing, but it is important that the country should not be flooded with semen from bulls of an inferior quality.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture are not giving enough money to the people from the Department who deal with livestock to go out and buy top class bulls.  I have seen on numerous occasions where limited budgets have been provided to the Department to buy bulls for AI stations and to buy bulls for leasing out to pedigree breeders.  It has happened especially in regard to the Aberdeen Angus breed.  The top class bulls at sales have ended up being exported to the detriment of the national herd.  With regard to that breed, we made a mistake in allowing the importation of Canadian bulls which brought extra growth into the Aberdeen Angus breed to do away with the true bloodline that we had.  The net result is that we have Canadian bulls' blood in all our Aberdeen Angus cattle.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Department should look at this and see to it that while there is some semblance of the old breed left it is retained, even if it is only retained in the AI stations by the storage of straws from bulls with no Canadian blood.  The reason I say that is that the Canadian Aberdeen Angus are good growing cattle, but they are inclined to lose the traditional conformation which we found in the original black cattle.  They have become a longer, leaner animal.  If we look back to the Aberdeen Angus as the base for a suckler herd in this country, we see that the Aberdeen Angus crossed with Charolais is producing the No. 1 quality cattle which would be required on the European market.  Regarding the Friesian dairy herd, numerous farmers who wish to buy Hereford bulls to place with those cattle are trying to buy bulls which have not got Canadian blood in them because there is better bone to be found in the old stock of Hereford bulls. It would be a retrograde step if we allowed those bloodlines to be lost to this country, as has happened to the Shorthorn herd.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> The Minister could make quite an amount of money available to the livestock breeding section to improve our herds.  Regarding importations of cattle for the improvement of our stock, we should ensure that we import top class cattle.  It is better to buy one exceptional animal than to buy ten fair quality animals, especially if they are going to be introduced into AI stations.  It is proposed to import more continental cattle and I would hope that there will not be a closed shop attitude taken and that any farmer who wishes to have stock taken in with any of those importations will be given the same treatment as those who are already in the pedigree society which imports them.</P>
    <P>Many farmers would import one or two animals if they were given the opportunity. They would possibly be prepared to spend more money to import one superior quality maiden heifer than to import 30, 40 or 50 animals.  The person who has produced a superior animal as far as stock is concerned in the pedigree business is the smaller breeder with three or four cows.  It becomes a specialist job to such people who are supplying the superior animals.  The reason is very simple.  These people are in such a small way that they have to really make it pay and they must produce the superior quality product.  That goes back to the ordinary commercial producer because the producer producing the better quality animal is the man with five or six cows who must produce a top-quality animal to make the maximum use of his few acres.</P>
    <P>Looking at the overall situation we have to force the use of pedigree bulls, even if means forcing it by means of paying subsidies.  Regarding dairy herds, only the top 20 per cent of the dairy herd should be used with dairy bulls.  The other 80 per cent, who will never be in a position to produce heifers which would be of a superior quality, should be crossed with beef bulls and crossed with pedigree beef bulls to help to improve the standard of the dairy herd.  The calves from the south being bought by farmers from the west have deteriorated.  In many cases it <Col N="1362" /> would be impossible to say what breed they are.  In many cases in trying to identify the breed, one would have to call them &ldquo;Heinz&rdquo;.  You would not know which of 57 fathers they might have had.  They have no true markings and no semblance of a proper breed.  We should look at the maiden heifers being allowed into our beef herd and ensure that there is a quality check kept on them.</P>
    <P>If there were a premium to be paid of £20 extra for suckler cows of a certain standard one would find farmers moving up the line very fast.  There is one thing that is an incentive to a farmer and that is profit.  If he can see that he can get extra profit or extra subsidy by having a superior article, he will have it.  The net result would be a gain to the Irish economy and a boost to the creation of employment.  If we consider the future of our beef production, I believe we will have to look to the added-value market and look to Europe rather than to third world countries to sell our beef products. While farmers now sell their beef on the hoof there is very little incentive for the production of a superior quality carcase. When you look at the boning hall and remember that the superior quality carcase can give anything up to 6 or 7 per cent higher in yield in saleable meat terms, you can see the difference.  Six per cent on a carcase will mean an extra £5 to £6 per hundred-weight of value for that animal on the foot.  If you take 12 at £6 that is £72, and that is an incentive to produce something of superior quality.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the Department will buy top quality and that we will not see our prize and our prime animals leaving this country to boost the national herds of countries like Scotland and England, which they have done for the past 30 years.  They have improved their stock by taking from this country the prime bulls which were available.</P>

      <P>This Bill, when first introduced, was almost unnoticed by the breeding industry.  Suddenly, the full ramifications of its application became apparent particularly to smaller breeders and to breeders in disadvantaged areas, <Col N="1363" /> whether in the west of Ireland, or in Kerry, or elsewhere.  Many of us at that time made representations to Deputy Hegarty, the Minister responsible for the introduction of the legislation.  I was rather amazed, in spite of all our representations in this regard that, until quite recently, no non-licensed bulls would be allowed to operate in any part of the country.  For that reason it surprised me that section 3 of the Bill specifically states that the Minister may, in prescribed circumstances and on payment of the prescribed fee, grant to a person a permit authorising the person to have in his possession an unregistered bull subject to and in accordance with such conditions as may be specified in the permit.</P>
      <P>I thought originally when I was making representations that the interpretation of that section would have allowed the kind of people who expressed concern to me, and indeed to Members of the House of all parties to be considered.  I have quite a lot of correspondence on the subject. I thought that the Minister would have conceded earlier that he would interpret that section as it was written.  I am glad to see that, in the Minister's statement today to this House, he said that in deference to the wishes of Deputies &mdash; and I hope he included Senators as well because we expressed similar wishes to him &mdash; he has agreed that for a limited period of three years beef suckler herds with up to a maximum of 20 cows will be granted permits to keep quality non-pedigree bulls.  The bulls must be inspected and passed by officers of the Department prior to the granting of permits. Basically, that meets the objections I had in principle to the Minister's interpretation of what the legislation meant. Most of the problems I encounter with smaller breeders, particularly in the beef area, will be met by the Minister's agreement on the interpretation of that section.  For that reason, I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now having a total change in the attitude of people in the cattle trade. I suppose the advent of the milk subsidy and milk quota system has made people more conscious of the fact that we cannot <Col N="1364" /> go on any longer producing an indefinite amount and an increasing amount of milk, much as we would like to see that happen.  We have never been given the opportunity by the EC to exceed or, indeed, develop to the levels of our colleagues in Europe.  It was a tragedy for us when in a developing agricultural section and developing milk sector, suddenly a lid was put on what we were allowed to produce.  Because of the introduction of that &mdash; and, indeed, I suppose it is appropriate to pay tribute to the Minister and his officials for having got a reasonably good deal for us in the milk subsidy and the milk quota system &mdash; there is now throughout the country an awareness that there will have to be a diversification in the cattle industry.  The industry will have to go into the production of beef.  Because of that I have reservations, particularly for small breeders in disadvantaged areas, about insisting that all the beef produced by them from small herds will have to be by a licensed bull.  I was genuinely concerned about it and was of the opinion that widespread hardship would be caused to those small breeders.  There have been representations from people from the Sneem development co-operative society.  I know the Minister has had streams of letters from smaller farmers throughout the country expressing this concern.  I am glad the Minister has agreed to the interpretation of section 3 which I had hoped he would agree to some time ago.</P>
    <P>I must, at this stage, pay tribute to somebody who had a life-long commitment. He is no longer, sadly, with us.  He is gone to his eternal reward.  I refer to J.P. McKiernan, who was the life president of the General Council of Agricultural Committees.  He spent his life in the service of this section of the cattle industry to ensure that the highest possible quality would be achieved.  That could only be achieved by using the proper standard of quality bull which was approved and inspected by the Department.  Indeed, he gave of his best, as somebody who inspected bulls throughout this country.  He was always <Col N="1365" /> adamant that the highest possible standard would have to be achieved in the interest of the industry itself.  He held that belief up to the day of passing to his eternal reward.  At that time a change had taken place on the instruction of the Department, subject to some directives by the EC.  He grieved over that backward step, as he considered it to be.</P>
    <P>We have now again changed course in this Bill.  We have changed course again in this direction.  I share the concern of Senator Ellis that, in changing course like this in an industry which takes a while to either adjust to the changes or, indeed, for the benefits of changes to follow, much valuable time can be lost.  This concern was expressed by Senator Kiely of the Fianna Fáil agricultural team in this House in July 1983 when he raised this matter with the Minister, Deputy Hegarty, on the adjournment of the House, as reported in the Official Report of Thursday 14 July 1983 at column 1346, Volume 101.  That was when the abolition of the existing licensing laws came into place.  Senator Kiely, in making the case for the retention of registration of bulls, was worried that the Government of the day were just abolishing the licensing for the purposes of economics, I quote Senator Kiely who he said:</P>
    <P>Whilst it is understandable that Governments would be anxious to effect economies, the decision to abolish bull licensing as far as the livestock breeding programme is concerned amounts to false economy.  In the long-term, if there is no control on the breeding of cattle, it will have an overall effect on the standard of livestock, resulting in greater losses in the cattle export trade and breeding of cattle generally.  Therefore it will be seen that the loss to the trade and the economy will be far greater than any saving effected by suspension of licensing.</P>
    <P>The Minister in responding to him did genuinely say that the rounds of inspectors of bulls at that time was costing somthing like £160,000.  He also repeated that figure in today's speech.  He said that it was a considerable amount of money.</P>

It seems to me that when we go to the trouble of selecting a council which will be acting in co-ordination with and under the newly appointed director we should give them the fullest possible consultation.

It seems reasonable and sensible that decisions taken should be done in the fullest possible consultation with this body.  I suport this amendment.</P>

      <P>These amendments are designed to ensure that the list of what will be included in archives will be as comprehensive as is humanly possible. Amendment No. 2 adds in plans and drawings which might not perhaps, have been comprehended in the original definition list.  Amendment No. 3 proposes the insertion of files.  It is certainly over-superfluous as it is almost certain that files are included amongst papers. Just in case there could be any ambiguity it is included.  I am advised also that the inclusion of &ldquo;and other micrographic records&rdquo; out of microfilms would be desirable and that &ldquo;optical or&rdquo; should be inserted before the word &ldquo;video&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If at any stage Senators have any other views about anything else that should be added for the sake of completeness, I, of course, would take it on board on Report Stage, but we have endeavoured to include everything we can think of here to ensure that the National Archives will comprehend all forms of documentation and I am even hesitant to use a word such as &ldquo;documentation&rdquo; least that might not be comprehensive.

If there has been an omission, the omission is more glaring and indeed, the legal view might be taken, since there has been such a very complete specification here, that the omission was deliberate.  I think it behoves all of us and, indeed, the outside bodies with their interest in archives, to think again about this problem between now and Report Stage.  Once we have embarked on this idea of exhaustive enumeration, then it has to be exhaustive.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> (d) the inspection and examination of arrangements for the preservation of departmental records and, with the consent or at the request of the appropriate member of the Government, the examination of departmental records,&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment arises out of a number of representations concerning the role of the director <i>vis-a-vis</i> records in Departments prior to their transfer to National Archives and have become 30 years old.  As the Bill stands, the director would have the right to inspect departmental records only at the request of the appropriate member of the Government.  The need to strengthen the director's powers in this regard has been recognised and it is considered that the proper balance has now been achieved in the amendment put forward. Under this amendment the director would have the right of inspection and examination of arrangements for the preservation of departmental records.  This is an important function particularly with the proliferation of computer and modern technological data storage systems.  He will satisfy himself that the Departments are taking proper steps to ensure their records are adequately preserved. The further power contained in the amendment relates to the actual inspection of records, that is, the ability to examine records themselves as distinct from examining arrangements for their preservation.  Under the amendment, the director can take the initiative in seeking to examine records where he feels this is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It primarily concerns current records and there will be circumstances where Ministers will feel unable to allow access to particularly sensitive records.  For example, in the security area, access to sensitive security information would normally be allowed only to a very restricted number of departmental officers and, even then, only on a need to know basis. In general, it is felt that the director will, through this mechanism, have access to most departmental records.  It is also <Col N="1371" /> important to bear in mind that the director will have the support of the Taoiseach in any reasonable request to inspect records in departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not altogether understand the sensitivity about letting anybody outside the ranks of the Cabinet and the public service have any absolute right of access.  If, as the Taoiseach says, questions of national security are involved, then why not specify that in the amendment rather than leave it in the hands of an individual Minister to withdraw or withhold consent when he saw fit?  One could visualise &mdash; and I pick this off the top of my head &mdash; if there was a problem about disease eradication that a Minister for Agriculture might decide to withhold consent from the director for a reason of his own.  You could go through every Government Department and think of a reason which a Minister would feel was sensitive.  As the amendment stands, even though it is an improvement, and it is obviously suggested with the best of intentions it still weights the balance almost entirely in favour of the Minister and, by implication, I would suspect his senior civil servants to preserve anything from the unwelcome eyes of the director that they might see fit, including, perhaps, the nature of inadequately kept records.  In other words, if a Department reckon that they are going to be identified as not having kept their records properly, then one device would be to get the Minister to refuse consent to the director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very healthy to think through these things and work out what are the exceptions but, subject to those exceptions, there should be an absolute right to inspect records.  This holding back, in what is otherwise a Bill which is intended to maximise access to some forms of information, of almost a veto power without qualification to the Minister concerned seems to me to attack in some way the spirit of the Bill and it is open to abuse.  Unfortunately, wherever suspicious people like me see a possibility of a Bill extending beyond where it is <Col N="1372" /> intended to go, the history of most countries is that when the opportunity or necessity presents itself, if the power is there, it will be used.  There is nothing in this proposal to say that a Minister will not be able to abuse the power given to him for his own interests, for the interests of his civil servants, or for some political or other reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point the Senator is raising relates not so much to the amendment as to the section as originally drafted.  What the amendment sets out to do is to add to the functions of the director the power to inspect and examine the arrangements for the preservation of departmental records.  In the Bill as originally drafted, there is provision already for the power to examine records at the request of the appropriate member of the Government.  We strengthened that to enable the director, if he should feel there is a particular case to examine some records with a view to satisfying himself about them, to seek to do so, and do so with the consent of the Minister.  So we have two new things here.  He can take an initiative to examine records with the consent of the Minister and he has a right without asking anybody to inspect and examine the arrangements for the preservation of records.  Both of these are improvements on the original Bill.</P>
      <P>What the Senator is suggesting goes beyond anything that has been contemplated or is normal in most other countries, although I am sure there are some countries the Senator could find which might be exceptional in this regard, going beyond what most people here would think was reasonable like my experience in Sweden in discovering that a journalist can come in in the morning and look at the Prime Minister's post before the Prime Minister sees it.  By normal Irish standards that would be regarded as slightly eccentric but, no doubt, it is acceptable in Sweden.  We have to operate reasonably in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not concerned here to appoint somebody who has the right to look at every current document of every Government out of some kind of curiosity.  We <Col N="1373" /> are appointing somebody to look after the national archives to ensure that they are preserved and maintained and that they are transferred as appropriate and made accessible at the appropriate time. We are concerned to give all powers relevant to that and to set out, as the Senator suggests, to list all the cases in which there would be good reasons why this particular official whose functions are archival rather than investigative, all the cases where problems could arise without his seeing documents when one cannot envisage what they might be, it would be an impossible way to legislate.</P>
    <P>I mentioned national security as the obvious one.  There are documents that might reveal that somebody at some time had provided information to some authorities in the past that might be detrimental to his great grandchildren.  There are long memories in Ireland.  Indeed, the British public records office pay special attention to the release of Irish records in case somebody might be damaged by discovering that some distant ancestor had behaved in what could be regarded as an unpatriotic way a century or two later.</P>
    <P>There are many other cases, but I do not think we can legislate by trying to imagine all the possible cases, list them and give the director power to examine everything else.  What we are concerned about here is not that he should be investigating the records, but be able to satisfy himself that they are being looked after properly.  I think we are going as far as is reasonable in this regard.  I do not think any Minister is going to busy himself about trying to prevent an inspection of the adequacy of the conservation of records.  Indeed if he attempted to do so it is a matter which the Taoiseach of the day could reasonably look at.  The Senator is going beyond what is reasonable in this regard.  I could not envisage how we could think of all the possible cases individually where inspection might be undesirable.  What we have here enables the director to do his duty and goes considerably beyond the original terms of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reflect on the effect of the amendment because it does change the original draft and changes it in a very welcome way.  To construct a hypothetical problem &mdash; let us hope we are talking about a hypothetical problem &mdash; this legislation will be exercised in a very definite political administrative framework.  I am thinking of the situation where an official in a Department speaks to the Minister of the day who, in our non-fully Devlin-implemented world, will be busy with many things, as the Taoiseach would agree. The suggestion may be made that, if you are going to allow inspection of these records, you are opening up a box from which the Lord alone knows what might come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I lean very much towards the point being made in the spirit of Senator Ryan's amendment which is that one should repose the maximum trust in the holder of the new post to be able to have access to and inspect documents even if they are not ultimately removed, and so on.  What one is doing is giving power in the national interest to the holder of the post to move beyond any administrative obstacles that might be placed in relation to access to documents.  I have a feeling that, while the inspection of the arrangements goes some way, it still leaves that obstacle there.  The idea that you would have a director of national archives who would be so overwhelmed with curiosity that he would want to devour every detail of the Department is a bit farfetched.  I also think the holder of the post would want to defend his or her reputation and to exercise the position in a very responsible way.  The general power of access and inspection, even if it falls short of the removal of documents to an appropriate location, would go further than the amendment.  I made some of these points on Second Stage.  I am lending my support to what I feel might be administrative obstacles and a busy Minister may be influenced by this.  How is the Minister to decide unless he or she has the opportunity to assess a case that is being made by people who have much more time, who may have handled or be familiar <Col N="1375" /> with the nuances of a particular piece of documentation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these amendments because I think that paragraphs (c) and (d) go a long way towards meeting the case which was being made by, for instance, the professional archivists and other people interested.  Before I voice any criticism of the way in which the amendments are worded, I feel that credit should be given for the fact that representations were made to the Government to do this and they have, in fact, responded and amended the Bill in this way which does improve it.</P>
      <P>Again, I am not sure why we do not trust the director sufficiently to let him examine the departmental records without necessarily having the consent or the request of the appropriate member of the Government.  Nobody is saying that most Ministers will not behave in a proper manner, but decisions which are said to be decisions of the Minister cannot in the nature of things all go through the Minister's actual hands.  While there may be only a slight danger, there is a danger that relevant records might be at least suppressed or not made available to the director through decisions which were officially decisions of the Minister but in reality were decisions of somebody along the chain of command.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody is, in fact, referring to certain tensions which will exist between different people who will be involved in the whole business of preserving and keeping records.  Obviously, the director will have a very clearly defined function.  Civil servants will have their own attitude and view on the preservation of departmental materials. Indeed, politicians who march to another slightly different tune will have their own outlook on this matter.  It strikes me that, in order to allay these tensions which could become unhealthy if not addressed, it would be useful if from time to time the different bodies who had a function in this could come together to talk about their different perceptions of how the <Col N="1376" /> country's interests could be served in the perservation of archival material and governmental and departmental records.</P>
      <P>I know that the archives department of UCD has in the past put on very satisfactory courses for people involved in preserving religious records and records of their own agencies.  The same could be done in relation to this Bill and this subject which we are discussing today.  I recommend it as something that could, perhaps, be looked into as a way forward and a way of ensuring that the staff of the National Archives, council members, the director, civil servants and politicians could have an overview of the concerns of each of the people involved so that, in that way, whatever difficulties and tensions existed would not become unhealthy but could be met appropriately. I would put that forward as a suggestion for getting over that particular difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking here about the transfer of records and what is to be withheld from transfer.  We are not talking here of the giving or not giving of access to records after 30 years.  That will come in other sections where we can have an argument on the point.  It is open to discussion.  We are trying to deal here with a simple question of ensuring that records are preserved adequately.  We have made an absolute provision that nothing can be destroyed without the consent of the director.  So, if any Department want to destroy anything, they must have his consent and they can only get that consent by showing him the records.  He can examine them and say: &ldquo;Yes, that is useless.  You can throw it out.&rdquo;  That is not at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing we are dealing with here is ensuring that the manner in which records are preserved is such that they do not fall apart and the mice do not get at them.  That is basically the issue.  What does he need for that purpose?  He needs the power to be able to inspect and examine the arrangements for the preservation of the above-mentioned records in case the method by which they are being preserved has defects from the archival point <Col N="1377" /> of view and the records might deteriorate in some way and when the time comes to transfer them they might no longer be legible.  That is what is at issue.  In certain cases it is conceivable that the director, having examined these arrangements and having seen how files are stacked or kept, the accommodations and conditions in which they are kept, might well feel that in a particular case he would need to look more closely at the documents in a box or file to see that the conditions for preservation are adequate.  In those circumstances, he would ask the Minister's consent to look a little further into it to make sure the preservation is adequate and the Minister would not unreasonably withhold that for that particular purpose. That is all that is at issue.  We are not talking about the other issues of transfer or access, only how to ensure that the director can adequately carry out his functions of ensuring the preservation of archives.  The amendments here fulfil this.</P>
    <P>The other issues that have been gone into come up later on and on them there can be legitimate disagreement.  We are dealing only with this one issue here and I think the amendment that we have drafted now gives him considerable powers not merely to acquire Departmental records but to examine them first of all, and secondly, not merely to examine them in accordance with the Act, that is, when the question of transfer or access arises, and not merely to examine records when requested by a member of the Government, but to be able to inspect and examine the arrangements for their preservation and, even if he is unhappy with what he finds, to ask the Minister to allow him to look at the actual records themselves to make sure they are being preserved properly.  These are the additions we have made, and they go very far to meet the particular requirement we are concerned about here to ensure that documents are preserved and are not by some process of neglect allowed to deteriorate.  That is the net and narrow issue we are discussing at this point and the discussion is getting somewhat <Col N="1378" /> broader than that in anticipation, perhaps, of discussions on later sections.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 8:</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment also arises from the debate here in the Seanad. The purpose of it is to ensure that there will be sufficient flexibility for the director to enter into agreements when acquiring records or documents.  There may be instances where a bequest or a donation to the national archives would be subject to conditions other than restrictions on access which are dealt with in section 10 (2).  For example, it might be a condition of a donation that a valuable archival collection be allowed to remain in local custody and the director should have the power to make such an arrangement. This amendment enables us to take account of such conditions other than conditions relating to access.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to broaden the functions of the director so as to acknowledge formally in the legislation that he will have a role in relation to the development of a records management system.  Indeed, it is considered that the director or the director designate &mdash; I shall come to that distinction in a moment &mdash; should be consulted from the very start when regulations are being drafted under section 18 to establish an effective records management <Col N="1379" /> system.  I say director designate because we have already taken steps to initiate the competition for the appointment of a director and it is possible that that competition might produce a result before this legislation is passed in both Houses.  If that happened he would be director designate until the legislation is passed. He would be getting on with some of his work in anticipation of the legislation being passed.  That is what is involved in this amendment.  The establishment of such systems would involve consultations with all Government Departments so that various options can be teased out. My own Department and the Department of the Public Service are essentially involved in this process and the advice of the director would be invaluable. This does extend his functions significantly in an important and valuable way.</P>

      <P>Perhaps this is an appropriate time to raise the question of the training of the civil servants who will have responsibility in the various Departments for records management.  The Department of Archives in UCD is, of course, the only such department in any Irish university, North or South.  It is particularly well equipped to provide training courses in records management for the civil servants who will actually be handling this material which will eventually reach the National Archives.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might give me a response to the educational resource that is available to facilitate the operation of the Bill when passed.</P>

      <P>This is an amendment which I welcome and which was necessarily sought in order to enlarge the functions of the director and to enable a certain degree of flexibility in the functions of the director.  Like Senator Hillery, while I have no particular commitment as to where such training should take place it obviously is important that the civil servants who are dealing with archives should receive training.  It is a very specialised situation.  Anybody who <Col N="1380" /> has been in and out of Civil Service Departments must see the way in which files are kept.  In some cases the conditions under which some files are kept would be far removed from what would be regarded as desirable for archival purposes. In each Department there is a need for someone who has full training and who would understand and keep an eye on what is being done throughout the Department with regard to the perservation of records.</P>

      <P>Largely because I was a bit contentious a few moments ago, I would like to say, because it needs to be said, that the Government amendments are most welcome by and large.  They are obviously a very genuine attempt to respond to points raised.  I share the concern of my colleague that the question of archives management can get lost.  Big organisations are strange things.  My best education on that was being in a small provincial art gallery on one occasion and watching the caretaking staff decide where the paintings were to be hung and which would suit where because the thing was so large and so scattered.  I wish we would stop talking in terms of files.  A huge amount of what we are talking about will be stored in a way other than on paper.  The management of information that is stored other than on paper requires certain attention to things such as humidity and to many other things which can escape the notice of junior individuals who may not really understand the significance of what they are dealing with or the damage they are doing.  The question <Col N="1381" /> of training and care will have to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the points made very seriously indeed.  I cannot help feeling from my knowledge in the past of the way documents are kept both inside and outside the public service that much needs to be done if documents are to be preserved adequately.  It is not just, as Senator Ryan said, a question of files. There are other types of records the preservation of which may require techniques less obvious than those involved in preserving a file.  We are all capable of seeing if a file is being properly looked after or whether it has been left with the edges hanging out and falling off, with bits of the sentences dropping into the dust.  While we can observe that, we do not all have the same confidence when it comes to other areas, photographic, micro-photographic and so on.  It will require additional skills in Departments to do this.  Section 18 (4) states: that the Minister for the Public Service, after consultation with the director, may make regulations for the proper maintenance and preservation of departmental records and also fix standards in relation to the copying of them by photographic, microphotographic or other processes.  These regulations will play an important part in ensuring a new and adequate standard of preservation of records in Departments before they ever reach the National Archives.  That will require initial training for some of the officers concerned.  This will have to be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill that decisions about the transfer of records shall be made by an officer of at least the rank of principal in each Department subject to agreement by an officer of similar rank in the Department of the Taoiseach.  That officer's function will be legislatively confined to the role of deciding on transfer.  At least that is somebody pinpointed in the Department who has a specific responsibility for archives.  Either that person, or that person and others in each Department, would in most instances need some assistance if they are to carry out their responsibilities properly, <Col N="1382" /> which will be defined by the regulation of the Minister for the Public Service for ensuring the preservation of records. That probably will involve training.  It would be desirable &mdash; for obvious financial reasons I am not in a position to say that it will be done &mdash; that in each Department there should be a trained archivist for the purpose.  I am afraid we are some distance away from the stage where we can envisage that.  It was a dream of mine back in the seventies that we would do that.  I am afraid we have gone backwards in terms of having resources for things of that kind at this stage.  However, pending the stage when we can have a trained archivist to do this for us in each Department it will be important that those who will have this function and who will be operating under the regulations made in this public service should have the necessary training.  That is one of the matters I will be concerned about and the director and council can assist us by advising on what training will be necessary for this purpose.</P>

I mentioned in the Seanad on Second Stage that a director will be appointed at a similar level to the director of the National Museum and the National <Col N="1383" /> Library, which is a higher level than the existing equivalent post is graded at.  I am not sure if that is the point being made by the Senator.  The post is in the process of being advertised.  I have personally approved the proposed terms of the advertisement setting out what the requirements and the desirable qualifications of the person would be.  I have made some changes in the draft recently submitted to me with a view to ensuring that we draw from a wide range and that we get a suitable person.  That is well in hand at present.  I hope the advertisement will appear in the near future now that it has been approved.</P>

      <P>I hope I am not in the least disrespectful to the office of Taoiseach and not least to its present incumbent, but I find the wording somewhat curious.  I am not sure if it is wording that has arisen in other legislation.  I am trying to think of where directors have been appointed.  I think that Taoisigh, current and future, might want to protect themselves against this wording in some respects.  The section states that the director shall hold office on such terms, including remuneration, as the Taoiseach shall, with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service from time to time determine.  I take it I can presume the intention here is that within the stated purposes and practices of this Bill one could, for example, again when you have a mind like mine, construct an hypothesis where a director might be interpreting the functions and powers of this Bill in one way, a complaint might arise from a Minister to the Taoiseach and there could be a dispute about the role of the director. That might create the impression, although it is clearly not intended, of there being an element of arbitrariness in the construction of the role and practices of the director in different circumstances from time to time.</P>

It is a <Col N="1384" /> question of seeking someone, setting out in advertisement the qualifications required and then appointing somebody on terms related to those qualifications and setting out the duties.  The duties are, in fact, set out in the Bill.  I do not think there can be anything arbitrary about it. Like everybody else in the Civil Service people are appointed on certain terms. They hold office on those terms and as long as they carry out the terms of appointment, they cannot be interfered with and they cannot be told to do things they should not do.  I am not quite sure what exactly the Senator is fearful of in this respect.</P>

      <P>In my contribution on Second Stage my primary concern was focussed on two issues.  First, there was the question of accommodation.  I am glad that adequate accommodation will be provided for the National Archives. My second concern was the question of staffing.  In that context I have to welcome the fact that the competition for the position of director is now under way and that the grade for that post will be higher than it has been up to the present. The staffing is a particular worry.  The total permanent staff of our Public Records Office and the State Papers Office together amounts to about 30.  In sharp contrast, the staff of the Public Records Office in Northern Ireland, <Col N="1385" /> which has about half the archival material, amounts to more than 80.  The staffing level up to now has been a cause for considerable concern with the adverse consequences one would expect.</P>
      <P>In his response to Second Stage, the Taoiseach underlined the fact that the Bill would not really be worthwhile unless there was adequate staff provided.  He thought it would be ludicrous not to provide adequate staff.  I entirely agree with him but, since the Taoiseach is here, I have to express a further concern.  We pass legislation regularly in this House and, all too often, adequate staff are not provided for the implementation of that legislation.  I have in mind, in particular, legislation as it affects local authorities. Senior officials in local authorities have expressed considerable concern to me about passing legislation without matching staff to implement the statutes as passed.  The Taoiseach has underlined the fact that in the case of the director the competition is already under way.  Masses of material will arrive at the National Archives within a two year period.  Suitably trained archivists and support staff will be essential if the Bill is to be worthwhile.</P>
      <P>In my Second Stage contribution I made a plea for an estimation of the staff that will be required in two years' time, I should like the Taoiseach to give us some indication of when that process will get under way.  In a nutshell, I am very concerned that from time to time we pass legislation here and there is not matching staff.  I hope that, in the case of this Bill, appropriate staff will be provided and that action will be taken to meet the staffing needs as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <P>I have a passing comment but one that I think is in the process of being dispensed with.  I hope it is.  I saw a reference to an inquiry.  There is a dreadful distinction between officer and servant which is left over from another era.  This is now producing the most extraordinary anomalies in the public service where highly skilled technicians with all sorts of third level qualifications are treated as servants but junior people who <Col N="1386" /> are regarded as white collar workers automatically become officers.  I hope this is just an anomaly which is in the process of being dispensed with.</P>

On the point made by Senator Hillery, I dealt with this on Second Stage.  I must correct Senator Hillery in his loose quotation of my remarks.  I did not say that not to appoint adequate staff would be ludicrous.  I said not to give additional staff in certain circumstances would be to perpetrate an absurdity.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it is obvious that steps will have to be taken here.  I presume the record of the debate will be read by my colleagues the Ministers for Finance and the Public Service.  That is in the context that we have an embargo situation which creates a problem of trying to find such staff resources and reducing staff elsewhere to compensate. This creates problems.  It is obvious that something has to be done in this area. The question of how much has to be done can only be evaluated by the director when appointed.</P>
      <P>His first task will be to make a realistic assessment of the minimum requirements in order to carry through the function which will be a very onerous one in the first couple of years as the flow of records comes to the National Archives over a period of two years.  When we have his advice on that, it will be a matter that I will have to take up with my colleagues with a view to seeing what can be done to provide staff resources.  I am not saying it will be easy.  I am not saying we will necessarily arrive at a totally satisfactory solution to it, but obviously it has to be tackled.  I have gone as far as I can in that regard in what I have said here already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might just tell the House that a search for a temporary premises adequate for <Col N="1387" /> some years ahead depending on reaching a stage where we can construct a purpose built building, which may obviously take some years to find the resources and some years to do the building has gone ahead very rapidly.  I understand that a building has been identified amongst others already which, in the view of the acting director, would be adequate and appropriate as temporary accommodation. That was drawn to my attention yesterday. I am not saying a decision has been taken about that building, but I am relieved to know there at least one building has been identified which would be available and which, in the view of the acting director, would serve the immediate purposes for some years ahead.  It may be that we will find somewhere better but at least we have got somewhere that has been identified already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we have discussed the question of the staff numbers etc., I would like to make a few remarks about their role.  In doing so, I will come back to some points that were made earlier which the Taoiseach thought were slightly anticipatory.  The establishment of the archives on a permanent basis and this whole service would not be a success if the staff established under this section were in any way to form a separate group who were concerned only with the archives, concerned only from time to time in dealing with responsible officers in the Department.  I feel it must be part of the role of the director and the staff to infuse an idea of the importance of archives among those who are serving in the Departments, among those who are creating these particular archives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia made the point earlier, which is a very important one, that since we will have to make arrangements for the training of those who will staff this particular Department and because it will be essential to make sure that the relation of these staff to serving staff in the public service is not one of antagonism, there would be no better way of doing this than training together <Col N="1388" /> those who are to be responsible for archives within the archival service and those who will be responsible amidst their responsibility for other things in the service. I would commend very much this idea of training courses in which the staff to be recruited under this section sit side by side with people who are not specialist archivists but who will have some degree of responsibility.  It is very much to be commended.  In being in common in these courses, in discussions that would arise in the seminar mode in such courses, this would give an extremely good start to establishing, not merely an archive, but an archival mentality throughout the whole of the public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take that valuable point made by Senator Dooge.  I will certainly bear it in mind.  Amongst the functions of the director will be the provision of such educational services as the Taoiseach may from time to time approve so there is a provision for education which I take to include training in this respect also.  In so far as training can be done jointly for those in the archive and those who will be working with them, that would be desirable.  It may be, of course, that some of those people appointed if additional appointments are made as we all hope, will be people who are trained archivists.  The process of inducting them into their new job would involve a somewhat different kind of approach from the kind of training required for people in other Departments.  Subject to that, the point is well taken.  I would also hope that over a time the system of exchanging people between the archive and Departments might develop, which would be very helpful in ensuring close liaision.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> Government amendment No. 10:</P>
    <P>In page 7, line 19, after &ldquo;or&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, if the original is no longer available,&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept no responsibility for amendment No. 11.  We will hear about that in a minute.  The purpose of amendment No. 10 is to deal with the question of ensuring that, where a copy of a document exists the original should be retained rather than the copy.  As at present drafted the Bill states:</P>
      <P>...the retention and preservation of the original or of an accurate and complete copy thereof shall suffice.</P>
      <P>The genesis of this lay in my experience of handling files.  When a fat file comes before you, nearly all of which consists of copies of the same document, you dig through it to find eventually that there are three or four documents you have to read but you have to go through such a mass that it is very hard to find the actual ones you want amongst all the copies that are made of them.  I do not know why departmental files seem to take this form.</P>
      <P>This drew to my attention the fact that a large part of archival material consists of totally superfluous copies of the same document.  It seems to me that we do not want to preserve endless copies of the one letter.  I, therefore, suggested in the draft that wording along these lines should be included in the Bill so that we do not have to keep everything on the file.  The point has been made that, as it is drafted, there is no choice indicated between the original or a copy.  It reads:</P>
      <P>...if a copy is as good as the original...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, all things being equal, the original would be more important. Indeed, sometimes the original may have something marked on it which may not be on the copies, some notes in the margin, or something of that kind which could be significant.  Therefore, the amendment is designed to ensure that the original should be retained but, if the original is not available, a copy should be <Col N="1390" /> retained but a whole lot of copies do not have to be kept all the same with nothing additional on them.  The amendment is designed to give preference to the original over the copy, which did not emerge clearly in the original version of the Bill due, perhaps, to an oversight on my part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's amendment.  I have great sympathy with him in ploughing through a file which consists largely of three or four copies of different documents.  I feel that the invention of the photocopier has totally destroyed the ability of people in passing on information to others to <i>précis</i> that information and put it into a reasonably short form in which one can read it instead of which they produce copy after copy of extraneous documents that you have to plough through to decide what is relevant and what is not.  It is not necessary for archival purposes to keep 16 copies of each document.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Senator Ross is not present to move his amendment.  I feel the substance of his amendment is important in that, while I know we are stating here that the copy is only to be kept if the original is not available, it is not so much where an individual document is concerned but where a question would arise of whether you should keep filmed, taped or computerised versions of records, or whether you should keep the original.  It would be well to give the director a sort of consulting function with regard to the decision about originals and copies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we say &ldquo;if the original is available&rdquo; it might arise that the originals might disappear in the course of time if the director were not there to make sure that the originals were kept.  It could mean that, if the director is not involved, decisions could be taken to destroy primary documentation in serial form if filmed, taped or computerised versions of it exist.  One of the difficulties is that, without the training that we all hope will take place, at present there is not a great deal of expertise throughout the Civil Service about archival matters.  The director of the archives and his staff are <Col N="1391" /> probably the only people who will be familiar with these various techniques and practices which have been evolved internationally to deal with the difficult issues of whether one should keep original paper documents, or whether one should keep computerised records.  It would be a good idea to include an amendment of the type put down by Senator Ross that the director should have a function in deciding about copies and originals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be imposing an impossible burden on the director if, in respect of every file in the public service, he had to examine it to see whether 15 copies of the letter should or should not be kept.  That would not be realistic. I am not saying that there is not a point behind the amendment, and perhaps we should reflect a little further on it, but to bring the director into vetting the destruction of every copy of every document is asking more than is humanly reasonable.</P>
      <P>In section 18 there are provisions for regulations to be made fixing standards in relation to the copying of this record and so on.  It is made clear there that original records copied in accordance with the regulations of subsection (4) may be destroyed only on the written authorisation of the director.  I must say that on reflection, I am not too sure that I can reconcile that concept with their being destroyed with his written authorisation with what is said here and that you reserve the original rather than a copy. Maybe we need to match these two sections a little more closely.</P>
      <P>We will reflect further on this to see if there is a point to which we need to have regard.  A point that struck me in listening to the debate and thinking about it is that sometimes there may well be something written on a copy which is of some significance.</P>

      <P>I would not envisage that happening at all, that he would have to look at every file where there were 15 copies or whatever, but simply where a decision had to arise as to whether one was going to preserve the original or preserve the copy.  Only where the kind of thing that the Taoiseach has just been talking about arises, where perhaps the copy might have interesting glosses on it &mdash; if I might use that phrase &mdash; whereas the original had not, it would only be in that situation that the director would be consulted perhaps.  I do not mean that the director would have to look at every file to decide whether 15 copies were to be kept or not.  Certainly that would be quite impossible.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has suggested that he will take another look at these sections and I would be grateful if he would do so between this and Report Stage, just to see if there might be situations where the director should be consulted about whether you keep, say, computerised copies or whether you keep paper originals or whatever.</P>

      <P>I think there is another point that might well be considered in regard to this section.  I have a slight worry here that where it refers to &ldquo;the retention and preservation of the original or of an accurate and complete copy thereof&rdquo; we are talking of course, as we said earlier, not only of paper but of archival material in other forms.  My worry in regard to this is that what is one person's accurate and complete copy might not be another person's and that we could well have a director whose standards in regard to what constitutes an accurate and complete copy would fall below that of the archival profession <Col N="1393" /> generally, and perhaps below the standard which would be set by his predecessor or his successor.  While, of course, the Taoiseach has the power to get rid of a director &mdash; he would get rid of him if he were sinning seriously in this respect &mdash; in the meantime material might well be lost.  In regard to non-literary material, there is a real difficulty here that, for example, electronic copying is in a sense never complete.  With the advance of technology &mdash; and we have seen this in regard to the reprocessing of gramophone records of an historic character &mdash; we are able to copy far more accurately. There is the danger here that at a stage at which the technology in regard to one form of archive had not developed sufficiently, a director might in the circumstances of the day say: &ldquo;That is as accurate and complete a copy as can be accomplished under today's technology,&rdquo; and an original might be lost which could indeed not only be copied for archival purposes but copied so that it could be deposited in other archives or diffused.  I think the Taoiseach would be very well advised to examine the full import of the language at the end of section 7 (1).</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I think it means looking also at section 18.  It does lay down provisions about the fixing of standards in relation to the copying of such records and also provides, as I have said, that originals may be destroyed on the written authorisation of the director which does not seem to quite fit with what we have here.  I think we should reflect further with the points raised here.</P>

      <P>I would like to support what Senator Dooge has said.  We are inclined to think that the technology of today is the last word.  Technology moves quite quickly.  For instance, to my knowledge, within the records of RTE there are recordings on large discs of tape and the position is rapidly developing that the machines to play these tapes will no longer exist and they will need to be transferred to other sorts of tapes.  Much of this material is, in fact, archival material of interviews with predecessors <Col N="1394" /> of the Taoiseach, and various matters of this nature.  This kind of material can be lost because of quick moves in technology and any director would have to make sure, if he certifies that this kind of record is a proper copy, that it will not pass out of existence because the machines to reproduce it pass out of existence, and so on.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 10, to delete &ldquo;30&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;10&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had visions of myself repeating the argument over and over again.  However, I know the procedures would work out a way.  To suggest that I had a very strong feeling about whether it was 30 or ten would be very dishonest on my part.  I do have a view about access to public records anyway, in terms of freedom of information, but that is a matter for a different occasion and it is also a matter where questions of what should be available and what access should be granted and should not, would be very different from this.  I said on Second Stage that I am not entirely happy with picking 30 years <Col N="1395" /> simply because it is what other people use, or because it is what has been accepted and what has been the practice. A number like that should have a reason and it seems to me that, given the pace of change in society today that 30, 40 or 50 years ago things changed at a relatively leisurely pace.  There was not a huge accumulation of official public records. There were not so many issues which came and went and ceased to be as society changed and adjusted very rapidly and there were arguments for a longer time scale.  Given the rapidity of access to information today, given the increasing appetite of large sections of the public for more and more information in the various ways in which information is now disseminated throughout the world, it seems that 30 years is a figure which is excessively cautious.  The exemptions that are made &mdash; and they are extremely broad &mdash; and the possibilities for withholding information seem to present an opportunity to reduce the time before which records may be made available.</P>
    <P>I contemplated an amendment which would establish a maximum of 30 years and leave the actual assignment of a period of time to the Taoiseach of the day, but just as an initial endeavour.  We may perhaps come back to this on Report Stage.  I suggest that ten years is a reasonable period of time given the exemptions that are already available, given the fact that sensitive and other information need not be made available and that there will be procedures to ensure that that does not happen.  It seems to me that 30 years is excessively cautious and a ten year period would get us away from the heat of immediate controversy and enable us to look at things with a little less passion. We are not talking about a period immediately after a civil war or anything like that.  We are talking about a period of history where we have a fairly stable democracy &mdash; some of us might feel it is too stable &mdash; and by this I mean a fairly stable democracy with fairly stable institutions, responsible media and an increasingly interested population and a young population, interested very often <Col N="1396" /> in aspects that are quite immediate to us but which are outside their experience. Therefore, I am moving this long series of amendments with a view largely to inviting the Taoiseach to explain why 30 years should be the figure and say more than just that it is the appropriate one that other people use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess to sharing some of the mystification concerning the absence of an upper limit that Senator Ryan has referred to already and also the choice of the term 30 years.  There are several different combinations that one could think about.  For example, there are arguments such as why should you need a document that was less than 30 years old.  What unique character has it that makes it administratively so indispensable? Why not say something like &ldquo;not less than 30 years but not more than 50 years&rdquo; so that you could create a clearance period?  Maybe there are a couple of these documents that lie within a particular slot in time and once these are dealt with then this requirement goes. The problem about this in many ways is in what circumstances will this power be exercised?  I am bothered about it, I must say.  Are the justifications for this administrative? Or, are there some peculiar circumstances within this time period which are not being addressed?  I will be equally interested in the Taoiseach's reply.</P>

      <P>I would like to endorse what the other speakers have been saying because I made the point at Second Stage about this legislation that there seems to be no good reason why we should have this upper limit of 30 years.  I see no reason why some papers should not be published almost immediately.  There is a convention, probably established by the British, that it is for reasons of protecting reputations and so on and saving embarrassment. There are many documents that do not relate to the protection of reputations or saving embarrassment and are nevertheless very interesting.  I do not see why the papers could not be almost immediately &mdash; or as near as possible to <Col N="1397" /> immediately &mdash; made available.  I accept the upper limit for certain sensitive papers but certainly this blanket rule to cover all for 30 years I find a little difficult to accept.</P>

      <P>As a person who is intensely curious I can see it is interesting to get one's hands on material during the course of one's lifetime and for most of us here our expectation of having access to certain documents about, shall we say, the lifetime of this Government is, by the law of averages, to some extent diminished. We must suffer a certain impatience in that regard.  Really, it is largely about a matter of balance.  We talked earlier about the necessity to have confidence between all of the people involved in extrapolating and ensuring that this archival material was kept.  I am concerned that if we had a lower time limit that we might destroy this confidence that will be painfully built up, I am sure, even with the maximum of goodwill of all concerned. My understanding is that in the United States, when attempts were made to have a lower limit, there was difficulty attached to this so that, on balance, I think by far the safest thing to do is to keep the 30 year limit in operation even though those of us who would sincerely love to have access to information must suffer a certain impatience with the result.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I share the Senator's curiosity.  One of the self-imposed disciplines upon somebody in my position is not to go looking back and inquiring into past records that might be interesting to read but which it would be contrary to one's duty to examine unless there was a compelling reason of current administrative or official duties that required one to look back.  I must say, given my own age and with a reasonable expectation of remaining in my present office for some years to come, the 30 year rule does suggest that any memoirs I may publish would have to be rewritten in my late nineties on the basis of full access to <Col N="1398" /> records., I am not too sure if I will be able to do this.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand people's concern about that, but the fact is that the 30 year rule is there for a reason.  There is an essential arbitrariness in choosing any period, not 29 not 31 but 30.  The fact is that over 20 years ago the World Congress of Archivists settled on the 30 year rule throughout the world and asked archivists to promote this aim in their own administrations because the periods tended to be longer than that.  It applies not just in Britain, but in France, Australia, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany and, indeed, to EC archives. It has become established because it is a kind off compromise between, on the one hand, the desire to ensure that civil servants and Ministers in carrying out their functions would not be inhibited in what they write by concern that what they write might appear and in some way be a source of embarrassment to them later in their administrative or political life or indeed even after it.  If you were to carry that to extremes, given that a civil servant aged 25 may be writing something or even a politician of 25 &mdash; a Minister is usually a little older than that &mdash; and that people can live into their nineties, you will have a 70 or 80 year rule, if you are going to say that nothing can be published until everybody who has written it was dead. That would be so restrictive that it would be unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the other extreme, if you shorten the period too much, you are certainly going to inhibit people's willingness to commit things to paper.  Even at 30 years there is some inhibition involved.  There are many documents that I see from time to time, which may involve reports on meetings or discussions with people, for example, and I could readily visualise their publication in 30 years would not merely be embarrassing but quite dangerous for people in some cases.  We are not in quite such a position of stable democracy as Senator Ryan represents in a State in which members of our security <Col N="1399" /> forces are murdered, unfortunately, from time to time and we are part of an island in which violence exists on an appalling and tragic scale.  Life is more complex than that.  Some compromise has to be reached and the 30 year rule has emerged as the archival standard internationally and we are applying it.  I would not agree with departing from it upwards and I do not think I could justify departing from it downwards.  I think therefore it should remain.</P>
    <P>Some of the points raised in the debate suggest that some Senators are not adverting to some aspects of this Bill. First of all, with regard to earlier access, there is a provision in section 10 (6) which deals with earlier access, within the 30 years.  There is a provision in section 8 (7) dealing with earlier transfer of documents in the archives within 30 years. Moreover, in so far as there may be concern that in respect of transferred access there might be undue caution in handing documents over or making them accessible after 30 years, there is a new section which we will be coming to in a few minutes which gives extra safeguards to ensure that the five-year review of transferred access will have a check on it and will not be simply arbitrarily at the behest of officials in the Department. We have provision for earlier access and transfer, for checks on cases where the transfer or access is later than 30 years. Thirty years seems on the whole to be optimum even though any figure is, of its nature, arbitrary.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 13:</P>
    <P>In page 8, to delete lines 16 to 20, and substitute the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) An officer of a Department of State authorised for the purpose of this subsection may certify that for stated reasons a particular Departmental record or class of records which is more than 30 years old and is specified in the certificate is in regular use in that <Col N="1400" /> Department or is required in connection with its administration and that its transfer to the National Archives would seriously interfere with the administration of that Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of subsection (2) have been a matter of concern because they seem capable of being used more widely than was intended.  The provision is necessary because there are many Departments that have records more than 30 years old which are in continuous use, the Companies Registration Office, the Land Registry Office and so on.  There is a real reason for it.  Careful consideration has been given to how the subsection might be improved and the amendment now being put forward will help considerably.  It will first of all oblige an authorised officer of a Department to state the grounds on which any particular record or class of record has been retained. That decision cannot now be taken arbitrarily or without an indication of a reason for it.  The grounds have to be stated.  In other words, there is a further criterion introduced in that a record may not be retained unless its transfer would seriously interfere with the administration of a Department.  This would remove the temptation to retain files on the ground that they may be required occasionally.  It is a temptation that would be quite strong because there are many files which you could easily visualise you might want some time: something might turn up on that.  Unless they are files which are required with such frequency that to have to go to the archives for them each time would seriously interfere with the administration of the Department, they should be transferred.  They can, if the occasion arises, be brought back again if they are needed.  We have tried to tighten up here, to establish very strong criteria to ensure the retention of files on the grounds that they are being currently needed would not be abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a new provision which we will come to in amendment No. 22 which provides a cross-check on the operation of this, so that it is not simply a question of it being left totally to the decision of <Col N="1401" /> an official in the Department concerned. It is like a power of review and a power of overruling resting with an official of the Department of the Taoiseach, which offers a further cross-check.  This amendment is a useful one which will offer quite strong safeguards against the abuse of a requirement which is inherently necessary but which is also capable of being abused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated that the amendment is welcome in so far as it answers criticisms that were made at an earlier stage.  Would it not be one logical step further on to require the permission of an authorised official within the Department of the Taoiseach to be granted, because while this does answer, in so far as it makes the point that grounds have to be stated, it equally tightens it up in a very welcome way rather than have a variation of interpretation across Departments.  In so far as a new competence and interest will be developing within the Department of the Taoiseach, might it not be an idea to extend it even a little bit further and require permission from an authorised officer within the Department of the Taoiseach?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome this amendment because I feel that the original subsection (1) was far too sweeping and indeed we all suffer from this disease of looking at files and saying: &ldquo;Ah well, that might be needed at some stage,&rdquo; but they can sit there for long enough and we would never go near them.  This is important.  I notice that in subsection (11) the Taoiseach may prescribe a particular class of records where certificates granted under subsections (2) or (4) may relate.  As regards this and as regards generally the powers within the Bill to make regulations and to prescribe things and so on, would the Taoiseach be able to tell us when he envisages such regulations will be made?  I do not mean obviously to the day, but in rough terms, at any rate.  How soon can we look forward to seeing regulations under the Bill, when enacted, made and these various powers being used?  They are important <Col N="1402" /> powers and they will certainly back up the position of the director and the position of the National Archives but they are powers which will need to be put into use as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to answer that question because there are different functions which it falls to the Taoiseach to undertake.  In the particular case mentioned, which is subsection (11) of section 8, the Taoiseach may, by order, prescribe a particular class or classes of records in relation to which a certificate granted may relate and may by order revoke an order.  In that particular case, I envisage what would happen would be that, as Departments face up to having to transfer records, in certain cases they will find that there are classes of records which are needed for continuous use, such as the files of the Companies Office, for example.  They would then come to the Taoiseach's Department and say: &ldquo;We cannot make an order for every single company file.  Obviously, the current files on companies that we have are companies that still exist.  We want that class of record to be kept&rdquo;.  If that comes up then it is something in regard to which an order has to be made.  In relation to that subsection, I visualise that during the next two years there will be a succession of requests to be considered for things to be acceptably exempted by class rather than by individual file.  In other cases, the order is to be made because of rather different circumstances and over rather different time scales.  I could not give a general answer to the question. Obviously, many of the orders will have to be made during this two-year period in order to get the whole procedure off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other point made by Senator Higgins, it would be possible to do what he suggests.  I think on the whole the balance is against it.  I have brought in this cross-check against the possibility of abuse but I think you are imposing an unduly onerous burden on the Department of the Taoiseach if they have to be engaged in examining every individual case where files are retained or <Col N="1403" /> required to be retained for longer than the specified period.</P>
    <P>I think what is needed is a power of intervention, a power of cross-check, a power to act in any case where, for example, the director may say: &ldquo;I think that Department are really being a bit ridiculous. They are holding on to records because they might need them occasionally: they are not actually in continuous use.&rdquo;  That should be looked at.  You want the power of intervention there to overrule a Department which is acting against the spirit of the Bill.  To actually require every single record to be inspected not only by the officer in the Department but also by the Taoiseach's Department is going further than is necessary.  If the director is dissatisfied with the failure of any Department in transferring files it is a matter he would raise and that would bring into effect the operation of this amendment and the Taoiseach's Department would intervene to check as to whether in fact there is an abuse and if so, to ensure that it is terminated.  That is an adequate check and if you go too far you really are creating an extraordinarily cumbersome bureaucratic procedure with so many civil servants looking at so many files that you are going to clog up the whole system.  The amendment we have now is adequate for the purpose given, that the director will be in a position to draw attention to any case where he thinks the Department are abusing this power.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be pushing the limits of my limited optimism to suggest that this Bill <Col N="1404" /> could go through without this subsection. Nevertheless, this concept of what is &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; is a particularly unhappy choice of phrase because many people would suspect that what we politicians or, indeed most of the public service, would describe as being contrary to the public interest would be those things in which the public would have the greatest interest.  If there is to be a catch-all phrase, which is perhaps necessary, there are obvious areas.  The Taoiseach mentioned the one of national security.  It was a pity he brought in the question of Northern Ireland, and so on. It suggested a reflection on my concern which I do not think he intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not have taken offence in that case.  I really did not take offence because I did not think it was intended.  On the question of security we could argue forever about what represented a threat to national security.  Some of the things I have seen portrayed as threats to national security are pushing it a little too far.  Nevertheless, we accept that there is a threat to national security. There are other issues of privacy or distress and all the things that are mentioned there.  &ldquo;Contrary to the public interest&rdquo; is one of these phrases used regularly.  I hear Government Ministers use it regularly when they are asked to give information on something for which there is not a precedent or it would not be in the public interest to do it.  There is a particularly offensive perception of the public that there is a whole host of areas which the Government, the public service, and politicians know about, but which the public should not know about. Things that are to be withheld from the public should be withheld for good and clearly stated reasons which sound credible to the public, to the media and to professionals who would be interested and which are not so defined for reasons that seem appropriate to a public servant with the approval of his Minister or the <Col N="1405" /> Taoiseach as the case may be at a particular moment in history.</P>
      <P>We could and we should &mdash; and if we do not make progress here I will have to try to do it myself between now and Report Stage &mdash; come up with a term which incorporates necessary protection but, at the same time, does not leave as broad and as many meanings of an expression such as &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; intact.  It leaves whole areas of controversy and whole areas of possible poor decision-making in the past, whole areas of perhaps inadequate advice or inadequate information being tendered at a time, whole areas being capable of being kept quiet for long periods of time because they are not in the public interest.</P>
      <P>Unlike the Taoiseach and, indeed, the leader of the House I have not had the experience of ministerial office and do not even with limitless optimism expect to experience it in the immediate future at least.  Nevertheless, I think it is a very widely used device for Ministers and for the public servants to suggest that certain things are not in the public interest.  My instinct, my suspicion and, indeed, I think the experience we have all had is that when that term arises it usually means that it is something the disclosure of which would by and large by very much in the public interest but not in the interests of those required to disclose it.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Senator B. Ryan.  I do not want to say too much about it because we should confine ourselves entirely to the terms of its potential usage within this Bill.  Many examples come to my mind where arbitrary discretion and action have, in fact, been justified retrospectively when there were substantial abuses under later examination on the basis that, at the time, they purported to be in the public interest.  I support him in this quest for an alternative wording.  I also think in terms of legislation in general it is an anachronism now.  It found its usage, I believe, in statutes at a time when you could presume an unquestioned consensus in relation to the terminology &ldquo;the <Col N="1406" /> public interest&rdquo;.  We are living in far too great a flux of change.  The balance of social circumstances is changing all the time.  As well as that, it is part of our own tolerant society that we have possibly learnt to accommodate forms of dissent. Indeed, historically the abuse of this term &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; has arisen where it has been invoked authoritatively or in an authoritarian way more accurately to question forms of expressed dissent.</P>

While paragraphs (b) and (c) set out the main specific cases which may arise and are rightly included, there may well be need for an extra phrase which would give some sort of generality of discretion.  Really the phrase &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo; seems to me to be the kind of reasoning that can be used to cover a multitude of non-disclosures.  While I have not at the moment got an alternative phrase to suggest I would hope that between now and Report Stage the Taoiseach could try to find something a bit more restrictive than this phrase &ldquo;contrary to the public interest&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I have to confess to a certain sympathy with what has been said.  I am very uncertain as to how one might meet the points made.  There is no doubt that there can be an all too ready inclination to use &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; to cover a multitude of sins of omission or commission.  I suppose there must be some temptation when documents are to be published which may reveal some act of incompetence or unwisdom on the part of an official or a Government 30 years earlier, not to publish them.  Given the continuity of the governmental system and the party system, I suppose you could envisage a document being published in 1988 about something that happened in 1958.  The Government might be embarrassed about having it published even 30 <Col N="1407" /> years later for reasons of political embarrassment. It would have nothing whatever to do with the public interest.</P>
      <P>The point in principle is well taken. The difficulty is how to deal with it.  I am not sure that I can see another way of proceeding.  I decided when drafting the Bill that the decision in respect of this should be a decision of the civil servant in the relevant department and not of the Minister.  I am perhaps more sensitive to the danger of non-disclosure for reasons of political embarrassment, but I recognise that there might also be a temptation on the part of civil servants not to disclose something because it would reflect adversely on the Department or perhaps even on a civil servant who is still serving. While I have guarded against one danger I have not necessarily guarded against the other.</P>
      <P>I have done my best to try to protect against a political abuse of this power of non-disclosure.  Something might not be disclosed because it was political but was of genuine public interest.  If it is possible to think of some other way of tackling this or some other phraseology I do not exclude that, but I have difficulties about it.  Possibly other countries have found ways of doing this.  The difficulty about listing cases specifically rather than using a general phrase is that it is not certain that one would think of all the cases where there would be a real, genuine reason.  One thinks of the balance of a relationship with another country or agreements with other countries and things of that kind, but there will be others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to my reference to Northern Ireland &mdash; I do not know why the Senator thought I was reflecting on him but I had no intention of doing so.  I am conscious of that fact because of the nature of my duties at present in a country which faces these problems of many documents, operations and communications that exist, the publication of which in 30 years' time in a country of such long memories as this could be dangerous to people.  One may say that that is covered by paragraph (c) and perhaps it is, but I <Col N="1408" /> have an uneasy feeling that we might not think of all the possible dangers that could exist.  I am not excluding some other phraseology if people would like to reflect further on it and come back with ideas.  I will look at it myself and see if there is any other way of tackling it because I accept that the wording here is not tight.  It is capable of abuse.  If I can be convinced that any change should be made that would not itself place genuine dangers in not adverting to a possible situation I would be prepared to look at it.  Perhaps we could reflect further on this on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, sitting listening and trying to be reasonable I wonder would it be possible perhaps to use a word other than &ldquo;contrary&rdquo;, or possibly a stronger word than &ldquo;contrary&rdquo;? I suggest using something like &ldquo;seriously threaten&rdquo; or some other choice of phrase like that rather than &ldquo;contrary&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Contrary&rdquo; seems to me to be a very weak word.  Something like &ldquo;seriously threaten&rdquo; or &ldquo;seriously endanger&rdquo; might perhaps meet many of my requirements and the concerns we all share.</P>

      <P>Just before we move on, there seems to be no reference to administrative records of the Oireachtas in the provisions of the Bill.  This was mentioned in some correspondence.  Is there a reason for this, or am I mistaken?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that it appeared to me that it would be inappropriate for the Executive to propose in legislation that records of the Oireachtas <Col N="1409" /> should be published.  I saw that as a possible interference with the rights of the Oireachtas.  If the Oireachtas wishes access to be made available to its records then I feel such proposition should come from the Oireachtas and not from the Executive.  From recollection of one particular instance, the present rules of the Oireachtas about non-disclosure of documents are extremely stringent.  The rules require that certain documents should only be disclosed by an actual vote of the Oireachtas.  Otherwise they can never be disclosed and there is no time limit whatever. It seems to me that for me to tell the Oireachtas what their business should be in this regard would be inappropriate and even impertinent.  If Members of the Oireachtas wish on behalf of the Houses of the Oireachtas to propose that steps of this kind be taken, I am perfectly open to it.  But it must be a matter for the Oireachtas rather than the Executive.</P>

      <P>I think Senator B. Ryan gave rise to a very important point here.  Why should the Oireachtas be the last secret society in the public sector?  I see no reason for this at all.  I think the Taoiseach has given us a clear invitation here that we should act.  The only thing that this House and the other House have to consider is how we would act in this regard.  I would certainly be willing to bring this matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the Seanad for a discussion there where all the groups are represented.  We should do that and we should do it, if possible, before the Bill leaves this House.  In that connection, I would ask in order to assist the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges whether the Taoiseach would be able to make available to us a memorandum indicating how this problem is dealt with in the legislative Houses of Parliaments in other countries whose system is similar to our own.  I am quite sure that in the <Col N="1410" /> Taoiseach's Department in the course of preparing this Bill information must become available on this point.  I would ask if the Taoiseach would be prepared to have a memorandum prepared as a matter of urgency &mdash; because this Bill is well advanced &mdash; to be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the Seanad.</P>

It seems to me to be the best way of handling this issue.  One other piece of information which would certainly help me as a member of the committee is if we could have before us a generalised list of the classes of documents that would be affected by a lift of the secrecy rule regarding the records of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Obviously the main documents that come through the Houses of the Oireachtas and the records of the Houses themselves are in the public domain anyway, but a list of the classes of documents that are kept secretly would be a help to the members of the committee if they were considering this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one or two brief observations on section 10. Section 10 is an important section of the Bill having regard to the fact that the whole field of museums and historical groupings has increased greatly over the years.  There is clearly a great public awareness in this area.  Section 10 rightly makes the point that all archives with the National Archives shall be available for public inspection.  That being so, it would seem to me that there could be a danger of soiling, or tearing, or damaging documents. That has to be examined carefully. We have to have proper security. That is vital.  I am not talking about the security we referred to earlier.  I am talking about tearing, soiling, and that sort of damage.  It is very desirable that these two points be taken care of.  I understand there is little, if any, facility for the repair and conservation of damaged records in either the Public Record Office or the State Paper Office.  That being the case, it would seem to me that arrangements should be made to have that situation rectified.  Those are my two comments on that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will note the points made.  The first point is covered, or at least attempted to be covered, in section 10(7) which states: &ldquo;Nothing in the section should be construed as granting any right to inspect archives (or portions of them) which the Director considers to be in danger of damage through inspection by the public...&rdquo;  In such cases he will make copies available for inspection as soon as possible.  That seemed to us to be the best way of handling the point of which, indeed, I am very conscious.  If the Senator sees any way in which that can be improved upon I am quite open <Col N="1412" /> to it.  That is intended to cover the point made by the Senator.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>On a slightly different point on this section, perhaps an area of definition really, section 10 (1) states that all archives with the National Archives shall, subject to such regulations, and so on, be available for public inspection.  Does this include public records of the type that are defined in section 2 (1) (d) which would include such things as parochial records as being archives because these records are held elsewhere than in the Public Record Office under an Act repealed by this Bill. This is the phrase that has been used to define matters such as parochial records. I understand that they would not be in the custody of the National Archives.  I wonder if this phrase &ldquo;with the National Archives&rdquo; includes the records that are held under section 2 (1) (d)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 22 (2) the records the Senator speaks of are referred to.  It says:</P>
      <P>Not withstanding subsection (1) all archives which were formerly public records held at the commencement of this section elsewhere than in the Public Record Office of Ireland under an Act mentioned in that subsection shall remain in the custody in which they are at such commencement: provided that the Taoiseach, after consultation with the Director&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) may make regulations relating to the manner in which such archives are to be kept and for their proper custody...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not actually say &ldquo;access&rdquo; but the intention is that the subsection to which the Senator referred would cover those <Col N="1413" /> records.  I will examine that to ensure that the two are linked up properly together.</P>

      <P>I understand the intention is that section 10 (1) should cover them.  It is right that it should do so, but as they will remain specifically under section 22 in the custody in which they already are, they are records of a sort that should be open to public inspection.

      <P>11. &mdash;Notwithstanding section 8 (6) or 10 (5), an authorised officer of the Department of the Taoiseach may determine whether Departmental records, which are more than 30 years old and continue to be retained in a Department or, if transferred to the National Archives, continue to be withheld from public inspection, should be transferred to the National Archives to be made available for public inspection or, if already with the National Archives, should be made available for public inspection.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment to which I have already made reference in anticipation earlier in the debate which introduces the new provision for a role for the office of the Department of the Taoiseach in respect of the transfer and availability for inspection of records in the National Archives so that decisions about their non-transfer or non-availability for inspection will no longer be solely determined by an officer of the Department concerned.  It is a cross check.  It is a useful one.  I have already referred to it and justified it on several occasions so I will not dwell on it any longer at present subject to Senators having points they wish to raise.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In the second line, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after consultation with the Director&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This again may reflect my lack of experience in these things from the inside, but it appears to me, given the matters we discussed earlier with regard to access for inspection purposes to ensure the record was being kept and preserved properly, a bit anomalous that the decisions about disclosure should rest entirely with the public service.  The underlying suggestion that somehow the director must be kept at arms' length from questions in relation to the public interest or dangers to individuals, or breach of statutory duties, seems to me to retain the real power within that body which has the greatest interest.  I say this simply as a reflection of what I myself think I would be tempted to do in similar circumstances.  I am not attempting to suggest that other people are somehow less worthy than myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the normal inertia of large bodies and the normal inclination not to create further embarrassment and trouble for oneself, it seems to me it would be very useful to ensure that, where a decision to retain a record was being made by an officer of the Department of the Taoiseach, he should <Col N="1415" /> at least be required to consult with the director.  It would introduce an element of external reference.  I thought about putting in &ldquo;with the consent of the director&rdquo; but that would entirely undermine the objectives of retaining the records.  It is reasonable to suggest that the director ought to be consulted about decisions like that.  It at least ensures that the procedures are taken reasonably seriously and that it is not done in a cursory or an arbitrary fashion by some harassed civil servant who has about six other things on his agenda that day.  The obligation or the requirement of consulting the director would ensure that the matter would be handled with some deliberation and with some concern and care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have difficulty in seeing how this would work in practice. We are talking of records which to use the same phrase suggested by the Senator, would be seriously damaging to the public interest and constituting a breach of statutory duty or good faith because supplied in confidence and causing distress or danger to living persons.  What kind of consultation could take place with the officer of the Department concerned? We would have to say to the director: &ldquo;Come and have a look here; see all these boxes.  They all contain things which are seriously damaging to the public interest.&rdquo;  You cannot say more than that.  The director obviously is not in a position to go into in any detail as to how the public interest would be seriously damaged, or what living person would be damaged, or put in danger, or caused distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see how the proposed amendment would help.  It would be a gesture in a certain direction but in practice consultation could only be of the most perfunctory kind saying: &ldquo;All these files in this room are ones which come under these headings.  I am telling you this now and I am consulting you&rdquo;.  What could the director say other than: &ldquo;I do not know what is in the boxes I cannot tell you whether it is right or not.&rdquo;  I cannot <Col N="1416" /> see how the director could have a function in the matter if, as I believe to be the case, it would be inappropriate that he should be given the powers of inspection.</P>
    <P>While I understand the thrust of what the Senator is saying, I do not think the amendment would achieve anything in a practical way, or that it would be workable in practice.  You either accept that the decision as to what is seriously damaging to the public interest or involves a breach of good faith, or causes distress or danger is determined by the official of the Department who controls the record, or you do not.  I do not think there are half measures in this area.  You have to accept that somebody in the Department makes that decision.  I have introduced a cross check so that in the instance of the director being unhappy about the quantity of material not being transferred he could say to the Taoiseach's Department: &ldquo;I really think the Department are hanging on to a lot of material and it would be worth your while looking into it to see whether they really have good grounds for it.&rdquo;  That is open to him under the mechanism I have established.  I cannot see how there could be any form of serious consultation which involves excluding any inspection of or information about the nature of the contents of the documents.  I do not think the Senator's amendment will get us any further in this regard.  He may want to reflect further on it.  I cannot see how it would help.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has convinced me that my own amendment is inadequate.  He has not convinced me that what he has proposed is in the least adequate.  I am coming rapidly to the conclusion that the only really satisfactory way to ensure that decisions like this are taken in the spirit in which this legislation is intended is to trust the director to be involved in these decisions.  It seems that he is going to be a senior State official regarded as such and of the status in terms presumably of salary and conditions of some very senior civil servant. <Col N="1417" /> Therefore, it seems that the only solution is to actually trust the director and, perhaps, leave these decisions to the director in consultation with the officials referred to here who would also have access to the information.  It seems that anything else would really leave the decisions not with people who cannot be trusted, but with people who have a particular perspective on matters which is not necessarily the same perspective as that of other people or the same perspective as the Taoiseach has on this issue.  I will withdraw the amendment, but I will think about the issue between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the guarding against the improper removal of records and so on which is essential.  There is just one small point I would make about section 17 (1) (c) which states that &ldquo;a person shall not remove archives, which at the commencement of section 22 are held elsewhere than in the Public Record Office of Ireland under an Act mentioned in subsection (1) of that section, from the place in which they are so held at such commencement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to harp on this but within the Church of Ireland a great many parochial and other records could be held at parish level in not very good condition.  It has been found from time to time when we are trying to reorganise our own archives and our own records, that the best way to deal with this is to remove them to the custody of the Representative Church Body Library which has been developed <Col N="1419" /> in recent years to deal with this archival problem.  It would be possible for this to be dealt with under section 22 which permits the Taoiseach to make orders to permit a transfer of this sort.  I hope it will be dealt with sympathetically.  I want to be sure that paragraph (c) will not mean that one has to keep records in the place of custody which, in fact, is not a suitable place where they may be attacked by damp, mice, dust or whatever else because the Bill says they must be kept in the same custody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have met this point, I think.  This section starts: &ldquo;Except as provided by law a person shall not remove archives from the National Archives.&rdquo;  There is provision by law to meet the point the Senator is making. Section 22 (2) (a) (ii) says that where he considers it necessary for the preservation of such archives the Taoiseach, may, by order, provide for the transfer of such archives to the National Archives or, with the consent of the Council, to another archival institution or other appropriate body.  That does give power to remove parochial records from where they are to another appropriate body which could be a church representative body with the consent of the council.  The legal provision there governs and qualifies what is in section 17.  The point has been met by the provision here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume it would be possible for the Taoiseach under that paragraph in section 22 to make a kind of a class order, that he would not have to make an order in respect of consulting the council on every single record involved. A sort of a class order could be made that would allow this kind of transfer to take place because it does arise on quite a number of occasions.  It is very necessary to move quite quickly to rescue records that are deteriorating rapidly.</P>

      <P>I am working from memory now which is not very reliable. Under subsection (4) the Taoiseach may at any time terminate the employment of the chairman or any other member of the council.  That is usually, in most legislation I have seen, at least a little bit more circumspect.  It usually mentions by notice in writing or for reasons stated, or something like that.  It seems rather strongly worded, given the less than controversial nature of the council and chairman. The least we could have insisted on was that the Taoiseach should notify people in writing if he is going to terminate their appointment rather than as it stands, which is rather blunt and bald.  It is only a small matter.  But it seems rather different from other legislation that has passed through this House in my time here.</P>

      <P>Could the Taoiseach give us an indication of the role he sees for the National Archives Advisory Council?  I know the terms are laid out within the section itself to advise him in the exercise of his powers under this measure and all matters released to archives in their use for the public.  But from a more practical day to day point of view, how much influence, power and authority would the National Archives Advisory Council have over the whole question of the National Archives and to what extent will their advice be normally accepted?  Would the Taoiseach give us <Col N="1422" /> an idea of the extent to which he envisages the council will be used for the future enhancement of the preservation and expension of our National Archives?</P>

      <P>The section states:</P>
      <P>The members of the Council shall include not less than two members of the Irish Manuscripts Commission and not less than two archivists not employed by the National Archives.</P>
      <P>There is a strong case there for including, perhaps, a representative of the Professional Association or Archivists.  The point I make is that archivists who are working within the National Archives, and archivists working outside, both subscribe to the professional standards and practice and, indeed, the enthusiasm which their professional association creates for them.  Perhaps if they need not be mentioned some reference should be made to the professional association of those involved.  I would support that suggestion in the sense that it creates a professional consensus where I know it to exist.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers, I wonder in regard to the appointment of the advisory council how recognition might be given to the various local historical groups throughout the country. There is a federation of approximately 50.  There are probably hundreds of <i>ad hoc</i> village groups and so on, doing their own thing for their own area.  We all know there is great interest in this.  It may be only one person perhaps the local national teacher.  They are doing tremendous work and there is great interest.  The Irish people recognise and appreciate their past and the fact that it can be compiled and documented for them.  I am mindful of my own town where we have the Old Athlone Society.  It has existed for 20 years and is keeping the past to the forefront.  I am very mindful of the fact that a newspaper article, in my own local paper, recently gave a full page to memories of the past, written by a local person of my own era.  He was talking about Athlone of the mid-forties.  It received <Col N="1423" /> great interest.  It was an article that was discussed at length.  It brings back to me and highlights for me that there is such a fine interest in this area of our way of life.  I wonder how the Taoiseach can recognise the great work that these people are doing.  I would like to think that in some way it would be a national thing, it would not be a &ldquo;Dublinish&rdquo; or a Pale situation.  I would like to think that these people who are doing such great work in this <i>ad hoc</i> way be recognised in this council.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would think on these things when he is selecting his grouping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take these points, while I shall certainly look at the phraseology of the process of termination, I suspect that it would be rather standard phraseology.  Senator Dooge may have a point that if one varies it one may get into trouble.  I will look at it to see if there is any way in which it can be made to sound a little less abrupt.</P>
      <P>With regard to the functions of the National Archives Advisory Council, their specific powers are laid out at different points in the Bill and they have this role to play.  But beyond those specific powers there is also in section 22 the powers of submitting an annual report on the activities of the council.  In between these two, in between the specific role and the submission of that report, they would obviously have the function of overseeing the developed National Archives, ensuring that it develops in a satisfactory way and are taking up with the Taoiseach of the day, not merely in the annual report, but, if necessary, during the year any matters in respect of which they feel there is reasonable dissatisfaction and concern.  Any Taoiseach would take very seriously any advice coming from that source on behalf of the National Archives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think one should lay down the powers of the council in a restrictive way and seek to set them out in detail.  They are brought in where there is specific reason to bring them in to advise on a particular matter.  But beyond that, they <Col N="1424" /> should be left to offer fairly free ranging advice as and when they think proper and bring in their annual report during the year.  That is subject to any views Senators may have on it.  That would be my instincts in the matter.</P>
    <P>On the question of the appointments to the council, Senator Higgins raised the question of whether they should be required by law to appoint a representative of the professional association.  I will reflect on that.  I think that in the ordinary way it would be somewhat surprising if at least two archivists not employed by the National Archives were not in some way representative of the association. Whether one should make such provision in the Bill I do not know.  I have no strong views on that.  I will reflect on it.</P>
    <P>With regard to local groups concerned about history and the protection of our heritage and records, that is a very good point indeed.  It is not merely a question of recognising their work in some way just by giving an honour.  There is more than that to it.  Many of those people have very valuable experience of a most relevant kind.  In this instance where we are talking about a multitude of groups I do not think that you can lay down legislation that some particular person from that class has to be appointed.  It would be rather difficult to do.  In appointing the council I will have regard to the groups in question from whom I believe a member or members of the council could very appropriately be drawn.</P>

      <P>I would like to raise a question in relation to the publication of the reports.  I would ask the Taoiseach to consider that not only should they be submitted but arrangements should be made for their publication.  There would <Col N="1425" /> be widespread interest in their publication. That is the positive side of it.  The negative side of it is that the publication of the report would prevent any omissions or abuses in that regard.  I am also unhappy about the mechanism of laying reports before each House of the Oireachtas. Many valuable reports do not find their way into the public consciousness through that mechanism.  I would urge their more general publication</P>

      <P>I support Senator Higgins on this.  What is wanted is publication in a general sense, making the thing available to the public with sufficient copies printed because, as far as I understand from the deliberations of the Marriage Breakdown Committee, only a very limited number of copies need be produced in order technically to lay the matter before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I also understand that there have been a couple of reports by the Visitors to the National Museum which were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, but certainly were not published.  No doubt it was considered that it was contrary to the public interest to publish them, but I would not like that to arise with the council for National Archives and I would like a definite commitment to the fact that it would be published in the sense of plenty of copies of the report being made available and the public should be encouraged to take an interest in it.</P>

      <Col N="1427" /> SCHEDULE.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Schedule be the Schedule to the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points that arise on the Schedule.  One of them, of course, we have decided to handle, that is the question of the inclusion of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  But there are two other bodies whose absence can be noted here.  They probably arise because of their peculiar nature.  One of them is the Omsbudsman and the other is the Adoption Board.  It is important in this regard to distinguish between two classes of documents that are liable to be among the documents available in the office of the Omsbudsman and in the Adoption Board.  There are papers which relate to individual cases considered by the Omsbudsman and individual cases considered by the Adoption Board.  But I see no reason why papers which pass between a Minister and the Adoption Board should not reach the light of day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in this House, down through the years, at intervals discussed the question of the revision of the adoption laws. I was involved in one of these exercises. One could detect that there were very serious differences of opinion, in regard to the amendment of the law, between the Minister of the day and the Adoption Board.  I am not suggesting that this has occurred in regard necessarily to recent cases, nor am I suggesting any desire to pry into that within the period of 30 years, but I see absolutely no reason why the general administration of the Office of the Omsbudsman, the general relationship between that office and the Minister for the Public Service, or any other Minister, should not be covered by this Bill.  I feel the same is true with regard to the Adoption Board.  It would be quite easy. It could not really be done just by scheduling. I think simply to schedule these two bodies would create too much difficulty. It may be that consideration could be given to a section dealing with these two cases which would make the division between the papers relating to individual <Col N="1428" /> cases, which quite properly might be left protected, and to the general operation.</P>
    <P>The third point that arises on the Schedule is the manner of the order in which the Schedule appears.  I am not quite sure what protocol is being followed here but I suspect that it is the protocol of the Book of Estimates.  It starts with the Office of the President and it goes on to the Office of Taoiseach.  They leave the very important Departments of Finance and the Public Service, and lesser Departments, further down the way.  But it does seem to me that while that might have been a convenient way of listing in the drafting, for the sake of the general public, for the sake of anyone who looks at our Bills, we might, perhaps, put the Office of President first and afterwards put the others in alphabetical order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Dooge in his suggestion for the inclusion of these two bodies.  I only make the point that in relation to the journal which now exists, which makes a comparative study of the Office of Omsbudsman, there are many contributions dealing with the evolution in the history of that office. I can see very valuable research on the history of public administration and on the history of the innovation, that the creation of the office created, being impeded should we not seek to accommodate the point made by Senator Dooge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support Senator Dooge very much on this.  I know there may be some difficulty about just scheduling them but, after all, they would also be subject to the savers which were included in section 8 and this could be covered where it would be a breach of good faith on the grounds that they contain information supplied in confidence or contain information about individuals. Therefore, the confidential and individual information included in the records of the Adoption Board could very readily be protected.  However with regard to the communications between the Minister and the Adoption Board and the general records of the Adoption Board, it would <Col N="1429" /> be of help to have them included in the Schedule or dealt with in some other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The one series of bodies that are not mentioned here at all &mdash; and I think the Taoiseach referred to this on Second Stage &mdash; are the courts.  I understand there are reasons why that should be so but I suppose of all the bodies in the country the background to why courts arrived at a decision will probably be more relevant in the future than in respect of any other area of State activity and as precedents established in the legal area have a life which far exceeds 30 years or may have a life which far exceeds 30 years.  I understand that there are probably constitutional difficulties there as to who owns the papers.  Are they State papers or what category of papers are they?  It is an omission which requires careful consideration, recognising, of course, the separation of the Judiciary and the Executive, which is enshrined in our Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the last point my understanding is that this is covered in the Bill and I hope I am not wrong.  Section 1 (2) (b) deals with this as I understand it.  Paragraph (a) says &ldquo;a scheduled body&rdquo; means a body, institution, office, commission or committee referred to in the Schedule to this Act. Paragraph (b) says that in this Bill references to a Department of State include, where appropriate, references to a court. Paragraph (c) (ii) says: &ldquo;in relation to a court, as a reference to the Minister for Justice.&rdquo;  It seems to me, subject to contrary advice, that the court is included in any constitutional difficulty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I see.  My understanding is that all court records are included but my understanding and the law could be two different things.  Let me come back to the Senator on this on Report Stage if there is any difficulty about it. On the point about alphabetical order, one could do that all right.  Senator Dooge thinks it is important.  We could start with the President and put things in alphabetical order.  I see no diriment impediment to that procedure.  On the question of the Adoption Board and the Ombudsman, it is a little more difficult. The problem here is that, if they are included in some way in the section, quite irrationally, no matter how you delimit what papers would be made available and how carefully you exclude individual complaints, individual records, or individual documents, the fact that they are included in the Bill could give rise to disquiet even if there were no grounds for it whatever.  We are very concerned that nothing is done that could even irrationally make people fearful in regard to procedures of the Adoption Board or that in the early stages in the life of the Ombudsman's office anything should be done that could irrationally make people worry about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points made about correspondence between Departments and the board, which is a very good point, is covered because that correspondence will be amongst the records in the Department.  Correspondence will be published in the ordinary way so that would come out anyway.  I take Senator Dooge's point.  From a policy point of view that correspondence could be of very considerable historical importance. The only thing missing then are the actual records of the administrative working of the two boards.  At this stage rather than risk any loss of confidence in the confidentiality of the procedures of the two bodies, it is not worthwhile putting a special provision in just for those administrative records.  Perhaps at some time in the future that could be looked at.  I <Col N="1431" /> would be hesitant about doing it lest this be understood at this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few comments on this Bill.  I welcome the Bill in parts but, as I see it as a lay person, if we are to legislate on a national basis and if our prime consideration in the legislation is with particular groups, and we are catering very essentially for groups in such an area, particularly the disadvantaged areas, we are embarking on poor legislation at the <Col N="1432" /> outset.  I have to make that remark in general.</P>
      <P>I welcome the idea that we are registering bulls again on a national basis.  That is very important.  The Minister, the Department, the law enforcement agencies, the Garda Síochána are conscious at all times that we have many unregistered, unlicensed animals in the breeding herds. While the Bill will endeavour to combat part of that, we must be conscious that at all times, as in all professions, there will be within the farming community the rogue element which will at all times maintain certain numbers of those in certain areas, be they isolated or not.</P>
      <P>Isolation is not a criterion for the location and distribution of unlicensed, unregistered animals.  At this point the importance of the Bill must be seen in the fact that quality consciousness should be of apparent importance especially in our national herd.  I have no brief indeed for the breeding societies.  I have the greatest sympathy for them should this Bill pass in its present form through these Houses.  I say so for many reasons, not because they are unprotected by this Bill but because it essentially means that their work and dedication to the improvement of the standards, breeding qualities and characteristics of the respective breeds over the years has been undermined very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will take the proposal to license three-quarter bred animals for breeding. Many people might think that at present they have three-quarter bred animals for breeding purposes in their herd but, in fact there is nothing to say that they are actually three quarter-bred.  If they are retained within the herd as the years go by the quality is deteriorating very seriously. We might think that we can safeguard this quality by inspection as was done in the past by Department officials.  I have the greatest respect for the Department officials but when the nature of that inspection was visual in the past &mdash; I mentioned this in this House about 12 months ago &mdash; this was very inadequate. I instanced several times when a Department inspector went into any location where these inspections were due to <Col N="1433" /> take place under the instructions of the Department of Agriculture and visually inspected the animals there was actually a disaster in regard to breeding.  It has to be said that many of them have proven themselves to be incapable of breeding at all.  If such a structure of inspection is allowed to continue within the Department of Agriculture and animals are inspected visually without any further tests as to their proven ability to breed, such inspections will be totally inadequate. They are in urgent need of investigation with a view to establishing a more thorough inspection which would prove that they are animals capable of breeding as well as good animals.</P>
    <P>Very seldom has it ever been taken to court and successfully proven that animals presented for sale or otherwise following inspection and being certified by the Department were suitable breeding animals.  If that is the case we are allowing legislation to go through here which cannot stand up in court if such a situation arises.  It is time to call for a more thorough examination of the stocks that are allowed to go into the breeding herds particularly those that are allowed for sale.  Most of these animals going through these inspections are in fact registered as pedigree animals in various breeding society books.  While that may be so, the point I am trying to make is that registration in a book alone is of no importance if the inspection that was carried out was just a visual one.</P>
    <P>Some Senators mentioned this morning that in the past various organisations and breeders societies might have rings for sale purposes of their animals, having them registered, and a particular group can monopolise the whole situation.  I do not accept that at present.  It might have been the case in a few instances in the past but it would not be accepted by the farming community and the purchasers today nor could it even happen in present circumstances.  The point I am making is that if we permit the situation, as proposed in this Bill, that three quarter-bred animals are to be licensed for breeding purposes in disadvantaged areas we will be effectively giving a licence to allow <Col N="1434" /> our breeding stocks to deteriorate very substantially.  If non-pedigree animals are allowed into the breeding herd to produce we will ruin our herds.  We are lucky to have outlets in North Africa and the Far East for those types of animals.  They are not top class animals.  We are lucky.  If our competitiveness deteriorates where will we turn for markets to sell our inferior quality carcases?</P>
    <P>When we take into account that it is widely known and established, particuarly in the west where we are well known for our store cattle production, that many of the cattle bred in the dairying areas of Munster are bred with the idea that if a cow has a calf that calf can be shifted, regardless of the quality, to the store breeding areas of the country.  By and large the quality of the animal we get from the present dairying area in a lot of cases is not a good animal.  The reason for it not being good for beef production is simply because the animal siring those calves was not suitable for beef production. I believe we are putting in jeopardy the whole breeding stock and a very important sector of our agricultural income if we allow substandard animals to go into the breeding herds.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is any such thing as a three quarter-bred continental bull because how do we determine the quality or lack of it in those animals?  AI over the years has enabled particularly high standards in breeding stock for dairy purposes and for beef breeding to be built up.  While the maintenance of the standards within those breeds is in some way monitored loosely by the Department of Agriculture it has always remained within the hands of the breeding societies.  If we take from here the idea that these breeding societies will be undermined, indirectly we are allowing for the deterioration of our stocks and the quality of animals.  The idea that has been put forward by some speakers with regard to the cost, particularly to the suckler herds in the west, does not stand up at all in regard to the provision of full pedigree licensed animals.</P>
    <P>Let us take any time when pedigree bulls are offered for sale, particularly <Col N="1435" /> from January onwards, in any of the renowned centres for marketing of breeding stocks like Limerick, Carrickon-Shannon or Roscommon.  At the last 1984 sales, on average, it could be said that any ordinary commercial animal could fetch higher prices than pedigree animals could at that time.  It was recorded in <i>The Farmers Journal</i>, following one of those sales, that many of the animals shown for sale as breeding stock at some of those sales centres were actually brought immediately to the factories for slaughter.  There is no justification for anybody to oppose the Bill in the light of that fact.  The cost to many small breeders does not justify the purchase of a pedigree animal as against some other substandard quality animal.</P>
    <P>It has been said by the Sneem group, who are particuarly vociferous with regard to this Bill, that the conditions along the west coast were unsuitable or too severe for the real thoroughbred or pure bred animal, whether of a continental type or otherwise.  I could not accept that as being a reason for the unsuitability of pedigree animals being maintained in these outlying herds along the west coast. I will probably contradict myself by saying that if we are providing legislation essentially for disadvantaged areas and allowing this, we are doing a bad day's work for the national herd.  If we are to have legislation it must be legislation in the national sense rather than for smaller communities.  While many people would give statistics to prove that what I am saying is incorrect, many of the herds are small but they are certainly numerous.</P>
    <P>The important thing is that people can afford and are allowed by the Department to acquire proper breeding animals.  I agree with many Senators, particularly those representing areas along the west coast, that there is the facility for the Department to adequately compensate farmers without undue cost, particularly in disadvantaged areas, and provide an incentive for herd owners to purchase proper, high quality animals for breeding purposes.  I urge the Minister before he finalises this Bill to consider <Col N="1436" /> the difficulties expressed in this House and if there is a difficulty where finance is concerned, it is more important in the national interest for the Department of Agriculture to subsidise in some way the proper breeding of animals rather than to allow the national herd to deteriorate because of bad or poor breeding animals in the herd.</P>
    <P>Profit margins are very low in some cases and losses have been incurred by beef producers during the winter period. They must be taken into account because what they will have to acquire for the feeding and housing of animals in the autumn will be presented basically in the store areas of the markets.  Many of those animals will have come off suckler herds and when they go into the feeding lots they will melt away in agricultural terms. The feeder will be unable to maintain them.  In addition to the actual loss in production there is a delayed output which is also important.  Inferior quality takes longer to finish than the good quality animals which produce and grow at a constant and fast rate as is the normal case for pedigree animals.</P>
    <P>We should have learned by our mistakes in the past within the Department of Agriculture.  We have the record and we have our failure as shown during the period when the first beef heifer scheme was introduced.  I do not know the actual date, but it was in the early seventies when many very poor quality heifers were allowed to breed. Like the sheep flocks in mountainous areas most of those animals are bred more for disadvantaged headage payments than they are for real quality animals.</P>

      <P>Normally we would propose to adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on <Col N="1437" /> Wednesday, but a special consideration arises next week.  There is the possibility that Dáil Éireann might rise for the summer recess at the end of next week and, even if that is not achieved, it will rise at the end of the following week.  All Senators are conscious of the position with which this House is faced year after year whereby the Dáil in the closing week or weeks of its session passes important legislation and then adjourns leaving the Seanad in the relatively impotent position of having to discuss legislation and consider amendments, the passing of which would involve the recall of the Dáil.  I had consultations this afternoon with the Chief Whip of the Opposition party and we feel that this House should sit three days next week so that we can deal with legislative business to as large an extent as possible before Dáil Éireann adjourns. I must apologise to Members of the House for the fact that they are getting much shorter notice than would normally be given in regard to the question of a Tuesday sitting but I think they would agree that it would be in the interests of the dignity of this House if we were able to carry out as much as possible of our legislative work, which has to be done before we adjourn, while the other House is still in session.  For that reason I propose the adjournment until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was appalled to hear on the radio the secretary of the Airline Pilots' Association state that not only were they going on strike for four days, with all its implications and at the cost of at least £4 million to Aer Lingus, but that they were going to have 24 hour-lightning strikes.  All this came only 48 hours after their agreement had expired.  As serious as the four day strike is, notice was given <Col N="1438" /> and the airlines had an opportunity of providing alternatives and the public were made aware of it.  When we will have the lightning strikes the public may find themselves stranded for 24 hours in London or any other airport.  These people might need to be back for a funeral or to come back to someone who is seriously ill, or may have no money at the end of their trip and they would have to find their own way home.  They may have to find another place to sleep for the night.  That is all because the airline pilots took it into their own hands to take this action.  If retrenchment is forced on Aer Lingus then the obvious casualty will be the loss-making North Atlantic route which is costing about £20 million per annum, while the Irish Airline Pilots' Association captains are now earning £45,000 per year.  In addition to that, they get $75 a day expenses free of tax plus their hotels and their food.  Any contraction in the airline flight schedule will mean that the pilots jobs will be the first to go.</P>
      <P>I doubt that all the 250 pilots have endorsed this latest version of &ldquo;hijacking&rdquo; as practiced by the association on the general public.  We do not know if they had a meeting.  We do not know if they had a vote.  All we know is that the secretary of their association came on the radio and made these announcements. The reality is that the pilots are in dispute, not with Aer Lingus, but are on a collision course with the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Airline Pilots' Association were offered a special hearing by the Labour Court; they did not want it.  The Airline Pilots' Association knew that at the end of the month a decision and guidelines would be given to Aer Lingus by the Labour Court.  They could not wait until the end of the month.  If industrial relations as practised by the airline pilots were to be emulated by the rest of the country's workforce we would have strikes right across the community involving up to about 100,000 workers.  That is at least the number in the private sector whose pay deal under the 24th wage round has now run out and in some cases <Col N="1439" /> is stretching back to last November and not back 48 hours as in the case of the pilots.</P>
    <P>In my view, whatever the reason, this action is utterly indefensible and politically motivated.  I say politically motivated because they refused a Labour Court hearing; they refused to discuss the dispute with their employer, Aer Lingus; they wanted to discuss it with the Government. They wanted a Government decision and they would not take the normal course.  It is very difficult to understand the contempt the 150 pilots and their association are showing not only for the travelling public but for the vital tourist industry and also for their 5,500 colleagues in Aer Lingus whose job prospects could be adversely affected by this unnecessary stoppage.</P>
    <P>Over the next decade Aer Lingus will have to provide from £300 million to £500 million to replace their shorthaul fleet and the Government have put them on notice that they must fund this from their own resources.  How can they fund anything from their own resources when they are losing money and when an opportunity to make money arises it is just thrown away?  Not only will the pilots strike have that result but it will cost the airline £4 million.  That is for a start.  The tourist season in this country was just getting on its feet and it looked as if we were going to have a bumper season.  That was judged from the bookings in various resorts, such as Killarney, where I come from.</P>
    <P>As the Fine Gael Party spokesman in the Seanad for tourism I am making this case, but when I wear my other hat I am also involved in tourism.  I have a fleet of self-drive cars and I have coaches and I know how I am going to be affected.  My colleagues in the business all over the country are going to be affected.  I know how the hotels are going to be affected. The public abroad were educated to come here and much of it was a spin-off from President Reagan's visit.  Now, all of that is going to be destroyed.</P>
    <P>The pilots who were originally based in Shannon for social reasons got transfers to Dublin.  Naturally, they had <Col N="1440" /> families who were growing up and they had in Dublin educational and other facilities which they would not have in Shannon. Then Aer Lingus moved the major maintenance staff and equipment to Dublin.  That was a big loss to Shannon. A spokesman at one of the annual dinners of the pilots' association proposed to overfly Shannon despite the fact that 65 per cent to 70 per cent of passengers disembark in Shannon.  The pilots association &mdash; and I would not tar them all with the same brush because I know there are decent people in it, people who would not be part of this action but are somehow hooked on it and it has made them anti-Shannon, anti-west and anti-Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will be aware the Minister for Communications is occupied in the Dáil on the Transport Bill.  I listened with interest to Senator Daly speaking about the four-day stoppage of the Aer Lingus pilots. The effects on the finances of the company, on the tourist trade as so graphically illustrated by Senator Daly, on the community generally and above all, on the travelling public are plain and are rightly deplored by all.  The outstanding feature of the affair and the one commented on most widely has been the unseemly haste with which the industrial action has been undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is well known the pay agreement for all categories of Aer Lingus workers, including the pilots, did not expire until 30 June and, in the ordinary progress of industrial relations, it would have been expected that discussion and negotiations would have been in progress for some period following the expiry date.  However, a week before the expiry date the pilots' association took the unusual step at such an early stage of threatening a four-day stoppage.  Despite intensive talks with the company, they could not be persuaded to call it off or at least postpone it.  Not only that, but they also declined to accept a formal invitation from the Labour Court to a hearing of their claim on Saturday 29 June, almost in the teeth of the stoppage itself.  It makes it <Col N="1441" /> all the harder to understand when one recalls that at the time a claim on behalf of a substantial body of the Aer Lingus workforce lay before the court, on which a recommendation is to be made before the end of the month.</P>
    <P>In recent years Aer Lingus have been among the early starters on the wage round.  This allied with the fact that their 24th round agreement ran for a shorter period than agreements in a number of other State bodies, means that they ended ahead of most other State bodies and also in the middle of the Aer Lingus peak traffic and tourist season.  For a group such as the pilots' association to take industrial action just 24 hours after the expiry of their pay agreement shows an inexplicable disregard for and an unwillingness to give any consideration to the effect of such precipitate action.  It is a pity that in this way the pilots should risk damage to the reputation which their high skill and professionalism have won for them not only among the community here but also abroad.</P>
    <P>The pilots association have stated that Aer Lingus have been prevented by the Government from entering into negotiations on their pay claim.  They have also indicated that even a 1 per cent token pay increase would have been enough to avert the strike.  Formal guidelines for public sector pay have not yet been adopted by the Government.  As I have already indicated, Aer Lingus were one of the earliest bodies to be dealt with in last year's pay round and many other settlements have still some time to run.</P>
    <P>In the very difficult position of the Exchequer, the Government are most concerned about the pay bill of the public <Col N="1442" /> service, at present running at almost £2.5 billion, and could not willingly countenance any pay movement in the public sector that might prejudice their position in dealing with that problem.  Also, as I have mentioned, the Labour Court are still dealing with a claim on behalf of a substantial body of the Aer Lingus workforce, and have indicated that they will be making a recommendation at the end of this month.  In that situation, the Government could not approve of any offer of a pay increase to the pilots.</P>
    <P>While the contingency plan mounted by Aer Lingus with such rapidity has helped in limiting the inconvenience to the travelling public, the dispute cannot but have a damaging effect.  Some of these effects were outlined in detail by Senator Daly in his capacity as Senator and from his on the spot dealings with the tourist industry.  It is not too late even at this stage to look for a limitation of the damage which this stoppage is causing. The most effective way of securing this would be if the pilots would call off their industrial action.  This would be very much in the national interest as well as in the interest of the viability of their own airline.  On behalf of the Government, I call upon the Aer Lingus pilots to reconsider their attitude and call off their industrial action and resume normal working.  Such a move would, I believe, be welcomed by all sections of the community and would, I would hope, redress or at the very least limit the damaging effects of their industrial action.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 9 July 1985.</P>
