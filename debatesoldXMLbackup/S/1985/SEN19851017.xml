      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>In a moment I am going to say something that is in order but first I should like to support Senator Higgins in what he says.  The procedures should be revised whereby a matter of such importance may be discussed in the House.  It is a matter of great emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I do not understand why we are taking item No. 2 today at 2 o'clock <Col N="425" /> because I have just read the report of what Senator Dooge said at the end of our last meeting and that was that we would sit all day today and next week, all legislation having been passed, to discuss the Report of the Joint Committee on Marital Breakdown.  On that understanding the Independents did not oppose the fact that the Seanad, for some strange reason, was not to sit last week.  It was particularly on that understanding, and with that promise from the Leader of the House, that we did not oppose the absence of any meeting last week.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the report of the Ombudsman has been put in now because Senator Dooge gave a promise. Are the Government again trying to give us only two and a half hours today to discuss marital breakdown or are we coming back to this after the annual report of the Ombudsman?  I should like the Acting Leader of the House to give us an assurance &mdash; an assurance we have already &mdash; that next Thursday, when we are meant to meet again, we will not again have only two and a half hours or less to discuss marital breakdown.  Will that assurance of Senator Dooge &mdash; I am sorry to be speaking about him in his absence &mdash; be carried through to next Thursday also?  Does that assurance still hold or are we going to have another report slipped in next week?</P>

On reading Standing Orders I <Col N="426" /> well understand that it is in the interests of the orderly business of the Seanad that people should give notice when they intend to raise matters but I am sure the Chair will appreciate that at any time the President of the South African Republic could have acceded to requests by the international community to defer the hanging in question.</P>

    <Title>Report of Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator Dooge on Thursday, 27 June 1985:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the Report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, urges the widest possible debate on its recommendations and calls on the Government to consider the holding of a Referendum on Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Government&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to hold a referendum on Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution within the lifetime of the present Government&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Ross.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day I had been considering, in detail, the submissions made to the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown on the divorce issue.  These are set out, as Senators are aware, in the section of chapter 7 dealing <Col N="427" /> with divorce.  They are divided, firstly, into the arguments in favour of divorce and these are followed by the arguments against divorce.  Senators will note that all the points which have already been raised in this debate by Senators and which will continue to be raised by those who participate later today, or next week, were fully considered by the Joint Committee.  They set out the arguments for and against divorce and then said how the committee considered those arguments. They did so in great detail and in a very fair-minded and balanced way.</P>
      <P>This parliamentary committee, representative of all sides of the political spectrum in both Houses, weighed up the evidence and the arguments and came down in favour of accepting the need to remove the constitutional ban on divorce. The political significance has not yet been fully appreciated.  The matter has been examined in great detail, it has been examined by a committee who were empowered to, and did seek representations from the public.  They received in excess of 700 written submissions and devoted a lot of time listening to groups representing both sides of this very important debate and those with a specialist knowledge or interest in the subject.</P>
      <P>The calling for the removal of the constitutional ban on divorce by the committee was not done in a neutral or abstract sense.  It was a positive commitment on the part of the all-party committee because the committee called for the removal of the ban on divorce in a manner which was not ambiguous.  It was clearly intended to prepare the way for the introduction of divorce legislation.  I would remind Senators of this by quoting from the relevant paragraph in the summary of the recommendations of the committee.  There we see summarised precisely how the committee wished to see the removal of the ban on divorce considered.  It said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any such referendum should be in a positive format, replacing the present Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution with a provision, specifically authorising the <Col N="428" /> Oireachtas to legislate for the dissolution of marriage. <i>(Paragraph 7.8.29)</i>.</P>
    <P>That shows the clear Parliamentary view of the all-party committee and their recommendation having very carefully weighed up the arguments.  I invite Senators &mdash; particularly Senators who are either worried or not yet sure of their view on this issue &mdash; to look at the very detailed arguments as set out, to look at the way all the fears and apprehensions were expressed.  They are set out in the report and they were considered by the committee.  Yet the committee clearly and unequivocally recommended the removal of the ban on divorce and did so in the context of preparing the way for the introduction of divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>I turn now to an important issue in relation to the kind of divorce legislation which the committee wish to see.  I want to address in particular the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Nuala Fennell, in her contribution to the Seanad debate on 27 June last.  Senators will recall that the all-party committee had referred to the kind of divorce legislation which they would envisage if the ban on divorce was removed.  I have already referred to this passage but since I am going to deal with it perhaps I should remind the House of what the committee said about it, in summary terms.  The committee emphasised, that if the referendum were held and passed, a situation of divorce on demand would not be appropriate that it would be essential to have adequate safeguards.</P>
    <P>One of the criteria that the committee recommended was that any such divorce legislation should be based on the concept of marital breakdown.  I was concerned and indeed somewhat worried when I read the contribution of the Minister of State on this point, because she appeared to be confused about different concepts.  It also appeared that she had not read the report of the committee on marriage breakdown with the care that one would wish.  She noted that the Joint Committee did not wish to have introduced into Ireland &mdash; because it would be unacceptable to the vast majority of <Col N="429" /> people &mdash; the concept of divorce on demand.  But she asked how is this to be reconciled with the recommendation of the committee that divorce when introduced would be based on the concept of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage? A passage from the contribution which the Minister of State made highlights the difficulty she had with this.  I want to address, and I hope, unravel that difficulty for her and remove some of the confusion from this passage that I am going to quote.  The passage is from column 1183, Volume 108 of the Seanad Debate of 27 June 1985 and it is as follows:</P>
    <P>One of the first questions is whether or not &ldquo;fault&rdquo;, i.e. adultery, cruelty, desertion, should play a part in any legislation that might be necessary.  In modern systems the concept of no fault divorce has become common.  I mention this because there seems to be a view that fault should play no part in any legislation we might have, whereas I think that that question would be, to say the least, still open.</P>
    <P>The argument usually made is that the necessity to prove fault can lead to allegations and counter allegations and can result in a painful and humiliating public inquisition on the marriage.  I venture to say that the matter is not quite so simple.  The fact that matrimonial cases are heard in our jurisdiction <i>in camera</i> obviates public, if not private, embarrassment of the parties. It has also been recognised that fault cannot be completely eliminated from divorce legislation, for example, questions of conduct inevitably arise in coming to decisions on maintenance, division of property, custody of children etc.  To that extent fault remains. Again, even with breakdown as the basic ground, if that were to mean something more than a mere formula of words, it should presumably impose an obligation on the court to satisfy itself that breakdown had in fact occurred and this could mean an inquisition into the marriage as painful as <Col N="430" /> any under a fault system.  Fault is a feature of our existing family legislation in maintenance, judicial separation, succession, occupation of the family home and barring orders, and I would not accept that we should get rid of it in these areas.</P>
    <P>The situation in England is of interest. While, there, divorce is granted only on the basis of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, in order to establish breakdown it is necessary to prove one of five facts, three of which are fault-based.  In 1982, 70 per cent of decrees were granted on proof of fault-based facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on in this vein.  There appears to be a very high degree of confusion in that passage.  It would appear that the Minister has not in fact understood the recommendation of the joint committee on this point.  The interesting aspect of the analysis of the joint committee is that the concept of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage is considered by the joint committee initially in the context of judicial separation.  That is where we have the full analysis of this concept of the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.  I will come to the relevant passage in a moment, but briefly the joint committee unanimously recommend that irretrievable breakdown becomes the basis for a decree of judicial separation. It is later in chapter 7 that the committee consider the question of divorce legislation if the constitutional ban on divorce is removed.  They link back to what they said on irretrievable breakdown in the context of a judicial separation and said that there should be the same approach to the divorce issue.  It is most important that the Minister of State appreciates that the committee recommend for existing remedies, for the remedy of judicial separation, that the law be changed and improved by introducing as the basis for the granting of a decree of judicial separation, the concept of the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.  But then &mdash; and this may meet a large part of the worry and concern of the Minister &mdash; it is quite clear from the way that this is set <Col N="431" /> out that this ground would not remove from the court the importance of being satisfied that the marriage had irretrievably broken down.  The basis on which the court would be satisfied would be by looking at the criteria as set out by the committee on this point.  I will refer to what the committee had to say on what would constitute the irretrievable breakdown of a marriage.  It will be perfectly clear that the matters which the court will consider, whether in the context of a party looking for a decree of judicial separation or whether, in the future, in the context of looking for the remedy of divorce in our society will be whether or not there had been a irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.  The passage I want to refer to is at page 49 of the report of the committee.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  The court should grant a decree of Judicial Separation if it is satisfied that the marriage of the person to his or her spouse has irretrievably broken down.  Irretrievable breakdown should be the one overall ground for the grant of a decree of Judicial Separation.</P>
    <P>2.  In considering whether or not a marriage has irretrievably broken down, the court should be satisfied that such breakdown has occurred if an applicant proves one of the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  That his or her spouse has behaved in such a way that the Applicant cannot reasonably be expected to co-habit with that other spouse.</P>
    <P>(b)  That his or her spouse has been guilty of adultery.</P>
    <P>(c)  That his or her spouse is in desertion or in constructive desertion of the Applicant.</P>
    <P>(d)  That the Applicant has been living separate and apart from the other spouse for a continuous period of not less than one year and the other spouse consents to the making of the decree.</P>
    <P>(e)  That the Applicant has been <Col N="432" /> living separate and apart from the other spouse for a continuous period of three years.</P>
    <P>(f)  That such other facts and/or reasons exist or existed which in all circumstances make it reasonable for the Applicant to live separate from, and not co-habit with, the other spouse.</P>
    <P>That is the view of the joint committee, as to the proper basis for the court examining the situation and concluding on the basis of evidence and the examination of the parties and any witnesses that there has been an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.  The passage which I have quoted from the Minister of State's speech suggests that she would not accept any change in relation to the grounds for obtaining a decree of judicial separation. I hope that was said inadvertently, I hope that is not in any way an indication of the approach either by the Minister of State or the Department of Justice to significant reforms expressly called for by the joint committee in our existing law in relation to judicial separation as well as being also the proper basis for future legislation providing for the remedy of divorce.</P>
    <P>What might well be the subject of discussion in this House is whether Senators have a view on these criteria which are the unanimous view of the joint committee; there was no dissent at all on them, but maybe Senators would prefer, for example, a longer period of separation. This is a recommendation relating to existing law.  I will come back to a number of the important recommendations on other areas besides divorce which the joint committee recommended, but I want to take up that important issue which appeared to reveal some confusion on the part of the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>While still dealing with the recommendation of the joint committee to remove the ban on divorce I want to address a recent initiative taken in that area, namely the proposal by Deputy Michael O'Leary to introduce as a backbencher a combination of Bills seeking to remove the constitutional ban on divorce and a <Col N="433" /> Marriage Bill which would be the subject of a second referendum if his combined proposals were to be acceptable.  There is a superb irony in the fact that this Private Members' proposal comes from Deputy O'Leary who has changed party and is now a backbencher.  When Deputy O'Leary was in the Labour Party a Bill was drafted &mdash; I was the drafter of it &mdash; entitled the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1980.  I have a copy of the text of it here.  It was proposed to be an Act to amend the Constitution by removing the ban on divorce and inserting a different formulation.  I will put on the record of this House what that formulation would have been.  It would have inserted a new section 3 to Article 41 as follows:</P>
    <P>1º The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of marriage and to protect it against attack. The State shall take measures to encourage adequate preparation for marriage and to promote the stability of marriage.</P>
    <P>2º It shall be the duty of the State, in making provision in cases of marital breakdown, to seek reconciliation between the parties to the marriage, to provide for the physical and economic protection of vulnerable family members and to afford a means for the dissolution of marriages which have broken down irretrievably.</P>
    <P>I also have a copy here of a brief explanatory memorandum to that Bill which was circulated to members of the Labour Party in 1980 with a view to the Labour Party introducing that as a Private Members' Bill.  Deputy O'Leary, who was then deputy leader of the Party &mdash; Deputy Frank Cluskey was the leader &mdash; opposed the idea of the Labour Party introducing a Private Members' Bill and sought instead to have the Labour Party introduce a motion to establish an all-party committee on the subject, and that is what happened.</P>
    <P>In the autumn of 1980 the Labour Party <Col N="434" /> introduced a motion to establish an all-party committee to examine the question of the removal of the ban on divorce.  The fact that the Labour Party had introduced that motion was used as the basis for refusing to support Deputy Noel Browne who sought to introduce a Private Members' Bill.  He could not get enough Members of the Dáil to support him on that occasion.  Since then efforts by The Workers' Party to introduce Private Members' legislation have not been supported on the basis that there was about to be established, or there was established and working on the issue, a Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  Now that joint committee have reported &mdash; their report is dated on 27 March 1985 &mdash; and reccommended the removal of a ban on divorce.</P>
    <P>I understand that next week we are going to have a proposal by Deputy O'Leary seeking to have his Bill or combination of Bills published and circulated for discussion.  We have now run out of excuses on this.  Those who are clearly committed to the removal of the constitutional ban on divorce and the introduction of divorce legislation, which would form part of the draft Marriage Bill which Deputy O'Leary wishes to have published and circulated, cannot but be prepared to allow the publication and circulation of this legislation.  It is a way of advancing the debate.  It is a way of ensuring that the two Houses consider this issue.  The legislation will be put through both Houses of the Oireachtas only if the Government are prepared to introduce the necessary legislation and to have a referendum subsequently to endorse that legislation.</P>
    <P>We have gone through all the hoops and loops on this issue.  We have had what the motion calls for.  We have had the widest possible debate on the issue. We have had previous efforts to introduce a Bill to remove the ban on divorce. The time for excuses and political jockeying is gone.  Notwithstanding the fact that I must regard Deputy O'Leary as a relatively recent convert to the idea of introducing legislation on this subject, I welcome the initiative he has taken. <Col N="435" /> There is considerable merit in the formulation he has proposed.  It is a compromise on any views that I hold, in that I would prefer to go further than this proposed Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, of which I have seen a text, but it has a certain merit.  It proposes to give the people a control over the kind of divorce legislation which might be introduced.  For those Senators who have not had the benefit of seeing the text of this Bill &mdash; which has not yet been published as an Oireachtas Bill &mdash; I will refer to the relevant provision which proposes the removal of the present ban and the substitution of the following wording:</P>
    <P>No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage unless the Bill for such law has been approved by the people as though it were a proposal to amend this Constitution submitted by Referendum to the decision of the people in accordance with Sections 2 and 5 of Article 46 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>That is quite a clever formulation given the present state of public opinion.  There is a very clear majority, 70 per cent or more, of the Irish population in favour, when asked the question &ldquo;Do you believe divorce should be admitted in certain circumstances?&rdquo; There are circumstances when 70 per cent accept that people should be able to get a divorce and remarry.  That has become clear over the last half decade.  The trend shows an increasing number, who will soon be an overwhelming majority, in favour of divorce in certain circumstances.  When a different question is put, such as &ldquo;Would you be prepared to support a Bill to remove the ban on divorce? &rdquo; You get a much more even divide &mdash; 43 one way, 45 the other way and the rest do not know.</P>
    <P>There is also much less sense of public opinion consolidating in one way or the other.  Certainly in the late seventies and early eighties the number who were prepared to say yes, they would favour the removal of the constitutional ban, was growing.  In recent times there has been <Col N="436" /> a certain retrenchment in that, which shows a public anxiety and concern.  It is clearly an anxiety and concern that we have to face up to, so the proposal by Deputy O'Leary is a clever formulation. There is no doubt about that.  It is one that warrants serious consideration and public debate and I see no reason at this stage for it not being given the necessary parliamentary approval to have it published and circulated, and time given for it to be debated.  The only thing that should pre-empt that would be that we have a Government Bill which proposes to remove the constitutional ban on divorce and that would deserve to and should get priority.</P>
    <P>I have spent a considerable time looking at the proposals of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown on the issue of divorce.  I have done so because it was the major social issue which led to the establishment of the all-party committee. That is clear in so far as this was the commitment of the joint programme.  It was at that time a compromise for the Labour Party who are committed to the introduction of legislation seeking the removal of the ban on divorce.  I also wanted to reinforce what Senators Bulbulia and McGuinness emphasised in their contributions, that the committee spent a great deal of time on their work. I would use the same words, that is, that the members of the committee were privileged to have the opportunity to look as fully and as deeply as we did into that particularly difficult issue.  They have recommended the removal of the ban and recommended it in the positive context of envisaging the introduction of divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish now to turn to some of the other areas considered by the joint committee because in a sense they are of equal importance.  They concern the whole range of remedies, the procedure and the court system in relation to our marriage law.  The reason the joint committee had so much work to do was because this was such a neglected area.  It is an area where we have seen very little reform and legislative attention.  I began my contribution on the last occasion by saying that I <Col N="437" /> regretted that the joint committee did not adopt the approach of issuing a series of interim reports.  Had we done so, each of the recommendations in the substantial areas would have had a great deal more impact.  There would have been more likelihood of an early debate leading to specific reforms or at least commitment to reform in those areas.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to look now at the analysis and recommendations of the joint committee in relation to some of the other legal remedies dealt with in chapter 7 of the report.  The first remedy dealt with is nullity of marriage.  This is an area that has been the subject of considerable analysis.  There was a White Paper produced in the mid-seventies by the then Attorney General, Declan Costello, which regarded reform of the law of nullity as being of the utmost urgency.  That was a decade ago and we still have not got around to taking any action.  There was a more recent report of the Law Reform Commission, looking in great depth into the law of nullity and now we have the analysis in the joint committee's report concerning the law of nullity.</P>
    <P>The joint committee seek reform of the substantive law.  They want it clarified and codified because they noted that in the absence of updating legislation there is a worrying variation in the judicial pronouncements in the area of nullity.  To a worrying extent it may depend on the individual judge whether a person involved in what might be called a difficult or marginal case would obtain a decree of nullity.  That is not desirable from any point of view and it is not a very fair position in which to place the members of the Judiciary.  The committee call for clarification and updating of the law on nullity.</P>
    <P>They also call for something which is probably of equal importance.  They call for an immediate reform of the procedure, the way in which a person can apply for and obtain a decree of nullity. I recommend to Senators that they look at what the joint committee have said on that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> The joint committee point out at pages 37 to 39 the reasons a petition for nullity is so expensive.  First, you can apply only in the High Court.  The Report refers to the cost of bringing a defended application for nullity &mdash; in which counsel is instructed and which takes approximately one day to hear &mdash; as being in the region of £2,000 to £3,000.  How can we possibly say that this is allowing access to justice, to fair procedures in our society? How can we say it is providing a remedy for people?  It is possible that one party may have access to legal aid through the law centre.  It is even possible that both party costs might be met that way, but that would be rare.  A considerable portion of the present cost stems from the cumbersome procedure which is set out at pages 38 and 39 of the report.  It is worth referring to the fact that it takes from the letter (a) to the letter (r) to set out the steps of the procedure.  It is clearly a procedure which has been allowed to become completely ossified, completely unreformed and unmodified so that even for lawyers it is regarded as a difficult and outdated procedure.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the next remedy.  I have already touched on it in another context in my contribution this morning, the remedy of judicial separation or as it is sometimes called divorce, <i>a mensa et toro.</i> Again the law governing this remedy dates from more than 100 years ago. The Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1870 provides for the jurisdiction and the granting of a decree of judicial separation.  As the committee set out, the grounds are threefold &mdash; proof of adultery, proof of cruelty or proof of unnatural practices.  It is entirely fault based, so no matter what has happened between the parties if you cannot establish one of those three categories of possible fault then the remedy of judicial separation is not open to the parties.  That was the basis for the reform sought by the joint committee, seeking to substitute for those three fault based grounds, the one ground of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage but which of course would encompass those three grounds and others.  Apart from looking <Col N="439" /> for that substantive reform, the committee also made a number of important recommendations in relation to the jurisdiction of the court when somebody is looking for a judicial separation, that the court should have a lot of other powers or, as they are called in legal terms, ancillary powers.  For example, the court should have an ancillary power to decide who would have the right to live in the family home as and from the date of making the decree of judicial separation and how the court would approach the exercise of that power.  The committee recommend that the court would have the ancillary power to divide the various property or properties of the spouses between the spouses, so that at the point of the decree of judicial separation that matter could be dealt with, also that the rights of succession could be assessed by the court at that time and, finally, that the court would have power to make any necessary ancillary orders in relation to custody of or access to children and maintenance orders so that the one legal remedy would empower the court to deal with the actual problem.  At the moment in a situation where there are various issues, as there almost always are, for example, in relation to the family home, maintenance and any children, the parties have to bring a combination of proceedings under different marriage law Acts.  This is one of the general criticisms made by the joint committee of that procedure.</P>
    <P>The joint committee also considered in detail the provisions in relation to guardianship and custody.  Basically, the committee were of the view that the provisions in relation to guardianship and custody as they stood were working reasonably well but they did feel that in particular in relation to maintenance orders there was need from the very beginning of any proceedings seeking maintenance, whether it was maintenance on behalf of a spouse or maintenance on behalf of children of a marriage, for the court to have means of ensuring that it had full knowledge of the means and financial resources of both spouses <Col N="440" /> in order to make an assessment as to maintenance.</P>
    <P>The committee also considered the remedy of barring orders and looked at the 1981 legislation which amended the original Act which introduced the barring order, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  They looked at the manner in which the 1981 Act extended the scope by introducing a protection order as well as a barring order and made a number of technical recommendations in relation to the operation of barring orders.  A number of the matters considered by the committee reflected a general concern about the operation of barring orders but the committee do make it clear that a barring order is not a remedy for marriage breakdown, that it fulfils a specific purpose and must be available and accessible to fulfil that purpose, to protect a spouse or children where their safety or welfare demands it.</P>
    <P>I have spent a little time directing Senators towards the types of reform in the general marriage law and legal remedy for marriage that the committee considered because it would seem as though the only reasonable response on the part of the Government, when they get around to considering this report and formulating a response to it, would be to envisage perhaps a White Paper on general marriage law in Ireland in which the Government would commit themselves to a range of substantive reforms of our marriage law, taking into account the recommendations of the joint committee and, indeed, other reports such as the reports of the Law Reform Commission, where these exist.  My reason for saying that is that it is depressing to see the extraordinary time lags and bureaucratic delays in our legislative and parliamentary process.</P>
    <P>Let us take one measure for which, certainly from debates in this House, there is wide support on both sides of the House, the proposal to remove the status of illegitimacy and the relatively recent Government paper on the Status of Children Bill which included a draft Bill.  That is one measure of reform, but it is taking <Col N="441" /> a very long time.  First, it took a long time to get the proposal published and we still have not seen the text of a Bill.  I would be concerned that if one area were tackled on its own then it could take the rest of the lifetime of this Government to have one Bill &mdash; for example, reform of nullity, or perhaps some reform of matrimonial property &mdash; whereas what is needed is a broadly based approach.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for a broadly based approach being necessary is that an important element in the analysis and recommendations of the joint committee, which I have already emphasised in the case of nullity, was to look for reform of the procedure for obtaining family law remedies.  We need to have a comprehensive approach in which the procedure for obtaining family law remedies is simplified, some of the out-dated legal jargon removed, a standardising of the procedure and, also, where a person was seeking a judicial separation that the court would be empowered to make any relevant ancillary orders in relation to other matters such as, as I have already said, family home, custody or access to children and so on.</P>
    <P>Another important recommendation of the committee was in relation to family courts.  This, again, is a general recommendation since it applies to the whole area of family law remedies.  It is an extremely important recommendation of the joint committee.  What was interesting in the discussion on this issue was, first, that this reform was referred to in a very wide number of the submissions sent to us.  Right across the spectrum where there was a sharp divide on other issues &mdash; those against any change in the area of divorce, those for a change in the area of divorce &mdash; all wanted reforms of the court system for hearing and determining family law cases and disputes.  This unanimity of view from the outside about the need for reform was shared by members of the joint committee.  Although it was in one way one of the most radical proposals in the report of the joint committee it was also one of the least contentious issues.  Nobody was making a stand <Col N="442" /> for continuing the present system, neither the lawyers nor non-lawyers who were represented on the committee.  That is very significant and I had hoped to see an earlier response to this.  It is a political difficulty.  Because this report deals with the divorce issue, the Government are not prepared to address it or consider it, but that is tragic because this report deals with so much else which is urgent and does require a detailed and positive Government response.</P>
    <P>One of the areas in which it would be hoped that there would be an early and positive Government response is reform in the family court area &mdash; family court is the wrong name for it now &mdash; the reform of the present court structure. Therefore I would like to refer to the summary of the joint committee's opinion on this.  Not only was it unanimous, it was also non-contentious as an issue.  It was considered in great detail because it formed an important part of the submissions and representations made to us.  On what it called the new family structure the committee recommend as follows: I am quoting from page 122 of the report:</P>
    <P>A new body must be established with full and exclusive powers to deal with all types of family cases.  Such a body should form part of the High Court . . .</P>
    <P>This body should be referred to other than as a court, and should be known as the &ldquo;Family Tribunal&rdquo;. . .</P>
    <P>The Family Tribunal should be staffed with a sufficient number of Judges to ensure that family cases are held fully and speedily at a location which is reasonably convenient to the parties . . .</P>
    <P>Judges should be appointed solely to hear family cases and different criteria should be applied in selecting Judges for this purpose.  Broadening of the present statutory requirements to become a Judge may be necessary to allow for the appointment of suitable candidates . . .</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to limiting the appointment of a Judge to <Col N="443" /> the Family Tribunal to a fixed period of years . . .</P>
    <P>Suitable training should be provided to give both Judges and lawyers, who regularly deal with family law matters, a proper insight into the social and psychological aspects of the type of cases that occur . . .</P>
    <P>A comprehensive welfare service should be attached to the new Family Tribunal.  This welfare service should be staffed by social workers preferably with experience in dealing with marital difficulties . . . .</P>
    <P>A representative of the welfare service should be present during the hearing of all family cases . . . .</P>
    <P>Proper accommodation in which to hear family cases should be provided for the Family Tribunal.  In some cases it may be possible to use present courthouse accommodation for the purpose. Suitable community facilities may also be available locally in which the Family Tribunal can sit . . . .</P>
    <P>It will be essential that the Family Tribunal sits in as many centres of population as possible to ensure easy access to the service.  In the more densely populated areas, specialised facilities should be made available on a permanent basis providing a suitable atmosphere for the hearing of family cases . . . .</P>
    <P>One type of form should be used to initiate any type of family application . . . .</P>
    <P>The manner in which family cases are at present heard should be modified with the aim of reducing the formal adversarial nature of such proceedings. An obvious step in this direction would be the abolition of the wearing of wigs and gowns by Judges and counsel . . . .</P>
    <P>A Judge sitting in the Family Tribunal should have a general discretion to waive the normal rules of evidence if this is desirable in the interest of justice.  Also a Judge sitting in the Family Tribunal should have the power to direct that further evidence other than that produced by the parties should be heard by the Tribunal . . . .</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> Written court judgments in family cases should be made available publicly in such a manner as to ensure the anonymity of the parties . . . .</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to reduce the cost of resolving marital disputes and a shift from outside adjudication to the parties seeking a settlement through mediation and negotiation should help to achieve this goal.  This simplification of procedure in the Family Tribunal should lead to a reduction in legal costs and allow more people to represent themselves as they wish . . . .</P>
    <P>A comprehensive system of civil legal aid in respect of family matters should be introduced . . . .</P>
    <P>There should be no Stamp Duty payable on court documents and family cases and VAT should not be payable in respect of legal fees incurred in a family law matter . . . .</P>
    <P>That is very radical and comprehensive proposal for reform of the family court structure.  I believe it would be greeted with wide public support and enthusiasm, particularly from those who have any contact with the present system and the present court structure and procedures in seeking access to a family law remedy or in defending a family law application by another party.  This is not something that can be achieved overnight.  It is a complex area in which it would be necessary to give a great deal of thought and care to the form of legislation and to the other types of provisions in relation to accommodation and location of the family tribunal which would be necessary.  I underline and emphasise the sense of urgency, the need for the Government to consider this and the fact that this reinforces the desirability of having a White Paper which included the substantive reforms in marriage law and the reforms and procedure in the court structure.</P>
    <P>Another important area which the committee consider is the area of mediation and the committee spent some <Col N="445" /> time in explaining their terms and in distinguishing between conciliation and reconciliation. With regard to conciliation, the acceptance that there are problems which cannot be resolved within the context of the marriage but which can be conciliated, in order to avoid confusion between the terms reconciliation which is also dealt with in the report, and conciliation, as it is called in a number of other jurisdictions, the joint committee adopted what is the clearer term, once it is understood, of mediation.  The joint committee in their report dealt with mediation in chapter 8.  They first of all considered the purposes of mediation. We had some difficulty in the joint committee with the first assumption before you can have the proper use of the facility of mediation and that is that mediation accepts that the parties' marriage has broken down.  This was a concept that gave rise to some difficulty but it is a necessary acceptance which is the reality for an increasing number of couples in our society and where at the moment, with very few exceptions, they do not have the possibility of getting the professional help and counselling to cope with the reality of the marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The committee looks at the type of help which couples who are involved in marriage breakdown could look to under the present system and as possible to introduce.  You can either have simple bilateral negotiations between the parties but these, in so far as they exist, do not allow the parties to have objective help and they are not of great assistance in seeking to resolve issues on which there is great dispute.  You can also have supported negotiations where the parties have the assistance of outsiders whether they be legal advisers, tax advisers or other outsiders.</P>
    <P>You can have the concept of mediation.  The advantage of the mediation structure is considered by the committee at page 95 as being the preferred solution because it retains in the parties greater control over the outcome of their case.  The mediator does not <Col N="446" /> decide the matter for them.  The mediator facilities the process whereby they can seek to reach a proper decision.  The committee, having considered all this, concluded at page 97 of the report that it would be not just desirable but necessary as part of a general reform of marriage law and of the procedure and family court structure that there be established an independent mediation service and that this mediation service be used at an early stage and preferably before the question of any court proceedings has arisen.  The committee recommend that it should be staffed by specialists whose sole function would be to attempt mediation and to attempt to resolve the conflicts which had arisen between the parties by way of agreement.  The committee see a direct link between the reform of the family court structure and the best operation of this kind of mediation service, because the two would, in fact, go hand in hand.  If the parties first of all had the opportunity, through the provision of the resource, of an independent and countrywide mediation service then they would be in a position to look themselves to this service for help when the marriage had broken down and they had difficulties to resolve.</P>
    <P>The committee were also of the view that lawyers should be required first of all, to inform and, secondly, to encourage in the sense of seeking to have their clients avail of the mediation service.  The committee were not of the view that it would be helpful to have a compulsory mediation service but considered that there might be periods or opportunities when the lawyers and the court itself encouraged the parties to consider returning to mediation or referring certain parts of the potential areas of conflict between the parties to mediation.  Therefore, the joint committee deal expressly with the methods of referral in the report and with the experience in Britain of the operation of a mediation service, together with the earlier recommendations of the joint committee on the importance of having marriage counselling and supports for marriage with a view to helping to reconcile the parties where <Col N="447" /> that was possible and where a little preventive help might save the marriage relationship from getting to the stage where it had either irretrievably broken down or was extremely difficult to retrieve.</P>
    <P>These recommendations are an important parallel system to any genuine commitment to reform of the legal remedies, to reform of the procedure and to reform of the courts system.  In a sense I think it is fair to say that you cannot go very far with one without the other.  If the Government were, for example, to say &ldquo;we like what the committee say about marriage counselling and about mediation; we will do a certain amount and we will invest a certain amount of money in that area,&rdquo; it actually would not achieve any considerable improvement because of all the problems, delays and expense in the system, because of the outdated remedies, the intimidating environment of court and so on.  Similarly, if the Government were to accept the need for specific reforms and began in the manner I have described by taking one Bill and starting a long process and then perhaps a few years later if the same Government were there or the next Government, taking another Bill and starting the same process again over the next few years, that would not result in the kind of change of context in which family matters would be examined and considered with people who are going through a very difficult and lonely process of having problems whether within their marriage or as a result of the fact that their marriage is irretrievably broken down.  They would not be greatly helped by once-off specific remedies.  They would be a help to a small percentage of people in a narrow context.</P>
    <P>Another reason why it is desirable and indeed urgently needed that the Government respond broadly to the recommendations of the joint committee is that this would from the beginning affect attitudes of lawyers and judges who at present administer and give effect to the process. If the Government committed themselves to undertaking a programme of reform which would encompass reform <Col N="448" /> of the procedure in the manner I have outlined, reform of the family court by introducing a new family court structure and a commitment to broad-based reforms and legal remedies, this would signal a new approach to family law cases and family law disputes.  It would give great encouragement to those who are seeking to administer the present system as best they can by promoting some of the values I have been talking about and they would be reassured in the knowledge that at last a Government appreciated the extent of the need for reform in family law and were prepared to commit themselves to that broad measure of reform.  If we do not get a comprehensive response, then much of the impact of the report of the joint committee will be lost and a lot of the linkages, the linkage between introduction of better supports for marriage and improvement in remedies and procedure for obtaining those remedies and the court system through which parties would go looking for the remedies, will be lost.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by expressing again the points I made at the outset. The report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown of which the Leas-Chathaoirleach was a member covers one of the most important and urgent areas of reform and it should not lose out because the report also addresses one of the most sensitive political issues.  There is a real danger that for that reason it will become yet again a political football, a report that the political parties do not wish to take a position on because it has the recommendation on the divorce issue.</P>
    <P>I will be supporting the amendment to this motion because I believe that that issue has to be grasped and that the committee clearly weighed up and expressed the reasons why it has to be grasped. Equally, I urge the need for a comprehensive and early response from the Government on the other significant and important recommendations on the whole area of marriage law and preferably the kind of response which will advance the implementation of the recommendations. The best way to do that <Col N="449" /> is for the Government to commit themselves to the White Paper of reform of marriage law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not without significance that the last three contributors to this debate &mdash; and they were three excellent contributions &mdash; were people who had been members of the joint committee. When you consider the small number of Members of the Seanad who were on that joint committee you can see that the weight of interest in this matter unfortunately lies with the people who were involved in that report and that there is a substantial number of people in the House who do not think the matter is of that great importance.  Three members of the joint committee one after the other were called to express their views of on this matter but I feel that the views of the people who were not members of the joint committee are far more important at this stage.  To a greater or lesser extent the views of people who were members of the joint committee are related to the document but I think it is the response of the rest of us that is vital in considering what we should do about the many problems which are dealt with in this report.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with some of those problems I would like to reiterate what Senator Robinson has said that really we are not merely talking about the question of divorce although we must also talk about that.  We are talking about a vast number of other problems which must be tackled and which can be tackled without any political risk or without any political agitation.  There is a duty and a responsibility on the Government to ensure that these matters are dealt with immediately. That is one of the reasons I am not altogether happy with either the motion or the amendment.  I do not think they do full justice to the report.  I will be dealing with that again later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be necessary for me to say something about the quality of the report and the specific recommendations with which I am quite disappointed.  One of the problems with the committee is that it was made up of two categories of people, of lawyers and non-lawyers and the lawyers <Col N="450" /> won overwhelmingly.  They beat the remainder into the ground.  I can speak as somebody who has a foot in both camps.  It appears the lawyers took that committee by the scruff of the neck and dictated to them the tone and approach they should adopt to the various problems. I am not criticising the lawyers for that &mdash; that is what they are trained to do &mdash; it is a criticism of the other people really rather than of the lawyers.  It is really a criticism of the Fianna Fáil Party, for this reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>They had no lawyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, that is precisely the reason it is a criticism of them. This was an unbalanced committee for one reason.  The lawyers who were on the committee, according to my research, were Deputy Alan Shatter, Senator Mary Robinson, Senior Counsel, and Senator Catherine McGuinness, B.L. Deputy Shatter is a solicitor who specialises in family law matters.  It is not unworthy or improper of me to say that those three people are, to a greater or lesser extent, committed to the prospect of the introduction of divorce in this country.  There is nothing wrong with that, they are entitled to their opinion.  It is an opinion which in certain circumstances I may share myself; in other circumstances, I may not.  But there was nobody to present the other point of view from a legal point of view and that was a tremendous lack in the committee.  It is shown throughout the report that certain attitudes are taken and approaches are assumed as if the legal problems being created by the suggestions that are made are not being confronted by somebody with a different point of view.  There was a responsibility on all the political parties, Fianna Fáil among them, to make sure that the joint committee was more balanced in that respect.  It is a great pity it did not happen and the report suffers accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can approach this from a human point of view.  If one read the contribution of Senator Bulbulia and contrasts it with <Col N="451" /> the approach of Senator Robinson, one can see the different approaches of a person who is a lawyer and another who is not a lawyer.  They both have their contributions to make, I am not saying one is better than the other.  But one can view this in the area of pure logic or from the heart.  This report fails totally to take into account anything to do with the report heart.  In that regard I consider the report a significantly deficient document.</P>
    <P>The report is written against the background of a support for the concepts which the lawyers on the committee, to which I have referred, represent and which they support.  There was a failure to match that by all parties, particularly by Fianna Fáil, and the decision by them not to put a lawyer on the committee was a grave mistake because it allowed the tone of the committee to be established by those who were lawyers.  I propose to go through the report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not very logical. Senator O'Leary wants more lawyers but he is criticising the lawyers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not criticising the lawyers.  Obviously Senator Robinson was not listening to what I said.  What I said was that I wanted a balance of lawyers. If there were lawyers on one side of the argument, it was important that there would be lawyers on the other side of the argument.  Irrespective of the number of lawyers on the committee, it was also important that they would be balanced by people who had a different analysis of the problem than merely a pure legal analysis of the problem.  In my opinion that differential analysis would have been aided had there been lawyers of two different persuasions on the committee.  To me it is a perfectly clear position.  One may not agree with it but it is a perfectly clear position.  The fact that there was nobody to confornt the lawyers, that they were all singing the same tune, destroyed the effectiveness of the long legal members of the committee in putting forward a different analysis and a different solution to the various problems involved.  I <Col N="452" /> propose to go through the report and give my views on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to say that my views are a product of my background and of my analysis of the situation.  In this matter we can only say we represent out-selves because there are so many different view points and nuances with regard to the various problems of marriage and family matters.  It is very hard to say we represent a significant section of the population in everything we hold in these matters.</P>
      <P>I should like, first, to refer to the discussion in chapter 3 of the report in so far as it relates to the age of marriage. This matter has been considered by this House in the recent past as a result of legislation reducing the age of majority from 21 to 18 with the consequential reduction in the age of marriage allowed for in that Bill.  The committee in paragraph 3.4.7 came to a conclusion with which I agree.  They say:</P>
      <P>The Committee is of the opinion that the minimum age for marriage should be 18 years and that any marriage contracted by a person under 18 years should be null and void.</P>
      <P>That is a very sensible and wise opinion of the committee.  They continue:</P>
      <P>Marriages of persons between 16 and 18 years may however, be permitted if persons obtain the prior consent of guardian(s) and the prior consent of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the case for that has been made at all.  I believe there should be an absolute prohibition on people marrying under 18 years of age.  I am not presuaded that the court has any useful function to play in this at all.  I am not persuaded that the court is in a position to be able to judge whether or not people should get married between the ages of 16 and 18 years of age.  To a large extent it is hard to imagine a set of circumstances which would be so exceptional as to allow the court to come to the conclusion that it <Col N="453" /> should permit people between 16 and 18 years of age to marry.  One of the worst reasons, of course, would be the pregnancy of the girl, as it would be a very bad basis indeed on which to commence married life.  The courts by and large adopt that approach.  Other than allowing for suggestions that certain people, including travelling people, marry at a younger age &mdash; which does not appear to be borne out by the facts &mdash; it is very hard to envisage circumstances in which people should marry between 16 and 18 years of age.  I would be in favour of an absolute prohibition.  While I agree with the opinion being expressed by the committee with regard to 18 years, they have gone too far in suggesting that anybody should be allowed marry between 16 and 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>I will come back and deal with the question of divorce afterwards because it is a thorny problem on which I have not made up my mind.  I should like to deal with chapter 4 of the report which deals with the question of marriage breakdown, in particular, paragraph 4.1.3 which says:</P>
    <P>. . . but in an increasing number of cases these pressures can lead to friction and conflict which cannot be resolved and which can lead to the breakdown of marriage.</P>
    <P>This deals with my fundamental criticism of the report in that it has failed to do the most important thing which was required of it to assess the size of the problem. They have failed totally to address the problem of the number of people whose marriages have broken down and the number of such people who wish to remarry.  The committee say that the information was not available, but if that is so it was their duty to get it.  There are adequate statistical systems available whereby accurate information could be made available in regard to the number of people whose marriages have broken down and the number of such people who wish to have the facility for remarriage. If a public opinion poll can show with some accuracy that 3 per cent or 4 per <Col N="454" /> cent of the population are going to vote next time for The Workers Party, then they can certainly measure the number of people whose marriages have broken down.  What cannot be measured of course is the number of people whose marriages have not yet broken down, but that is a different problem.  At least let us get the basis right, because there is a bewildering variety of statistics &mdash; I will come to them in the appendices &mdash; which, in so far as they deal with the problem at all, would seem to suggest that there is a very small problem.  It is not an analysis I agree with, but I find myself faced with using the statistics which are used in this book and they would lead me to the conclusion that there was a relatively small problem in this area.  I do not believe that, but it was the duty of the committee to take whatever time was necessary to adequately establish the size of the problem and they have failed totally to do that.  I believe the report of the committee, excellent as it in many areas, is seriously deficient in that regard.</P>
    <P>In chapter 4 there is one very significant piece of logic which shows the attitude of the dominant group on the committee which, in my opinion is very false.  It is very important because it shows their approach to the whole question of social legislation.  In paragraph 4.32 there is the most astounding statement I have ever seen in a public report.  It says &ldquo;The development of birth regulation is increasingly playing a large and important part in the fabric of family life.&rdquo;  I do not think anyone could criticise that.  &ldquo;It can be argued that the time is now approaching when children will only be conceived when their parents want them and are, as a result, able to give them the unconditional care and love which is a necessary prerequisite for the development of their health, both physical and psychological&rdquo;.  In other words, as if the decision of parents to have children, taken as it often is in the heat of the moment or taken in a family situation which changes dramatically with the arrival of the child, can sustain itself over the following 15, 16 or 17 years, and will always mean that that decision will <Col N="455" /> guarantee the unconditional care and love which are a necessary prerequisite for the development of the child's health, both physical and psychological.  It is a fallacy to think that the availability of contraceptives, which I support, will of themselves give rise to a situation where children who are born are necessarily more wanted than in any other situation. It may happen in individual cases, but in general, peoples decisions with regard to the conception of children are taken for a variety of reasons, very often nothing to do with the children themselves, very often to do with the question of cementing relationships between two individuals, or sometimes because a woman wants a Cabinet Minister to marry her. There are all sorts of reasons why people decide to have children.  To say that the mere availability of contraceptives will ensure that children will for the complete years of their minority, be wanted by their parents is an analysis of society which is seriously deficient and shows a shallowness of approach by the majority ethos of this committee which is surprising and disappointing.</P>

      <P>All I can say is that it is a most astounding, uncontradicted statement. If the committee said they did not agree with it, that is fair enough; but it is said as being the opinion of the committee.</P>
      <P>There is a very interesting aside in the paragraph where they talk about large scale unemployment putting a strain on marriages.  When the breadwinner, be it a man or a woman is unemployed, the unemployment for that family is 100 per cent.  The existence or non-existence of other large scale unemployment is largely irrelevant because their marriage is strained as a result of their particular situation, not as a result of the general unemployment level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to chapter VI, which deals with statistics.  This is by far <Col N="456" /> the weakest portion of the report.  It correctly says that commonsense would let us know that there are people whose marriages have not broken down but who might wish under different circumstances to live apart: It says in 6.4:</P>
    <P>The numbers of marriages which may, to all intents and purposes, have broken down, but where the spouses continue to reside together, exacerbates the difficulty.</P>
    <P>The committee should have said that that problem is not unique to Ireland; it exists in all jurisdictions, even jurisdictions with divorce.  There are many reasons why marriages &mdash; for example, in the United Kingdom &mdash; have broken down &ldquo;but the spouses continue to reside . . .&rdquo; It is the increased incidence of that in this country that would be relevant, not the absolute figure.</P>
    <P>Appendix C deals with the actual statistics. It is a most unworthy document.  I refer the House to tables A2, A3, A4 and A5 which are part of Appendix C and which analyse the number of people who returned marital status of &ldquo;other status&rdquo;. The survey gives the number of people aged 15 and over in total, and then the number of males and females.  It is extraordinary that the number of females is significantly different to that of males and I do not understand why this should be so in such a wide range of categories. Table A3 then re-analyses those figures on a percentage basis and divides them between various provinces, county boroughs and counties.</P>
    <P>There appears to be absolutely no purpose whatsoever in re-analysing the same figures over and over again. It appears to be just filling up paper because we are getting no additional information.  As I understand, the only information we are getting basically is that there are 14, 117 people in the &ldquo;Other Status&rdquo; category and as such consider themselves separated or something like that and, they are divided in the ratio of 5,116 males to 9,001 females.  The re-analysis of it is only seeking to import into that a validity by sheer volume of numbers which is not <Col N="457" /> justified by the basic figures that are available. I do not see any purpose in it.  One could say that there is some purpose in showing that the problem exists throughout the country but the kind of analysis that it shows is repetitive and merely covering up the fact that proper statistics are not available as to the number of people who are separated.  This would have been available to an accurate extent if the committee had interpreted their responsibility in this regard in a different way and had decided to look for fresh information on which they could base their decision.  Later on it will be seen why I consider that information to be absolutely vital before I could make a decision on the question of my support, or otherwise, for the concept of divorce here.</P>
    <P>There is also a labour force survey figure dealt with.  It is part of the same analysis and extracts from the first results of the 1983 labour force survey.  The previous figures were from the 1981 Census of Population.  The figures go much further than the others in table C and seem to confirm the figures which were in the Census even though they are slightly different in that they identify the number of people who are deserted, whose marriages are annulled and legally separated, who are separated and divorced &mdash; 8,300 in the case of males and 12,800 in the case of females making a total of 21,100. That appears to be the highest figure which the report identifies and is a hard figure on which we can operate.</P>
    <P>Beyond that the Report states:</P>
    <P>There is some further analysis of the Survey data which suggests, indirectly, that the total for &ldquo;separated&rdquo; may be somewhat higher than estimated above.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to dispute the accuracy of that statement but if it is to be taken seriously it should be supported by some hard facts.  There are no hard facts.  The Report merely says, &ldquo;there is some further analysis which suggests . . .&rdquo; If that analysis would seem to suggest it I think we should be given the benefit of that <Col N="458" /> analysis rather than merely saying that it does exist.  It is an oversimplistic approach to the problem to deal with it in that cavalier fashion.</P>
    <P>For that reason I have a major problem with this report in so far as it relates to divorce &mdash; it does not affect the question with regard to the other maintenance problems, the nullity or the property problems.</P>
    <P>The extent of the problem is vital in deciding what priority we should give it and what attitude we should adopt to it. Page 114, which has already been referred to by Senator Robinson, summarises chapter 7 and, rather than go through it, I must say that the recommendations of the committee in the report, their opinions in regard to nullity as stated in pages 114 and 115 &mdash; there are 13 in all &mdash; by and large have my support and should be implemented.  I support what Senator Robinson said in regard to that matter.</P>
    <P>I do not understand, although there may be a good technical reason for it, why the Act to prevent the marriage of lunatics should be repealed.  In principle, I would be in favour of preventing lunatics being married on the basis that they are subject to pressures and influences which may not be helpful.  It may be proper for the law to do that but I remain to be persuaded on it.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 6 states:</P>
    <P>That a separate part of the church ceremony of marriage should be set aside, in which the civil aspect of marriage is clearly set out.</P>
    <P>The signing of the register, and the making of the register a more open civil document, is the crucial way in which this can be done without offending anybody. In addition to going through the marriage ceremony in the church of their choice, or not going through the marriage ceremony in any church if they want to, the actual signing of the register be it in the church or in the registry office should be brought to their attention as being the civil portion of the act.  It should be the central portion <Col N="459" /> from the point of view of determining the validity of the marriage in civil law.  I am not disagreeing with what the committee said.  I am merely expanding on it and making a suggestion as to how it could be put into practical effect.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the committee's opinions on the question of nullity are good and they certainly have my support. The problem of judicial separation which is also dealt with in the report is a ticklish one.  The irretrievable breakdown concept which the committee suggests is one which, if the truth was told, is a preparation by the committee for the basis to be used in establishing the right to divorce.  There is no point in ducking that, that irretrievable breakdown in that concept if it is used in the question of judicial separation will automatically become the one criterion which would be appropriate in any future divorce legislation. I do not disagree with that.  The concept of irretrievable breakdown is wide enough and can be judicially interpreted as being wide enough to have a useful role to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>One could argue whether or not, for example, a single act of adultery by one or other of the spouse should itself form sufficient ground for judicial separation without any time bar but these are relatively minor matters.  I agree with the idea that irretrievable breakdown of marriage should form the ground for examination of the justification of judicial separation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to paragraph 7.4.18 of the report.  There is not much point in writing into legislation that desertion or adultery should be a discretionary bar to maintenance for the applicant spouse and then saying unless the conduct of the defendant is or was such as to make it inappropriate and unfair that he or she should be entitled to rely on the applicant's desertion or adultery.  That appears to be saying that as long as the two people commit adultery one cannot use it as a bar to maintenance but if only one person commits adultery one should.  Is that not going against the whole basis of having the matter removed from a fault based mechanism, the fault based mechanism <Col N="460" /> being taken out of the system?  I should like to have that matter looked at further. The needs of the parties, and such matters as their capacity to earn elsewhere, expressed in general, should be the deciding factor with regard to maintenance rather than the question of whether or not they have committed any one of a number of civil or moral crimes.  The need of the spouse should be the deciding factor with regard to the question of maintenance rather than their behaviour. I would also refer to paragraph 7.4.13 in that regard.  Here, and on the question of the family court and the provision of civil aid in the event of marriage breakdown, the committee seem to adopt opinions which will cost a lot of money. Of no section of the report could that be said more than of 7.4.13 where it says:</P>
    <P>In particular, the Committee is of the opinion that the State should be empowered to make payments of maintenance to victims of such default and to recoup moneys owed by defaulters, with an appropriate system of sanction in the case of continued default.</P>
    <P>Of course there is a responsibility on the State to ensure that a person gets a minimum amount of maintenance in any case. But if the State is to make payments to the full sum which has been awarded by courts in the hope that it will later recoup moneys, I venture to suggest knowing the inactivity of the State in recouping moneys in that kind of area, that the State would find itself paying a very substantial number of maintenance payments which it would never recoup because of the administrative difficulty to which a number of such payments would give rise, and the difficulty of enforcement.  I have no objection to the State providing a back-up service, and an income support service for anybody who is in need, but to suggest that the State should, to the full extent, guarantee maintenance payments is quite excessive and it would be administratively unworkable.</P>
    <P>With regard to paragraph 7.4.19:</P>
    <P>The factors to be taken into account by the court in deciding whether to <Col N="461" /> make a Maintenance Order and in deciding the amount of any such Order should be extended to include the following:</P>
    <P>(ii) The making by that Court of an Order granting the sole right to reside in the family home . . . .</P>
    <P>I would like to see something added to that which would specifically identify that the ability of the applicant to earn his or her own living would be a factor specifically to be taken into account as it is necessary in order to, on the one hand, protect the applicant in the position where he or she would not be able to earn his or her living but on the other hand, over a period of time, particularly when children grow up, to put some responsibility on the applicant, whether it is a man or a women, to make some contribution towards his or her own living rather than to leave the matter where a person who has gone through the process of a judicial separation, or divorce, at a later stage, is automatically entitled to assume that he or she would be entitled to maintenance for the rest of his or her natural life without making any contribution towards his or her own welfare.  That could be a useful addition, although there are provisions under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act which can be used for that purpose.  I would like to have it specifically put into the recommendation so that it would be a consideration which would have to be taken into account.  There are cases, of courses, where it would not be proper to take it into account.</P>
    <P>I also refer to 7.5.13 which deals with the question of custody orders and guardianship. The committee have quite rightly emphasised that:</P>
    <P>The Committee recognises that it is essential that a court when making a Custody Order should ensure that both parents understand that they remain joint guardians of their children with all that that implies.</P>
    <P>The committee quite rightly distinguish between the question of custody and the <Col N="462" /> question of guardianship.  Very often, in practical terms, the person with custody is the sole guardian of the child except where repeated applications may be made to court.  It is important that guardianship as a function should be recognised by the law.  I strongly support the committee's suggestion along those lines.</P>
    <P>The question of matrimonial property is dealt with from paragraph 7.6.1 to paragraph 7.6.12.  It is also dealt with in page 119 by way of the summary of the recommendations of the committee's report.  This is probably an area of great difficulty.  I suppose all of our worst instincts come out with the question of maintaining a right to a separate property existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he is an excellent man.  It is easy to get emotional about the question of matrimonial property but there are a number of things which should be said about it.  Women fought for many years to have the right to separate property on the occasion of their marriage. That was a major legal crusade of women throughout the 17th century and 18th centuries.  It is not something which should be changed too easily.  There should be a recognition of the right of both husbands and wives to retain separate property.  The simple fact of marriage should not automatically transfer into common ownership all the property and assets of the individuals involved.  I am not suggesting that the committee are recommending that but it should be borne in mind.  In dividing matrimonial property some system of distinguishing between various categories of property must be agreed and accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain changes are recommended. <Col N="463" /> Section 5 of the Family Home Protection Act, 1976 should be interpreted in such a manner that the spouse will presume to intend the natural consequences of his or her action.  That is dealt with in paragraph 7.6.24.  It is proper to ensure, for example, that where people put their houses into joint names, they mean to put their houses into joint names and that where they transfer a property from one spouse to the other they mean to transfer the property and it is not just a question of doing it for some temporary financial or taxation benefit and that one holds it for the other by way of some trust or other. That is important and it should be clarified.</P>
    <P>The amount of effort expended by a wife in duties in the home &mdash; or indeed by a husband, if appropriate &mdash; should be taken into account in calculating their percentage of ownership of a family home.  There is no good logical reason why a woman who stays at home &mdash; it is normally the woman &mdash; and provides for a family and does very useful work in the home should not be recognised and valued as contributing towards the family home.  Our legislation in that way is defective.  The five recommendations on page 119 in this regard should be agreed.</P>
    <P>The question of community property should be examined but it is not automatically attractive.  A study into the question should be commenced because the various problems that would arise would be identified as the result of such study.</P>
    <P>Page 119 contains a summary with regard to barring orders.  The committee have correctly identified that the sole role of a barring order should be to afford protection.  It should not be seen as a principal legal process in a case of irretrievable breakdown.  A problem with regard to barring orders which has now been sorted out is that the barring order system was being abused.  Barring orders could be obtained very easily and were being used as a method of furthering one point of view in a family dispute rather than merely as a protection mechanism in respect of the health, wealth, safety and welfare of the spouse.  The definition of welfare there is extremely important. <Col N="464" /> The situation has changed since the committee were established and during their deliberations they noted the Supreme Court's decision on the question.</P>
    <P>Having examined the various suggestions of the committee and leaving aside for the moment the question of the family court structure, we are faced with the problem of divorce and what we should do about it.  First, we must establish whether we consider divorce to be a civil right.  The basis on which we would consider that people are &ldquo;entitled&rdquo; or &ldquo;not entitled&rdquo; to the introduction of divorce as a basic human right is important.  In this area the analysis of the committee with regard to the pros and cons of divorce has been superficial, to say the least. I do not believe that divorce is an absolute right, but that should not surprise anybody because there are very few absolute rights.  We have not an absolute right to life.  You have the right to take another person's life if that person threatens your life and in certain other circumstances. Therefore, the right to life itself is not absolute.  There are very few absolute rights.  Even the right to worship God, except in your head, is not absolute because procedures and sacrifices, for example, which certain religions attempt to make would correctly not be permitted in this country.  Therefore, even the right to worship God in your own way is not absolute.  The right to do it inside your head is another matter, and I suppose that is what distinguishes us from animals in that regard.  We have not many absolute rights, and I do not believe that divorce is an absolute right.  Therefore, if it is not an absolute right it is a qualified right, and it is qualified by the common good.  It is not qualified by whether the Church of Ireland want divorce or whether the Roman Catholic Church want divorce.  The appeals of the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland in this regard are merely evidence of the existing social behaviour of their members &mdash; or the behaviour at least to which they aspire &mdash; rather than evidence of the existence or non-existence of a need for divorce.  The criterion which has been identified correctly by quite a <Col N="465" /> number of Roman Catholic clergymen as the common good is one with which I can identify.  The problem is that their definition of the common good very often appears to be restricted to what is consistent with the teaching of their own Church.  That is not my criterion of the common good.  I would have to be satisfied that the common good in a much broader sense than just the common good of members of a particular religion would be satisfied before determining whether in particular circumstances I would favour divorce.</P>
    <P>I took the opportunity in 1977 to write a political pamphlet which I have referred to previously.  It was called <i>One Man's View.</i> In it I set out my position on divorce which is basically the same as I hold now, that in so far as it is consistent with the common good you should allow people the maximum freedom to organise their life but always subject to the common good.  We must establish what the common good is.  One way in which we establish the common good is to determine the size of the problem.  That is why I criticised the report so seriously and so fundamentally.  For example, if only one person in the country wanted divorce and if there was any evidence that the existence of divorce would destablilise other marriages, obviously the common good would determine that you should not have divorce.  Similarly, if 50 per cent of marriages were in difficulty and were breaking down and 50 per cent or 40 per cent of the people wanted the right to remarry, obviously in those circumstances the social consequences of not conceding that position would be so horrific that you would have to come to the conclusion, irrespective of your personal moral or religious position, that the common good would dictate the acceptance of divorce as being for the common good.</P>
    <P>One thing to be taken into consideration is the liberty of the individual.  That goes into the equation.  The other thing that goes into the equation is the number of people, the effect on the common good, and that is where I take serious issue with the committee.  While they had <Col N="466" /> given considerable weight to the liberty of the individual they have not given us sufficient information to enable us to make a rational decision on the basis of the frequency with which it is demanded in society.  For that reason I consider the report to be seriously defective.</P>
    <P>To say that because a religious persuasion want divorce and because one individual wants it you must have it is emphasising too strongly the individual as against the State.  It is an extreme right wing position.  Indeed many of the extreme right wing elements in the United States are now coming to the point of view that many of these libertarian positions which they find themselves taking they take because they want to allow the maximum freedom to the individual at all costs.  That is not a sensible analysis of society.  The socialist concept of the common good has an important part to play here and it is one of the factors which must be taken into account.  That is where the committee have failed in their task of identifying the size of the problem and enabling people like me who have an open mind on the matter to make a decision on it.  Obviously if the matter goes to a referendum I will have to make my decision on the basis of the available information or of what other information is made available between in the meantime and then.  The report is seriously defective in that regard.</P>
    <P>We come now to the question of the amendment and when the referendum, if there is to be a referendum, should be held.  First, I am in favour of a referendum and I do not really mind when it is held.</P>

      <P>We now come to the question of when the referendum should be held, if there is to be a referendum. There is good evidence that there is a need for a referendum.  The will of the people should be ascertained in this regard and it should be ascertained in the foreseeable future.  Whether it should be done before the next election is dependent on a number of factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="468" /> There are serious differences within all political parties, including the Labour Party, on the question of divorce.  There may be no difference within the Labour Party on the question of the time of the referendum but there are serious differences within that party on the question of divorce.</P>
    <P>Based on my experience with the Fine Gael Party a proposal to hold a referendum which was opposed by Fianna Fáil and the Catholic Church would not pass through the present Dáil.  It would fail to get the full support of the Labour members and also of the Fine Gael members just as the proposal to amend the law in relation to contraceptives, which was a very minor matter, failed to get the support of both of those categories.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what is the point in subjecting the country to another quite unnecessary debate when the responsibility as to whether we are to have a referendum should be placed where it belongs, that is, with the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is my belief that the position of the Labour Party with regard to holding a referendum is clear as also is the position of Fine Gael Party on this matter. That is that a referendum should be held. However, I do not believe that any referendum on the matter should be held until such time as there is all-party support for it.  It could be said that that is giving a power of veto to Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is a power of veto which they will be very reluctant to use because if Labour and Fine Gael declare themselves happy to have a referendum at the first available opportunity and if Fianna Fáil are the only party preventing that referendum from being held, the political pressure with regard to the holding or otherwise of the referendum will descend in total on Fianna Fáil.  They will then find themselves in an uncomfortable political position with regard to this matter.  That is a very worthy objective. In that regard I favour the adoption by the Government of a position that they <Col N="469" /> will hold a referendum at the first available opportunity and when there is all-party agreement on the need to hold a referendum.</P>
      <P>Nobody is asking that everybody within Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour would automatically guarantee that they would vote in favour of a referendum or in favour of the introduction of divorce. That is not the point of issue.  The only point of issue is the question of the holding of a referendum.</P>
      <P>There is a particular dimension to this which we ignore at our peril.  It is perhpas a little childish to pretend that there is not a party political dimension to it.  So far as I am concerned there is a party political dimension to it and that dimension must be recognised.</P>

      <P>I could not agree more. It is tragic that it is that way.  These matters should not be party political matters at all.  They should be subject to free vote.  The reality of it is that that is not the position.  The reality of putting the pressure on Fianna Fáil is that we might bring about a situation where the future of these social matters would be the subject of free votes.  We will never make progress on social matters in this country unless there are free votes in matters which are not fundamental to the continued operation of Government.  That applies much wider then divorce, much wider than contraception.  I have repeated that over and over again during the debate on the Criminal Justice Act. Our party system is much too strong.  Our party whip system is much too strong.  It is not necessary in these matters that there should be party whips.  It is singularly inappropriate in a matter where personal judgment is everything, as in the question of the availability or the non-availability of divorce.  It is inappropriate that there should be the slightest hint of a party position on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any political party the size of Fianna Fáil there must be people who support <Col N="470" /> the concept of divorce.  In a party the size of Fine Gael there must be people with both points of view also.  Why should these people be whipped into a position with which they do not agree, where there is no reason that the non-existence or the existence of divorce is fundamental to the operation of Government?  For that reason I believe we should have a referendum on divorce when everybody recognises the reality of the situation.  All we would be doing is asking the people what their opinion is.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I am long enough on the fringes of political activity to recognise that as long as the major political party oppose a piece of social legislation the debate has an inevitable party political taint.  It is in an attempt to depoliticise this issue that I believe we should firmly say that we are not going to hold the referendum until there is an all-party approach, or at least a free vote approach on the question of the holding of a referendum, irrespective of what position political parties might take with regard to the actual decision being taken by the people.</P>
    <P>If there were a referendum in the morning I hope that the debate would be sufficiently enlightening and that the information would be sufficiently up to date to enable me to come to a rational decision on what is the common good in this matter.  If I could be sure that the number of people about whom we were speaking are only the number of people which are referred to in appendix C of the report of the joint committee, then I would certainly have grave doubts about supporting any voting in favour of the change in the Constitution in that regard. I cannot be sure of that because the work has been inadequately done.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I would like to say one thing that I forgot to say at the time.  One of the fundamental things which nobody asked the 21,000 people who were deserted or living separately from their spouses is how many of them want to remarry.  That is really the fundamental question.  We are not talking about the better facilities with regard to judicial separation and annullity.  That can all be <Col N="471" /> done within the framework of the present Constitution.  How many of these 21,000 people want to remarry?  Do any of them want to remarry?  Common sense would think that they do.  I do not know how many.  Do half of them want to remarry, or three-quarters of them?  This is a very basic piece of information because when we are talking about the introduction of divorce in this country we are really talking about remarriage.  We have divorce in every sense, if badly organised, except in the remarriage sense.  Surely it is fundamental to ask these people how many of them want to remarry, or how many want the possibility of remarriage.  I certainly would not limit the question to whether they intend remarrying in the near future, but whether they would like the possibility. We might find that a substantial majority of them would say that they had such a bad experience that they would not under any circumstances in the future remarry.  That would give rise to a different set of circumstances.  That is why this report is quite inadequate in that regard. It is a disappointing document because it fails to tackle these problems.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I would like to refer to the proposal with regard to the family court structure.  There are suggestions which obviously would make some difference &mdash; for example, the question of whether one should wear wigs and gowns in family law cases.  Whether one should wear wigs and gowns at all is another question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>A piece of our history which really is not fundamental to the future health and prosperity of either the lawyers involved or their clients.  If that is the only difference between the family court and the ordinary court, it would be very small, indeed.  There is one problem with which we are faced and that is that we are a constitutional republic and we cannot easily set up different kinds of court structure as they can, for example, in the United Kingdom.  If the United Kingdom want to set up a court and call it a family court they can do it and they <Col N="472" /> can give it whatever power it wants. Here, because we are limited by the Constitution to a certain type of court structure, I notice that one of the first recommendations &mdash; contained in paragraph 94 but summarised in the summary on page 122 &mdash; is that such a court should form part of the High Court.  You can dress it up any way you like, but because our court structure is laid down by the Constitution it must fit into that framework. That, in my opinion, limits, for example, the informality which can be associated with such a court structure.</P>
      <P>There is a possibility of having a family court structure at a lower level than the High Court and allowing for appeal to the High Court.  That is something to which some consideration should be given.  There are tricky legal problems involved in that, too.  The whole question of whether judges should be appointed over a fixed number of years is well worth considering.  There is no doubt about it that at the present time a lot of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court is in Circuit Court judges who do not want the job, who do not feel that they are suitable for the job and who treat it as an onerous addition to an overcrowded schedule which has recently been foisted on them. As a result they do not give it a priority which would ensure that it was dealt with before other matters.  It normally just takes its place on the list and that, of course, is a serious limitation.  There are considerations like that which would render the present system as being unsuitable for any reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that I do not share the view of the committee &mdash; and I think it was the view of the lawyers on the committee as well as everybody else &mdash; that there is anything particularly wrong with an adversarial system in so far as it relates to a family court.  There is nothing more adversarial than a husband and wife who have family difficulties.  Irrespective of the number of mediation and conciliation services which you provide, the cases that will ultimately come to court will come to court on the basis of there being two sides of the argument.  It is not necessary <Col N="473" /> that the lawyers in presenting their client's case should present it in such a way as to denigrate or diminish the respect which the court will hold for the other side.  They do have to present their own case the best way they can and that does mean that they have to represent the other point of view as being incorrect.  I do not really think that the new family court structure proposed will overcome that problem.  I do not think that it is necessarily a bad thing that it will not overcome it, but if people think that there will not be any adversarial atmosphere within that portion of the High Court which will be the family court structure, I think they are wrong.  I think it will develop over a short period of time that the advisers of the litigants will, for example, seek to take advantage in the interests of their client of every legal quirk that they can find in every interpretation of the law.  That is the reality of life.  They cannot be stopped arguing those matters before the High Court.  It is just not possible. Unless you actually remove the original jurisdiction from the High Court totally, to allow appeal to the High Court &mdash; which would have to be allowed in any case &mdash; the informality which could be introduced into the system while retaining it as part of the High Court is limited and retaining the new family court structure as part of the High Court will not solve the problems which I think have been correctly identified by the committee in that regard.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think that all the members of the committee &mdash; the lawyers and the non-lawyers &mdash; are to be congratulated on making a tremendous effort to clear our minds of many of the misconceptions which we have about family matters.  If I am dissatisfied with their report in so far as it relates to the information which I consider to be necessary to make a logical decision on the question of divorce, that is one aspect only of their report.  There is so much else in their report with which I agree that I would not like that aspect of my contribution to grow to an importance which it does not deserve.  If I did not mention other individual recommendations <Col N="474" /> made by the committee, it is not because I do not agree with them; it is because I agree with them.  I have carefully gone through the report and examined it and in so far as I found myself in substantial disagreement with the committee at all, I brought it to the attention of the House here today.  So the remainder of the report has my support, always subject to the fact that I might have overlooked something.  By and large, it does have my support.  The members of the committee are to be congratulated in so far as they have produced a document which is a valuable addition to the process which Senator Robinson correctly identified should proceed without reference to the question of divorce or otherwise &mdash; the process of reforming the law in so far as it relates to marriage and the family because our structures have been mummified. They have been prevented from developing by the fear of misinterpretation which any change in the law in this area had prior to this.  If the report has done one thing it has separated the various elements of the problem, enabled us to examine the problems which have no relevance to the dissolution of marriage, divorce and remarriage.  It has separated those from the other matters which need to be urgently tackled without reference to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by regretting that there are not more speakers on this motion from the Fianna Fáil side of the House.  A valuable point made by the previous speaker is that, as the party that has received the greatest support from the Irish people, more votes than any other party, one might reasonably expect that they would discharge that responsibility properly.  I cannot, for example, consider that no Fianna Fáil Deputy or Senator has ever experienced the situation in which nobody has come to speak about marital difficulties or the case for changing the legal situation whereby there can be some civil remedy for marital breakdown.  It is not good enough to simply sit silent, wait for the other parties to debate this issue and not offer an opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> I might make one point absolutely and unequivocally clear.  The Labour group of Senators in this House &mdash; and this motion is before Seanad Éireann &mdash; will be voting unanimously in support of the amendment.  We favour a referendum in the lifetime of this Government.  In so far as reference has been made to it I should also like to clarify the position as regards the Labour Party and divorce.  The Labour Party have, at one conference after another, supported a change in the law which would allow the possibility of divorce as an option and the preliminary step of the holding of a referendum to remove the constitutional impediment and ban on divorce.  May I go further and say that when I look back across the political debate on this issue, since 1923 when W.B. Yeats spoke in this House, I look at the proceedings of the Labour Party.  The Labour Party have a very fine record of concern for the situation that had arisen particularly after the 1937 Constitution.  At one conference after another they have debated the issue and always come out in favour of an amendment in this area.  The only difference about the last annual conference of the Labour Party was that no opposition was expressed at that conference to removing the constitutional impediment on divorce. That is not to say that there are not members of our party who hold reservations about the holding of a referendum. But the position of the party is that we favour a referendum in the lifetime of this Government.  I would like to make that point very clear.  What I sometimes find rather strange is that a party like ourselves, which now enjoy less than 10 per cent of the support of the electorate, can be used as the principle for a party that enjoy a great deal more support of our people avoiding what I believe to be their duty.</P>
    <P>A fundamental issue arises in the discussion of this report.  I should like to welcome it and pay tribute as other Senators have done, to the thoroughness of the report.  It would be very wrong to think that this report should perform the task that should be accomplished when <Col N="476" /> we are discussing the precise forms of divorce legislation.  It was a committee to address itself, in a very preliminary way, to the whole question of marital breakdown. I am moved by the very thorough speeches being made by the women Members of the Seanad who have spoken so far.  I hope that when people comment on this debate they will acknowledge the contribution to civil rights that has been made by the people who served on the committee and particularly the women Members who have spoken.</P>
    <P>I am worried about one fundamental in approaching the discussion on this report so far.  It is in relation to the question of whether divorce and the right to remarry is a human right or is not.  The Knights of Columbanus, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 28 September, 1984, have a very clear position.  The Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbanus, Mr. Vincent Gallagher, is quoted as saying that divorce is not a human right.  As I understand it, the Fianna Fáil view is that the right to remarry is something less than a human right; it is, in fact, a bargaining position.  As I look back on statements from the Fianna Fáil Party I begin to think there is a hint-hint, nudge-nudge that it might surface as something which you could have in your hand to bargain with members of the Northern Ireland population should you be discussing unity.  This view is a dangerous one.  Unfortunately it is reflected in the contributions of some distinguished people, such as Professor Mary McAleese, who is reported in the Law Society <i>Gazette</i> of June 1979, in the text of a paper read by her to the society's annual conference in Galway from 3 to 6 May, 1979, pages 95 to 98.  She indulges in the unusual practice for a lawyer &mdash; from whom I would have expected the exactitude of the basic discipline of law, that is administrative law &mdash; by on the one hand arguing very strongly against divorce on the basis of what she calls &ldquo;its impact on the social fabric.&rdquo;  By training I am a sociologist but rarely if ever in this House introduce anything I have to say with the preface as a sociologist, because it would be singularly absurd to introduce <Col N="477" /> a priestly mode of reference to anything that I have to say in that regard.  But it does not stop lawyers, including the distinguished Professor Mary McAleese, from coming out with the extraordinary statement, as she does in her article, that divorce is &ldquo;a social evil.&rdquo;  I am not sure in what context lawyers use the term &ldquo;evil&rdquo;. They certainly rarely use such terminology when addressing judges.  Those who are represented by Professor McAleese find it easy to make this statement in papers like the one to which I made reference.</P>
    <P>This is a very dangerous line of argument. First &mdash; and let us be unemotive about it &mdash; it argues for a connection between the law and society which is problematic.  There is a discussion in the sociology of law, as it happens, as to what impact laws have and do not have on social practice.  Yet for the lobby that opposes divorce in this country no problem exists.  They have two basic assumptions, one is that changing the law will lead to some kind of social collapse.  However, their view is not as unsophisticated as that.  They see a package of measures as speeding us towards a slide into moral collapse.  Thus divorce is fired in along with contraception, abortion and indeed usually by the more extreme elements with recognition of the rights of homosexuals and others.  They are, all together, a package which is tending towards the dissolution of society.  There is not one whit of evidence offered by these people for the connection between the innovations in law and the social consequences to which they make reference.  I challenge people in this debate to offer such evidence because I intend in my own contribution to take up this question as to the social impact of divorce legislation in other jurisdictions.  In fact it is rather ignorant, insulting and offensive for people within legislatures in Ireland to be foisting on to other populations and other communities, which have their own legislatures, sets of consequences and aspects of moral depravity in respect of which they are reluctant to offer evidence. There is another issue which arises and which is related to that, the suggestion as <Col N="478" /> to what is the connection between divorce as a human right and moral order. When we discuss the relationship of divorce legislation to the moral order it is rarely &mdash; intriguingly &mdash; discussed by lawyers in terms of the civil moral order. What they seek to do is to test the legislation against Catholic moral order or religious moral order, for example, is it moral or immoral to suggest to a population that they have to wait for the fundamental facility to remarry until they have finished the political process of bargaining?</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Annual Report of the Ombudsman for the year ended 31st December, 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former Ombudsman I would quite clearly have more than an ordinary interest in the first report of the Ombudsman in the Republic for 1984 and I look forward to the 1985 report, more especially since his remit has been extended to cover local authorities and the health boards effective in that year.  I welcome the report in that it presents a fairly wide picture of the nature and complexities of questions related to citizens' grievances in a complex society.  It pinpoints the basic democratic philosophy that the State and its bureaucratic machinery is to be seen working as a servant of the people and not the other way round.  This <Col N="479" /> is precisely where we in democratic societies differ from totalitarian regimes, authoritarian, and indeed sometimes despotic.</P>
    <P>The area in which the Ombudsman operates can be best described as a grey area.  From experience it was found that the legal machinery could not provide all the remedies and the same is true of the political and administrative apparatus. One has only to look at the report to see the truth of this assertion.  On these matters, legal, administrative and perhaps political I will make this observation and qualification.  On the question of access to the courts the Ombudsman normally does not intrude, that is, he does not investigate.  However, it is possible for the Ombudsman to take a case if he is satisfied that in the public and the peculiar circumstances it is not reasonable to expect the complainant to go to the court.  The same principle applies in the case of tribunals if a person complains that the injustice sustained by him remains unremedied.  These are serious qualifications and very important ones. Again, the normal political machinery does not operate to the depths that the Ombudsman's investigation operates and that is why in civilised democratic communities all over the world we have Ombudsmen's offices.</P>
    <P>On page 11 of the report I note there were a number of legal challenges on points of law by different Government Departments to the authority of the office to conduct investigations.  There is nothing peculiar about this.  I think the Ombudsman would have welcomed it; I know I would.  I am pleased to see that these exercises have, in fact, cleared the air &mdash; that is what they were designed to do &mdash; and the action taken by the office was correct.  This removes the uncertainty and the anxiety arising as it did from differing interpretations of the legalities. This brings me to pages 8 and 9 of the report.  The relationship between the Ombudsman's office and the Civil Service is a very important element in the working of the office.  Traditionally the head of a Civil Service Department <Col N="480" /> regarded himself as having the final say in all matters, especially employment, relating to his Department.  It would, therefore, be somewhat disconcerting for him to find that his or his Department's decisions would be looked at by an outside party.  That is natural.  It does, and it will, take time to get used to the new position and the new idea, but in my experience that will be overcome eventually. It is very important that it is seen to be overcome.  There cannot be a bad relationship between the Civil Service on the one hand and the Ombudsman's office on the other, or between the local authorities and the Ombudsman's office.</P>
    <P>On page 25 the Ombudsman said:</P>
    <P>The experience of the first year and the level of co-operation achieved from the various government Departments, despite some continuing tensions, promises well for the future development of the Office of Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Here we have it from the Ombudsman that relationships have improved and are now stabilised.  This is a good thing and I am glad to note that.  Again, I point to my experiences as Ombudsman in Northern Ireland where the Civil Service and the local authorities and other bodies subject to investigation take the stance of actually advising the complainants to go to the Ombudsman.  We do this because we feel confident that their decision is the right one.  It is common sense and intelligent to tell a complainant that if he does not like the decision, the Ombudsman will clear up the matter because he is independent.  That stance has developed and I believe there is a good relationship between the Ombudsman's office and the Civil Service, the local authorities and the health authorities, as the 1985 report will, I hope, show.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises the fact that the very existence of the office keeps administrators on their toes.  It is nice for a complainant to find that the Ombudsman has found in his favour, but what about the people for whom he cannot find in favour?  There is this to be said about that: there will be a small minority of people who never will be pleased.  On the <Col N="481" /> other hand, among the people for whom he cannot find in favour, the average consensus of opinion is that an independent mind looked at the case and they are satisfied they were wrong and that the Department or local authority were right.  That is very important.  It is important that people are satisfied that an independent, in-depth investigation was carried out, that it was properly carried out and that the right decision was made, even if it was not in favour of the complainant.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman investigates allegations of maladministration, a sinister word which is not defined in the dictionaries. Dick Crossman, when Minister in the British Labour Government, gave as good a definition as I have found &mdash; bias, neglect, delay, ineptitude, perversity, arbitrariness, discrimination of the religious, political or racist.  Good administration means more than doing what is precisely legal.  It means fairness, taking care and good communications.  The essential function of the Ombudsman's job, therefore, is to promote fairness. The word &ldquo;Ombudsman&rdquo; means fair play man, justice-man and, as I said, the very existence of the Ombudsman's office means that the administrators will see to it that they and their Departments do not have the Ombudsman knocking on their door too often.</P>
    <P>There is a fair picture in the report of how the communications system works. This island is divided into 26 counties, and complaints came from every county. This is commendable.  Nevertheless, more can be done in the publicity area. Television, radio and the press are there and I have been informed that the Ombudsman is providing this kind of service everywhere he goes.  I would like to see more posters at railways stations and more pamphlets at post offices explaining what the Ombudsman does.  When speaking to people in the Republic, especially students, I make a point of asking them if they know they have an Ombudsman and what he does.  There is still room for better communication through posters, pamphlets, radio and television.  I used them extensively in the <Col N="482" /> North and I suggest that the Ombudsman could have another look at extending the publicity in the Republic since his remit has been extended to cover local authorities and health authorities.</P>
    <P>Among the matters mentioned was the question of delay.  On pages 22, 23, and 24 the heading is &ldquo;Delay &mdash; a matter of serious complaint.&rdquo;  On page 42 there is the heading &ldquo;Delayed Payment&rdquo;.  Under that heading it is stated:</P>
    <P>A man who claimed disability benefit from the Department of Social Welfare in 1981 was paid at the wrong rate.  Three years later he queried the payments made in 1981 and as a result received arrears for an amount in excess of £1,000.</P>
    <P>Three years delay: human error, computer error, or whatever, and the Ombudsman has said that within the definition laid down by Crossman delay is a serious matter.  This was serious.  In a reply he got from the Department asking them to comment on that man's appeal for payment of interest, the Ombudsman went on to say:</P>
    <P>In view of the implications such payments would have for all Government Departments with paying responsibilities it &ldquo;is most unlikely that the Minister for Finance would agree to such an extra statutory payment, . . . . .&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement is irrelevant.  I does not arise for the very simple reason that the Ombudsman need not rely on the Minister for Finance to make a statutory payment, to make it law for delayed payments.  All the Ombudsman has to do &mdash; and it is within his powers to do it &mdash; is to make a recommendation for an <i>exgratia</i> payment by way of compensation. That is relevant.</P>
    <P>The Department go on to say, &ldquo;Over the years there had never been any consistent demand for interest on delayed payments&rdquo;.  That is irrelevant.  The fact that there were no demands for interest payments means nothing to the case.  The complainant could still be right.  Not <Col N="483" /> knowing his rights he did not bother to make any complaint about the delay or, for compensation, not interest, which may be equivalent to interest, but not necessarily.  What I am saying is to assist the Ombudsman.  I am trying to make constructive, not destructive criticism.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman goes on to say:</P>
    <P>I accept that the Department's decision in this case is consistent with its practice over the years &mdash;</P>
    <P>Of course, it could be consistent.  Consistency has nothing to do with justice or fairness.  It could be consistent malpractice over the years and probably is.</P>
    <P>&mdash; and with its view that it should continue with the efforts to eliminate the causes of avoidable delay in all its payments.  But I am concerned about the inequity that operates between &ldquo;paying&rdquo; Departments and Departments who collect money, e.g. Revenue Commissioners who may charge interest on money due.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is inequity between the payment Departments and the Departments which collect money.  He went on to say that there was also the more serious problem of the loss and hardship endured by persons who are denied their due entitlements at a time when the need is greatest but he did not make a decision to have compensation paid to the complainant.</P>
    <P>I am perturbed about that because as a former Ombudsman I would have made the decision for compensation.  I am not saying the Ombudsman was drastically wrong but he has bowed to officialdom because of the implications for other paying Departments.  I would suggest this by way of relieving the pressure on the Ombudsman from officialdom.  There is in Westminster a select committee called the Parliamentary Commissioners Select Committee for Administration and the Ombudsman in Northern Ireland and in the UK keep in touch with the all-party committee, exchange views, iron out difficulties and do their best to help the Ombudsman navigate a course of direction which would show that his decisions are based on fair judgment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> I am recommending, therefore, that an all-party committee be set up &mdash; it may not be called a select committee &mdash; to meet the Ombudsman at least once a year and exchange views.  The Ombudsman requires this support in his navigation course and what he does and why he does it, and the premise on which he acts. If he reaches a dilemma by way of a recommendation not carried out by the Civil Service he must depend on the will of the Houses of the Oireachtas to give credence and credibility to his recommendation. What better way to prepare the way than an all-party committee meeting at least once a year with the Ombudsman to do that.  His geographical page showing that the counties had all complained and his comparisons with other countries who had ombudsmen did not contain a comparison with Northern Ireland.  It should have done that, especially since the former Northern Ireland Ombudsman is now a Member of the Seanad.  Northern Ireland had an Ombudsman many years before the Republic.  That is relevant too.  The comparison between the Republic and Northern Ireland should have been in the report as well.</P>

      <P>It is indeed a privilege and personal pleasure for me, as Minister for the Public Service, to be able to address the House in relation to the annual report of the Ombudsman.  The report, of course, is the first annual report produced by the Ombudsman and I welcome its publication. The provisions of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, gave the Ombudsman a very special reporting relationship with the Oireachtas.  It means in effect that he reports only to the Oireachtas and that he is totally independent of all other agencies in the exercise of his functions. It is appropriate, therefore, that the Members of the Oireachtas should have an opportunity to discuss this report and the general operation of the Office of the Ombudsman during the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even a casual glance through the report is sufficient to show that 1984, the year covered by the report, was a busy <Col N="485" /> and eventful one for the Ombudsman and his staff.  In his first year of operation the Ombudsman received more than 2,000 complaints from all over the country and from people in all walks of life.  The nature and extent of the complaints received clearly underline the need for the office and justify its establishment. By the end of December, the office had dealt with 1,736 complaints.  This represents about 77 per cent of the total number of complaints received and is a tangible benchmark of success.  It underlines too, the efficient manner in which the Ombudsman and his staff have been discharging their responsibilities</P>
    <P>The report raises a great number of issues both of a general and a specific nature.  Before going on to discuss these issues I think that it would be useful to make a few general comments about the role of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>As Members of the House will be aware the Ombudsman was appointed by the President on 8 November 1983 following resolutions passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas recommending his appointment.  He took up office on 3 January 1984.  Above all else the Ombudsman was appointed to speak and act on behalf of individual citizens.  On their behalf he examines the actions of public officials and seeks a satisfactory remedy in those instances where he finds that a citizen has a genuine grievance. He deals with day-to-day administrative decisions rather than with the broad scheme of Government policy or national affairs.  During his first 12 months in office he has been examining the actions of Government Departments and their associated offices.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman, of course, is independent in the exercise of his functions. While he has no power to force a body to accept his recommendations, his recommendations do carry a significant moral authority.  He is empowered to make a special report to the Oireachtas, to whom the administrators are responsible if he is not satisfied with the response to his recommendations.  There can be no doubt in anyone's mind that no official <Col N="486" /> will take lightly the possibility of such public criticism of his Department from such a high and independent source.</P>
    <P>While the Ombudsman acts on behalf of the citizen, I must emphasise that he is not an enemy of the bureaucracy.  The Ombudsman is not intended to be some kind of overlord avenging the misdeeds of bloody-minded bureaucrats.  Rather he is an independent and easily reached mediator.  His role is purely to investigate and report.  His importance lies in his power to investigate the actions of administrators and to report on those to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Going on the experience of Ombudsmen abroad it can be expected that a fair proportion of investigations will show that the administrative actions complained about were fair and reasonable in the circumstances.  I think that this is borne out by the statistics in the report which show that quite a number of complaints were not upheld.</P>
    <P>To the man in the street, the Ombudsman is seen as an important and independent figure, a known form of redress. Informality, speed and accessibility are the keynotes of his office.  In essence, therefore, the Ombudsman is an impartial and independent referee, or, as he himself put it in his report &ldquo;a kind of mediator between the public and the administration&rdquo;.  I am glad to note, and Members of the House I am sure will feel likewise, that the Ombudsman's perception of his role is concerned not only with the legal aspects of complaints, but also with the question of equity and fair play. They will also note the emphasis on informality with which I wholeheartedly agree.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the report itself, the statistics show that the Ombudsman received a total of 2,267 complaints during the year.  As the report indicates, these complaints came from all over the country and from people in all walks of life.  These figures reflect, in my view, the major impact which the Ombudsman has made in his first year in office.  Indeed to my mind, they indicate the confidence of the people of Ireland in the office itself <Col N="487" /> and in the appointment of Mr. Michael Mills as our first Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>A total of 1,544 of the complaints came within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman. This represents 68 per cent of the total number of complaints received.  The Ombudsman succeeded in completing his investigation of 1,013 of these cases and the balance of 531 were carried forward. I note from the report that apart from resolving 400 cases, the Ombudsman was able to provide assistance in 148 cases.  In general, this means that the Ombudsman did not uphold the original complaint but was able to point the complainant in the direction of other benefits or other schemes or other courses of action that were open to him and from which he was likely to benefit.  This I think is an aspect of the Ombudsman's work which is worth nothing.</P>
    <P>We all have a tendency to think in terms of cases which are resolved or not upheld.  It is reassuring to see that even where cases cannot be &ldquo;resolved&rdquo;, assistance can nevertheless often be given.  The fact, of course, that a sizeable number of cases were not upheld is, as I have already said, evidence that the Ombudsman acts impartially and is not involved in any type of &ldquo;witch-hunt&rdquo;.  He is, therefore, in a real sense the man in the middle.  He is the friend of the public but he is not an enemy of the bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>The original complaint was not upheld in 294 cases.  The report indicates that 122 of these referred to the system of averaging insurance contributions for the purposes of contributory old age pension. There are no details given of what the balance of these complaints referred to. However, I understand that in general they referred to items such as claims for social welfare benefits, grants, and refunds of tax, to which the complainants felt that they were entitled but which, on examination by the Ombudsman, proved to be unfounded.</P>
    <P>There were 171 cases where the complaint was discontinued or withdrawn. Again, we do not have a specific breakdown of these cases.  In general, I understand that in some of these cases, the complaint was withdrawn because the <Col N="488" /> complainant received satisfaction from the body concerned before the Ombudsman had completed his investigation.  In other cases, complaints were withdrawn when the facts presented by the body concerned, refuting in detail the complaint made, were put to the complainant. In some other cases, the complainant would have also been referred to a solicitor and on reconsideration the complainant might have opted for a legal course of action rather than pursuing his case through the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Almost all Departments and offices listed in Part 1 of the First Schedule to the Ombudsman Act, 1980 were the subject of complaint.  Not altogether surprisingly the bulk of the complaints were in the areas administered by the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  These are areas of public administration which affect the daily lives of almost every citizen in one way or another.</P>
    <P>I was interested also in the relatively high number of complaints which lay outside the Ombudsman's jurisdiction.  The total involved was 723 and constituted almost 32 per cent of the total number of complaints received.  I was very happy to note that the Ombudsman was able to resolve some of these cases despite the fact that they were outside his jurisdiction. Many of these related to health boards and local authorities.  These bodies are of course now within the remit of the Ombudsman since 1 April last.</P>
    <P>A number of others related to such issues as pensions, conditions of service, recruitment and so on.  The whole area relating to personnel matters is specifically excluded from the Ombudsman's remit at present.  The case has been made to me on a number of occasions about the possibility of the Ombudsman investigating this area.  I remain still to be convinced of the necessity for it.  At the time the legislation was going through the House in 1980 the then Minister of State did not favour this idea.  I should also mention that a very detailed procedure has been agreed with staff interests regarding steps that are to be taken when a civil servant finds himself in dispute on <Col N="489" /> a particular matter with his employer. That is a very detailed procedure and leaves open to the individual recourse to quite a series of steps.</P>
    <P>The other potential objection, as I have pointed out before in this House, to the concept of the Ombudsman investigating areas such as this is that the Ombudsman might well become a personnel grievance officer in so far as civil servants are concerned and that might not be the best image for the Ombudsman to have.  However, I still have a relatively open mind on this issue.</P>
    <P>Other complaints referred to the Garda, courts and Defence forces which are all excluded from investigation by the Ombudsman.  The exclusion of the Garda was recommended by the all-party committee, after detailed consideration. They were excluded on the grounds that their work is mainly subject to the scrutiny of the Judiciary or else related to security or subject to existing appeals machinery.  The courts are excluded as it was never the intention that the Ombudsman would interfere with the judicial process. The Defence Forces are excluded on the grounds that they do not greatly impinge on the everyday life of the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>There were also a number of complaints about State bodies.  Senators will be aware that a major extension of the Ombudsman's remit took place on 1 April last.  This extension covered local authorities, health boards, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  In deciding on the framework for the extended remit, the Government took into account the availability of resources and the areas where resources could be employed to the optimum advantage.  In essence, resources had to be balanced against priorities.  Even with the major increase in staff resources, it was necessary for the Government to make a choice as to which areas the extended remit should cover. Since An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann were established at the same time and since their operations had such an important and immediate impact on the public in the postal and telecommunications <Col N="490" /> area as a whole, it was decided to include these two State bodies in the Ombudsman's remit.</P>
    <P>The position of other state bodies will have to be considered at a future date.  I intend to keep the legislation under review and further additions could be made to the Ombudsman's remit as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Another point about the statistics given in the report on which I would like to comment briefly is the number of complaints received in the closing months of the year.  This is graphically illustrated on page 60 of the report.  I have said before in the House that it is vital that the public become fully aware of the Ombudsman's role, especially now that his remit has been expanded.  I was interested to hear Senator McGonagle's remark regarding the necessity for a continuing campaign of publicity so that the greatest number of people are aware of the existence and operation of the Ombudsman's office.  Following discussions which I had with the Ombudsman last year, he launched a major publicity campaign.  The result of this campaign was the large inflow of complaints to his office in November and December of last year.  This is probably a major factor in the number of complaints carried forward into this year.  The need for adequate publicity for the office, especially in its early years, is vital to ensure its effective operation.  I am sure that the Ombudsman will take the remarks of the Senator into account in deciding on the type of publicity campaign and literature which might be employed in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The geographical spread of complaints is also interesting.  Complaints were received from every county.  This will raise in many people's minds the question of the Ombudsman and his staff operating in some way on a regional basis.  This is all the more important now that he is dealing with complaints about health boards and local authorities.  Any discussion of this issue must take cognisance of the independence of the Ombudsman in deciding how to carry out the functions of his office.  I know there have been <Col N="491" /> requests from time to time from Members of the Oireachtas that there might be even regional offices established.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman has recently decided that members of his staff should visit regional areas for the purposes of interviewing complainants at a local level.  It is intended that these visits will be a regular feature of the work of the office.  During these visits, members of the public, who have an unresolved complaint against certain public bodies, are able to meet with the staff of the Ombudsman's office to have their complaints examined.</P>
    <P>Navan, Monaghan and Dundalk were visited during the week commencing 9 September 1985 and Limerick and Ennis were visited during the week commencing 23 September 1985.  Longford and Mullingar were visited during the week commencing 7 October 1985 and it is intended to visit Cork city on 22 and 23 October.  Other areas will be visited over the coming months.</P>
    <P>As part of the arrangements for these visits temporary offices for the Ombudsman's staff are established in local hotels.  Posters advertising the visits are displayed in post offices, libraries, community welfare offices, tax offices, employment offices and other offices of that type and advertisements are placed in the local papers.  Where possible, interviews are held with local journalists to ensure adequate advance coverage of the visit.  Members of the public are invited to call to the hotel to meet the Ombudsman's staff during ordinary office hours and in the evening time between 7.30 p.m. and 8.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>Experience to date has shown that these visits are well worthwhile and beneficial to all concerned.  Firstly, there has been a steady stream of callers to each of the centres indicating a clear demand for this service.  Secondly, it has been found to date that few, if any, of the complainants interviewed would have been prepared to go to Dublin.  They would not have put their complaint on paper, generally because they felt that their complaint was too complex and they felt that they were unable to commit all the details to paper.  Expenses of those required to <Col N="492" /> travel distances in connection with investigations by the Ombudsman may be recouped.</P>
    <P>I would like now to turn to an aspect of the report which is of deep concern to me.  The Ombudsman reports that while the response of many civil servants to the creation of his office was most encouraging, some senior civil servants resented its intrusion, particularly when their decisions were under scrutiny.  He also reports that there were legal challenges to his authority which seemed to be more concerned with preventing an investigation into particular complaints than the question of whether the complaints were justified.  This was also referred to earlier by Senator McGonagle.</P>
    <P>The efficient discharge of the Ombudsman's role depends, to a large extent, on the co-operation he receives from the bureaucracy.  Bearing this in mind, my Department issued guidelines to all Departments before the office of the Ombudsman was established about the procedures to be followed during the investigation of complaints by the Ombudsman and his staff.  These guidelines did not leave any civil servant, irrespective of at what level he was serving, in doubt that they were expected to co-operate fully with the Ombudsman and his staff.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned and disappointed, therefore, that the Ombudsman should have been hindered in any form while attempting to carry out the functions of his office.  I need hardly say that I regard this absence of co-operation as tantamount to frustrating the intentions of the Government and of this House.  Any lack of co-operation with the Ombudsman, irrespective from what quarter it emanates, will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Some public officials may be hiding behind the illusion that, because the Ombudsman has no powers to force a body to accept his recommendations, they need not co-operate with the Ombudsman and will remain untouched. I would remind officials that the Ombudsman can make a special report to the Oireachtas where he is not satisfied with the response that he gets.  If such were to <Col N="493" /> happen, I need hardly say that a very serious view would be taken of the matter.</P>
    <P>It was understandable, as the Ombudsman points out, where points of principle were involved or where, as in the case of the appeals officers of the Department of Social Welfare long established procedures were in question that legal clarification would be sought.  However, legal challenges to prevent the Ombudsman from investigating specific complaints are totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Early suspicions were, of course, to be expected.  Senator McGonagle drawing from his own experience has confirmed that.  This has been the international experience.  However, the full co-operation of all the agencies covered by the Ombudsman's remit, and indeed each individual member of their staff, will be expected from now on.  I will be keeping a close eye on this matter and I hope that no further adverse comments will be called for.</P>
    <P>Another item which the Ombudsman considered to warrant special comment in his report was the unnecessary delay on the part of various Government Departments and offices in replying to letters and decisions.  As the Ombudsman has pointed out, delay, in any circumstance, is frustrating for people.  Very often it can also result in real hardship, particularly when the most vulnerable sectors of our society are involved &mdash; the old and the needy.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the comments of the Ombudsman in relation to instances of apparently unreasonable delays in administration.  I am sure that all Departments &mdash; especially those specifically cited in the report &mdash; will note the Ombudsman's comments and take action to eliminate or reduce the sources of delay.  My Department have been addressing this problem, and will continue to do so, in the course of their efficiency reviews in Government Departments and offices.  Progress in eliminating delays will be a major element in improving service to the public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> Apart from efficiency reviews my Department are endeavouring to improve service to the public by providing an increased level of training for those in face to face contact &mdash; both oral and written &mdash; with the public.  A special unit has been established in my Department to improve the presentation and layout of Civil Service forms.</P>
    <P>Another important change &mdash; what I call the personalisation of the Civil Service &mdash; has been made.  Civil servants dealing with the public, whether face to face, by telephone or by letter, are required to have their names and designation typed below their signature on all correspondence and to wear name badges when serving in offices open to the public. Other proposals are included in the White Paper which I have recently published. Improved management methods and greater use of technology are central to these proposals.</P>
    <P>The office of the Ombudsman has now been in operation for almost two years. The office is carrying out a function that is entirely new to the experience of this country.  Obviously, the creation and staffing of such a new office was likely to give rise to some problems initially for the office and its staff.  I note that the Ombudsman reports that the appointment of staff by the Civil Service Commission gave rise to some problems during his first year in office.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of staff by the Civil Service Commission ensures a fair and independent means of selection.  It is very important for the independence of the office, and its future effectiveness, that the staff are seen to be independent of the political system.  Therefore, it is necessary that the system of recruitment is fair and seen to be fair.  This can, however, involve the commission in detailed selection procedures.</P>
    <P>There were no problems with the appointment of most of the staff to the office.  The director and senior investigator were appointed in January and April 1984, respectively, but officials were in fact serving in a temporary capacity in these posts from 1 January 1984.  Similarly, there were no problems <Col N="495" /> in regard to the appointment of clerical and executive staff.  Such positions were filled without any delay.  The only problem arose in relation to the appointment of permanent investigators.  However, I should emphasise that temporary investigators were appointed to the Ombudsman's office from the outset. The problem in appointing the permanent investigators arose because there is a time scale involved in the recruitment of staff by open competition.  However, this is the only way that I can see to ensure that the best people are recruited and that there is no interference of any kind in the recruitment process.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak briefly about the future of the office.  The remit of the Ombudsman was extended on 1 April of this year to cover local authorities, health boards, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann. This is a major expansion in the Ombudsman's remit.  It means that the actions of an additional 100,000 public servants approximately fall within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction.  This represents, in numerical terms, almost a threefold increase in his initial remit. Given that the Ombudsman has been in operation for a relatively short period, I think that the expansion that has just taken place must, by any standards, be considered a major one.</P>
    <P>An additional 12 investigators and three senior investigators have been appointed, together with back-up clerical staff, to cope with the additional workload. This staff were assigned on the basis that one senior investigator and four investigators would be assigned to each of the areas of the local authorities, the health boards and telecommunications. Before these staff were recruited consultations took place with the Ombudsman as to what would be deemed the appropriate level of investigative staff which might be required.  The Ombudsman was satisfied that the number of staff recruited would be adequate to cope with the additional workload.</P>
    <P>The additional senior investigator and investigator posts represent a threefold increase in the existing staff complement of the Ombudsman's office at these <Col N="496" /> levels.  The authorised staff of the office has now been increased to a total of one director, four senior investigators, 16 investigators and some 20 support staff for the discharge of his extended remit. It underlines the Government's firm commitment, at a time of necessary cutbacks in the public service, to the concept of administrative justice.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to one aspect of the Ombudsman's remit which I think is particularly important.  A suggestion was made last year during the debate on the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill, 1984 that the Ombudsman should highlight those areas where grievances can be remedied only by reforming legislation. I believe that the Ombudsman has an important role to play not merely in investigating individual complaints, but also in pointing to areas where general remedial action is needed through changes in legislation.</P>
    <P>The all-party committee saw this as a very important aspect of the Ombudsman's role.  In doing this, of course, he would be of considerable help to the Oireachtas which, because of pressure of business, has not always the time to review the impact of legislation on an on-going basis.  The anomalies identified, no matter how slight they might be, could still give rise to very serious problems for large sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to see, therefore, that the Ombudsman has included a section in his report which suggests that certain areas of social legislation might be reviewed.  The report has been brought to the attention of the Ministers concerned and the Government have asked each Minister to take appropriate action to remove them in so far as it is possible to do so within the resources available.</P>
    <P>In some cases remedial action has already been taken.  The Finance Act includes a provision to remove the tax anomaly which which deprives some widows and other single persons of the single person's tax allowance.  The dates in regard to the revision of rateable valuation of property have been altered and the Minister for the Environment issued <Col N="497" /> a circular to each rating authority requesting them to notify individually the owners of property affected by revised valuation together with the details of the rights of appeal.  Legislation is at present in preparation which will confer a new general power on local authorities which should enable them to deal with cases similar to that reported by the Ombudsman under the heading &ldquo;Antiquated law&rdquo;.  It is, of course, only right to say that some of the anomalies highlighted in the report involve many complexities. The contributory pension scheme is a case in point.  Detailed analysis of this issue shows that to modify the statutory contribution conditions for the people affected would in turn create further inconsistencies for other groups.  The cumulative costs of the modification would be of the order of £50 million in estimated 1987 price terms.  The deserted husband is another case in point.  The Commission on Social Welfare are looking into the whole area of the needs of single parents.  The Seanad will readily agree, I know, that any attempt to sort out this problem must again avoid the creation of new anomalies.  Again I am sure it is not necessary for me to refer to the complexities involved in the whole area of domicile.  Suffice it to say that proposals being developed by the Minister for Justice will have the effect of doing away with the present rule under which the domicile of a married woman is deemed to be that of her husband.  As I have said, the Government have asked each Minister concerned to take appropriate action on these anomalies, wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Of course, I should add that remedial action is dictated by the financial and economic parameters within which we find ourselves.  However, the Government have taken serious note of the Ombudsman's suggestions for the review of legislation and, as I have pointed out, action has already been put in train in a number of the areas involved.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the report that the Ombudsman is optimistic about the future development of the office.  I share <Col N="498" /> that optimism, having seen the achievements of the office during the first year and I take this opportunity to wish the Ombudsman and his staff every success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report of the first 12 months of operation of the office of the Ombudsman.  In a relatively short period the office seems to have got its act together and to have had a very successful first year.  The only non successes seemed to be due to lack of co-operation from Departments of State.  It occurs to me that if it were not for the Departments of State not doing their job there would have been no need for an Ombudsman in the first place.  There is no doubt about the need for the Ombudsman because of the tardiness of certain officials within Departments in doing the job for which they are employed in the first place.</P>
      <P>In the first few years of the operation of any new scheme difficulties are bound to arise, many of them because of the lack of knowledge by certain people as to why the Ombudsman was appointed in the first place.  It comes across quite plainly in the report that a number of the complaints that were made were about matters for which the Ombudsman had no control.  Nevertheless it is disappointing to read that the only challenges to the office of the Ombudsman or the role of the Ombudsman relates to specific Departments, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, in the first place, and Bórd Telecom Éireann in the second place, the Department of Education and the Department of Social Welfare.  It is strange to think that an office which was set up to help the public should be hindered by public servants who are there in the first place to help people who have problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thrust of the argument that is put forward in the report against civil servants is that they do not seem to realise the difficulty people have when they are in a socially deprived situation.  A number of the cases mentioned here are cases where people have not got their rights under law in the social welfare area. <Col N="499" /> There is a major problem by way of delays and apparently as a result of lack of knowledge because it would appear that people in the Department of Social Welfare are not aware of what they are supposed to do when somebody is socially deprived.  As a public representative I can say that one of the most savage indictments of the social welfare system is the non-arrival of a cheque on a Thursday morning to somebody who has no money. There are people in this House who will have a salary cheque at the end of every month.  They know it is coming.  There are people in this House who are in business and there are some here who have second salaries, so even if the cheque from the Department of Finance is delayed at the end of the month it does not matter at all that much.  But to somebody who has borrowed from his local shopkeeper in the expectation of getting a cheque through the post on a Thursday morning the story would be very different. If such a person is told on phoning the Department that his cheque has not been processed all that means to the civil servant giving the reply is that the cheque has not been processed.  It does not make any difference to the civil servant but it does make a difference to the person down the country who has not got one solitary penny in his pocket and who has run out of credit in his local supermarket. In appealing to people who deal with problems such as these and looking at them in terms of the report of the Ombudsman, if we are to get any equity in payments we must computerise at regional level the payment of social welfare benefits.  We talk about this here every time a Finance Bill is before us and every time we deal with Department of Social Welfare matters but nothing is being done to remedy the position.  I can phone my secretary in Dublin and she can ring a special number to get information but that is if there is not a work to rule going on in the Department, in which case they will not accept telephone calls from anybody.</P>
    <P>It is all right for my secretary to ring the Department of Social Welfare and to be told, &ldquo;Sorry, due to a work to rule we <Col N="500" /> cannot take telephone calls&rdquo;, but consider the person down the country who has borrowed 50p from his next door neighbour to ring the Department of Social Welfare only to be told that the Department are not taking telephone calls.  The 50p has been lost but it must be repaid from the social welfare cheque whenever it arrives.  I am appealing to the Minister who is present to improve matters in this area.  I know from very close contact with him at local level that he not only has a knowledge of the problem but has been trying to do something about it.  If that communication problem could be overcome much of the annual report of the Ombudsman could be squeezed into a very much thinner volume than is the case at present.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; now Bord Telecom &mdash; in their attitude towards their consumers have been deplorable right through the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>What they seem to forget is that the people who have telephones are customers and as customers are entitled to know at all times how much every telephone call costs.  There should be a proper monitoring system on every telephone.  If this is going to cost them money it is money that will be well spent, both in terms of PR and in terms of their own working.  So long as they know on a monitored basis the extent to which each telephone is being used, they will know how much they should charge certain groups of people in the community.  They can adjust charges and make those telephones which are less economic more economic possibly by adding a surcharge for telephones which are not used.  They could give discounts where telephones are used to a large degree and they could have a proper monitoring of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again one notices that in relation to the Department of Finance many of the problems brought to the Ombudsman are communication problems with the Revenue Commissioners whether relating to PAYE, to PRSI, to certificates or anything else.  In every area there seems to <Col N="501" /> be a tardiness in answering specific correspondence about specific cases.  There should be no need for an Ombudsman to become involved in a situation like that. The Ombudsman should not be there to deal with day-to-day normal workings of any Department of State.  His role should be to get in when all fruit fails, when there is no further avenue that a citizen can pursue in trying to get his rights.  His remit has been extended to local authorities and this is a good thing.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we hear that local authorities are very bad in their communications, that their PR work is bad and that they do not do their job very well, but from what I can gather since the remit was extended to them the number of complaints has not risen to the extent that the people who decry or who try to run down local authorities staffs would have us believe.  People who work at local authority level are closer to the people of the area.  This is why in general they do a better job in the public perception than is done by civil servants who are too remote.  Civil servants should not hide behind a computer error or computer input.  I have had specific cases during the year at times when telephones in the Department were being answered but queries were not being dealt with.  On one occasion when I had to go to Store Street to deal with a specific social welfare matter I found that seven of the nine desks were not in use and that at the two in use about 300 people were waiting to be dealt with by two people.  That was at a time when there was a work to rule in terms of telephone communications. Nobody could tolerate that.  I stayed there in one instance for over two and a half hours and then had to leave without reaching the counter.  A fault I have with many of the offices of Departments in Dublin is that the people at the front desk are not exactly the greatest PR people for the Departments that they are supposed to serve.  It may be that they are not being paid to be PROs but if people are meeting the public, at least they should have the courtesy to deal with the person coming in.  Whether they be recipients of social welfare benefits or <Col N="502" /> benefits of any kind or ordinary members of the public who are coming in to make a query, they should all be received civilly.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's role is one which will become definitive only after it has been operating for a number of years.  That role at present is inhibited in the sense that too many of the problems that people have with Government Departments are problems which come about because of legislation.  Most of the problems, particularly on a contributory pension basis, are laughable when one reads them, but they are not laughable to the people involved.  There is the instance of the report of a complainant's record of stamps through a period from 1953 to 1984.  In 1953 he had 52 stamps, in 1954 32 stamps, 1955-73 nil, 1974-84 520, making up a total of 604 stamps, or of reckonable social welfare income.  His friend had stamps as follows: 1953 nil, 1954 nil, 1955-73 nil.  In 1974-84 he had 520 reckonable stamps.  The complainant's total is divided by 31 for 1953-84 and comes out with an average of 19.48 stamps per year, whereas if he had 20 he would have been elegible for all the benefits.  His friend only had stamps for 10 years.  The total 520 was divided by 10, so he came out with 52.  It is a ludicrous situation, to which we in this and in the other House must have due regard.  It is a very telling example of bad legislation making bad law and bad law resulting in this type of situation.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure whether contacts with Ombudsmen from abroad is particularly useful, except as an exercise, because things differ from country to country.  I do not think we would base our views of the role of an Ombudsman on what is happening in other countries.  As an intellectual exercise it might be useful to keep in contact with people who are writing on what an Ombudsman does in another area, but I am not too sure that it is of major importance.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the report raises questions and areas in which reviews of social <Col N="503" /> legislation should take place.  The anomalies in the law of domicile, an area mentioned, are so great that one could spend the rest of the afternoon discussing them. There was mention of these this morning in some of the contributions on the Report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown that is before us.  In relation to divorces which took place abroad people are trying to change the situation here, and the domicile rules are totally ludicrous and out of date.</P>
    <P>Contributory old age pensions are mentioned.  There is also the deserted husband anomaly as against the deserted wife.  There is no reason why, as is set out here, the deserted wife should get £20 a week more than the deserted husband in a similar situation.  It is right that the Ombudsman should raise this. However, the role of the Ombudsman should not be to deal with anomalies.  We in this House should be able to see these anomalies and bring them forward. Having said that, it is useful that every opportunity be used to highlight the type of anomaly evident in this report.</P>
    <P>On the trade issue, problems were mentioned which arose when people had, in effect, been locked out.  The Minister present knows that the situation in a factory in south Kilkenny was one of the reasons why there were changes made to deal with that specific case but just because that case was dealt with in a specific way does not mean that there are not still problems in that area, on which people should approach the Irish Congress of Trade Unions about legislation. I would suggest equally that they should get in touch with the legislators rather than the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. If a specific union have a problem, let them go to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, but the buck stops in these two Houses of the Oireachtas and we should recognise the situation.  Mention was made &mdash; and I am sure that there will be other speakers who can elaborate on this more than I can &mdash; of delays in payments. Mentioned in the report is the case of somebody who made a claim in 1977, which claim was not fixed up until 1984. <Col N="504" /> The person in 1984 got the 1977 settlement figure without any adjustment for income tax or for loss of income during that time, without making any adjustment for the fact that money values had dropped significantly in the meantime.  I do not know of any other country in which interest was not paid on such delayed payment.  People should get interest if payments are delayed for a period like seven years.  It is ludicrous that they should have to bear the loss of value in monetary terms over, in that case, a very significant length of time. The 1977-84 case stands out, but it was not the only case in which there was a significant number of years involved in the settlement of claims.</P>
    <P>One of the problems we have in social welfare legislation is the matter of dealing promptly with delayed payments.  For various reasons, a payment or claim might be delayed because the person was not entitled to the claim, but surely there should be some way of speeding up the process.  Why have people to be brought down from Dublin all the time to settle claims?  Why can they not be dealt with on the spot by the local social welfare officer without the person having to go to the local Department of Labour employment office, have the case referred to the local social welfare office, have it referred to Dublin, and the case will then be referred back to the local social welfare officer.  The case will then be identified by the local social welfare officer and then will be referred back to Dublin for final adjudication on the merits of the case as seen by the local officer.</P>
    <P>If the local officer is not going to have the final adjudication on it, why get him involved in the first place?  Why not let him do the whole job?  A social welfare officer should be quite capable of adjudicating on a local matter and having the matter finished at local level.  That would stop many of these delays.</P>
    <P>In many cases delayed payment would probably not be the best description: delayed settlement would be a better word.  Community welfare officers around the country are taking the brunt <Col N="505" /> of the inadequacies in the social welfare system some of which have been mentioned in this report.  Were it not for the community welfare officers around the country there would be a revolt.  The number of people dependent on supplementary benefits, pre-payments from community welfare officers is growing at an enormous rate.  Why?  We are told it is because of the increase in the number of people who are unemployed.  But if there is an increasing number unemployed and there is an increasing need for service from the Department why not increase the staff in the Department to deal with these demands.</P>
    <P>There is an embargo on employment in the public service.  But surely an embargo on employment in the public service should not be paid for by the people who can least afford it, by the people who have not got a solitary penny in their pocket, by the people who do not really know how to go about getting a pre-payment when a dispute arises or who have to go because their computer hiccups.  Indeed computers do not hiccup; it is the people who feed computers who hiccup.  If they are on a one day strike or on a go slow it is the person who has not got a solitary penny in their pocket who will suffer.  It is not the Civil Service, individual civil servants or the Minister who will suffer.  Rather it could be the local shopkeeper who decides to extend a customer's credit by a day; inevitably it is the harassed person who goes to the post office to discover there is no letter for them in the post.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no doubt that the Ombudsman can do nothing about antiquated law.  There is a need for consolidation of all laws that have passed through this House in the last 100 years. There were a couple of attempts made at that but there has not been a full consolidation of legislation passed in either House.  We need a consolidation of social welfare legislation and that in many other areas such consolidation would eliminate many of the problems that arise.  It would make it easier for legislators to deal with <Col N="506" /> legislation.  Hopefully, if we get a consolidation Bill or a series of consolidation Bills they will be written in language lay people can understand, they will not be written in archaic legal jargon with no meaning in terms of the way people now speak.</P>
    <P>The office of the Ombudsman has attempted successfully to support people with problems.  It is interesting to note that the largest number of such problems related to staff problems within the Civil Service which could not be resolved through the normal channels, so these people had to resort to the Ombudsman. That is an indictment of personnel management within the Civil Service.  There must be a continuation of effort within our Civil Service that would give each and every member of the Civil Service from the highest to the lowest, the feeling that there is an opportunity for him or her to discuss problems with their superior officer and, in a lot of cases when I say &ldquo;superior officer&rdquo;, I am thinking of going as far as the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>The report is an indictment of many Departments of State and semi-State bodies.  The number of queries received by him and which could not be dealt with because of statutory obstacles is too big. The number of queries received other than those, which could not be dealt with, was not the fault of the Ombudsman. There was the case of the man who came into the country with his golf clubs with two letters, one of which was open and the other which was not open.  It appeared to the junior customs officer that the right thing to do would be to confiscate the golf clubs, give a receipt for them, and that they could be recovered on the passenger's way out, but that did not happen.  It was suggested that he was smuggling in the golf clubs. It was suggested that there was a letter to prove that he was smuggling in the golf clubs for his sister.  Yet, when the Ombudsman got involved, that client got his money back, he got his golf clubs back and went back to the United States with everything.</P>
    <P>One must ask: would that happen somebody who came in here and who had <Col N="507" /> to remain in this State?  The Ombudsman found that the junior person involved at customs level, at whichever airport, had a better grasp of the situation then had senior civil servants.  That is only another indication that the Ombudsman got involved and, because he became involved, there was a resolution of the problem to everybody's satisfaction except, probably, the intermediary, the poor person at mid level of management who probably got rapped on the knuckles because he did not do what his senior officers felt he should do.</P>
    <P>To the Ombudsman and his staff I would say: well done for the first year of operation.  I sincerely hope that, within the next 12 months or couple of years, the frustrations they have suffered because of lack of co-operation from Departments of State will be reduced.  When that happens the role of the Ombudsman might be able to fade into oblivion because, if things were operating properly, there would not be the need for that office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join other Senators in welcoming the first Annual Report of the Ombudsman for 1984 and to join those who complimented the Ombudsman, his investigators and staff.  I clearly recall the context in which the office of Ombudsman was discussed for a number of years in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  When Basil Chubb published his article in the sixties, going around persecuting civil servants, the role of the Irish TD, discussion ensured in the popular newspapers in which people began to refer to TDs, Senators and public representatives as messenger boys, when people on television programmes would frequently have the question put to them: are you a legislator, or are you a messenger boy and so forth? Thus, when the office of Ombudsman was being discussed, people suggested that, when established, it would put a great deal of what were referred to as the clientless politicians out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us ever took that very seriously. The office of Ombudsman in any one of the countries in which it was introduced has made a very slight reduction <Col N="508" /> in the total volume of complaints that citizens have against the State.  If one took all the countries which have an Ombudsman you would probably find that there is not a reduction of 15 per cent in any country.  That is the first point. Therefore, it was never really seriously suggested that it would answer all questions of grievance between citizens and the State.  The office has been very successful, as the report tells us, although there are a number of important modifications in future reports to which I would look forward and which to some extent Senator McGonagle has anticipated. For example, in future reports it will be very valuable to have more detailed discussion of the basis upon which the Ombudsman's office came to a particular decision.  That is very important for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>The office of the Ombudsman should indeed have the informality to which the Minister for the Public Service made reference in his contribution to this motion but while it should seek a resolution in individual cases it also has an exemplary function in so far as it takes these cases as examples of the interaction between citizens and the State.  If we are to benefit from the procedures of the office to the best degree, we need to know the basis upon which the Ombudsman came to a particular decision, for example, in relation to An Bord Telecom an arrangement for investigating telephone accounts has now been arrived at.  I am glad that a certain proportion of people who are disturbed at the enormous bills that they received for one reason or another have had their grievances resolved but I am still anxious to know what kind of arrangement was made.  We need to know this not only to have the benefit of the findings for reforming legislation but also to be able to look at the areas where there may be breaches of natural justice.</P>
    <P>To follow on from the points made by previous Senators, including Senator Lanigan, I have no doubt that delay in the giving of a benefit to somebody at appropriate and current rates can offend against natural justice.  I know the old <Col N="509" /> argument will be that the person was not entitled to the benefit until the day that he or she was judged eligible for it but that is an administrative legal decision and does not take priority over issues of natural justice.  For example, the whole establishment of the different benefits in the social welfare code were justified on their introduction on the basis of appropriate need.  Therefore, from once the need was in existence and the person had notified the State of that need, in all conception of natural justice and the Social Welfare Acts within it the person is entitled to benefit from that date and the person is entitled to the benefit of income from that date.  Thus one cannot have, except in a very backward State &mdash; and this is a backward State in many regards &mdash; the total absurdity whereby the Revenue Commissioners can seek interest on the sums due to them and that those who have been in need and have satisfied that need after a long procedure are not entitled to the money value adjusted to present day standards or indeed to be compensated for such additional expenditure incurred in the vindication of their rights under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>I call to mind the hucksters' attitude of the commercial banks which have the beautiful notion that if, on the one hand, the bad debts of a bank for Revenue Commissioner purposes include not only the capital sum but also the interest that is calculated as due on the capital sum and which is recovered on a pound for pound basis from the Revenue Commissioners or their other beautiful mechanism of instantly debiting their customers with money due by way of interest and not paying interest on deposits for a three day period afterwards due to their own processing system.  I have my own view about the morality of that but it is perfectly clear that in this country, when one looks at it from the perspective of jurisprudence, there is a different criterion of relationship accepted in terms of the recipients of housing, social welfare, health and other benefits and that which is encountered, <Col N="510" /> for example, in the commercial world.  I would ask any public representative in this or the other House to reflect on the different treatment by people who manage private labour mobility exchanges, private labour exchanges and public ones, the private housing market and estate agents, the public local authority housing market and their clients. There is an ethos of the poor law system.</P>
    <P>When the supplementary welfare allowance was introduced people said there would be an end to the dole mentality and so forth and that we were making a great qualitative leap forward in legislation.  I doubted that at the time because the exchanges remained the same and they are a disgrace to the public.  The circumstances under which people who are unfortunate enough to lose their jobs and people who have some disability or another have to come to these exchanges is an absolute scandal.  I also suspect &mdash; and I would like to return to this &mdash; that there is a distinction between the treatment of men and women in relation to their interaction with public services provided.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reforms being made within the public service and I compliment the Minister on humanising the public service so that people can identify with whom they are speaking.  I have written elsewhere about this and said that at times I wondered about the fact that promotion with the public service seems to mean that one had reached the pinnacle of promotion when one had moved backwards and upwards in such a position where people no longer knew where one lived &mdash; at that stage the person had achieved a position of supreme authority. I have said that the Irish system was really deficient in so far as the people who were at the point of interaction with the public were often people who were not the most experienced or senior.  That is a deficiency.</P>
    <P>Equally, within the system there is a legacy brought over from the old British Civil Service days which is absolutely disastrous which is that the Irish public service is hierarchical, centralised, bureaucratic and is categorical in the way <Col N="511" /> it operates in relation to rules.  It is hierachical in so far as the number of decisions which are retained at the very top of the system and the amount of authority which is not delegated is totally counterproductive.  It is centralised in so far as the most major decision making powers are very tightly centralised and I am not talking about geography.  People have this absurd notion that decentralisation is about putting clerk typists and typewriters into vans and sending them off to remote parts of the country.  I am talking about centralised decision making, people above a certain level who are located at the centre of the system. It is bureaucratic in so far as the manner in which decisions are communicated &mdash; and this comes through in the report &mdash; is totally impersonal.  I welcome the fact that people at least sign their letters but the impersonality which is brought to bear in decisions from time to time is totally unsatisfactory.  It is categorical in so far as there is this appalling obsession with, under pain of great penalties I suspect, of operating outside a strict interpretation of the rule.  The easy way out is take no decision other than the standard decision indicated, ignore the human suffering.</P>
    <P>I challenge again a comparison between public and private modes of consumption of services in that regard.  The average estate agent would not deal with a customer in relation to the housing market in the way that a housing officer will be forced to take a categorical decision in relation to an applicant for public housing.  In relation to the question of employment exchanges the same applies and I repeat it in relation to a whole range of services.  This creates a great many problems.  People write learned articles about the price we pay for proportional representation but perhaps the wasteful competition that exists because of proportional representation in a multi-seat constituency contributes to some of our difficulties.  Perhaps the dependency which exists explains the clientalism that is at the back of our practices. However, there is a deficient <Col N="512" /> complaints mechanism in the country and the Ombudsman's office has been a very important contribution to redressing that balance in favour of the citizen <i>vis-á-vis</i> the State.  For that reason we should all welcome the fact that the office has been able to function so well.</P>
    <P>I agree with what the Minister said about the obstructions placed in the way of the early operation of the office.  If the office is to function it requires co-operation from everybody and in that regard we are not addressing any pious aspiration.  The view of the Oireachtas has been explicit and has been voted upon.  We require that co-operation. There is a tragic element in the report in many ways and that is that the greatest volume of complaints are in the area of social welfare and in the area of delays. What that is telling us if we extend it is that those with the least capacity to survive delays are those who are carrying the greatest burden of the features of bureaucratic centralism and of the whole question of hierarchy and abuse of authority. All of the features of the central state I mentioned are duplicated at the level of the local state and the local authority system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent events in South Africa have disturbed most parliamentarians and abhorrence at what is taking place has been expressed at a number of international fora.  The European Community has conveyed to the South African Government its concern at the proposed hanging of Benjamin Moloise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to this poet is that he was sentenced to death in June 1983 for the alleged murder of a black security policeman.  I do not want to go into the details of the case.  It is true that a unit of the African National Congress responsible has stated that he had nothing to do directly with the events that took place.  In this House we have all expressed our views previously in relation to hanging as a barbaric punishment that challenges our very claim to be a civilised people and on that aspect alone we should condemn what is proposed.  I also <Col N="514" /> feel that it is little less than minimal consistency with the position taken by succesive Irish Governments and the position represented at home, at the United Nations and at the European Community by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs that we are opposed to the system of apartheid.  There is no doubt whatsoever that this hanging is being viewed as an exemplary action by the South African authorities against the opponents of apartheid.  It is used to intimidate and terrorise them.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be well aware of the events that have ensued as a result of the announced intention of Mr. Botha to proceed with the execution of Benjamin Moloise.  On October 15 he refused a petition for a re-trial despite the fact the new evidence had become available.  The events which have followed that have resulted in three youths being shot by the police, another man being burned to death after canisters of tear gas had been thrown into his house some of which set the house on fire and of 20 people being injured.  Among those injured were very young people, aged eight and ten, and one dead person was the young age of 15 years.</P>
    <P>These are pieces of emotional colour to a tragic situation in which the authorities are seeking to repress the black majority in South Africa.  It is disgraceful that in 1985 we are now witnessing the convulsions of a racist system in South Africa.  We are witnessing the use of naked force and intimidation against a black majority but in the proposed hanging of this man we find all these events focused and sharpened.  It is as if the whole thrust of our foreign policy is focused by what is being proposed.  In the most appealing form of death which is proposed, that of hanging, we have a sordid illustration of the besieged Government of South Africa and the desperate ends to which it will go.  The State's further acts of aggression against the black majority in South Africa are having the resultant deaths and injuries of which we read.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="515" /> I should like to say how much I appreciate the reports in <i>The Irish Times</i> in bringing these matters to the attention of the Irish public who are very interested in the events in southern Africa.  I am very appreciative of the information they are providing for us.  To think that tomorrow morning somebody can be hanged like this in the atmosphere that we know southern Africa represents at the present time is a great moral moment for all of us and I do not think that civilised people anywhere in the world can be untouched by it.  It is as if some great tragedy was being acted out.  In many ways this gesture by the South African Government has pushed all the debate about southern Africa past all the niceties of the discussion about whether sanctions will work or the consequences of sanctions or whatever.  What we are witnessing is the barbarous defence of a totally unjustifiable position.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased the Irish position within the context of the European Community is to join with the Community in expressing a request to the South African Government to think again about their action.  What is very significant is that at international fora all over the world a similar expression has been made and parliamentarians and bodies and international groups have equally requested Mr. Botha.  It is an indication of the stubborn desperation of the regime in South Africa that they refuse to listen to any of these.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that so many Senators wish to speak on this matter.  The purpose of the Seanad expressing its concern is that the Dáil is not in session.  While I have every confidence in how we will administer this matter through the Department of Foreign Affairs, it is important that the elected representatives in this island speak out, let us hope before it is too late, to add their voice to the voice of civilised people all over the world who are objecting to what is taking place.  Whatever result may come of it, it is something we should do.  We should execute our common resolution by seeking to contact privately, institutionally and politically, every body and every <Col N="516" /> institution that we think might bring pressure to bear to ask the South African Government to step back from this barbarous action.  I thank the Chair for facilitating discussion of this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have the opportunity to discuss this matter in the House.  It is a matter of major importance for a number of reasons.  I am glad that the atmosphere in the House is one of support for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers in the EC who have expressed a viewpoint which is similar to that expressed by Senator Higgins here.  What we are trying to do is to reinforce the arguments put forward by the EC against this hanging.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the world we live in has increasingly become more right wing.  In this world extreme right wing attitudes are growing.  An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth attitude is beginning to emerge.  We have extreme militant Moslems, Evangelists, hot gospellers in the United States, the emergence of people like Falwell and the emergence of right wing Governments who think they can ride rough shod over other people.  I think the South African Government in this instance are saying that, irrespective of international abhorrence for what they are about to do, they will go ahead and hang Benjamin Moloise.  That is a symbolic hanging.  It is not the hanging of a person; it is a hanging of the ideals for which he stands.  The easiest thing in the world is to stop the dissemination of ideas and by killing Benjamin Moloise, the South African Government think they will kill the ideas and the ideals of the black majority in South Africa.  They are going against history when they attempt this.  Apartheid has been called a crime against humanity, and that is exactly what it is.  It was suggested by another man in another place that not alone is this a crime but it is a blunder, and it will be seen more as a blunder than as a crime when we think of it in the international context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scenes from South Africa over the past number of months have been <Col N="517" /> horrific.  The rights of the black and nonwhite South African people are being totally ignored.  We had horrific scenes on television last night of a truck being escorted by South African police driving through a township and coming under attack &mdash; I am not too sure if attack is the right word &mdash; and young people throwing stones at this vehicle.  On its return the sides of the vehicle were let down and suddenly armed marksmen appeared from the back of the vehicle and they killed women and children quite deliberately and in front of international television.  This is the regime that suggests that this poet should be hanged for his alleged part in a murder in 1983.  The ANC have categorically stated that he had no part in that killing and they named the people who did take part in that episode. One of the things revolutionary groups do is admit when they take part in an unpalatable act.  When certain telephone calls come to the newspapers in Ireland from &ldquo;Mr. Black&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mr. White&rdquo; the pressmen realise they are coming from sources which can be trusted.  In this instance the ANC have said quite categorically that this man had nothing to do with the events of 1983.</P>
    <P>I hope everybody in this House will support the motion before us.  It has not been proposed only for humanitarian reasons but in the hope that the South African Government might, even at this late stage, change their minds.  It is not in any sense a criticism of the Minister for Foreign Affairs; it is not a criticism of the Irish Government because we have seen the efforts they have made through the EC to try and get this situation changed. It is a response in humanitarian terms to an injustice which, if allowed to happen, will be rued by the South African Government as long as they stay in power.  Please God this hanging will not take place.  It might keep the South African Government from the brink of the disruption which is inevitable unless they pull back and give the black majority the rights to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I am thankful that the Cathaoirleach allowed this motion and I am glad the <Col N="518" /> Minister came in to listen to this debate. I thank Senator Higgins for bringing forward this motion.</P>

We should be careful that we do not officially appear to be interfering in the course of justice in another country, because we have our own problems here, the killing of a policeman is always a serious affair.  But there seem to be many question marks over the system in Africa.  The African National Congress seem to be making statements that would suggest that this man is an innocent victim.  This man has grown up in an atmosphere where Africans are victimised in their own country and I appeal to the Minister to ask the South African authorities to commute the sentence and have a new trial. We feel a sense of shame that any person could be hanged in this day and age in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>Mr. Botha has mentioned reform and has said they are prepared to do something about it.  This would certainly be a first sign that he was going to do something about it and it would give credence to his words.  I do not know if we can believe everything we hear about South Africa.  I have never been there and I have no first-hand information, but I have no reason to doubt that the stories and horrific pictures we have seen.  We are told that the only way those being executed or their relatives know when any execution will take place is when the prisoner gets a different meal the night before.  If that is the position, it is horrible. I ask the Minister to do what he can to save this man's life.  We would all be the better for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senator Higgins for bringing this matter to our attention at the very last moment. Otherwise we might have let this day pass without dealing with this horrific subject in such an emergency climate.  I spent a year &mdash; 1966-67 &mdash; in South Africa in black non-European hospitals and I know that since then there have been considerable changes in what is known as petty apartheid, but even so there has been practically no change in the way in which in mind the black people are looked upon by the whites.  However, in those 20 years the black people have become much more conscious of their power, much more conscious of the injustice to which they have been subjected and much more conscious of the immutable forces that have thus far been held against them.</P>
      <P>On the other side, we have the white fear of the minority colonial rule man who fears the sudden swift change to majority indigenous rule and all that that means for him in terms of victory or defeat.  We have a great sense of potential violence in South Africa and, no matter what we do, it seems highly unlikely that the next few years in South Africa can be got through without a considerable amount of violence, State force and paramilitary force.</P>
      <P>In a recent letter I wrote to a newspaper about the need to release Nelson Mandela &mdash; this was following an interview I had had with a great friend of mine who had come from Soweto &mdash; I mentioned two things.  I said:</P>
      <P>The black people are not to be satisfied by living in a society sanatised for them by whites.  They wish to determine, as equals, the form of their own society.  To do this, they will settle for nothing less than the power that is necessary and which, thus far, has been denied them through the exercise of State violence and force.</P>
      <P>In the last paragraph I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like most States, South Africa was created by violence and force and has been sustained by them.  Representatives with State guns behind them must <Col N="520" /> now be prepared to have dialogue with all of those who can show they have a mandate even if such a mandate is from people who hold anti-State guns.</P>
    <P>I added as an aside: &ldquo;Perhaps there is a message in all of this for Ireland too&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We cannot talk about Ireland in the context of South Africa because although our problem does not seem to be so vicious &mdash; at least not yet &mdash; it is much more longlived.  The South African problem, which is potentially much more violent in the immediate future, has been a more shortlived problem because in the last century &mdash; as Senators know &mdash; the great trek took place in which the Boers went north because the British colonial interest was pushing them in that direction and they in turn pushed the blacks &mdash; the Zulus &mdash; further north.</P>
    <P>We had various conflicts.  We had the introduction of the British in the 1820s and at the beginning of this century we had the Boer War.  I mention that to remind Senators that Irish people fought with the Boers &mdash; President Botha should be reminded of this today by cable &mdash; against colonialism.  He should now consider 80 years on what the black people feel like when subjected to the internal colonialism of today.</P>
    <P>When we come to this particular case, we have heard Senator Higgins outline its background, we have to consider, are we for or against the death penalty in the modern world.  Is there an alternative, even if this man was guilty of what the State accuses him?  But the State must remember that there are consequences, if you violate someone, you reap the guilt and remorse ultimately and in the meantime you have got to seek justification for your act through falsifying the wholeness of that man's or group's identity in order to keep one's own sanity.</P>
    <P>There is another point which was alluded to.  When a person is executed who in his being represents a whole mode of thought, a whole way that a group has of looking, a world view, a national view, one is not only eliminating one person, one is trampling on the feelings of a whole people.  This is the danger because if one <Col N="521" /> tramples on the feelings of people in a volatile situation such as South Africa, then, inevitably, one incurs their wrath. There are far too many black people in South Africa for the whites to be complacent about incurring their wrath any more than they have already done so.</P>
    <P>This summer an ex-president of the Chamber of Mines in Rhodesia and in South West Africa, married to a cousin, visited our home and told me that much change had taken place in South Africa. I said, &ldquo;Bill, I am sorry to say it but because of the record of oppression the little change you have created will create a demand which you will never be able to keep ahead of&rdquo;.  About five or six weeks later I heard on the radio on a Sunday the wonderful voice of a Zulu girl &mdash; I cannot mention her name for obvious reasons &mdash; who had come from Soweto. I made contact with her.  I had not seen her for some 12 or 14 years and then I remembered her as a bright, vivacious person who wanted to engage the whites in dialogue because she knew that the white people had much to give her and she wanted to share with them the light of Africa which was in her soul with them. She arrived in the North a determined single-minded person who would no longer have any truck with compromise short of complete change in the régime in South Africa.  About three weeks later the first man, having returned to South Africa and having seen for himself the first riots erupt, wrote that at aged 70 he had got to acknowledge that this is the product of years or generations of resentment that we must now address ourselves to.</P>
    <P>The South African Government will not address itself to that by executing this young poet.  I suggest that we as Irish people could do them a service by reminding them of what has happened in this country when young men were executed for their political viewpoints and, more so, were executed when they had the poetry and the soul of their country embodied in their own.  These things President Botha needs to be reminded of to help them out of the fierce dilemmas <Col N="522" /> which they face.  Do not let us forget that to be president of a minority government in a situation like that in South Africa would be a challenge which few of us could rise to.  Let us not forget then that the blacks are utterly resolved and that South Africa will have to work out some day how the various tribal, European and Asian groupings can live together.  It will not be accommodated by that change from minority colonial rule to majority indigenous rule; it will have to go beyond that.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, propose in the time available to us and through the media &mdash; which I would say are fairly thinly represented on the ground, one of the sadnesses of Ireland &mdash; that while we have not got a press release, for the time is not available for such, we should send cables, telephone messages directed at three fronts, to every churchman known to any person this evening living in South Africa, to any person known to us living in South Africa and, finally, to the Government.  Before coming up here I listed those in the Government to whom one might address onself: the President and Prime Minister, Mr. P.W. Botha; the Minister for Transport, Mr. H. Schoeman, the Minister for Constitutional Development and Planning, Mr. Heunis; the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr. de Klerk; the Minister for Law and Order, Mr. le Grange; the Minister for Public Works, Mr. Munnik; the Minister for Health and Welfare, Mr. Van der Merve; the Minister for Co-operation and Development, Dr. Veljohn; the Minister for Defence, General Malan; the Minister for Manpower, Mr. du Plessis; the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Dr. de Villiers; the Minister for Justice, Mr. Coetsee; the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Wentzel; the Minister for Minerals and Energy, Dr. Steyn; the Minister for Finance, Mr. du Plessis; the Minister for Environment and Tourism, Mr. Wiley; the Chairman for the Ministerial Council for Coloured Affairs, Mr. Hundrichse; and the Chairman of the Ministerial Council for Indian Affairs, Mr. A. Rajbansi.  Finally, I will read a cable that I dispatched on my own <Col N="523" /> account, as I felt that time was running short, to President Botha before coming up the stairs here.</P>
    <P>Sickened by the intention to execute Benjamin Moloise, I appeal to you at this late hour to peer into your soul and feeling for the conscience of your children and of your people and of their children to come to ask what future for them if you go through with this obscene act of vengeance.</P>
    <P>I implore you, for the sake of your own minority people if not in the name of justice, to reaffirm hope for life against death through the exercise of mercy with courage by revoking the decision to execute.  I know your country and its people well for I worked among them.  For the sake of them all, commute this sentence.</P>
    <P>I have much pleasure in supporting Senator Michael D. Higgins's motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very hard contribution to follow, nevertheles I will follow it.  I will start by quoting from a poem called &ldquo;The Plea,&rdquo; which I wrote in 1961 on the question of apartheid and what the world should be doing about it.  It is as follows:</P>
      <P>Come ye to my land afar</P>
      <P>And from my bondage set me free</P>
      <P>Wait not for word of yes</P>
      <P>From a brigand power that be</P>
      <P>Hasten to my call lest the race be lost</P>
      <P>For I have fear, that somewhere near</P>
      <P>There is a ghost that stalks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was an anti-apartheid activist around that time and, having regard to some of the things that went on, it is true to say that the cry from the Irish about the injustices of apartheid is not a new one. However, other nations did not listen to the pleas &mdash; I do not refer specifically to my plea which was very limited and only published in a very small organ of the media &mdash; which might have prevented the rebellion we are now witnessing.  Over 25 years ago people were trying to advise nations on the part they could play in <Col N="524" /> preventing this rebellion occurring. Great nations such as Britain and America with trading investments in South Africa are now giving a greater response to this plea than they gave 24 years ago. However, one wonders whether there is any point in making a plea to a person of the nature of Prime Minister Botha who rules over the country by force.  That is the simplest way of putting it.  They have not learned from the lessons of Rhodesia and they did not listen to the pleas of the world in relation to apartheid.</P>
    <P>I understand the problem facing the Prime Minister because his party and his supporters have allowed the situation to develop in a way which has put him in an impossible position.  If the President does too much too fast he will have a major problem with the whites and if he goes too slowly the rebellion will take off much faster and we will see many atrocities being committed by both sides in the name of justice.  If the Prime Minister does not commute the sentence of this man not only is he ignoring the pleas of the world but he is ignoring advice handed down through the years that the way to make haste is to go slowly.  The Prime Minister will embark on a road which will cause more hurt, mostly to the coloured people, and he will spark off more problems for himself and the inevitable will happen that much faster.</P>
    <P>One speaker said that some responsible association had cast a doubt on whether or not this person was present at the scene of the crime and that makes it much more serious.  We are at the moment discussing the abolition of capital punishment and there is a broad consensus of opinion here against the principle of capital punishment.  If this execution goes ahead tomorrow there will be more brutal slayings.  People who are denied the fruits of their labours in the crudest possible way in their own country will inevitably get to the point where they will either destroy themselves or topple the force that gives effect to this oppression.  While we are waiting for this to happen the brutal slayings and assassinations will go on.  In the long run we will get back to the point of accepting <Col N="525" /> that ruthlessness brings ruthless results. When one uses ruthless force to suppress all sorts of dissent one is asking for trouble. If the President does not commute this sentence he will throw more oil on the fire.  Apart from the political side we must look at the question of hanging.  To hang a prson can only heighten feeling. It would be all right in Ireland to say that one is making a martyr out of a person and make a case for it in that way but most of the coloured people in Africa, particularly the blacks, are close to martyrdom and indeed, seem to be inviting it on themselves.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Botha has been very foolish.  If he has not caution and does not try to get out of his present dilemma, power through the muzzle of the gun will prevail rather than the reforms brought about by justice and the meaningful dialogue that leads to justice.  His conduct is strange in the face of a world movement against capital punishment.</P>
    <P>A perusal of the Official Report of the Seanad will reveal that I have listed a substantial number of countries which have abolished capital punishment within their boundaries.  Evidence has been produced to the effect that capital punishment is not a deterrent to serious crime. Therefore, it is strange that in South Africa, in the face of this world movement and doubt as to whether such punishment is a deterrent, Mr. Botha intends to take this revenge tomorrow.  The people will see this death as an incentive towards more rioting and they will suffer further.  I join with my colleagues here in making the plea in the name of humanity that the Prime Minister of South Africa. will commute this sentence not alone because of the nature of apartheid but in the name of humanity and the world movement against capital punishment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Higgins and other Senators who spoke here today.  I am conscious that Senator John Browne has spoken and expressed the views and wishes of the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad.  We felt it was important that at <Col N="526" /> least two of our Members should express views and I would like to add my voice to what the other Members had to say on this matter.</P>
      <P>There is a tremendous turbulence in the whole of southern Africa concerning the future political structure under which that country will be governed and the division of political responsibility and economic prosperity between the members of the various races there.  The grotesque pictures which we see of the confrontation between the black people of South Africa and Government supporters and arms of the law are constant daily reminders of the depth of the problem in that area and the gulf of understanding which separates the white people in that part of the world from the realities of life in the 20th century.  They have withdrawn into a &ldquo;never-never&rdquo; land in which they think they can hold back the tide of equality of humanity. They are failing to face realities.  As Senator Robb suggested, the difficulty is that when you get yourself into such a situation it becomes increasingly difficult to satisfy people with moderate reform.  The violent confrontation which we are now seeing is the natural and logical consequence of the iniquitous situation in that country, over all the years of my life anyway.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that this is just one of a whole series of capital punishments which we cannot accept as being normal and a standard part of humanity or criminal systems in this day and age.  I would be opposed to the execution of any other person in South Africa as I am against the execution of this young man.  It does not do anything for the atmosphere in South Africa except to poison it probably to a far greater extent than does the killing of people in the street.  It is not seen to be the emotional or instinctive response of somebody acting on the ground but to be a more institutionalised approach and as such in the political atmosphere there has a more fundamental effect on the political realities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am opposed to the use of capital <Col N="527" /> punishment in any conceivable set of circumstances in the 20th century.  In the delicate political climate which exists in South Africa to start using capital punishment is nothing short of criminal lunacy when, if it is felt necessary to penalise anyone, perfectly sensible and good alternatives are available.</P>
    <P>Whether this man committed the crimes involved is not the centre or core point I am making.  The use of capital punishment at all in the context of southern Africa is itself counterproductive and likely to give rise to a greater number of deaths in the approaching revolutionary changes in that country.  There are other places in the world where executions have been carried out.  A man was executed in the United States yesterday. I wonder how many people noticed that.  I consider that to be totally unnecessary also in that society.  Against that background I want to support very strongly the sentiments expressed by Senator Higgins and to lend my support to any and every effort which I know the Minister and his colleagues will be making in this matter over the next 24 hours and the many contributions and efforts that they have made in the recent past.</P>
    <P>Any of us who have any connection with South Africa should take up the suggestion of Senator Robb and use it to the best possible effect, not only in respect of this case but generally in respect of the problems facing that country which need a steady hand and a sensible approach in order to minimise the difficulties which people of all races, black, white and coloured, are going to face over the next few years there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the sentiments expressed during this debate.  I congratulate Senator Higgins for raising this matter and I thank the Minister and all those who have made it possible to have this debate at such short notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to express my personal horror at the idea that this man is to be hanged tomorrow in South Africa not only because it is capital punishment but also because it is symbolic of what we <Col N="528" /> are debating, of the continuous series of capital punishments and the system of justice which exists there, which &mdash; I gather from this debate &mdash; all in this House will unanimously condemn.</P>
    <P>On a word of discord I should say that I find it a little ironic that we should have a unanimous condemnation in this House of a capital punishment to-morrow when this House continuously refuses to give time to the abolition of capital punishment in this country.  There is a Bill before this House to do this, a Bill which has been on the Order Paper for at least a year.  I find it hypocritical and totally wrong that people, with the most genuine motives &mdash; I do not question anybody's motives here today but it is an emotional moment &mdash; should come forward and unanimously condemn what is happening in another country &mdash; which is undoubtedly wrong &mdash; but will themselves refuse at any stage to give time for a Bill, for which many of us have asked time in this House and which has been refused, to abolish capital punishment here.  Capital punishment is on the Statute Book in this country and as long as it is on the Statute Book it could be used.  Whether or not we condemn capital punishment in South Africa, which I do, I believe that perhaps &mdash; I know it is not specifically the Minister's brief &mdash; as a result of this very moving, very sensible and very constructive debate here today we might have a response from the Minister about our intentions in relation to capital punishment on our Statute Book because we cannot really condemn the practice of it in another country while it still exists here.  I believe that the effects of this motion, unfortunately, will probably not stop the execution of this man or other men in South Africa, but South Africa is sensitive at this stage to international opinion, it is sensitive to the opinions and condemnations of both East and West on matters like this.  We are chipping away and playing a constructive role by putting down this motion and by passing it unanimously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me state at the outset that <Col N="529" /> the Government shares the concern of Senators reflected in the tabling of this motion concerning Mr. Benjamin Moloise who has been condemned to the executed in South Africa tomorrow and I welcome this opportunity to put this concern on record.  I wish to advise the House that the Ten, together with Spain and Portugal made a <i>démarche</i> to the South African authorities earlier today appealing to the authorities.  On humanitarian grounds, not to execute Mr. Moloise.  A similar <i>démarche</i> was made in this case last year and the Ten, along with Spain and Portugal, have been following his fate with great concern.</P>
      <P>Senators will be familiar with the main features of Mr. Moloise's case, some of them were outlined earlier.  Condemned to death in 1983 for the 1982 murder of a policeman near Johannesburg, he recently admitted, through his lawyers, that he had been involved in the crime, although the ANC have consistently claimed he was not involved.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government, while not condoning the crime Mr. Moloise was convicted of, are of the view that it cannot be viewed in isolation from the system of oppression which has been established in South Africa.  This case raises the question of the relations between those inside and outside the political process itself, of the injustice inherent in the system of apartheid itself.  Mr. Moloise's case has to be viewed against the background of the frustration felt by the majority community in South Africa, their alienation from the political process, the impossibility of achieving advancement or social justice under the system of apartheid.  At a time when the Government in Pretoria have claimed to be interested in and committed to reform, but have as yet shown no serious effort to move in that direction, cases such as that of Mr. Moloise are bound to call for very close examination among the international community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to be hoped that the South African Government, with the eyes of the world focused on them as never before in recent months will at this late hour relent and commute the sentence on Mr. Moloise. <Col N="530" /> I congratulate Senator Robb on what he has done.  There is an example which many other people could legitimately follow.  We do not have direct diplomatic relations with South Africa, not as a matter of convenience but as a matter of deliberate policy.  Individuals can do a lot in this regard, other than what he intends to do &mdash; we do not have a day left now, there are only hours left &mdash; and continue to do among the Ten.  This would be one signal that the Government are prepared to re-examine their position and that the talk of reform in the system is not just words.  It would also be a humanitarian gesture and a positive gesture to the majority community, not a sign of weakness. Senator O'Leary said capital punishment is never right.  The attention of this House is focused on this particular hanging which is to take place tomorrow. Senator O'Leary said there was one execution in America yesterday, but in South Africa last year 115 people were hanged.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps appropriate to take stock and to remind the House what it is that Ireland as an interested observer wishes to see come about in South Africa.  The answer at once is an unequivocal one &mdash; the abolition of the iniquitous system of apartheid and the emergence in South Africa in its place of democratic and multi-racial society that would harness the energies and considerable wealth and potential of that country for the benefit of all its inhabitants and not just a small minority.  In such a society cases such as that of Mr. Moloise, or the many other embittered and alienated persons whom we have seen on television in recent months in violent conflict with the security forces, would not exist &mdash; including the incident which has been on television for the last 36 hours and which has been referred to by two or three speakers here this evening.</P>
    <P>Ireland is committed to doing what it can to help bring about such a society by peaceful means.  The policy of this Government, and previous ones, has aimed at doing this.  This policy has been characterised by action on a national level and by action multilaterally, through our <Col N="531" /> membership of the European Community and the United Nations.  There has been considerable publicity recently about the actions taken by Ireland, and the Community, as a means of bringing pressure to bear on South Africa.  It is therefore appropriate now to look briefly at the measures Ireland has taken.</P>
    <P>The European Community agreed in September on a set of measures both positive and restrictive to be taken in common, with the aim of giving a political signal to South Africa concerning the depth of feeling of the Community about what has been happening in that country. These measures included some with little relevance to Ireland, such as the recall of military attaches and some with considerable relevance, such as the discouraging of sporting contacts, and the cessation of exports of sensitive equipment which might be destined for the South African security forces.  The measures agreed were not intended to be a substitute for sanctions or other stronger measures. The measures were regarded as a minimum and the Ten in their statement specifically referred to the fact that the question of other measures, including sanctions remained.  The measures were designed to make clear, in unambiguous terms, the seriousness with which the Ten viewed the situation in South Africa and the need for the abolition of the apartheid system in that country and the opening of a genuine dialogue with the representatives of the black majority population.</P>
    <P>Nationally, Ireland has set these Community measures against the background of our own measures.  Thus, with reference to the Community measures, Ireland for some time has not encouraged contacts with South African officials nor encouraged contacts of a cultural nature with South African groups favouring apartheid.  In the area of sport Ireland actively discourages sporting contacts with South Africa, withdraws finance from sporting bodies persisting in such contacts, and has indicated that entry into Ireland will be denied to South African sporting terms or individuals seeking to complete or play in Ireland in a representative capacity.  Ireland strictly enforces <Col N="532" /> the terms of the United Nations mandatory arms embargo under Security Council Resolution 418 (1977).  No arms or related material are exported to South Africa and the Government use their licensing powers to ensure that nothing which might be considered as suitable for military application will be exported.  In the area of computer sales, for example, assurances are sought that the goods exported are not destined for use by the South African Security Forces.</P>
    <P>In addition to the set of measures agreed in Luxembourg, in the political sphere Ireland does not, as a matter of policy, have diplomatic relations with South Africa.  The Government do not encourage Irish people to travel to South Africa as tourists, on business or as emigrants. Ireland does not encourage trade with South Africa and State or semi-State dealings with South Africa are avoided. Thus, bodies such as CTT, the IDA and Aer Lingus do not operate in South Africa.  In this context also, the Minister for Health directed in September 1984 that health agencies here should not deal with South African agencies or purchase goods of South African origin.  Under exchange controls the import and sale of kruggerands is effectively prevented. There are no civil aviation links between Ireland and South Africa.</P>
    <P>As far as the positive measures agreed by the Ten are concerned, the Irish Government already pursue a policy of assisting victims of apartheid.  Through co-financing of schemes with non-governmental agencies, humanitarian aid is provided for victims of apartheid within South Africa.  The Government have also this year made money available to two funds which help to provide legal defence in political trials in South Africa and Namibia, the International Defence and Aid Fund and the Asingeni Fund of the South African Council of Churches.  Ireland also provides aid to SADCC, the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference.</P>
    <P>On the wider question of sanctions, Ireland has always supported the imposition by the UN Security Council of effective mandatory sanctions on South <Col N="533" /> Africa as a means of applying pressure to end apartheid.  In 1984 Ireland cosponsored a resolution to this effect at the UN General Asembly and has previously co-sponsored resolutions urging the imposition of an oil embargo and a ban on new investments in South Africa.  The position of the Government has always been that Ireland supports the idea of selective graduated and mandatory sanctions properly imposed by the Security Council in accordance with the charter of the United Nations and fully implemented.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest hope, and I know it is a hope shared by those here today, that the whole sordid chapter of apartheid will soon be a thing of the past in the history of South Africa and of the world.  The Government in South Africa can be under no illusion as to the opprobrium in which they are regarded by the rest of the world.  The measures that we have taken, that other countries have taken, have been designed to convey that message and to push and prod the Government there to effect meaningful change. An act of mercy at this time, affecting <Col N="534" /> Mr. Benjamin Moloise, would be a sign that the Government in Pretoria have come to terms at last with their responsibilities to end the brutal cycle of violence and repression that is a product of the apartheid system.  I call on that Government there to make that gesture and to give that sign today.</P>
