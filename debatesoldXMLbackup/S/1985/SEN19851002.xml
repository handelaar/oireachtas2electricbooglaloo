      <P>I have notice from Senator Catherine McGuinness that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The failure of the Department of Education to provide for proper educational facilities for a profoundly deaf child who resides in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4. No. 1 the Nurses Bill, 1984, has been debated for a while and it is anticipated that Second Stage should finish reasonably quickly.  The proposal then would be to take Committee Stage on 16 October.  Item No. 2 relates to the registration of electors, the implementation of the provision made by a recent Act for giving votes in parliamentary elections to British citizens.  The principle has been agreed already and it is not anticipated that this should occupy <Col N="232" /> much time.  Accordingly, there should be time for a substantial amount of debate on item No. 3 up to 5.30.  It is proposed to suspend the sitting from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and at 6.30 to take up No. 4.</P>

      <P>I notice that the Leader of the House said it is intended to take Committee Stage of the Nurses Bill in two weeks time.  Does that imply that the House is not sitting for another two weeks after today?  If it does, perhaps the Leader of the House could tell us why, because there is plenty of business on the Order Paper, including a motion on marital breakdown, which we could sit tomorrow to discuss, and which we could sit next week to discuss.  I do not understand, if we are not sitting for two weeks, why we are not sitting for two weeks, There are Bills and motions on the Order Paper.  There is a very important motion on divorce on the Order Paper which for some reason we do not seem to be able to discuss for two weeks.  My guess is that on No. 3 today we will have perhaps an hour or an hour-and-a-half, and possibly one speaker.  What I would like to know is, if that motion is as important as the Government are maintaining why we cannot discuss it tomorrow or next week?</P>

      <P>I would certainly be in favour of our meeting this day week or indeed tomorrow but certainly not later than this day week, to continue the debate on the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  There are a number of Members of this House who wish to contribute to that debate and full time should be given for that purpose.  I should like to refer to another motion on the Order Paper and that is motion No. 29.  This is an unusual motion in one sense.  It is a motion calling on Seanad Éireann to note with concern the practice of strip searching women prisoners which has been in operation in Armagh since November 1982 and in particular to note the manner in which the strip searches have been carried out and the frequency with which women prisoners, including remand prisoners, have been subjected to such strip searches.  This has caused <Col N="233" /> serious distress and humiliation to the women affected.  It calls on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to raise the matter formally with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The unusual and unique feature of this motion is that it is in the names of women Senators from the different political parties and indeed from Senator McGuinness as an Independent Senator.  It has the names of four or five women Senators in the House and it has the strong support of the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  She did not sign the motion at the time because she was acting Cathaoirleach of the House. On behalf of the proposals in support of this motion I should like to ask the Leader of the House if it would be possible to have an early date for this motion.  I appreciate that it does not quite fit into the mould of either coming from a particular political party or coming from purely the Independents as such.  The issue is an important one.  It is something that is debated widely outside both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There has not been any debate in Parliament on it.  It is important that the House be afforded an early opportunity to debate the motion and I would welcome some indication as to when it might be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse fully and support what Senator Mary Robinson has just said.  This is an important matter and could become an even more emotive issue than it is at present.  I certainly feel that it should be debated at the earliest possible convenience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support what Senator Robinson has said.  This is a very important matter concerning human dignity. I should like to remind the House that the British security forces some years back were found guilty of inhuman and degrading conduct almost approaching torture.  Strip searching is inhuman and degrading and I support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if at all possible we bring forward a discussion on that motion.  As has been said, it is a <Col N="234" /> matter which concerns many people.  It is a degrading practice and the sooner we can show our concern that it should be stopped as soon as possible, the better. We would support the bringing forward of that motion at the earliest time possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There are signatures to this representing all the parties but I want to assure the House that the Members of the Labour Party would like if this motion were taken as soon as possible.  We are asking the Leader of the House to try to fit it into the business of the House and ensure that it is ordered in such a way that a debate can start on this very important resolution.  From the Labour Party's point of view we are anxious that it would be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised on the Order of Business. There is the general point of when the House should sit again.  I should like to point out that it has been the custom of the House that the House would come together when there was legislation to be discussed and other matters are taken at the same time.  It would not be appropriate, if the Nurses Bill is passed today, that Committee Stage should be ordered for next week.  There have been a number of representations from a number of organisations in regard to it.  Two weeks is the appropriate time for a large and in places technical measure such as this to be considered before Committee Stage. I would like to emphasise that the position is that the only legislation that is passing through the House at the moment would not be ready to be dealt with next week.  There is no other legislation coming through from Dáil Eireann because of course this House resumed business one month earlier than the Dáil is due to resume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of whether the House should meet specially in order to continue the debate on No. 3, that is a matter for the House to decide.  I will <Col N="235" /> have discussions in the course of the day in order to find out what the attitude is. I had discussions with representatives of all the groups in the Seanad last week in regard to this question.  There was agreement, certainly there was no serious objection, to the House adjourning for two weeks, and then coming back to take Committee Stage of the Nurses Bill and to continue with the motion.</P>
    <P>In regard to this motion, I have taken the attitude that I have no desire to stifle the debate.  I want to see the widest possible debate.  This motion was originally put down as a Private Members' motion. That would have involved three hours of a debate.  We have already had twice that amount of time allocated to it.  It was taken over as a Government motion, allowing Senators to speak for longer than the paltry 15 minutes that would have been available if it had been done in any other way.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government side of the House I have facilitated there being a thorough debate on this topic.  It is far more important that we should debate this matter thoroughly.  It is far more important that the report of the joint committee should be given solid consideration by this House than that we should rush the question of voting in order to satisfy the curiosity of people either inside or outside the House as to how particular Senators are going to vote on this issue.</P>
    <P>The problem is an important one; it will receive the fullest possible debate in the House.  I do not think there will be undue delay.  I believe that even without the House meeting next week it will be possible for us to do full justice to that excellent report produced by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, for every Senator to be able to take part fully in this debate and still for the debate to conclude before the end of the month. My view is that there is not great urgency in this matter.  I undertake to have consultations and the position is that no matter what I propose at 8 o'clock this evening it is a matter for the House to determine when it will meet again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> In regard to item No. 29 this is, as Senator Robinson has pointed out, a motion which has been signed by members of more than one group.  For that reason I initiated some consultations, though not complete consultations, as to whether this motion should have been taken before we started a new round of motions, taking each of our groups in order.  I will now have further consultations to see whether this can be taken at an early date.  But there is one thing that I would like to say here in regard to it.  The motion calls on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to raise this matter formally with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  I want to assure the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs does not have to wait for a resolution of this House in order to raise this matter.  My understanding is that the matter has been raised to good effect; that there still is this practice of strip searching which is a matter of such concern but that the manner and the frequency is not as serious as when this motion was put down.  But I will have consultations and I would be willing at an appropriate time to have this motion, which is <i>sui generis,</i> taken so that the House can debate the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not let this opportunity pass without expressing sympathy to the family of the late Tim McAuliffe who was a respected Member of this House for many years and whose daughter Helena is a respected Member of the House, I should like to have it on the record that we appreciate the work he did and the work of the McAuliffe family for this House.</P>

    <Title>Nurses Bill, 1984: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally this Bill is most welcome in bringing our law in line <Col N="237" /> with modern developments and in rectifying the EC position.  I propose to confine my remarks to the provision I see central to the Bill, namely, the disciplinary powers and procedures.  I hope my brief remarks will be helpful.</P>
      <P>The nurses profession is a very large and vulnerable one.  Their vulnerability stems from the nature of their duties and their position in employment.  Nurses are in daily contact with people who have emotional and physical problems, often interlinked.  Their conduct in regard to their duties can be easily called in question under the terms of this Bill.  Section 38 allows An Bord Altranais or any person to apply to the fitness to practise committee for an inquiry into the fitness of a nurse to practise on the grounds of (a) alleged professional misconduct or (b) alleged physical or mental disability. The right to petition to any member of the public is a wide power which unless controlled can be abused.  It has been the experience of other professions that it is abused by unreasonable people.  Nurses could be open to complaints from the emotionally disturbed, hypochondriacs and cranks.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the types of misconduct should be spelt out by regulations so that nurses and complainants know where they stand.  It should also be laid down that a person making a complaint should have to produce substantial support and evidence.  There should be spelt out a process for screening and for complaints. Complainants who fail to justify their complaint should be required to apologise and pay for the waste of time involved.  If it is shown that a complaint was malicious the complainant should be open to criminal and civil procedures.  A nurse's good name should be protected at all costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions of employment of nurses are vague in many regards.  They are the front line troops for health boards, matrons and doctors.  The nature of their responsibilities are often very vague.  For example, what is the conscience position of nurses?  Look at the sterilisation position and look at the <Col N="238" /> Dunne's Stores position.  These positions should be clearly set out so as to ensure no misunderstanding in regard to life and limb can be involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is the position of a nurse who is asked to assist at a D and C which she believes may be a subterfuge for and abortion.</P>
    <P>Indirectly, on the question of conduct and standards, the Bill should place a duty on nurses to undertake continuing education and possibly continual assessment so as to ensure the maintenance and supervision of their high standards of education and application.  I am sure the board will ensure this when they begin their work.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second ground of complaint, that of physical or mental disability, the words &ldquo;serious physical and mental disability&rdquo; should be inserted. This surely must have been the intention. It would be very hurtful and damaging to have complaints about relatively minor ailments.  I also wonder if the right of appeal to the High Court is somewhat illusory.  Unless there is a right to whole or partial civil legal aid in a matter as important as one's livelihood, would it be constitutional to have such a right of appeal without it being backed up by legal aid?</P>
    <P>On this subject I would like to have more detailed terms of reference for the Fitness to Practise Committee.  Our group had a discussion this morning with a representative of the Irish Nursing Association and she was rather vague about what was involved.  I would like the Minister again to clarify this section on the Fitness to Practise Committee.  This, as far as I can see, is a powerful committee with powers of the High Court in some regards.  Again, it requires that members have a knowledge of law and a strong sense of justice but from what I understand there will be no legal person on this committee which will be comprised of board members solely.  Their actions should be confirmed by the board unless the board dispense with the necessity for such confirmation.  This is rather curious.  If the board dispense with that it removes from the accused a review <Col N="239" /> procedure but if they do not dispense with it, has the accused the right to be heard and will the board on review include members of the committee?  I would like if the Minister could answer that.  If so, they are judging their own decision.</P>
    <P>I feel that the matters I raised need clarification.  Otherwise, I should like to welcome the Bill and to congratulate the Minister for introducting it.  It is a very important Bill and I am sure it will help to upgrade the standard of the nursing profession and the quality of nurses in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief because this is an area in which I am not very knowledgeable.  With any legislation going through this House we should ask ourselves if a Bill is necessary first of all and, then, if it is comprehensive or forward looking enough. Everybody agrees that this Bill is necessary and I would like to welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like all the other Senators I would like to pay tribute to the nursing profession in all areas.  It is a very noble profession. We have seen nurses work in difficult situations in hospitals, casualty units, clinics and other places.  Their pay has generally not been so good, conditions have been difficult with very long hours, very strict discipline and very onerous work.  Sometimes I think they had to engage in very menial tasks which they should not have had to do.  I recall in my younger days many young girls went to England and qualified as nurses in very difficult situations without the support of families.  A great tribute is due to them. They have also contributed enormously to nursing in this country.  In passing, I would like to mention the problem of unemployment in this area.  Something should be done about it, particularly with regard to short term and part time employment.  In any profession at present it is necessary to keep abreast of developments and to do that it is most important to spend a considerable amount of time &mdash; perhaps a half day each week &mdash; reading reports and keeping abreast of things. <Col N="240" /> It is also most important to be engaged, as artists say, to keep your hand in, in this area.</P>
    <P>The educational standards have been raised considerably and this is understandable enough.  It is important to have academic requirements and qualifications but it is an area which should be decided from the vocational aspect rather than the academic aspect, because everybody is agreed that nursing is a vocation and a very difficult one.  I could visualise girls with all the qualities to be good nurses being unable to meet the educational or the academic requirements. Perhaps this may also be true &mdash; although I have no knowledge about this &mdash; with regard to doctors.</P>
    <P>We have had great service in the medical area in this country and there are some families in which the sons and daughters have become doctors.  I could visualise people from a medical background and who would be good doctors perhaps not being able to meet this qualification. This could also be true in nursing. Greater emphasis should be given to the vocational aspect rather than to the educational or the academic.  Great strides have been made in this area in recent years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new board, I note that 17 nurses will be elected and one will be nominated, which means that no fewer than 18 of the 29 members will be nurses &mdash; which seems satisfactory &mdash; and perhaps this could be as many as 20.  The Minister when introducing this Bill stated that in deference to the wishes of many nurses he is considering providing in the regulations for the first board that the election will be conducted on a system of proportional representation.  I know this has been commended here by Members but I understand that the Irish Matrons' Association and also the Irish Nurses' Association, who together represent the vast majority of Irish nurses, are totally opposed to the proportional representation system.  I believe this form of voting procedure is not used by any other health profession in Ireland, nor, I understand, is it used to elect nurse members to the competent authorities in other <Col N="241" /> countries.  This is an area which I would like the Minister to re-examine.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Central Applications Bureau, it is to be welcomed in a guarded way.  The position was becoming chaotic and out of hand and applicants, in order to gain entry into the nursing profession, had to fill dozens of application forms in many cases.  I recall making representations at one time and I found that 4,500 applications were made for a couple of hundred places.  I also believe that some of these teaching hospitals carried out their own examinations, which perhaps made it more complicated. I agree in principle with the Central Applications Bureau but the hospitals themselves should have some considerable input.</P>
    <P>With regard to ethics, we all received the code for nurses which was published by An Bord Altranais earlier this year. The resolution stated that all employing authorities have in their contract for nurses and midwives a clause stating the right to conscientious objection.  I am in total agreement with that.  It is reasonable. That position obtains with regard to doctors: they can make up their minds. Nurses are independent and autonomous and it is only right and proper that we should agree with this code.</P>
    <P>I have a general welcome, as have all the other Senators, for the Bill.  There is one other area that I would like to mention, that is where I believe some of the nursing profession are gravely concerned with the inclusion in the administration category of those above ward sister level, unlike on the previous board where the administrative seat was held by an experienced hospital matron only.  Since the vast majority of nurses are employed in hospitals and appointed by matrons, it would be invidious if a situation could arise under the present proposals where none of the positions in the administration category might be filled by matrons.  For example, only unit nursing officers might be elected.  At present for a person to be elected into the administration category, he or she has to be a matron with a minimum of two years <Col N="242" /> experience.  Generally, I believe that this Bill is important, it is necessary and I welcome it.  I ask the Minister to look into the few points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil seans agam moladh a bhronnadh ar bhanaltraí, ní hé amháin ar na mbanaltraí atása tír seo faoí láthair ach ar bhanaltraí na tíre seo atá ag obair go dian i dtíortha thar lear.  Many of these nurses who have gone to other countries have worked under very trying conditions.  Some of them have to work way beyond the call of duty, at times taking on the role of surgeon.  In particular those who go to Third World countries do marvellous work and I would like to pay tribute to them.  With regard to the nursing profession at home, we are very lucky that it has been of such a high standard and that the care that nurses give to patients is second to none.</P>
      <P>Like other Senators I am worried that we are setting many of our standards in Ireland on leaving certificate results and this holds for most professions now.  It is not a question any longer of getting either a pass or honours in your leaving certificate. It is a question of how many points you get, how many As and Bs you get.  I remember when I did my leaving certificate and I was called to the training college.  There was no interview for teaching.  At the end of a year there were always three or four people who were told that it was very nice having them for a year but not to come back.  Many of these people were quite clearly never going to fit into the ranks of the teaching profession.  It was scandalous that there were no interviews.  There are now and I am very glad to see that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that when An Bord Altranais get into full swing they should put much more emphasis on the actual interview and the interest of girls in nursing.  It is all very fine to have the top brains of the country nursing or in the medical profession, which is just as serious, but they may have very little interest in people.  There is a danger that we can go to extremes and work on academic <Col N="243" /> standards only.  While there are new regulations coming in that outline minimum standards, I worry that while there might be minimum standards officially people would not even be called for interview. Because they would have so many applications they would start at the top and the cream would be so thick on the top that those who were only on minimum standards would not have a hope of being called for interview.  Therefore they would have no way of proving that because of their interest in people, because of what they have done up to the stage when they did the leaving certificate they really would be natural nurses.  I know it is difficult not to have some kind of standards.  Perhaps political influence or the influence of nuns or family will make a difference.  I would like to see much more emphasis put on the interview and on the way the girls or men, if they are involved actually perform and prove they are keen on nursing.  They should get a chance at least.</P>
    <P>Many parts of this Bill are acceptable to the nursing staff and I do not intend at this stage to go through them.  On Committee Stage we will be discussing them in detail.  Section 9 seemed to cause a problem earlier on.  In fairness, with 17 nurses directly involved and the Minister having the possibility that he can put on one or two more I think the nursing profession is well covered.  I know that perhaps the psychiatric section feel they should have more because they represent so many nurses and nurses in hospital are inclined to think administrators are not exactly representing them.  However, medical set-up is so involved that it is very difficult to separate one section from another.</P>
    <P>While I fully support the nurses that this is a Nurses Bill and, therefore, should be concerned mainly with nurses and that An Bord Altranais should be run mainly by nurses, I think that there has to be a limit, that we cannot completely leave it to them.  In general they are happy enough.  Every group would probably like one or two more or some sections might <Col N="244" /> like one representative but I can understand the difficulty of the Minister.  It is not so easy to fit in everybody and give everybody as many representatives as they would like.</P>
    <P>In my contribution today I want to emphasise the right of conscience.  Many nurses are concerned about this.  Many people immediately think it is a question of those who are against sterilisation, that they are going to be the people who will be objecting.  Trends in medicine are changing.  Euthanasia was a big word long ago and it was a remote possibility.  The question of experiments with embryos is something that is new.  In future nurses could be asked to do things that were never considered in the nursing profession before.  While their code of ethics is there, many of the nurses feel that it should be written into the Bill.  I ask the Minister if he can to do that so that people will feel they are not under pressure. Under the code of ethics their case would have to be genuine.  They could not go off on their own at every twist and turn and decide they could not do anything because they had a conscientious objection to it.  I believe it is written into the Bill in Northern Ireland and at the moment they are trying to have it written into the Bill in England.  We are producing a Bill which I am sure will not be changed for many years to come and we should look to the future because we do not know exactly what is going to happen. There are people who are worried that trends in medicine are going a lot faster than many of us realise.  For that reason I ask the Minister again to include that in the Bill at a later stage.  In general, I am glad this Bill has come in.  I am glad that it has been accepted so widely by the people it will help later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to take the opportunity to make a few brief observations on Second Stage.  I hope to have an opportunity, perhaps, to deal with some of the proposed provisions of this Bill on Committee Stage.  I may take another opportunity to develop some of the themes I had when we were discussing the Dental Bill last year.  At the expense <Col N="245" /> of repetition, I know the Minister is aware of some of my views on these matters.</P>
      <P>We have got bogged down in seeing health as what happens in hospitals and in surgeries, forgetting that that is a focus on disease.  Our medical and nursing schools &mdash; and particularly our medical schools; nursing is in many ways more advanced in this respect &mdash; have focused on the curing of diseases as the main thing in a so-called health service.  We have ended up going to disease centres which are called health centres and developing a disease service which is called a health service.</P>
      <P>The unfortunate thing in that is that those who hold power in the institutions that regulate this disease service also take it upon themselves to assume that they have the right to determine what is right for the health of the nation.  Health is to deal with wholeness and health is a topic which demands a much more radical reappraisal of society than disease does. Disease is part of the health scenario, but it is only a part.  There are far too many people who get into positions of institutional power in the health service who are not qualified by thinking, teaching, experience or by philosophy to deal with the whole range of what is involved in promoting a health service.  In that context take away the cutbacks, the Minister from a philosophical point of view has at times shown indications that he does grasp the fuller significance of what health is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We then come to what we mean and how we set up such a board?  There are three important aspects of any such service, be it the education service, the health service, the disease service or whatever service, we are referring to. There are the consumers, the people for whom the service is destined to serve and who are paying the salaries and wages of those who operate it.  Secondly, there are the operatives, all of them from the most junior student nurse to the matron, the doctors, the paramedical workers, the outside labour force, the inside labour force and so on.  Thirdly, there are the institutions who embody in their regulations <Col N="246" /> what has been decided in the past, how it is being modified through experience in the present and try to project into the future.</P>
    <P>We have as a country been far too dominated by power given to the institutional men and not enough to the operatives and to the consumers.  I was glad to see the very modest amendment whereby nurses got a slightly increased representation, the ordinary working nurse of which there are 23,000 or 24,000 in the State.  The numbers to be represented on the board are to be increased from five to seven.  One could argue, as I am sure some Senators have &mdash; I regret that I was not here to listen to the other contributions &mdash; that there are ten nurses representing some 2,000 teachers and administrators.  Then we come to the other side of the coin.  I would have felt happier had our profession been prepared to open its doors in some sort of a reciprocal arrangement to see that it is in symbiosis with the nursing profession in the delivery of that dimension of health care, the disease service, that takes place inside our hospitals and outside in our communities.</P>
    <P>I notice with some concern that while there are three medical practitioners on the nurses board there is a strange travesty of equity in that there is not the same facility on medical boards or councils for an equal representation of nurses.  Is there enough representation on this board for those nurses who work outside of the health centres, who work in the community?  Why are the student nurses of Ireland not represented on this board? They are over the age of 18.  We take pride in the fact that, albeit we have to slavishly follow England before we decide to do our own thing in this as in so many other things, the citizen reaches his majority or her majority at the age of 18 and yet because they are students they are not looked upon as mature enough to participate.  The board should be about the whole service and we should be trying to involve in as wide as possible a way the people concerned &mdash; young, old, senior and junior.  The day is long gone when those who are full citizens of the <Col N="247" /> State should be deprived of representation on such committees.</P>
    <P>I noted with some dismay what seemed to me the very heavy-handed way in which discipline is dealt out.  There is no doubt that one needs order if hospitals are to practise effectively and order is needed in the delivery of the health care services in order to retain the confidence of those to whom they are addressed.  I will be going through this with a fine-tooth comb on Committee Stage to see just how much emphasis there has to be in order to ensure that the nurses behave themselves and keep in their proper and disciplined place in relation to society. Certainly, we must have discipline.  Certainly, we must ensure that nurses, like doctors who are not fit to practise, are not allowed to practise and perhaps even more important, that they should receive the support they may need when they are no longer fit to practise through some fault, misdemeanour or so on.  In Ireland, North and South, we have been a condemnatory society for far too long.  We have got to support those who carry out the services and make mistakes as well as to discipline them.</P>
    <P>With regard to conscientious objection, the price of freedom is choice.  It is not the choice of the group; it is the choice of the individual.  I am not aware of the detail of the legislation in Northern Ireland, but in our own hospital &mdash; I am not a gynaecologist; I do not do sterilisation &mdash; where sterilisation on women is undertaken no Catholic nurse need be within the theatre when that takes place. We go out of our way to ensure that the conscientious rights and feelings of those who might be otherwise involved in practices to which they take objection is respected.  I defy anyone to show, other than perhaps in some outrageous exceptional case, over many years that the practice has been otherwise.  I defend, as I am sure other Senators did, the right of conscientious objection but that is one thing.  However, it is not a right that should extend from the individual to the practice for other individuals if any reasonably significant number also have <Col N="248" /> conscientious feelings that the practice which is being brought into question is right by the code of ethics which they hold.  Here is the danger and here is the dilemma, that in giving the right of conscientious objection we must also give the right of conscientious affirmation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the sections of the Bill which deal with the need to determine professionalism and, in particular, the point made by the last speaker, with which I agree.  There was a time when nepotism was rife.  If you were the doctor's son you got into the doctor's practice.  If you were the surgeon's son you got into the surgeon's practice and if you were the matron's niece, as it would have been in those days, you slipped in through the back door if you could not get through the front door into the hospital and got your training when somebody else did not have the opportunity.</P>
    <P>This has now swung the whole way in the other direction &mdash; I am speaking of my own experience &mdash; and in order to safeguard oneself against nepotism the whole thing has become the cult of the examination number.  We are only now beginning to realise in the eighties that examinations test a fragment of knowledge, and a fragment of experience but it cannot possibly cope with the whole person.  When we talk about the whole person, and the contribution of the whole person and the relationship between the whole person and the whole job to which they are called to do, then, whether we like it or not, instinctive judgement also comes into play.  Thank goodness, what may be right in a hospital in County Kerry might be a misfit in a hospital in County Louth.  Long may it last that this society is based on the right of difference and on different opportunities, different styles and different fibres with different colours so that we have a vigorous society where different people's talents and personalities can find various niches.  However there have to be safeguards in that because otherwise we return to nepotism. Nepotism is one of the easiest things and at one time was the most rampant thing in Irish society both North and South. <Col N="249" /> There must be a balance.  Therefore, one has to say that down to a certain level in this examination system the person should be allowed in on the results of the examination but below that there must be a percentage left for the interview procedure.  I do not think it is all or none; it is a bit of both, and I certainly would favour the system which diminishes the possibility of nepotism even if it is at the expense of a few misfits.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an attempt to look at the state of nursing in the Republic of Ireland as it is.  So far there has been some congnisance taken of the concern expressed by individual nurses and nurses' organisations. There is still an opportunity to amend it and we should realise that in the late 20th century we will be moving into a participatory democracy &mdash; if we are to have a democracy at all &mdash; that involves all the people in the decision-making process, particularly at community level.  It will not, I hope, lead to more centralism and centralisation &mdash; more power to centre.  We should be striving to determine what the people need as they define it in their own locality and we should be setting up our structures to respond to that need, should it be the nursing structures, medical structures, educational structures or whatever. Finally, it should not be forgotten that only 10 to 15 per cent of all hospitalised medicine requires the attentions of the super specialists and super technology and that the smaller hospitals with people properly trained to meet community need in the widest sense can cope with the 80 to 90 per cent of hospitalised health care needs, including accidents and emergencies that are required at local district level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for their constructive and detailed contributions to the debate on the Bill.  I am pleased that, by and large, all speakers have welcomed the Bill although some have indicated that they have reservations about parts of it.  It would be naive of us if we did expect that there would be no reservations about a complex Bill such as <Col N="250" /> this.  I will briefly deal with some of the technical issues first and then deal with the questions of conscientious objection, the Central applications bureau and the points raised by Senator Robb.</P>
      <P>The question of ministerial powers was raised by Senators Fallon and Honan. There was a concern, an unnecessary one, that the Minister of the day proposed to take too many powers on himself under the Bill.  This is more related to a certain antipathy to the current Minister than to the Minister of the day.  That is understandable for a number of reasons but it is of no importance in framing legislation to stand, hopefully, into the year 2000 and from there on.</P>
      <P>Sections 15, 53 and 56 contain standard provisions, purely standard ministerial provisions.  They are not exclusive to the Bill.  Not since the fifties has any effort been made legislatively in this direction, not since the Nurses Act, 1950.  But now when we put conventional current ministerial powers into this legislation it was as if all hell broke loose and that the Minister of the day was assuming extraordinary powers, powers which everybody would have been perfectly happy with in the sixties, seventies and in the mid-eighties.  Section 15 is purely a reenactment of section 23 of the Nurses Act, 1950, and section 56 is similar to section 80 (1) of that Act.  It goes without saying that before an order is made under sections 15 or 53 any Minister for Health would consult with the board in order to have the board's views.  Section 53 is designed to give additional functions to the board, not to the Minister.  Indeed, it might be expected that the initiative for the assignment of additional functions would come from the board and that full consultations would take place between the board and the Department before an order is made.  Senator Honan was preoccupied about the powers of B. Desmond and so on but I can assure her that her excessive concern does not merit examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of fees was raised by Senator Fallon.  The provision for the board to charge fees is purely to enable it to obtain the funding it will require to <Col N="251" /> develop and expand the range of services it can provide for nurses.  The amount of the fees determined initially will require the approval of the National Prices Commission and any increase in the fees will be subject to the consent of the Minister for Health of the day.  The purpose of the provision for a retention fee is primarily to enable the board to establish and maintain a live register of nurses.  The present register, as many Senators, the Department and every nursing organisation knows, contains the names of nurses who have died, have married and have not been registered under their married name and new address &mdash; not that they are obliged to change their name but a number do &mdash; and the large number who have gone abroad or otherwise ceased to practise.  Therefore, if we are going to have a rational set-up throughout the country we have to charge a retention fee so that people pay on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that many nurses who are members of trade unions and who are accustomed to this form of continuation payment find objection to this.  Again at the risk of drawing the wrath of people on my head there is nothing uniquely special about professional roles in that framework and there should not, therefore, be exemptions.  I should like to stress that, this is of critical importance. For manpower planning and statistical purposes the present register is useless. Therefore, this change will be of major benefit to the profession and to the health services as a whole.</P>
    <P>On the question of ancillary nursing personnel, raised by Senators Fallon and Ferris, I should like to point out that section 30 enables the board, if it so decides, to establish a register for ancillary nursing personnel.  I made a significant amendment to this section in the Dáil.  I deleted the phrase &ldquo;or shall whenever the Minister so requests&rdquo;, which means that the discretionary power to establish a register is left entirely to the board.  I stress, lest there be any misunderstanding, that if ever this power were to be invoked, a register entirely separate from the current register of <Col N="252" /> nurses would be established.  That is quite clear-cut from the Bill.  That was an amendment made in the Dáil.  Contrary to what has been said here about my having made a large number of amendments in the Dáil, the Bill has not been amended that much.  By and large, there have been very few amendments, contrary to what a Senator suggested, but that is an amendment of some significance to which I wish to allude in this House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appeal provision referred to by Senator Fallon, which is in section 34 (5) I am satisfied that the appeal provision in the case where a hospital has been refused approval as a training institution by the board is adequate. There is nothing in section 34 (5) to prevent such a hospital from appealing to the board themselves &mdash; or, indeed, to the High Court &mdash; in addition to appealing to the Minister for Health.  I do not feel that the situation would arise as the board have laid down very detailed criteria for training schools.  Hospitals seeking approval would be very well aware, well in advance, of the criteria for approval as a training school and would understand very clearly the necessary provisions before making an application for approval.</P>
    <P>I am not very often at odds with Senator Robb, but I do not believe in having a Central Applications Bureau for, perhaps, the authentic 80 per cent and an interview system for the balance.  I believe that this would give rise to a post-colonial, bizarre system of the beloved aspects of the profession ensuring that their 1985 year 2,000 version of nephews and nieces would enter through the 20 per cent back door.  Inevitably I will get myself into trouble over it, but when one is dealing with the professional aspect, it is either all or nothing.  If one gives way even on 20 per cent one will find oneself being railroaded into 50 per cent and eventually there will be an erosion back to the nepotism, class structures, inequities and the lack of educational opportunity which existed &mdash; and still exist &mdash; for the nursing profession.  That is what we are trying to change and that is why I <Col N="253" /> am currently such a detested figure in so many training schools.  The influence on patients and on the public at large of such hospitals and schools can be and is profound.</P>
    <P>However, we will go ahead and see how it will work out.  I have no doubt that the Central applications Bureau will work out well.  I have no doubt that, in passing it, Seanad Éireann will do one good thing.  Looking back at the work done by quite a number of my predecessors, it is obvious that quite a number of them regarded as their priority in delivering the health services, as Ministers holding the Health portfolio, ringing up matrons around the country on behalf of Deputies and Senators asking them to admit Mary so-and-so to their nursing school as a favour.  Then when something has to be done in relation to that particular institution, the Minister is naked before the prospects of implementing any kind of health policy.  That, unfortunately, has been the situation.  I have adamantly refused in the past two-and-a-half years to make such representations and have issued directions within the Department to that effect.  Such representations are not made.</P>
    <P>The Central Applications Bureau has been singled out as an important element of the new structures for nurse training, education and registration laid down in the Bill.  It is to be seen as one element in the context of the totality of nurse training and education from the selection of trainees to their registration and the post-registration, education and training of nurses.  The Bill is designed to update the structures in relation to nurse training and registration.  Against the background of increasing numbers of applicants for nurse training in the 60 nurse training schools, a rationalisation of the procedures for application and selection for training is an essential part of this updating. Therefore, the CAB will co-ordinate the applications from persons wishing to enter nurse training and it will operate the screening of candidates from the educational and psychological aspects.  It will do so in an open, approved and accepted <Col N="254" /> manner.</P>
    <P>These are important, fundamental tasks in the selection procedure and will be of major benefit to the nurse training schools which in the last analysis, will have a pattern.  They will be able to select their own trainees from the point of view of suitability for individual employments. But the functions of the CAB in relation to the co-ordination of applications will be of benefit to applicants who will have to apply to one single body only, instead of having to apply to several training schools, as is the case at present.  It is both heartbreaking and enormously costly for parents and for young men and women to have to go around the country visiting nurse training schools, attending a multitude of interviews at enormous cost hoping for a vacancy.</P>
    <P>The CAB will have a screening function. It will determine, <i>inter alia</i>, an applicant's psychological aptitude for nursing, which is of crucial importance.  Up to now it has been a quasi-educational and sometimes quite cursory interview having more regard to where the person came from than to his or her capabilities.  This function will be of benefit to the training schools, the applicants and, in particular, to the health service.  Therefore, I strongly commend the provisions of the Bill regarding this aspect of the legislative proposal.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan suggested that the Fitness to Practise Committee be established under Part V of the Bill and that it should include in its membership persons who are not members of the board.  Senator Durcan felt that the committee would be more acceptable to the public and to nurses if its members included non-nurses. This suggestion has not been represented to me up to now by the nursing organisations.  I feel that external members would not be desirable for this committee. It is the business of An Bord Altranais to regulate and control nurses &mdash; if I may use that phrase, and I use it in its correct, professional way &mdash; and to control the practice of nursing at national level.  It follows that the board should have the power to adjudicate on the fitness or otherwise of a nurse to practice <Col N="255" /> nursing.  It should not fall to outsiders &mdash; I use that word for want of a better one &mdash; to adjudicate on the fitness of persons who are subject to the control of their own professional representatives.</P>
    <P>There are adequate safeguards from the public point of view.  There will be two members of the public on the board. Contrary to the party-political pre-occupation of Senator Honan, who said that it would be two Labour Party members, as far as I am concerned those appointed will be appointed on merit and there will be no other criterion.  Out of a large board there will be two members to represent the interests of the general public.  Either or both of these could be members of the Fitness to Practise Committee.  In any event, those members in their capacity as members of the board would have the opportunity to participate in making a decision on how the board should act on a report from the Fitness to Practise Commission.</P>
    <P>Senator Deenihan raised the question about the insertion of the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; in section 38 (1) (b).  I am entirely reluctant to put that in because &mdash; and I think a parliamentary draftsman would agree &mdash; it would hardly serve any useful purpose in that any person at the moment, as it should be, may apply to the committee for an inquiry into the fitness of a nurse.  That is under the general provisions of the Bill itself and it would be quite difficult, if not impossible, to determine in legislative framework the idea as to what should be or should not be a serious issue.  It will be up to the committee to decide the grounds for proceeding with an inquiry.  They will judge the seriousness and that will be devolved on them.</P>
    <P>Senator Deenihan raised the question that the type of complaint should be spelt out.  This again is something we just cannot comprehensively put into legislation. It is the purpose of the Fitness to Practice Committee to decide, at the first available opportunity following the making of an application to them, <Col N="256" /> whether or not there are grounds for proceedings. Therefore the type of complaint will be considered by the Fitness to Practise Committee.</P>
    <P>Finally, it was suggested that there should be some legal persons on the Fitness to Practise Committee.  The board are empowered to request persons to assist them in the performance of their functions and they can on that basis employ a law agent or a senior counsel from time to time and they can use this power to obtain legal advice.  The present board, I understand, have retained a firm of legal advisers, so I think the aspect is generally covered in the Bill in a reasonably effective manner.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of conscientious objection which arises under section 51 (2) of the Bill, a number of Senators, particularly Senators Ferris, Durcan and McGuinness, made detailed observations on this question.  Senator Ferris would have liked to have the principle of the right to conscientious objection enshrined in the legislation but he also made the point, which serves as a counterpoint, that we are living in a democracy in which people have the right to opt out of procedures which are directly at variance with their conscience, so, in effect, as a matter of generality, we do not have to put into legislation provisions of this nature.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan did not consider that the board's code adequately covered or actually gave the right to conscientious objection and he wants to see a statutory provision in this regard.  Indeed, he mentioned Spanish legislation on abortion, which gives doctors the right to opt out of abortion procedures.  A number of other Deputies referred to this area.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness was satisfied with the provision in relation to section 51 (2) of the Bill and with section 1 (11) of the code for nurses.  She indicated that she would oppose the inclusion in the Bill of what she quite correctly called a &ldquo;no-birth&rdquo; conscience clause in a situation where &mdash; I quote Senator McGuinness &mdash;&ldquo;we are very often talking about the ethics and the conscience of the majority <Col N="257" /> Church and perhaps of a rather right-wing group within the majority Church&rdquo;. Senator McGuinness feared the possibility of circumstances arising which could bring into conflict the rights of potentially conflicting consciences, namely, those of the patient, those of the doctor and those of the nurse and of course, she indicated that in relation to treatment the rights and conscience of the patient, should prevail.</P>
    <P>With these points I find myself in general agreement.  The Bill reflects the particular view of Senator McGuinness because it is of critical importance in this Bill to point out that there is no general precedent or provision in Irish legislation for the inclusion in an Act of the Oireachtas of a non-specific and general right to conscientious objection.  That is something of which we tend to be somewhat ignorant.  In the medical or nursing context the potential for damage to persons who are ill from the use of such a legislative statutory provision of conscience could be enormous.  A person, for example, as a matter of conscientious objection, could refuse to give a blood transfusion, something on which we would not, I am quite sure, contemplate giving a legislative conscience exemption. Equally, somebody could refuse to give a pain-killing drug or, for example, the attention of a particular clergyman to a particular patient on conscientious grounds.  Again, we would not stand over that.</P>
    <P>There is specific precedent, however, in health legislation for the inclusion of a conscientious objection clause in very specific instances.  The most obvious one, which I and Senators are equally familiar with, relates to the provision of services under the Health (Family Planning) Act. Section 11 of that reads:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Act shall be construed as obliging any person to take part in the provision of a family planning service, the giving of prescriptions or authorisations for the sale, importation into the State, manufacture, advertising or display of contractives.</P>
    <P>A very specific exemption in relation to <Col N="258" /> a very specific question is provided on conscientious grounds.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish a broadly based board which will regulate the registration, control and education of nurses.  The Bill does not deal with the individual nursing services as such.  It does not deal with whether they should or should not be provided for particular aspects of nursing.  It does not even consider within what specific circumstances these services as such are being provided and, indeed, by whom.  These are matters on which nurses should have and, indeed, expect guidance from An Bord Altranais itself and a specific power devolves on the board under section 51 (2) under a general umbrella of giving advice relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.  That, in my strong view, is as far as this Bill can go.  I quote the section:</P>
    <P>It shall be a function of the board to give guidance to the nursing profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.</P>
    <P>This is the nursing profession itself, on a self-regulatory basis, giving advice and guidance on this area.  Therefore, it would be completely inappropriate for legislation here to introduce what one might call a catch-all conscientious objection clause giving nurses overriding statutory powers in what would be totally undefined circumstances.</P>
    <P>This is of considerable importance within the framework of this Bill.  For example, the Bill does not deal with the question of abortion.  If there was an Abortion Bill before this House, presumably, as is the case of the United Kingdom legislation under the Abortion Act, 1967, there would be a conscientious objection clause as there is in relation to that Act. Presumably, if it were to happen there would be a similar type clause in that regard.  I would make the point, even in relation to the British Act, and I quote here from that Act where it is said:</P>
    <P>Nothing in . . . . shall affect any duty to participate in treatment which is necessary to save the life or to prevent <Col N="259" /> grave permanent injury to the physical and mental health of a pregnant woman.</P>
    <P>Even in that conscientious clause there is a very considerable obligation imposed. We are not dealing with that today.  But, since the question of abortion was raised by a number of Senators within that framework, there may well be some confusion. It is important that I should clarify that.</P>
    <P>If particular problems arise I am quite certain that the board will be prepared to advise individual nurses.  The board will also monitor the effectiveness of the code and they have drawn up their own code for nurses.  They will be prepared to revise that code, as necessary, in the light of experience of its application and <i>vis-àvis</i> individual operations.  Therefore, for entirely appropriate legislative reasons I have to resist, the consideration of an amendment or change of that nature.  I am glad the Seanad has raised the matter so specifically because it affords me an opportunity of clarifying the matter further.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons expressed reservations about the use of proportional representation in relation to the election of some of the members of An Bord Altranais.  If the Bill is enacted with reasonable speed we will have the elections fairly soon.  I will be drawing up the regulations for the election of members for the first board.  I am already on record as saying that I will explore the feasibility of providing that the election be carried out by way of proportional representation. I am doing that at present.  I beleive that proportional representation is the most equitable system possible.  As Senators know, it is used in the election of Members to Seanad Éireann and the Dáil and indeed in the election of members of the Dental Council.  In the nursing context it would give nurses of all categories an opportunity of being represented on the board.  Essentially the election will be to secure members for 17 separate seats, in effect 17 single seat constituencies. The proportional representation is <Col N="260" /> not usually used for this type of election. However, there is quite a significant precedent for it, even on the single seat basis. The President of Ireland is elected on a single seat basis.  I suppose if it is good for the President in that regard there is no great reason it should not be used here also, and I am in favour of it.</P>
    <P>I have received one written communication only from one nurses representative organisation objecting to the proposal to provide for proportional representation. On that basis I have no reason to believe that the majority of nurses would object to proportional representation at present.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is now reaching the final stage and the time for drawing up the relevant regulations is imminent I would be very glad to have the views of those nurses representative bodies who may be concerned about this aspect.  I can take these objections into account in drawing up the regulations.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons specifically referred to the question of matrons and assistant matrons and the prospect of their being electorally squeezed out on a proportional representation basis.  I will certainly bear his views in mind in drawing up the regulations for election of members to the first board.  I would be anxious to hear from the organisations because that was not my intention.  That is not nor was it ever the intention in terms of the operation of proportional representation.  I am very anxious that proportional representation should operate in the general election of the board.</P>
    <P>There are two final points I should like to deal with.  Senator Honan asked: why exclude the chairman of the board from being a chairman of any of the committees of the boards?  To an extent the Senator may have misread the provisions of section 13 which provide that the chairman of every committee established under this section shall be a member of the board.  This does not exclude the president of the board.  The only exception is that the chairman of the Fitness to Practise Committee shall be a member of the board other than the president or vice-president.  That is reasonably fair. <Col N="261" /> We have to prevent a situation arising in which the chairman of the Fitness to Practise Committee would in effect be reporting to himself or to herself.  Basically that is the reason for that.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Robb that within the legislative framework we would both claim to be liberal.  I hope we are not that ageing in our liberality.  But we still retain the sparkle, the need for change and a bit of imagination.  In terms of student representation on the board I would make the broad point that the board is for registration &mdash; it is an examinations board as such.  It is basically a board dealing in terms of fitness to practise of people who have qualified and who are on a register.  I am reasonably convinced on balance.  If there is an argument, then I would certainly share a degree of the Senator's argument.  I would argue for student nurse representation on the boards of hospitals and on service boards in the health services.  Student nurses are generally treated with a degree of patronisation, indeed disdain by some agencies. They are not treated in an adult and cooperative way.  It should be remembered that the contribution made by student nurses within the health services is enormous. An Bord Altranais are not a health service body.  They are basically a professional registration examining body.  In a body where examination procedures are established, where papers are drawn up, and where certificates are decided on student representation does pose some considerable difficulty in that regard, particularly in terms of student representatives deciding on fitness to practise of registered nurses.  There could be an anomalous situation there.  That is the main reason the change has not been effected.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Members of the Seanad for being helpful in relation to this Bill, helpful in highlighting a number of its aspects of which were not debated in Dáil Éireann, although the debate in that House was very extensive and lengthy.  It demonstration that the rigorous, second examination of legislation is invaluable. It demonstrates that Members of Seanad <Col N="262" /> Éireann reflecting on this Bill, have made exceptionally valuable and necessary points in relation to its further passage.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves of the following regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Registration of Electors (Amendment) Regulations, 1985</P>
      <P>a copy of which regulations in draft form was laid before Seanad Éireann on the 31st day of July, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these regulations is to make certain technical amendments to the procedures for the registration of electors.  These amendments are necessary to enable the provisions of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1985, which granted the Dáil vote to British citizens, to be given effect. The compilation of the 1986 register of electors is now under way.  The draft will <Col N="263" /> be published in December.  The new registration arrangements must be reflected in that draft and the making of these regulations will open the way for this.</P>
      <P>The draft regulations are being brought before the House in accordance with section 7 of the Electoral Act, 1963 which provides that, where regulations under that section are proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Electoral Act, 1963 authorities the Minister for the Environment to make regulations providing for such matters as the procedures to be followed in the registration of persons as electors and the format of the register. Regulations under that section entitled the Registration of Electors and Juries Acts (Specification of Dates) Regulations, 1963 were amended in 1977 to provide for the registration of the category of European Assembly elector.  The regulations which are the subject of the present motion will further amend the 1963 regulations to accommodate the additional category of elector provided for by the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1985.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, British citizens resident here are now entitled to be registered as Dáil electors.  However, they are not eligible to vote at Presidential elections or referenda and this means that they must be distinguished separately from Irish citizens in the register of electors. The Act provides for this by creating a new category called Presidential elector which is to be confined to Irish citizens. The draft regulations are designed to provide for this new category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this is a technical measure and the changes being made are designed to accommodate the new category of Presidential elector within the 1963 regulations.  There are no changes of procedure.  Accordingly, I do not intend to go through the draft regulations in detail.  However, there is one aspect <Col N="264" /> on which I would like to dwell briefly. That is the new lettering system to be used in the register of electors.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the different categories of electors are identified in the register by the placing of certain letters opposite their names.  At the moment, the letters &ldquo;LE&rdquo; are used to identify European Assembly electors, the letter &ldquo;L&rdquo; identifies persons from outside the European Community who can vote at local elections only and the letter &ldquo;P&rdquo; identifies postal voters.  Irish citizens, who alone can vote at all elections and referenda, do not require a distinguishing letter.  Under the draft regulations, the letters &ldquo;L&rdquo; and &ldquo;P&rdquo; will apply to the same categories as before and Irish citizens will not have a distinguishing letter.  The letter &ldquo;E&rdquo; alone will identify European Assembly electors, who are eligible to vote at both European Assembly and local elections, and the letter &ldquo;D&rdquo; will identify persons eligible to vote at Dáil elections as well as at European and local elections.  This latter category is, of course, confined to British citizens at this stage.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I would like to make.  The Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1985 confers on British citizens the right to be registered as Dáil electors.  However, whether a person can vote or not at an election depends entirely on being correctly included in the register of electors. I would, therefore, urge registration authorities to be particularly careful in compiling the register this year to ensure that all British citizens are correctly entered.  I would also ask all British citizens to be sure to check the draft register when it is published and to make claims for corrections wherever this is called for. In this way, we can ensure that the spirit of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1985 will be given appropriate practical expression.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these regulations despite the fact that they are long overdue.  They have been promised for a long time, if not by Ministers certainly by politicians in the past.  It is incumbent on every State to give to citizens who have <Col N="265" /> been ordinarily resident in that State for a reasonable length of time and who are citizens of other States, the right to choose their elected representatives.  We have many British citizens resident, working and contributing to this State.  I am sure all politicians &mdash; as they have gone from door to door seeking re-election from time to time &mdash; have come across many such citizens who were indignant that they were not given the same right as their State had afforded our citizens. Once one emigrates, or goes to live for a short period in England, Scotland or Wales, one is entitled to go on their register in that year without having to wait for any length of time and one is entitled to vote.  The Irish vote in Britain has been significant throughout the years.  We were lagging behind in not giving British citizens a vote in our State.  That is now being rectified and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that the Minister has arranged that when the register of electors, is being compiled &mdash; as is the normal practice each year &mdash; account will be taken of this new regulation.  I hope that it is being done throughout the country, that being the wish of the Government. British citizens resident here will be entitled to vote in Dáil elections as and from 15 April next year when the new register comes into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often wondered why, with all the electoral amendments we have had throughout the years, there has not been a rethink on the period within which such people may register.  At present the register is being compiled.  Those people entitled to go in the register are those who were ordinarily resident at a particular address on 15 September last.  Their names will appear on the draft register of electors due to be published in all areas on 1 December or the first week in December.  A certain time is then allowed to elapse for corrections or for people to check that they are on the register because the onus is on each one of us to ensure that we are registered.  Even though the local authorities are charged with the responsibility the main onus is on people themselves to ensure that they are registered.  The campaign run by the <Col N="266" /> Department of the Environment through newspaper, radio and television advertisements is, I believe, sufficient to draw people's attention to the fact that they should now be having a look at the register to ensure that their names are correctly listed so that they will be entitled to vote as and from 15 April 1986.</P>
    <P>I have often wondered at the wisdom of the particular period in which this enlisting is done.  The local authorities are now doing their job and will have the draft register of electors out in the beginning of December.  We have the period from 1 December to 15 January to have corrections made and to ensure that we are enlisted.  It is one of the busiest periods in the year for people. The Christmas period is a busy time for parents with all the preparation for the festivities of Christmas; and after Christmas is a holiday period.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider if a more appropriate period could be selected to enable people to have a greater opportunity of checking the register and ensuring that they are registered.  I do not think that the Christmas holiday, New Year holiday and that busy period in the depth of winter is the most appropriate time for giving everybody the opportunity of being registered.  I can instance the case of a man of 76 years of age who went to vote in an election in the early eighties. He found he was not on the register and he could not understand it as he had never been out of the State.  If we had a different period perhaps more people would check the register and ensure that they were enlisted.  I am not going to delay the House.  I am sure the passage of this regulation will be quite swift and I heartily welcome it even at this late stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this motion.  It is time that those British citizens had the right to vote in this country. I agree with the previous speaker when he mentioned the particular time of the drawing up of the voters list.  I said at a number of meetings of my country council that there could not be a worse time in the year than the month of December <Col N="267" /> and the first weeks in January.  That is a time that you cannot get people to check registers.  As a member of a political organisation you ask your branches to check it but they do not have meetings around that time.  That is one of the reasons why there are so many mistakes in the register.  The South Tipperary County Council will work by computer after this year which will be a big improvement.  The list of names will be there all the time and all they have to do is to put in additions and take out the names of those who are dead or who have left the area.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about this.</P>
      <P>Another point I would like to mention is that there are townlands down as addresses which nobody has heard of because they disappeared some years ago when the names were changed.  It applies even to very big villages.  I know big villages in Tipperary where the name does not appear on the register because there is a name of a townland for one side of the street and another townland for the other side of the street, townlands that were probably there before the village.  I cannot understand why these cannot be updated.  It also applies to Tipperary town where it is almost impossible to follow a register.  I do not know how the postman, when he is trying to deliver election literature, finds the different houses in certain streets, because two houses could have the same numbers just because they are on the same road but according to the most up-to-date figures they have different names.  Our registers should be modernised.</P>

      <P>I welcome the regulations. It is only right and fitting that somebody who resides in the country and contributes to the economy should be given a right to choose their Government or their public representatives and I have no doubt that they will choose properly. Like the two other speakers I appeal to the Minister to change the time of the revision.  As the previous speaker said, it <Col N="268" /> could not be chosen at a more inopportune time.  I also ask the Minister to consider changing the method of compiling the register.  On 13 March 1985, when the regulations for the postal voting were introduced in this House by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, I spoke of my grave reservations about the methods being adopted in my county.  I wrote to an M. Deering of the Minister's Department&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the compilation of the 1986 register of electors and asked local registration authorities to be particularly careful in compiling the register to ensure that all British citizens are correctly entered.  I would like the Minister to ask registration authorities to ensure that all citizens who are entitled to be registered are correctly entered and, which is just as important, <Col N="269" /> that those who are not entitled to be entered are not entered.</P>
      <P>When our citizens went abroad to England, Scotland or Wales they were privileged to be included immediately to have the right to vote there.  I do not want to deprive any Irish citizens of a right to vote while they are resident in Ireland but when not resident in Ireland &mdash; I am afraid that those who compile the registers, rate collectors particularly, do not emphasise this enough &mdash; when not normally resident in Ireland on 15 September they are not entitled to be on that register.</P>
      <P>I heard of a case last year, I drew it to the attention of this House on 13 March and I draw it to the attention of this House again, without naming any names or going into any detail, where a county registrar overruled an appeal to be left on the register in one year and the rate collector compiling the register for the same area in the ensuing year included the same persons.  The Minister's Department were made aware of this in April last year and despite their appeals to my county council permission has not been granted.  I am asking the Minister again to ask his officials to ask Donegal County Council and, if necessary, to direct Donegal County Council, to supply the information requested by his Department.  If we lose confidence in those who compile our registers, of if they lose confidence in us there is always the suggestion that there is political interference in the compilation of registers.  These accusations have been made in the past and they are likely to continue unless these type of loopholes are closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the present method of compiling a register is the proper method.  The present method appears to be that the rate collector involved examines the register in existence and deletes and adds accordingly.  There are obvious deletions but those not so obvious include emigration, leaving an area or moving to an area.  I do not know what the perfect answer is but I know that the present system is imperfect.  People can be omitted from one register simply because they move and are not entered in the other <Col N="270" /> register area to which they move, perhaps because one rate collector is doing his job properly and another is not.  Perhaps a registrar is over-zealous with regard to political undertones.  The result can be that the particular elector may not have a vote at all.  The opposite can happen where a person is not excluded from one but is reincluded in another and has two votes.  He or she may not exercise both votes, he or she may exercise one but somebody else might exercise the other vote, as happens often in big towns.  I thank the Acting Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  Would the Cathaoirleach like me to start all over again?</P>

      <P>Has the Minister or his Department any function in relation to the job of county registrar?  Could he nod or shake his head as the case may be?  I take it that he has not.  I have had grave difficulty where firm decisions were arrived at in revision courts in my county and it was publicly indicated to public representatives who were present what way those decisions were taken, but clearly not abided by.  I wrote on 13 May 1985 to the county registrar in my home county and on 26 September I received the following letter:</P>
      <P>The position is as I have already set out in previous correspondence.</P>
      <P>Yours sincerely.</P>
      <P>I do not believe any public representative should be treated like that by any official and certainly not in the exercise of his duty on behalf of his electors at any level, at any time or any place, from town commissioner up to President.  To be treated in this manner is an insult, not just to me but to the people I represent.  I ask the Minister's advice on this matter.  I have acted in the only two ways that I know and I have been in touch with the Department and with the office of the county registrar in April, or possibly May in one instance, and I have yet to get satisfaction in either regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the sentiments of my two <Col N="271" /> colleagues when they ask for a change of the time of the compilation of the register. I suggest that it should end some time in the beginning of December.  It should change in the period from August to December which would be far more suitable. I hope that the Minister will investigate the cases about which I have written to his Department and which I now raise in this House.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Senators who contributed and who welcomed the passage of this motion.  This is the last step in the process which began several years ago to grant all new rights to British citizens who were resident here.  In the meantime we have seen a Bill rejected by the courts.  We had the constitutional amendment and earlier this summer we had the Electoral (Amendment) Act.  When these regulations are made the whole machinery to enable British citizens to vote in Dáil elections will be in place and they will be able to exercise that right with effect from the 1986 register of electors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal briefly with a number of the points raised by Senators. All Senators raise the timing of the compilation of the register.  Senators McMahon, O'Brien and Loughrey suggested that the period for compiling the register should be altered and this is a point which I certainly will consider.  However, I would like to point out that most elections are held during the summer months and our concern is to have an up-to-date register available for that period and this is why the register is compiled between September and April.  Senators may think that Dáil elections are always held in the winter but local elections are held in the summer months and that means that most elections generally fall around that period.  It is a fairly lengthy period to allow people to register their names, from September to April.  One Senator said we were all busy at Christmas.  The purpose of the first Christmas was to register people for elections, back 2,000 years ago and people had to travel to <Col N="272" /> various centres in that part of the Middle East.  We only require people now to fill in a form if necessary or to see their local rate collectors who generally do the registration.</P>
    <P>It is often a problem when people only seem to become interested in being registered for an election on the day of an election or a week beforehand when political parties are doing their rounds in the campaign.  Then we are all blamed because somebody has forgotten to put them on or they have forgotten to check their names on the register of electors. Now is the time when everybody who wants to be sure that he or she is on the electoral register should contact the town hall or the county council office, or, indeed, their post office to see if they are already on the register and, if not, to take the necessary action.  I will certainly look at the situation to see if this is the best period in which this procedure should take place.</P>
    <P>The accuracy of the register was raised by Senator Loughrey who mentioned an inaccuracy in County Donegal.  The law is quite clear as to who is entitled to be registered.  Only persons normally resident in a constituency on 15 September of the previous year are entitled to be registered as electors in that constituency. Obviously, the registration authority do their best to ensure that only eligible persons are registered but they must rely on information supplied to rate collectors by householders.  They will normally accept that information at face value in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  If anybody wishes to have errors in the register corrected, he is entitled to make claims for correction to the registering authority.  The final decision then rests with the county registrar who adjudicates on all claims and I have no function in this matter.  There is of course the option of recourse to the Circuit Court if these various checks and balances do not meet the needs of the voter.</P>
    <P>Senator Willie Ryan raised the question of addresses of towns and villages being shown on the register, some of them with outdated townland names. <Col N="273" /> The question of what address should be used is a matter for the registration authority in the first instance.  However, I will make note of what Senator Ryan said and I will ask the registration authority to ensure that up-to-date addresses are used.  I and every Senator and Deputy who has campaigned in an election will have sympathy for people trying to follow registers, particularly in rural areas.  Even the people living in those areas do not realise that some of their addresses are referred to under some other name.  In a little village in my own constituency, called Ashford, there is only one house and yet the 1,000 citizens who live in the vicinity have the postal address of Ashford, although only the Garda barracks is in the townland of Ashford.</P>
    <P>The motion before us has been welcomed on all sides of the House and this reflects what has happened in the Dáil. We all agree that this is long over-due.  I am delighted that I have had the opportunity to introduce this legislation to allow people, who have contributed to the country, over many years in various ways to vote in national elections.  I thank the Senators for their contributions.</P>

      <P>I had just begun my contribution to this debate on the last occasion and I propose to turn, first, to the divorce issue.  Before doing so I would just comment that it may be regrettable that we have one ominbus report on marriage breakdown which runs to a total of 176 pages.  It might have been better, in retrospect, if the joint committee had issued separate interim reports on the different aspects of marriage law, for example, on custody, on maintenance, on nullity, on barring orders, on separation agreements, on family courts and so on.  Each of these areas is of the utmost importance.  Each of them could be the subject of a very useful and constructive debate in this House.  It is quite difficult, and this is evident from the debate so far, for Senators to do justice to this report in one debate.  Most of us are taking a long time in our contributions, but even so, it is quite difficult to do justice to the importance of the recommendations in this report, to their significance for reform of marriage law generally and to the urgency with which we need the reforms which are put forward in that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to begin my contribution by turning to the issue of divorce.  This was the crucial social question behind the establishment of the joint committee and it remains the central issue in the debate on their report.  Divorce in Ireland is inevitable.  This debate is about whether the Government are prepared to give the necessary leadership and to face the social realities in order to bring about an awareness and a willingness to accept the necessity for a legal remedy for couples and their children who are trapped, at the moment, in an impossible situation.  It requires courage.  It requires a willingness to invest the necessary time and political commitment to that debate.  If the <Col N="275" /> Government are willing to take on board that task &mdash; and some members of the Cabinet have already expressed a personal willingness to do so &mdash; they will find the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown very helpful in the sense that it is clearly pro the need for divorce.  This is different from the desirability of divorce as in many ways divorce is evidence of a failure of a marriage and as such cannot be desired in the sense that one would desire something that was intrinsically good.</P>
    <P>The report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown was much more pro the necessity for the legal remedy of divorce than has been recognised.  The reasons which were given by the joint committee for recommending that a referendum be held, were arrived at after weighing all the arguments.  Having weighed them the conclusion reached by the committee was that divorce was necessary because of the harshness and unfairness of the present law, because of the many anomalies in the law which bring the law itself and marriage into disrepute, and on the basis of the compelling and sad evidence of a steady rise in marriage breakdown.  I will be looking in some detail, as other contributors have done, at the way in which these arguments are presented and the conclusions reached in the report.  Essentially the thrust of the argument and the weight of the evidence is in favour of this country facing up to the need for the legal remedy of divorce: trying up the legal knots on a personal marriage relationship which has irretrievably broken down.  We need that now and we needed it a decade ago. We need a Government who have the courage to face up to this issue.</P>
    <P>I will also deal, at a later stage when I come to the merits of the report, with the context in which we should discuss this issue.  It is extremely important that we appreciate that context: that we are talking about a fundamental social issue with extremely important ramifications for our society, that it is an issue for legislators, that it is an issue for the elected <Col N="276" /> representative to determine the social good in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the debate which has not been sufficiently highlighted, but which is referred to in the report, should be a matter of grave concern to this House as it was to the members of the joint committee.  It is that marriage itself may be on the decline in Ireland.  We cannot be at all complacent because the figures show that there has been a noticeable and definite trend which indicates that marriage is less popular now than it was ten years ago.  The percentage of the population of marriageable age who are marrying is declining steadily.  It declined from 7.4 per thousand in 1971 to 5.5 per thousand in 1982-83.  That is a significant decline in social terms.  Most of us see the evidence of it around us.  We see young people living together but not marrying.  If asked why they are not marrying, they point to the image that marriage has, the trap of marriage, the incidence of marriage breakdown from which parties to a marriage cannot extricate themselves, and more and more people are saying &ldquo;Why should we take that step? &rdquo; We should be aware that not only are they saying it here but that they are saying it in much greater numbers in other European countries, with a different cultural approach to ours, one which we do not have to emulate. We should be aware that a significant proportion, in some countries a majority, of young people are not marrying. If one of the crucial objectives of our examination of this issue is to examine it in the context of recognising the value of marriage and seeking to promote marriage, then we must be aware that at present the case can certainly be made that the absence of divorce legislation in Ireland is damaging marriage.  It is damaging the very relationship which we seek to protect. That is not an overstatement.  The way in which the present oppressive situation has created so many visible problems in our society is actually damaging the value that we on all sides of this House seek to promote, the value of stable lasting marriage.</P>
    <P>The report of the joint committee <Col N="277" /> shows the pressures which lead to marriage breakdown.  It tries, as very few reports of parliamentary committees have in the past, to get beyond technicalities, to look &mdash; sometimes a bit naively; sometimes a bit clumsily &mdash; at some of the pressures on modern marriage.  It examines the pressures on individuals and on couples, and the societal pressures, economic pressures and pressures relating to the different development of members of a marriage and a family.  The committee conclude that the demand for divorce is mounting and will continue to mount as the pressures on marriage increase.  A number of the recommendations are very positive in showing the steps we could take but &mdash; Senator Bulbulia and Senator McGuinness emphasised on the last occasion when this was debated, &mdash; significantly have not been taken to try to support marriage, to try to correct some of these trends and to provide helpful preventive measures and real support and relief to people who are encountering difficulties in their marriage.</P>
    <P>Apart from all the existing pressures that are identified in the report there will be a further element to this debate, when &mdash; I hope very soon &mdash; we begin to consider a proposal to remove the status of illegitimacy, and to consider the general proposals contained in the discussion paper on the status of children.</P>
    <P>I am glad to welcome the Minister of State who will have responsibilities in that regard.  We are about to consider a Bill to remove the legal disabilities for the child or children of a relationship outside marriage.  That is a recognition of a family status.  I hope the Bill will ensure that the relationship between the parents and the child is as fully recognised as can be achieved under our system of law, because the law should accept the reality that stable relationships outside marriage are families.  That is a reality which is recognised as a human right under the European Convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  If we take that step then we as a society are recognising rights in a family relationship outside marriage. <Col N="278" /> If we do that it makes even less sense &mdash; even less social and political sense &mdash; for us to refuse arbitrarily and totally to allow people to re-marry.  We should say, if that is the case, that at a certain stage people would have the choice and the freedom to re-marry.  There will be quite a direct co-relation between the debate on the Status of Children Bill, or whatever the legislation will be entitled and the issues which we are discussing today on this report on marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>At present we have the worst situation of all.  We have a constitutional ban on divorce but a number of different kinds of what may be termed &ldquo;divorce Irish style&rdquo; which do not protect the economic and legal position of spouses and children involved.  We have divorce in Ireland. We all know it.  We all know people who are either calling themselves divorced or acting as if they were divorced.  Yet, there is a total lack of legal protection and legal regulation.  We turn a blind eye on our marriage law.  How can we say that we are concerned about protecting marriage and the family when we just do not want to know and do not want to look?</P>
    <P>What are these Irish style divorces which are increasingly common in our society?  A number of them are available only to those who can afford to take steps to obtain a divorce outside the country. Basically, there are two types of divorce that can be obtained outside Ireland. Increasingly, there does not seem to be too much difference between them, because the currency has been so undermined and attitudes are so cynical that it does not really matter all that much &mdash; even legally &mdash; whether one has a fully recognised foreign divorce or what might be termed a limping foreign divorce.  The effect may be quite the same for the couple concerned.  I would like to explain that.  The only divorce which will be fully recognised abroad is where the parties were domiciled in the country of the court which makes the divorce decree.  That means in effect the husband, because the wife automatically takes the domicile of her husband.  He must be domiciled, in the technical sense of being habitually resident with an intent to continue to <Col N="279" /> reside in that other country.  That sometimes happens, and if it happens then the divorced person may come back and re-marry in Ireland.  I intend to deal later with the question of how that really operates by referring to a passage in the evidence taken by the committee on marriage breakdown.  We are not talking about a court recognising divorce, but about a civil servant in the customs office deciding on whether or not a divorced person can remarry in the State.  We have now got seveal hundred divorced persons remarrying in the State because a civil servant, the Registrar General of Marriages, said &ldquo;Yes, that is one that would have been recognised and therefore you can remarry that person in the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The other type of foreign divorce is the limping divorce, as lawyers sometimes call it, the divorce that would not be recognised in this country.  We have agencies here in Dublin who are in the business of securing for people who are able to afford it a Mexican divorce, a Haitian divorce, or a Puerto Rican divorce.  One can have one's divorce, remarriage and honeymoon all thrown in, all at very knock down prices.  Indeed, to get a foreing divorce one may not even have to leave the country.  It does not matter too much if the divorce is recognised, because you have got the status of being a divorced person.</P>
    <P>If you are well enough off, and equipped with sufficient knowledge to be able to get a foreign divorce of that kind &mdash; even a mickey mouse foreign divorce &mdash; you can have access to Irish lawyers who will ensure that a separation agreement has tied up all the knots internally.  If you have a separation agreement dealing with matters like custody, family, home, maintenance and succession rights, then you have all those issues regulated, and all you need is the status of getting a bit of paper from a foreign country that is prepared to give it to you stating that you are divorced, you can remarry outside the country &mdash; in England or Northern Ireland &mdash; and you have achieved the objective.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are a number of other <Col N="280" /> ways of seeking relief, and they are referred to in the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  These do not go so far as to secure a bit of paper saying that a person is divorced.  Instead you may change your name by deed poll, or even not change your name by deed poll, but just call yourself by the name of your partner, live together as Mr. and Mrs. So-and-So, because the woman takes the man's name.  That is less necessary now because more women, happily, are retaining their own names and there is more freedom in the matter.  Nonetheless, it is one way of seeking to establish some sort of bond between the couple as far as the external world is concerned, some way of affirming the stability of their relationship in the absence of any right on their part to remarry.</P>
    <P>We have the truly sad situation of people who think they are married but who are not.  Those are people in circumstances where one or other was married in the Catholic Church and obtained a Catholic Church annulment and that person went through a second marriage, so they believe that they are married. There has been the tragic case where a couple in those circumstances, when the second marriage had taken place, tried to adopt a child.  The child had been placed with them.  They had gone through the whole procedure, practically up to the door of the adoption board, when it was discovered that they could not adopt a child, that the child should not have been placed with them in the first place as they were not married.  You had this shattering situation where this couple who though they were doing things properly, thought that they had complied with the full marriage law as they saw it &mdash; married in the Catholic Church, Catholic Church annulment, remarriage in the Catholic Church.  The State turns a blind eye on these second marriages.  They are bigamous, but there have not been prosecutions for bigamy.  We do not want to face up to that reality.</P>
    <P>You have the tragic situation, therefore, where a couple may find at a very late stage that they cannot adopt a child because they are not, in fact, married. <Col N="281" /> Or it can happen that the marriage relationship goes wrong and that one or other of the partners gets the advice of lawyers that it is all right: that he or she does not have to maintain or that there is no right to a barring order there.</P>
    <P>This is what we are presiding over.  This is our so-called marriage law.  This is a situation which contributes to the increasing &mdash;&ldquo;hesitation&rdquo; is too weak a term &mdash; aversion of young people to the idea of being what they would describe as trapped into that kind of relationship. This is one of the major concerns which we must have in looking at the whole situation.  You can have the marriage after Church annulment, which is not a true marriage, and you have the relatively high incidence of desertion.</P>
    <P>We are one of the few countries that has a special category in our social welfare code of deserted wives.  You do not have a category of &ldquo;deserted spouses&rdquo; because we have had over a significant number of years the pattern used to justify a certain category: a high incidence of deserted wives which again reflects on our approach to and our lack of support for marriage.  All of these relationships are unprotected or inadequately protected. These are the issues which we, as legislators, must face.  They are the issues which the Government must face up to if they are to come to terms with this problem.</P>
    <P>That is the background to the report and the recommendation on this issue of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. The joint committee operated under a number of time constraints which have already been referred to in this debate.  They were established in July 1983 to bring in a report within a year. In late June 1984 they had to seek an extension to December 1984 and ultimately a further extension up to the beginning of April 1985.  This report was published on 27 March 1985.</P>
    <P>The committee summarised their recommendations on the divorce issue at page 120 of the report.  It is worth referring to this summary because the summary makes it very clear what the <Col N="282" /> considered view and recommendations of the joint committee were.</P>
    <P>The Committee is of the opinion that:</P>
    <P>A referendum should be held in relation to the question whether the Oireachtas should be empowered to introduce divorce legislation.  (Paragraph 7.8.29)</P>
    <P>Any such referendum should be in a positive format, replacing the present Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution with a provision, specifically authorising the Oireachtas to legislate for the dissolution of marriage.  (Paragraph 7.8.29)</P>
    <P>Any such amendment should be drafted in such a way as to ensure that the basic emphasis of Article 41 is not altered, in that the Article should continue to place a duty on the State to protect the family and the institution of marriage and to recognise the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society.  (Paragraph 7.8.30)</P>
    <P>If any such referendum should be held and should be passed:</P>
    <P>(a)A situation of divorce on demand would not be appropriate in this country and would not be acceptable to the people.</P>
    <P>(b)It is essential that adequate safeguards must be built into any divorce legislation to take account of the State interest in fostering and protecting marriage and the family.</P>
    <P>(c)It is essential that any divorce legislation should make proper provision for the protection of the dependent spouses and the welfare of dependent children who might be affected by the grant of a decree of divorce.</P>
    <P>You had a parliamentary committee recommending and expressing an opinion, along the lines I have just quoted, in March of this year.  What has happened since then?  In the course of this debate a number of contributors have referred to the question of the timing of a referendum. <Col N="283" /> Senator Dooge referred to it in opening.  Senators Ferris and Bulbulia also referred to the timing of the referendum which has been recommended by the joint committee.</P>
    <P>The problem is that joint committees, particularly those dealing with such sensitive issues, do not operate in a vacuum. The report of the joint committee was published on 27 March and there has not yet been any Government response.  We know from an interview the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave last month that the Cabinet have not yet considered the matter.  Public opinion is influenced by official attitudes.  If the official attitude is not one of welcome for the report, of noting it and giving early endorsement to what a parliamentary committee recommended, or at least indicating a favourable willingness to have it discussed early in the Oireachtas or the Cabinet, that directly influences public opinion.  It conditions the attitude which the media have, which political correspondents have and which newspaper editors have on this issue.  It is disappointing and even damaging to an affirmative approach to this matter that there has been such a slow and unresolved Government response.  It is as though the Government were adopting the old cliché &ldquo;There go the people and I must follow for I am their leader.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Has it got to the stage when, even though a parliamentary committee have weighed the issues, examined them in great detail and recommended a referendum &mdash; clearly in the context of the necessity to remove the ban on divorce and to introduce the legal remedy of divorce &mdash; the Government are not willing to grasp this issue?</P>
    <P>Attitudes are also influenced by what happens in the Oireachtas.  It is significant that there has not been a debate in the Dáil on this issue.  That is greatly to be regretted.  The issue is of fundamental importance, of prime interest, to the public.  It has been debated in every hall practically in the country.  There have been constant articles and letters in the <Col N="284" /> newspapers, yet it has not been the subject of debate in the Dáil.  I do not think the debate in this House has been as affirmative and committed to the recommendations of the joint committee as would have been desirable.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to the motion and the amendment.  The sequence of events that led to this new Government motion and the amendment being tabled has to be placed on the record.  On 1 May 1985 a motion was tabled in the names of Senators Dooge and Ferris simply noting the report of the committee.  That was normal procedure in itself, but it did not reflect the importance of the Seanad taking a positive approach in a debate on a report of such importance.  A regular formula for this would be to welcome a report, to note certain aspects of it and to seek urgently that it be implemented.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the motion last May was a weak one.  Later it was used to block the moving of a Private Members' motion on 5 June calling for a Government commitment to the introduction of divorce.  That was done for a good reason, in part because on a Government motion the time is not limited.  If it were a Private Members' motion, the House would be limited to three hours which would be quite inadequate for a subject of this nature.  Following a meeting that evening of Labour Senators, an amendment was tabled in the names of most of the Seanad Labour group to the Government's motion nothing the report of the committee. The amendment called on the Government to hold a referendum on Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution within the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, towards the end of June, and totally without consultation or discussion with the Seanad groups, both the Government motion noting the report and the Labour group's amendment were removed from the Order Paper and the motion which we are debating was substituted. This motion welcomes the report, urges the widest possible debate on its recommendations and calls on the Government to consider the holding of a referendum.  It is a sort of moderate improvement on &ldquo;noting&rdquo; but in the <Col N="285" /> matter of giving leadership on this issue and of influencing public opinion it clearly does not represent the views of the joint committee who called for a referendum, the views of the Labour Members of the House and other Senators who believe that this debate does not take place in a vacuum but is influenced by the whole approach to it.  Subsequently, predictably, an amendment was tabled in identical terms to the earlier Labour amendment.</P>
    <P>I propose to support that amendment, as do all other members of the Seanad Labour group, because it represents the sense of urgency we have on this issue, the necessity for political leadership and the fact that a debate can only take place in a focused way on the basis of a proposal for legislation.  If there is lack of leadership on the issue, then a widespread debate is likely to become a divisive and increasingly polarised debate simply because it will represent the increasingly polarised views of one extreme or the other.  Already there has been much debate on this issue.  The striking background to the establishment of the joint committee was the amount of public debate that had taken place outside Leinster House on divorce and on marriage law generally.  We had occasional debates in this House in recent years on the subject but there has not been anything like the same amount of concern expressed in motions in the Oireachtas as there has been at public meetings throughout Ireland.  People's consciousness has been awakened throughout Ireland. People are now well aware of the extent of marriage breakdown and of the concerns that have to be expressed.  What is not needed now is another unfocused debate.</P>
    <P>Apart from the absence of debate in the Dáil and of discussions in the Cabinet, the approach of the Government to the debate here has not encouraged the belief that there is a commitment even to the other recommendations of the joint committee. It seems ironic that last week the Taoiseach came in for a Report Stage debate on the National Archives Bill &mdash; he had a particular interest in that Bill &mdash;<Col N="286" /> but no Cabinet member at all has come in for this debate.  On the last occasion a number of Ministers of State came in, and Deputy Fennell is here today.  That in itself tends to indicate that this is not a matter of high priority at Government level.</P>
    <P>That may not be the case.  It may not be correct, but that is the impression created.  If there is top level Cabinet commitment to accepting the recommendations of the committee then one would expect senior members of the Government to sit in, particularly as the Dáil is not sitting, and to contribute to this debate.  I hope we will see more evidence of political leadership because that will determine the quality of the debate and the formation of an informed public opinion on this issue.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I find the apparent silence and inaction of the Government so hard to understand is the context of the present discussions on a possible Anglo-Irish agreement.  We as a State are seeking to have a consultative role, to have an interest in the welfare of the minority &mdash; the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland &mdash; and we are doing so because of a long appreciation of the political necessity for some externalising of the situation and because the Nationalist community have suffered down the years from the way in which the laws of the country and the policies there have been dominated by one community.  In other words, we are placing great emphasis in the Anglo-Irish discussions on minority rights and minority protection.</P>
    <P>Yet, where is the counterbalance within our own borders?  Where is our concern here to have regard for minorities? I want to explain carefully what I mean by minorities.  In the context of marriage breakdown and divorce I do not mean a religious minority.  There is no evidence at all, &mdash; indeed, the evidence is all to the contrary &mdash; that it is those of a religious minority who seek the right to re-marry by which they mean the right to divorce and re-marry within our State, the Republic.  The vast majority of those who seek the remedy of divorce are Catholics. <Col N="287" /> Nonetheless they are a minority in that they are trapped in marriage breakdown, and are unable to help themselves and they require that the majority who are not affected by this problem have regard for their human situation, their human rights in that situation and are prepared to take the necessary steps. Therefore, there is a direct correlation between what we are doing in negotiating with Britain with a view to having a consultative role in Northern Ireland and our situation within our borders.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not want to be misunderstood. I am not suggesting that we should in some way decide suddenly to address this problem in order to impress or to win over the Unionists of Northern Ireland. We should do it for the quality of our own society.  We should do it because it is right.  We should do it because, paradoxically, we are seeking to do it in another jurisdiction.  We are seeking to secure minority rights in another jurisdiction and to have a consultative role in enforcement and protection of those minority rights, yet we are denying them within our own boundaries where we have sovereignty and full jurisdiction.  At that political level also it is time that we faced our responsibility.  It is time we did hard things.  We are asking the British Government and both communities in Northern Ireland to face up to very hard issues.  We are asking the British Government to do very hard things in securing a fair regime in Northern Ireland.  It is time we had the political courage ourselves to face up to hard decisions.</P>
    <P>The constitutional crusade was launched in this House some years ago. Would it not be desirable that it get a new lease of life from this debate and that we see the carry through in the most obvious and fundamental area of that constitutional crusade: that the Government accept the considered report and recommendations of this parliamentary committee?  We want the Government to look at what was considered by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and say whether they agree, and if they agree <Col N="288" /> that they are prepared to take the steps recommended.</P>
    <P>I have already put on the record the summary of the recommendations on the divorce issue, and I want to consider in detail the arguments which were considered by the committee.  However, I indicated that I would return to and emphasise the overall context in which we are discussing this issue.  We are discussing a fundamental social question: the institution of marriage in our society and whether couples should have a right to re-marry.  That brings into play all kinds of considerations, religious, cultural etc. in assessing the public good. Basically it is a question for elected representatives. It is not a question that anybody else, either a Church or other influence in our society can dictate to elected representatives.  I welcomed the approach adopted by the Catholic bishops in this regard when they came to the public hearing of the New Ireland Forum on 9 February 1984.  Bishop Cathal Daly made a statement on behalf of the Irish Episcopal Conference delegation at the commencement of the proceedings.  I recall one point when applause broke through and interrupted the bishop's contribution. That applause was for the passage which I am about to read out.  That passage was delivered with extraordinary commitment and with a passionate belief by Bishop Daly.  He said, and I quote from page 2 of the report for that day:</P>
    <P>Because a new Ireland could take so many different forms we could scarcely be expected to say what our Christian position would be in reference to this or that specific problem in a united Ireland.  What we do here and now declare, and declare with emphasis, is that we would raise our voices to resist any constitutional proposals which might infringe or might imperil the civil and religious rights and liberties cherished by Northern Protestants.</P>
    <P>So far as the Catholic Church and questions of public morality are concerned the position of the Church over recent decades has been clear and consistent. We have repeatedly declared <Col N="289" /> that we in no way seek to have the moral teaching of the Catholic Church become the criterion of constitutional change or to have the principles of Catholic faith enshrined in civil law. What we have claimed, and what we must claim, is the right to fulfil our pastoral duty and our pastoral duty is to alert the consciences of Catholics to the moral consequences of any proposed piece of legislation and to the impact of that legislation on the moral quality of life in society while leaving to the legislators and to the electorate their freedom to act in accordance with their consciences.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is the legislators who have the responsibility.  It is the legislators who must inform their consciences, who must look at all the considerations and who then must take a decision.  Because a decision would require a change in the Constitution, the electorate also would have an opportunity to vote in a referendum. In summary, Bishop Daly was saying that, first the Catholic bishops would champion the civil liberties of Northern Protestants.  Subsequently I put to him a question as to why, then, were they not prepared at this stage to champion also the position of the religious minorities in the Republic by looking for changes which would recognise fully their civil liberties in the Republic also?  I did not get an answer to that question.  Nonetheless the second point was quite clear: it was an authoritative affirmation that the Catholic Church, as well as the other religious denominations, recognises that this issue raises complex social and other considerations and ultimately is a matter for legislators.  Therefore, that is where we begin our consideration of the issues raised and the arguments advanced to the joint committee.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to put on record that not only can I understand but, I respect very much those on the joint committee and those in this House who do not find this an easy issue to consider and to conclude on.  It is not easy to weigh up the ramifications of any changes in our marriage law which would allow remarriage <Col N="290" /> in our society.  It is most important to have as a priority consideration of the vulnerable position and the financial situation of any dependent spouse or any children of a marriage.  There are a number of complex and important considerations which I will turn to more specifically in a moment.</P>
    <P>However, a parliamentary committee spent 18 month largely focused on examining, taking evidence about and weighing up those considerations.  It concluded at the end of that careful analysis and examination that there should be change, that we should take the step of having a referendum.  That step had already been recommended in 1967 by the earlier all-party committee, but they had not looked at the matter in the same detail.  This committee, who reported in March of this year, considered an enormous amount of evidence in the matter as they were mandated to do.  As Senator Bulbulia mentioned the committee got over 700 written submissions and heard a number of representative oral presentations.  That evidence has now been published and is available to Members of the House.  We are not debating this subject in a vacuum or in abstract terms.  We have the benefit of the very careful and meticulous consideration of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and their recommendation.  What we now need is courage and leadership to carry through on that recommendation and to ensure that the legislation to promote the referendum to remove the ban on divorce is introduced.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the detailed arguments considered by the committee.  Although these have been referred to by other Members, it seems that we must repeat at least in summary form what those arguments were so that Members of the House who were not members of the committee and members of the public more generally will know the considerations that were taken into account, were weighed and that ultimately led that parliamentary committee to decide positively that we should have a referendum to remove the ban on divorce.</P>
    <P>First, I want to consider, starting at <Col N="291" /> page 75 of the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, the arguments in favour of divorce.  The first of these was that the prohibition of divorce is an injustice to those persons whose marriages have irretrievably broken down and who hav become or wish to become involved in other relationships because they cannot achieve any recognition of their new relationships or an adequate legal definition of their status. There is no legislation if force to provide protection for the parties or their children in those relationships&mdash;for example, for maintenance, for succession, in relation to barring orders if there is violence, neglect and so on.  The children of such relationships are illegitimate and the parties suffer substantial disadvantages in areas of taxation and in the right to social Welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The first argument put here in favour of divorce recognises the reality for couples who are caught in a situation where basically what the want is not so much the right to divorce as the right to re-marry. They want to affirm the relationship that they are living in; they want to give it respectability, to ensure that if anything happens to go wrong there are legal rights that flow from that relationship.  The denial of that must be seen as a very harsh penalty for those couples involved, a very severe pressure on them if they want to marry and to legalise their relationships. A very significant number of couples are in that position.  They say it publicly. There are arguments about the statistical figure, but in social terms&mdash;we are talking about the social values in our society&mdash; a very significant number of couples want to marry and we say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, absolutely across the board while both are still alive, unless they can get involved in one of the devious practices I was talking about earlier which give them a divorce Irish style.  They can carry on and do that and nobody will say anything, but otherwise the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  That is the first argument, really one of basic justice.</P>
    <P>The second argument on page 76 points to the fact that all the minority Churches and religions, with the exception of the <Col N="292" /> Church of the Latter Day Saints, do not favour the retention of the blanket prohibition on divorce in the Constitution and consider the availability of divorce legislation as a basic right, notwithstanding that certain of those Churches as a matter of internal discipline disapprove of divorce.  When it gets to that stage, where a committee collect the evidence and the evidence is overwhelming from one minority religious group after another that they favour the removal of the ban on divorce, then how can we say that retaining it is not denominational? How can we say that the prohibition on divorce is not sectarian in terms of continuing in our Constitution since 1937 a denominational view of marriage and the lack of any civil method of dissolving that marriage?  There is a Church method of dissolving it which represents the Catholic doctrinal position and which, for that reason. is oppressive of minority rights in this area.  We should have great concern about it.  We should not do that unless it was absolutely socially necessary.  All the evidence of this joint committee is overwhelmingly on the side of it not being socially necessary or desirable.</P>
    <P>The third argument put forward in favour of divorce is that the constitutional bag on divorce is and the absence of divorce legislation since 1937 have not prevented marital breakdown from occurring and that the level of marriage breakdown has been increasing.  That was accepted among the members of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  Some of the arguments, which I will come to later, against divorce legislation are really criticisms of all the aspects of marriage breakdown such as the effect on children and the effect on the dependent spouse.  All these things are there at the moment, whether we introduce divorce or not. Side by side with that we have to face up to our dishonest attitude towards divorce anyway, where we allow all kinds of half divorces or even in some cases, if people can afford it, full divorces with remarriage in Ireland.  The concerns, the social problems, the worries are already there now in every town in Ireland, because <Col N="293" /> no town is immune from an increasing incidence of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The next argument in favour of divorce is that the breakdown of a marriage is due to the collapse of the relationship between the parties.  The divorce does not cause that collapse but merely affords a facility to give legal recognition to the fact that the marriage has ended while leaving the parties therto free to re-marry.</P>

    <Title>House Improvements Grant Scheme: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment to revise, as a matter of urgency, the house improvements grant scheme.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity of introducing this motion at a time when the building construction industry is in such poor shape.  I cannot recall during my lifetime the situation being anything nearly as bad.  Those who have been involved in the construction for longer than I have been, tell me that in their lifetime they never saw things as bad either.  It is important that anything that can be done to get us out of this situation should be done.  This is one area where it is important that a review be undertaken important that a review be undertaken immediately of the house improvement grants and that the amounts, conditions, scope and other details be improved. I notice that in the amendment it is stated:</P>
      <P>. . . to keep the terms of this scheme under constant review with a view to its enhancement when circumstances warrant it.</P>
      <P>If this had been done, and it should have been done, there would have been no need for this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the housing cost <Col N="294" /> price index which Members will know relates to a base figure on 1 January 1975. This is concerned with the labour and materials used in buildings only.  It does not take into consideration site costs, profits, interest or any other matter &mdash; solely labour and material.</P>
    <P>That base figure of 100 in October 1981 had risen to 285.4 and at 1 September this year the figure was 431.7.  In that intervening period between October 1981 and September of this year the housing cost price index had risen by 146.3 points.  This was a very considerable increase.  Yet there has been no increase in the grant amounts and these amounts are not over-generous &mdash; £200 for the provision of a water supply, £200 for the installation of sewerage facilities, £600 for the building of a chimney and the provision of a fireplace in a house without a chimney, £600 for the provision of a bathroom, £600 for the provision of an extra bedroom to relieve overcrowding and, since 27 April 1982, £600 for major necessary works to the basic fabric of a house.</P>
    <P>The grant will not exceed in any case two-thirds of the approved cost, which is worked out by the Department. There is no question whatever but that if these amounts were small when the scheme was introduced in 1981 they are totally out of date now and unrealistic.</P>
    <P>I am very indebted to the Department of the Environment, and indeed to the Minister, for details which I received regarding the payment of grants in the past ten years.  In 1975 the amount paid under this heading was £2.4 million; in 1976, it was £2.8 million; in 1977, £2.4 million; in 1978, £6.4 million in 1979, £16.0 million; in 1980, £18.5 million; in 1981, £19.4 million; in 1982, £4.4 million; in 1983, £6.4 million; and in 1984, £6.7 million.</P>
    <P>Those amounts include grants for reconstruction, water and sewerage for single installations and for disabled persons and essential repairs grants as well as the special grant to reduce dependence on oil.  There were three separate house improvement grants and one special scheme in operation at different times <Col N="295" /> during the period concerned but I do not consider it important to go into the details of those.</P>
    <P>With regard to the high payments in 1979, 1980 and 1981 there were a number of reasons, apparently, for this.  Chief among these was the special scheme to reduce dependence on oil which was introduced as an emergency measure in the wake of the second oil crisis.  During the short duration of this scheme, some seven months, the cost to the Exchequer was £14 million or £2 million per month. In addition the decision to abolish all reconstruction grants from 1 February 1980 and the stipulation that the work had to be completed and applications for payment received by 30 June 1981 was responsible for an inordinate number of projects being brought forward than would otherwise have been the case.</P>
    <P>To those who would say that before this scheme was introduced the grant payments for improvement were abolished I should like to point out that regarding those very high levels of payments in the years, 1979, 1980 and 1981, in round figures for any one of those years the payments as they were then would have been greater than the payments for 1982, 1983 and 1984 added together.  Therefore, there is no question but that the amounts are totally unrealistic and out of date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the importance of the improvements grants, as I have said, the building construction industry is in very bad shape and because of that factories engaged in the manufacture of furniture and carpets or in other ancillary business sutter also.  It is in our interest to do everything possible to improve this situation. Everyone of us realises the importance of these grants.  The Construction Industry Federation had the following to say in a circular which was sent to all Senators and Members of the House regarding house improvement grants.  I quote from page 6 of the circular:</P>
    <P>This is not a V.A.T. or taxation question but the Minister's comment would be appreciated.  We have one <Col N="296" /> million or so dwellings in this country, of which at least 250,000 are 60 years old or more.  While all our housein needs continuing maintenance, it is when the age of a house reaches 60 year or so that major refurbishment can become necessary.</P>
    <P>Yet we have a very limited scheme of improvement grants which accounted for £6 million in 1984 with a further expenditure of £5 million on local authority loans and other local authority improvement schemes.  That is a total of £11 million or about 3 per cent of 1984 Public Capital Programme expenditure or £377 million on housing.  Does this represent an adequate investment by the State in maintaining our older housing stock?  I would answer unquestionably that it does not.</P>
    <P>With regard to the scheme I should like to refer briefly to some aspects of it and in particular to the regulation regarding commencement of work.  At paragraph 3 of the document, &ldquo;House Improvement Grants&rdquo;, it is stated that:</P>
    <P>It is an absolute condition of eligibility under the housing improvement grants scheme that work must not commence before the Department's Inspector visits the house.  Therefore, you should make your application well in advance of the date on which you intend to start work, and you would be well advised not to start immediately after the inspection but to wait until you get a decision on your eligibility and on the amount of the grant (if any) to which you are entitled.  A grant will be refused if you are started before the Inspector arrives.</P>
    <P>This is a penal clause.  The criterion should be the necessity of work to the House.  Grants should be geared to improving the housing stock solely.  Very many people have suffered a loss they could not afford because they had done some very small part of the work before an inspector called.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> The procedure is completely different with regard to a new house.  The condition in that respect, as outlined at paragraph (ii) of condition (c) of the circular is that relating to new house grants:</P>
    <P>You have not occupied the house for more than one year prior to the date on which your application for a grant was received in the Department</P>
    <P>so one could be up to a year in a new house before applying for the grant.  Yet if one does a small part of the works for improvement one is disqualified.  The people who suffered were people who tried to affect necessary improvement to their houses, people who needed an extra bedroom, the installation of water and sewerage and so on.  I am sure Members on all sides will agree that the procedure up to now regarding the relevant grants is gravely wrong.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to all those in the Department who administer the grants, the officers, engineers and various people involved, but there are long delays in the administration and payment on grants. These could and should be avoided.</P>
    <P>I remember some years back the then Minister for Local Government, Mr. Tully introducing a pilot scheme in Country Meath where the grants for new houses and reconstruction grants were administered by Meath County Council. That scheme was a great success.  The amount of paper work involved was reduced.  Travelling expenses were reduced.  People who were involved could call into the central office in Navan rather than have to get in touch with the Department of the Environment.  There is everything to be said for decentralisation, including savings in administering the scheme.  Again, this is something which would not be controversial and something with which all Members of the House would agree.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the grant could be brought more up-to-date, for example, in the area of solar energy, an area in which it would be worthwhile encouraging people to build conservatories for passive solar energy because it has been proved that a simple conservatory, a <Col N="298" /> glazed extension on the south side of a house, would be a great advantage as regards solar energy.  This sould even be encouraged in new houses.  In order to encourage this development, a conservatory area should not be included in the area for grant purposes.  The qualifying maximum limit for new houses is 125 square metres or 1,346 square feet.  The Minister should encourage people to make use of passive solar energy.  It is the cheapest form of solar energy in this country.  It has been proved worthwhile. If the Minister encouraged it in that way, both in new houses and in old houses as part of the improvement grant scheme, it would be well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Regarding the essential repairs grant, paragraph 17 of the regulations stipulate that:</P>
    <P>A grant under this scheme may be paid to a person only where the housing authority (i.e. County Council) is satisfied that a house situtated in a county health district cannot be made fit for human habitation in all respects at a reasonable cost and that the repairs in respect of which a grant is proposed to be paid constitute at least the repairs that are necessary in order to prolong the life of the house.  Full details and application forms are available from the County Council in your area.</P>
    <P>This is an important grant, although the maximum again is only £600.  The regulations vary in the different counties but in County Meath I believe the house has to be in very bad repair and only one elderly person occupying it.  In other words, an elderly couple may not qualify. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.</P>
    <P>Why is this grant not paid in the urban areas?  In County Meath we have three urban districts &mdash; Trim, Navan and Kells. A loaf of bread costs the same in an urban area as it cost in a rural district.  If anything, houses in the urban areas may be in far greater need of this grant.  I can see no logical reason why people within an urban boundary cannot avail of the grant.  I realise it is administered and paid for by the county council but why is somebody entitled to it because he lives outside <Col N="299" /> the boundary while somebody living on the other side is not entitled to it?  This does not make sense.  It is an aspect I would like the Minister to look at.</P>
    <P>With regard to the disabled persons grants, again this is an important scheme but the maximum amount payable is £4,000.  That was inaugurated in the late seventies.  The amount may be unrealistic. I know from experience it is a very important grant.  In the Dublin area those who are qualified to avail of it have the plans prepared for them free of charge by the local authority.  This is a facility that should be extended to all areas.  It is most important.</P>
    <P>We have another important grant which is housing aid for the elderly.  In may area it is administered by the North-Eastern Health Board.  It is for making the basic fabric of the house habitable and no major works are included.  The work is carried out in co-operation with AnCO which, again, results in a further saving. In County Meath the money has been used up for this year.  There are 380 people on the waiting list and about the same number has already been attended to.  The work mostly consists of the fitting of doors, windows, fireplaces and painting. These small works enable people to live in their homes.  It keeps them out of hospitals, county homes and State care: in other words, it is a saving for the State. This is something the Minister might be able to look at to see if it would be possible to increase the amount of money available for these works.  We have a short list, a medium list and a long list in the figures that I quoted.  Some of the people quoted may be on the long list and they may never qualify for inclusion. It is an important scheme and it would not take a great amount of money to continue it for the full year.</P>
    <P>I made a plea before to this House for thatched houses and I would like in these circumstances to do so again.  We have a unique heritage of beautiful thatched houses.  I have done a study of thatched house in County Meath and found that fewer than 100 of them are inhabited. These will never be replaced.  It has been <Col N="300" /> said by concerned people that they should be bulldozed down but I would not agree with that.  I attended a meeting of Bord Fáilte officials in Slane in the past year at which Minister Bruton spoke very enthusiastically and rightly of our unique heritage of traditional houses, which included thatched houses.</P>
    <P>This State has never erected a thatched house.  Local authorities have not erected thatched houses and I would not expect them to do so.  They were built in times when money and materials were scarce. It is most important to preserve this tradition of thatched houses.  In the North of Ireland thatched houses, especially those considered important, are listed and grants are payable for the preservation of those grant houses.  I ask the Minister to introduce such a system here, to list the houses that are worth preserving and to give whatever grants are necessary to preserve them.  It would cost roughly £2,000 to have a small thatched house rethatched.  On the Bord Fáilte literature the thatched house is included as a symbol of Ireland.  I was disappointed that in the recent White Paper on tourism policy this was not covered.  On page 26 under the heading &ldquo;General environment for tourism&rdquo; it states:</P>
    <P>The attractions of Ireland as a tourism destination can be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>(1) Scenery and natural environment . . .</P>
    <P>In that area of scenery and natural environment it is most important to preserve all our traditional houses and to give sufficient grants and sufficient financial assistance to the owners to preserve those buildings.  I ask the Minister to consider very sympathetically this plea that I make for the preservation of thatched houses.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude with a small extract from the policy submission of the Construction Industry Federation dated September 1985.  On page 4 it states under &ldquo;Housing Repair and Maintenance&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>It is estimated that a minimum of 50 <Col N="301" /> per cent of all repair and maintenance expenditure on private houses is done in the black economy.  This is the sector which is most open to abuse in the industry.  It is not restricted to small works valued at £1,000 to £2,000 but extends right up the scale to include major refurbishment and extensions. In order to promote legitimate employment, it is necessary to introduce a substantial refurbishment grants scheme or reintroduce te residence related tax incentive scheme at a sufficiently high level to fully offset the competitive disadvantage suffered by registered contractors.  We estimate that 2,000 to 3,000 legitimate jobs would be created in the industry by such a measure.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to consider increasing the amount of grants.  This is an important scheme and many people would like to avail of it.  The amounts are unrealistic having regard to present-day expenses.  They should be increased..</P>
    <P>Above all, I appeal to the Minister to delete the absolute condition of eligibility. The Department of the Environment make the point that it is not easy to decide when an inspector calls what works are new where an old house is concerned.  From personal experience I would say that this is not alway so.  Perhaps, a case could be made to fine people in some small way, where they would lose part of the grant if they did not apply in time.  I acknowledge the importance of applying in time but the present condition is penal and bureaucratic and I ask the Minister to consider deleting it.  I also ask him to consider the other points I have raised in my contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad <Col N="302" /> Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;noting that a scheme of house improvement grants was introduced by the previous Coalition Government in October 1981, following termination of the earlier schemes by a previous Government in February, 1980, welcomes the investments in home improvement work which has resulted from the current scheme and calls on the Minister for the Environment to keep the terms of this scheme under constant review with a view to its enhancement when circumstances warrant it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All of us recognise the importance of the house improvement grants scheme. Therefore, for any Government to tamper with the scheme or to abolish it as happened was, in my opinion and that of the beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries, a retrograde step.  For that reason, I wich to put on record that we welcomed the decision of the Coalition Government in October 1981 to introduce the new scheme.  That scheme provided £200 for the provision of water supply, £200 for the installation of sewerage facilities and £600 for the building of a chimney and the provision of a fireplace in houses without a chimney.  During that period when oil was cheap many houses were built without a chimney and to this day local authorities are saddled with houses that were determined by the Department as not needing a chimney because at that time central heating was used to a very great extent and it was thought it would be the future source of heating.  Thus, the grant of £600 was vital.</P>
    <P>There was also the provision of £600 for bathroon facilities.  There are many houses, particularly in rural Ireland, that have no bathroom or toilet facilities.  For that reason, it was important when the Coalition Government re-introduced the grants scheme that that sum of money was included to ensure that the basic necessities of life would be grant-assisted by the Department.  There was also a need to provide additional bedroom <Col N="303" /> accommodation where there was overcrowding and a grant of /pounds/600 was included for the provision of additional sleeping accommodation where there were large families.  Many local authorities availed of the scheme for their own houses and they benefited from that scheme introduced by the Coalition Government in 1981.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to houses built by local authorities.  In my own area we have the kind of houses that a previous Minister, Deputy Molloy, advocated should be built.  It was then called low cost housing . It was then understood that if a local authority did not get any allocation for housing purposes.  They were foisted on the local authorities and to this day we have such houses.  We have them in the Carronreddy estate in County Tipperary, in Woodview estate in Cahir, in Killenaule and in Clerihan.  These were low cost houses but now this Government have to reconstruct them to make them habitable.  This is included in the national plan and an allocation was made in the 1985 budget but it will take us years to overcome that on error that took place in low cost housing schemes.  We welcomed the decision of a previous Minister, Mr. Tully, who ensured that local authorities would in future build houses of a standard that equalled or surpassed private housing and the number of such houses built last year was greater than ever before.  Last year alone over 7,000 houses were built and I wish to compliment the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, for that dynamic policy in providing local authority houses of such a high standard.</P>
    <P>During the time the previous scheme was suspended there were two extensions of the completion dates which were published in the newspapers.  In the period 1979 to 1980 there was talk about the abolition of the scheme and it was eventually abolished by Fianna Fáil in February 1980.  Because of the abolition of the scheme all the works in which people were engaged were brought forward and the grant allocation was increased from £18.5 million to £19.4 million.  Because <Col N="304" /> of economic problems many people were not able to complete the work.  In spite of our best efforts to notify people of the extension of completion dates many people panicked.  In many cases they carried out genuine reconstruction work but they were no aided by the State because they did not met certain guidelines. Initially they did not need approval and did not know there was a deadline.  In many instances there was no grant assistance for genuine reconstruction work.</P>
    <P>We welcomed the fact that the Government them introduced a new scheme.  To overcome the problem that had been left to us by a previous Government, we had to set down some criteria regarding approval for any new works.  The Department, in budgeting each year, need to know the level of claims under this heading and, for that reason alone, I must accept that approval is necessary.</P>
    <P>Some months ago the minister gave one exemption, namely, where urgent roof repairs were necessary because of exceptional storm damage.  Apparently if a person had submitted an application and then had to telephone the Department to tell them the roof was about to collapse verbal approval was forthcoming. I understand that was the only exemption.</P>
    <P>Final inspection is vital to ensure that the standard of work carried out is satisfactory. To protect the investment of the applicant and that of the State, if is important that there be final inspections to ensure that work is completed to a proper standard.  There is still a problem for some people in the area of approval and inspection.  Part of the work may necessitate planning permission or occasionally planning exemption.  In such a case a local authority engineer visits the applicant and gives an opinion on the spot as to whether the work about to be carried out is in accordance with proper planning.  Because an official tells an applicant to carry on with the work, in some cases he starts it on foot of that verbal, or sometimes written, approval from a planning officer.  He does not know that further additional approval is required from the Department of the <Col N="305" /> Environment. There are some anomalies in people's minds in this area.  People have genuinely started work, which normally would be grant aided by us, but because they did not get formal written approval from the Department of the Environment, they are debarred from getting the grant.  That is an anomaly and that is why I ask the Minister to keep the terms of the scheme under constant review.  He must now know the mumber of people who are debarred from getting grants because of the technicalities.  Senator Fitzsimons referred to this and I agree that the answer is somehow in the area of devolution of power.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons also mentioned two other vital schemes which run smoothly because the decision is made by people on the ground.  The reconstruction grants for disabled persons, for instance, are operated by the local authorities.  The work is inspected by the local authorities and approval is given by the local authorities. In the region of £1 million is provided for the special scheme run by the health boards for the care of the elderly. That is not enough.  Th scheme is for old people living alone who want to carry out minor repairs to their homes.  They do not have to make a contribution themselves but the important thing is that the decision is made at local level.  I ask the Minister to have regard for his own commitment in &ldquo;The Reform of Local Government&rdquo;, section 5.5 (a) of which sates:</P>
    <P>The administration of the grants scheme for group water and sewerage schemes, and of grants for new houses and for house imporvements will be assigned from the Department of the Environment to local authorities. There will be an urgent examination of other devolution possibilities including the driver testing scheme and the issue of certificates of driver fitness.</P>
    <P>That is in the Minister's own document which those of us who are local authority members have received and hav welcomed. I ask him to put that section of the devolution document into play as soon as possible.  I know that will involve <Col N="306" /> discussions between the existing inspectorate who carry out this work on bhalf of the Department and those who do the work on behalf of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I know we cannot initiate such a change without consultation between the two sides concerned.  However, those consultations should take place at an early date and agreemnt reached on the devolution of powers such as the approval of grants. If that happens a major change will tate place in this area of reconstruction. People can identify with a local engineer. They can telephone such a person who is in their area regularly.  They should not have to depend on engineers from the Department of the environment who are based at some regional centre and must be get them to carry out inspections.  The cost involved in that system must be astronomical in comparison to what it would be if it was administered at local level.  Any savings achieved in administration could be passed on to the applicants. They are the people we would like to help.  I hope that in the spirit of the amendment we have tabld to set the record straight the Minister will respond positively to us in trying to ensure that wat is a very important scheme is reviewed continuously and improved when circumstances permit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all agree with many of the things Senator Ferris has said, especially in the latter part of his speech when he referred to the local authorities. The motion calls upon the Minister for the Environment to revive, as a matter of urgency, the house improvement grants scheme.  The main reason for seeking that is very obvious.  Under the existing scheme a grant of £200 is available for the provision of a water supply; £200 for the installation of sewerage facilities; £600 for the building of a chimney; £600 for the provision of a bathroom; £600 for the provision of an extra bedroom to relieve overcrowding and £600 for major necessary work to the fabric of the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anybody takes the various grants under those headings and sets them against the total cost of the repair work <Col N="307" /> he would find that the grants are not sufficient, in many cases, pay the cost of the ncessary preparation work, such as having maps and plans prepared. Indeed, I hope the Minister will consider updating the amount of the grants.  The grants at present are the same as those which were available many years ago. If one looks back one will see that the amount of the grant available for new houses 20 or 25 years ago was a major portion of the cost of the work.  If we are to preserve the houses we have an keep them in a habitable condition we will have to make reasonable grants for this maintenance available to the people who own them.  In doing so we are also saving Governmnt money in the long term.  We swhould remember that every time on of those houses goes beyond repair the local authority have to pick up the tab to provide housing accommodation for the family cocerned.</P>
    <P>There are many houses owned by people who are on the housing list of various local authorities which, if there was a reasonable grant available, could be improved to a habitable standard.  A grant of £200 for the provision of a water supply is totally inadequate.  If a person has to bore a well £200 will not go too far.  We must consider also the extra costs involved in providing pumping factically £200 to it.  That does no include the cost of providing the septic tank and the piping.</P>
    <P>The £600 grant for the provision of an extra bedroom to relieve overcrowding is also insufficient.  The Minister should look at the conitions attached to the provision of extra bedrooms in houses. In many dwellings the bedrooms may b small but people are beging refused on the grounds that there is no sufficient overcrowding.  In many cases people propose doing the work before the overcrowding develops, before somebody's health is damaged.  Where there are <Col N="308" /> reasonable grounds for the provision of an extra bedroom a grant should be allowed.</P>
    <P>At the tim the person may have the necessary finance to carry out the work but due to family commitments when the extra accommodation is necessary he is not in a posiong to carry out the work.</P>
    <P>Many peopole find that when they are finished the repair work it has cost two to three times more than they had budgeted for.  Let us look at the grants as they stand at present.  A grant of £1,400, the combined maximum, is a very small amound for a person involved in the reconstruction of a house.  In that regard we must consider the amount available to a person building a new house in the form of grants and mortgage subsidy. Reconstruction grants should be in line with the amount available to such people. I suggest a figure of £6,000, the amount available to peopl in Northern Ireland ho wish to reconstruct a house.  Senator Cregan seems shocked at the suggestion but i ask him to consider if it is not better to pay a sizeable grant to make a house habitabl and likely to last a further 40 or 50 years rather than having the house condemned within a few years resulting in the State, through the local authority, having to house that occupier?  We are all aware of the cost of local authority houses today.</P>
    <P>The regulation concerning the date of the commencement of work should be reexamined. In most cases grant applicants must obtain planning permission before they carry out the work.  That involves a visit to the site by a local authority engineer.  That inspection should be sufficient rather than asking an applicant to await the arrival of an inspector from the Department.  Such a change in the procedure would result in a majour saving to the Department in that there would not be any question of paying travelling expenses.  A local authority engineer could carry out the inspection just as well as an inspector from the Department.  It is the old story of duplication but it is an <Col N="309" /> area that the Minister should look at.</P>
    <P>Many people have to wait a long time before an inspector visits the site and that results in long delays.  All public representatives are aware of applicants who lay the foundations before the arrival of the foundations before the arrival of the grant.  The old system wherby a person could apply even if the work was completed should be re-introduced.</P>
    <P>The essential repairs grant of £600 is insufficient.  We must bear in mind that amount of money will not to very far in the replacing of windows and doors. Will the Minister consider insisting on the use of hard wood in house repairs?  It might cost more initially but in the long term it would be of great benefit to the tenants and local authorities.  We are all aware that when local authority houses are eight or ten years old window and door problems develop.  Those problems are not due to the fact that the manufacturers of the windows supplied faulty goods but because soft wood was used in their construction.  Major problems arise because of the use of soft wood.</P>
    <P>The grant of £4,000 towards the cost of adapting a house for dasabled persons is insufficient.  That work can be very expensive, particularly in modern houses.  An alteration to a doorway to permit a person confined to a wheelchair to gain access can cost a lot of money. The aid scheme for the elderly would be a good one if sufficient funds had been provided.  I understand that £1 million has been allocated for that scheme but that amount will not make any impact on the problem.  A grant of £600 to help those peopl is insufficient.  The net result is that local authorities have to provide prefabs and other structures to accommodate old people.  Many of them, if the amount of the grant was greater, would be prepared to invest money in bringing their house to a habitable state rather than having to spend the remainder of their time in a house they would never own.  Old people feel they lose their sense of security then they are forced to move from their homes.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the grants are the same as those that applied in 1981. <Col N="310" /> There has not been any allowance for the increase in the cost of materials or the additional burdens people must face from the rise in the cost of living.  The grant system is in need of overhaul.  I suggest that the VAT paid on goods used in such reconstruction work be refunded to the pople involved.  Such a refund would mean that people carrying out the work would have a sizeable amount of money available to them.  I suggest that the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, consider that, particularly if he does not intend to increase the reconstruction grant.  All documentation in regard to the purchase of items used in the reconstruction work would have to be produced so that a person does not get a refund of the VAT paid on a washing machine, for instance.  Under the farm modernisation scheme farmers get a refund of the VAT on building materials. Such a move would encourage people to carry out the necessary repars to their homes.  Finance should be provided for those who are anxious to remain in their own homes.</P>

      <P>In the area of housing grants and subsidy for either new or old houses and in the provision of water and sewerage grants, group water scheme grants ect., I can assure the House that we are no administering the most comprehensible and flexible package ever of incentives to house owners and house purchasers in the history of this State.  When the previous Coalition, of which I was a member, took office July 1981 there was the totally unacceptable sitution that for the first tim since 1924 no grants were available from the Department of the Environment for house imporvements.  The reason for this situation was the decision taken in February 1980 by the then Fianna Fail Government to abolish the scheme of grants which operated at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="311" /> Consideration of the necessity for a house improvement scheme at the time had to be seen against the background that the total housing stock exceeded 900,000 houses.  A total of 49,000 houses had an external water supply only, while a further 38,000 lacked any supply. Regarding sewerage facilities, 43,000 houses had external facilities, while a further 98,000 completely lacked the facility and 185,000 houses lacked a fixed bathroom or shower.  On top of all this, there were many houses which had been constructed without chimneys and, in addition, account had to be taken of overcrowding from the point of view of sleeping accommodation.</P>
    <P>Following the abolition of the grant scheme none of these essential works could qualify for financial assistance.  This was a lamentable situation and one that had no doubt caused hardship to very many families.  When they took office in June 1981 the Coalition Government were very concerned that the continual absence of grant assistance would have serious adverse consequences for the improvement of the national housing stock.  Also, many less well-off families would be denied the opportunity of providing in their houses the necessary basic amenities and standards of accommodation which are taken for granted by most of the community.  Accordingly, the new house improvement grants scheme introduced in October 1981 was specifically planned to make an impact in the areas where the social and accommodation needs were most pressing.  The scheme therefore introduced the concept of specific grants directed at the most pressing kind of needs.  Thus separate grants were made available under the new scheme for both water and sewerage facilities, reflecting the fact that a significant number of houses lacked these fundamental amenities.</P>
    <P>Another grant was provided to meet the acute needs of families where there was overcrowding because of inadequate sleeping accommodation.  By providing in the new scheme for special grant assistance for necessary extra bedroom accommodation <Col N="312" /> the Government demonstrated their concern to assist families in this situation in the most economic and convenient way possible.  Similarly a new grant was introduced to enable families which did not have bathrooms to provide this essential amenity.</P>
    <P>Finally, a grant was provided for the building of a chimney and the provision of a fireplace in a house which did not have a chimney.  As Members are aware, many houses were built during the sixties and the early seventies without chimneys. Senator Ferris has referred to this already. For a number of years, in the aftermath of the first Dáil crisis in 1973, special grant assistance had been made available for the provision of chimneys and fireplaces; but this assistance was also discontinued from 1 February 1980.  As there was still a good number of houses without chimneys, the inclusion of the grant for the provision of a chimney in the 1981 scheme was designed to avoid discrimination against the families in question and also to allow families the option of burning solid fuel.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, it will be seen that the scheme introduced was very much socially orientated and targeted at the provision of basic essential amenities and at the improvement of living conditions where this was necessary.  To be fair, it is appropriate for me to acknowledge at this point that the scheme was subsequently expanded by the then Fianna Fáil Government in April 1982 to include also a grant for carrying out major necessary works to the basic fabric of a house.  This action by that Government was taken shortly after taking office and was in direct contrast to what had been done by them in early 1980.  Clearly, it reflected an acceptance by Fianna Fáil that their earlier decision to terminate payment of improvement grants was indeed a major miscalculation.</P>
    <P>The scheme as administered at present provides for a maximum of £2,400.  Furthermore, the position previously was that an application for a grant was required, where particular facilities did not exist, to carry out almost all the works covered by the existing scheme before the <Col N="313" /> house owner could qualify for payment. The present scheme was so structured from its introduction that an eligible applicant can carry out each category of work separately and qualify for payment according as the particular works are completed.  There is also the special arrangement that works commenced within a three year period are regarded as forming one scheme for grant purposes. This arrangement allows for an applicant to obtain a grant for, say, the provision of a bathroom and later on qualify for grant assistance under other categories provided such work was undertaken within the three years of the commencement of the earlier works.  This flexibility is of great value to many people who might have difficulty in funding various grant-aided work simultaneously.</P>
    <P>Of course, the real test of any house improvement grants scheme is the level of response generally by the public.  In the case of the present scheme total applications received amounted to 11,500 in 1983 and increased further to just under 12,200 in 1984.  Further growth is taking place this year and the indications are that applications this year will exceed 15,000.  It is heartening to be able to put on record this increased interest in the scheme, especially as in my view it illustrates the relevance of the scheme to people's needs.  As is the case with most schemes of this nature, there is always scope for review; but in the present circumstances the cost factor, as Members will appreciate, must be of vital consideration, especially when the Exchequer is also providing about £50 million overall in housing grants and mortgage subsidy.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that in the spirit of the amendment to the motion now before the House I intend to keep the terms for the improvement of the grant scheme under review and it is my intention to bring forward new proposals when, in the light of the response to the scheme by house owners and the overall financial and economic situation, that course can be seen to be warranted and I assure the House that that on-going review is taking place right now.  I am not in a position at this stage to suggest when <Col N="314" /> improvements would become available until we speak with other areas of Government, but that review will be and is taking place and I will, I hope, be in the position in the months ahead to be able to talk further on this.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to an area that has been raised by Senators on both sides of the House, and this is to the problem of prior inspection.  I have some sympathy and, as a Deputy who has to make representations on behalf of my own constituents, I have seen the difficulties that can arise.  Senator Ferris made an attempt at explaining the problems.  When I give an explanation for its necessity, I think Members will agree that there is some legitimacy in the requirement of prior inspection.  Prior inspection, which is a statutory requirement provided for in the housing improvement grants regulations in 1983, was imposed to ensure that applicants would know in advance that the work would qualify, what the Department's requirements were and the amount of the grant, if any, available, in order to avoid the situation where the applicants might be disappointed and naturally embarrassed by going ahead with the work in anticipation of a grant and finding subsequently that they were not eligible for one reason or another.  Also the Department experienced considerable difficulty in establishing eligibility in the past under various schemes particularly where only works commenced after a certain date qualified for a grant or where certain criteria could not be checked after the commencement of the work.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, from the point of view of accountability there was no option but to introduce such a condition.  It is also very much in the applicant's interest not to embark on a costly scheme of works and subsequently find that he or she was either totally ineligible for grants or not eligible to the extent anticipated.  The existence of this requirement has been publicised in the press on a number of occasions since the scheme was introduced. Also, the matter has been exhaustively dealt with over a prolonged period <Col N="315" /> in correspondence with public representatives and, indeed, the public in general. Again, an explanatory leaflet is issued as a matter of course to all who make requests for applications under the scheme.  In both the leaflet and the application there is specific prominent reference to the requirement.</P>
    <P>In addition to all this, applicants are advised to make their applications well in advance of the date on which they intend to start work and not start immediately after the inspection but to wait until they receive a decision on their eligibility and on the amount of the grant, if any, to which they are entitled.  A grant will be refused if work is started before the inspector arrives and his report confirms that this is the case.  However, where more than one category of work is proposed and where one category has commenced a grant may be allowed for the other provided that it qualifies in its own right.  Senator Ferris suggested that in the plans for the reorganisation of local government these grants would be devolved to the local authorities and I hope to be bringing in a Bill which will allow that in the future.  I agree with the Senators who spoke about the duplication of work in this area.  Devolution to local authorities would, indeed, reduce that type of duplication.</P>
    <P>Many queries have arisen already at this stage of the debate and I would like to respond to them but with more speakers to come it would be best that I respond again to them, or my Minister of State will have the opportunity to reply to many of the queries which have been raised both by the proposer and by those who have proposed the amendment and support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, I welcome the proposals put forward about the problems of house improvement grants.  I, like other speakers, would be worried about the problem of trying to create constructive work in the construction area.  I would like to emphasise constructive work because, for example, in 1977 the Department gave £2.4 million to the public in home improvements <Col N="316" /> grants.  In 1978 with the change of Government it was increased to £6.4 million and then a policy was implemented on 1 November 1977 to improve the grants from £200 to £600 for reconstruction, from £50 to £200 for water, from £25 to £150 for sewerage &mdash; an enormous increase from £275 to £975 with a cost to the State in that year of £16 million.  It was further increased in June 1979 with a cost to the State in 1980 of £18.5 million.  Then the grants were increased again by the State in allocations to the people of £19.4 million in 1981. Because of delayed applications the money was allocated.</P>
      <P>At that time approximately £20 million a year was being allocated &mdash; £500,000 a week &mdash; and with moneys of about £950 going to each eligible person that represents about 500 houses per week.  In all sincerity, can you blame any Government, even though they were Fianna Fáil, saying that at the start of 1980 they would have to stop this because it was literally totally out of control?  That on 1 November 1971 there should have been envisaged a 200 per cent increase in grants gave no consideration to what that meant.  In fairness, in 1980 the Minister for Finance was perfectly right in saying to his Cabinet that that could not continue. All they had done was to throw the money out the window, and that is not saying that the people who needed it most were getting it.  There were many more constructive ways in which that money could have been spent.</P>
      <P>Between 1977 and 1982 the Government were literally irresponsible.  At the start of 1980, when they knew it was totally out of control, they said they could pay out no more and nobody could get anything.  The less well off do not get anything; the person who wants to get necessary work done does not get anything, but the person with plenty of money and who applies for extra or nicer windows, not an essential improvement in windows, could get £600 for that.  Is that very good policy as regards Government control of people's money, in a country that is not really that old?  It is totally irresponsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> I am very worried about the lack of work in the construction industry at present. There are avenues where we could be creating work in the construction industry, especially in the home improvements grants area.  A Senator pointed out a few minutes ago that when part of the work was started no grant was paid because the person got some help.  Did the teacher concerned get help from the fellow next door?  Would the public agree on a person getting £1,000 for digging his own trench with the person next door helping him?  Where is work being created? Where is the person who should be doing that work?  Are the right people working at it?  We have a responsibility to ensure that if we are spending the taxpayers' money in giving to people grants which are very necessary at times, the people doing the work are people registered to do so.  That is the most important point.  Should one give £600 to two teachers to help each other with a trench, when they are already working? That is totally irresponsible and unfair to the rest of the community.  People think it is good that extra work is going on in the construction industry and the construction industry admits that, but many areas are in serious question.</P>
    <P>There are many people drawing money from all areas and yet they are not saying whether they are working in the construction industry.  Cement sales are an instance.  In all the money spent in 1980 by the Government of the day, cement sales totalled 1.8 million tonnes.  In 1981 sales totalled £19.4 million for 1.4 million tonnes, a decrease, yet more money was spent.  That was readily admitting that something was wrong, that the money was not being spent in the construction industry.  The figures are there.  In 1983 cement sales were at 1.3 million tonnes and in 1984 they were at 1.2 million tonnes.  That is an unwelcome decrease, but the money is not being spent on grants.  They have been reduced by nearly £10 million.  I would like to see cement sales going up and more grants being paid out but I would like to see more registered people working.  I do not like people telling me that they are not working <Col N="318" /> and then if I look for them on a Tuesday or Wednesday they are missing because they are part of the black economy in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>I know of a private builder with contract tenders in Cork Corporation totalling about £7 million, yet there are only 56 workers on his workforce.  Across the city I am spending only £2.2 million and I have 122 workers.  Can anybody explain to me how he can build a scheme of 166 houses and, I think, another of 66 houses at a total expenditure of £7 million and a total workforce of 56 while on the other side of the city we are spending only £2.2 million to build 110 houses and we have 122 workers there?  Who is responsible? The answer I am getting back is &ldquo;Denis, we got the tender in'.  The tender is there, he is supplying the houses, but who is doing the building?  Who is providing the work and who has the expertise?  We know who has the expertise; it is the people who are doing one thing one day and working the other day.  We are not prepared to say it.  We should be saying it.  We have a responsibility to say it.  If there are areas in the construction industry where we can get legitimate work, we do it legitimately and we are prepared to give good grants to people.  There has been talk about urban renewal.  As other Senators have said, there is a rapid deterioration in inner cities and towns and these areas need to be revitalised.  A scheme should be got together between the public and private sectors to revitalise these areas, both acting legitimately.  For instance, if we can acquire 3,000 sq. ft. or 4,000 sq. ft. of upstairs accommodation that can be revitalised in towns or cities, we can give a private concern the go-ahead to start such revitalisation.  We can tell them &ldquo;We can guarantee that we will take the accommodation, we will provide the people to go into the accommodation and we will pay you for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that way a legitimate workforce is employed.  But it is readily admitted within the construction industry that there are builders employing the black economy.  We are not saying enough about that.  How can you get on top of it?  Can you blame people for getting £100 <Col N="319" /> per week for plastering a ceiling and a couple of walls and then £100 elsewhere? We are not responsible enough to say that we will legislate money.  This is what this Government did.  Credit must be given to the Coalition Government for doing this legitimately in 1981.  They will readily admit that they spent £8 million in 1984 in grants.  I would really like to see it improve.  I would like to be able to say to people &ldquo;Yes, I will give you £2,000 if you are spending £8,000, but you must guarantee that the person on the exchange at present must not be on it next week&rdquo;.  How do you do that?  We must give people motivation but at the same time we must be legitimate about it.  We cannot pretend not to know the person who is going to dig the trench so long as it is dug, and more luck to the person who is going to get £600 or £900 from the State.  I see nothing wrong with affluence as long as it is evenly distributed.  We have no right to say that we are going to give money to people who are not in need of it.  That is irresponsible.  Fianna Fáil did that in 1978, 1979 and 1981.  They then found out that this was wrong and irrespective of who the Minister was he was perfectly right in saying that it had to be stopped.  He did that.</P>
    <P>I would like to make another point with regard to the number of people employed in the construction industry at present.  For every 100 persons employed in that industry in 1982 there are now only 52.  That is very serious.  But when you look at the cement, sand and gravel sales, the reduction of 48 workers out of 100 between 1982 and now is not justified. We should not be saying that the same number of people should be gone because of the reduction in sales of cement.  Sales have been very much reduced but it does not compare with the number of people who are idle in the construction industry. The Construction Industry Federation will readily admit that there has been a reduction in all purchases of materials. Let me make the point that in the construction industry only 23 per cent of everything used comes from other countries, and it is a pity we are not making <Col N="320" /> sufficient use of the raw materials we are producing here.  The present situation where only 52 out of 100 are working in comparison to four years ago readily proves that there is a massive black economy. That is the main point I want to make.</P>
    <P>With regard to house improvement grants, we should be getting together with the private sector to create an initiative whereby deteriorating buildings in cities and towns can be revitalised.  There is a rapid deterioration in my own area of Cork.  We cannot, however, do that if we are not going to be responsible for who is doing the work.</P>

      <P>It is widely recognised that the building industry has for a long time been on its knees &mdash; in fact, some people now say it is flat on its belly.  This motion tabled by the Fianna Fáil Party will, I hope, help in some way to restore confidence in the building industry and at the same time alleviate some of the hardship and deprivation that exists in many areas. When the debate is finalised I hope the Minister will realise that the adoption of this motion will have a two-pronged effect.  First, it will act as an incentive to the building industry and, second, it will help to remove the anomaly which exists at present between the home improvement grant scheme and the new house grant scheme as they now operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total housing stock is now approaching one million dwellings.  It is quite modern, with almost 400,000 dwellings completed since 1970.  Yet at the same time we have some 250,000 to 300,000 dwellings, or some 30 per cent of the housing stock, which is over 60 years of age.  The investment in the renewal of our housing stock is very low.  £10 million was paid out in home improvement grants and loans in 1983 or 2 per cent of total public housing expenditure of £530.5 million capital.  At present the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses, of which I am privileged to be a member, is drawing up a report on the construction <Col N="321" /> industry.  Since we started this report we have become very perturbed.  As has been stated, there is a black economy about which we are very concerned. There are many ways in which we can improve the building industry but the kernel of the problem, as I see it, is that there are so many houses at present without proper toilet or bathroom facilities. In spite of very genuine and sincere efforts to try to alleviate this problem we have not to date succeeded as we would like to succeed.</P>

      <P>The matter I wish to raise on the Adjournment is one of the continuing education of a profoundly deaf child.  I have given the name and address of this child to the Minister for Education so that she &mdash; and I have no doubt the Minister of State &mdash; will be aware that there has been some correspondence about the case with me and with others.  At the outset I should like to say that I have arranged with Senator Robb that he may have a short period at the end of my 20 minutes to add to what I have to say because he has a special contribution to make from the point of view of his knowledge of the Northern Ireland situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to this child, the best thing I can do is to give a sort of brief history of her.  She is now 11 years old and has completed her primary education.  In her early childhood she became totally deaf because she suffered from meningitis. But, unlike many profoundly deaf children, she was not deaf from birth and, therefore, had already learned to speak and was in a slightly different position. When she recovered from her illness her parents, who were very anxious that she should have the best possible education, studied the options open to them.  They decided, because she had already been able to speak and because she was psychologically assessed as being of a <Col N="323" /> very high level of intelligence that they would make a great effort to have as normal an education for her as possible. For a while after her illness she went to the Celbridge No. 2 national school along with ordinary children and, along with that, to the deaf clinic at Harcourt Street Children's Hospital.  This went on for two years.  This was because the parents were living in the Celbridge area.  It was a very difficult and expensive thing for them to keep up so they decided for the good of their child to move house to the Terenure area.  They sent her to Rathgar Junior School, which is a private primary school where there is a very low number of children per class as compared with the average number of children per class in a national school.  Also, there was previous experience in this school of teaching deaf children.  She attended this school and also the deaf clinic at the same time and came to the end of her primary education in which she did exceptionally well.  She is well up to the standard of hearing children of her own age group.  In that sense she is in a profoundly different position from many deaf children who have attended special schools for the deaf and who may be doing quite well but are really not at the same level of education as ordinary hearing children of the same age.</P>
    <P>When it came to the end of primary school the parents, naturally being concerned about their child's welfare, went on to investigate the possibilities for the future.  They thought, first of all, of sending their daughter to the High School in Rathgar where her sister attended.  But the pupil-teacher ration in that school, as in most secondary schools, was about 30 children per teacher.  They were informed that they would not get more than a one-hour weekly visit from a visiting teacher for the deaf in the school. They felt that it was impossible for a totally deaf child to keep up with the standard of education there with this amount of extra tuition.  They also investigated St. Mary's School for the Deaf in Cabra, which is a Dominican convent school, and felt that, while it offered a <Col N="324" /> great deal to profoundly deaf children who had been deaf from birth and who were having a certain level of education, it did not prepare children for a full leaving certificate examination.  They might have one or two children doing one or two subjects in the leaving certificate, but they did not prepare children for a full education and training such as a child would have in a normal school.  The parents, conscious of their duty to their child, went further and discovered that in England there was a grammar school called The Mary Hare Grammar School, which was specially orientated towards deaf children who were of full educational ability and which gave &mdash; a term which is not usually used in this country &mdash;a grammar school education.  I feel sure the Minister of State understands exactly what I mean by an academic secondary education to a high level where children were specially taught so that they would be able to sit public examinations on the same basis as hearing children.</P>
    <P>For these parents, who are members of the Church of Ireland, this school also had the great advantage that it was an interdenominational school but, generally speaking, of a Protestant ethos and atmosphere.  They considered this; and the child sat the highly competitive entry examination for this school and succeeded. She took the competitive interview to get a place in this school and succeeded.  It is quite rare for somebody to get into this school and to reach this standard of education and she has had this enormous success.  But the crunch came then &mdash; the fees for this school were higher than the parents could afford to pay and they applied to both the Department of Health and the Department of Education for help.  The Department of Health, I understand, indicated that they would give up to £2,000 a year to help towards the boarding element of the school, but the Department of Education have hitherto refused to give any help at all.  The reasons they are giving, as far as I understand them from the letter sent by the Minister's private secretary to the parents, were that the child could go <Col N="325" /> either to Rathgar High School, to Ballinteer Community School or to St. Mary's School for the Deaf in Cabra.</P>
    <P>I have already said why the High School, Rathgar appeared to be unsuitable and, <i>a fortiori,</i> Ballinteer Community School, which was a larger school with larger numbers in the classes, and the same level of help for the deaf, is equally unsuitable.  It is not really possible for a girl who cannot hear at all to keep up with ordinary children in this sort of school with this level of numbers of pupils in the classes.</P>
    <P>As far as St. Mary's School for the Deaf is concerned, I have already said that they are not geared to this particular type of grammar school education for children of high ability, but also there is the religious problem.  It is perfectly true &mdash; and I must admit this straightaway &mdash; that the Church of Ireland chaplain for the deaf accepts that St. Mary's School is suitable for Protestant children whose parents wish to send them there.  No doubt this has been pointed out again and again by the Department of Education. But &mdash; and this is a very big &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash; Catholic schools are Catholic schools and they are very proud of that fact.  All of us will have read Catholic educators emphasising the importance of the ethos and atmosphere of a Catholic school and how it affects the pupils &mdash; and more power to them.  Of course, that is what they want and, of course, that is what the parents who send their children to Catholic schools want.  And they have every right to choose that kind of education. But it is not an education which necessarily appeals to convinced Protestant parents, who naturally want to have their child brought up in a school with a concomitant Protestant ethos and Protestant atmosphere or, at the very least, an inter-denominational atmosphere.  When I say &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo; it can be things as simple as the fact that if you go to a convent school, you will find that the place has plenty of statues &mdash; whether moving or otherwise &mdash; and has pictures of a type which are distinctly Catholic.  All the other children attend Mass with the exception of two or three who are the <Col N="326" /> odd ones out.  When a parent does not mind that, it is fine, but if parents object and feel strongly about it, it is unfair for our State authorities to say that is the choice they have, the choice they have to make and to refuse to give a unique child in many ways this chance.</P>
    <P>Interestingly enough, in the 1972 Department of Education report on the education of children who are handicapped by impaired hearing, which was a basic document about the education of the deaf, it is stated in section 7.50, page 118 that provision for Protestant children should be made to have them admitted to suitable schools in Northern Ireland or Britain.  Clearly either the Department of Education authorities have not read this report or they do not believe what is said in it.  It seems very undesirable that such pressure is being put on these parents in which they are given the alternatives of sending their children to an ordinary Protestant school, like High School, which is really not suitable for deaf children, or to a deaf children's school which is educationally not suitable and to which they have a conscientious religious objection.  An extremely valuable part of our education system is the enabling of children to attend schools in accordance with their own religious ethos and background.</P>
    <P>This is surely one of the things that was envisaged in Article 42 of the Constitution about parents' rights to educate their children.  Hearing children are given this choice by the operation of grants through the Protestant secondary education committee where they have not got means to attend the schools of their religious choice.  In addition, the State goes out of its way to provide transport for Protestant children to go to Protestant schools and this is very much appreciated by Protestant parents.  Here we have a deaf child who is being refused this right. She is also being refused the best type of education that she can have.  It contrasts rather strangely with the situation in Northern Ireland to which Senator Robb is about to refer and will show that the present situation makes rather a nonsense <Col N="327" /> of the kind of attitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs setting out to protect the rights of the minority in the North against religious discrimination.  It also makes nonsense of the Forum report if we behave in a much more discriminatory fashion than the authorities in the North.  I will now yield to Senator Robb to add to what I have said.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator McGuinness for this opportunity to speak on behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Poynton and Emma.  I am very well acquainted with the ex-vice-principal of the Jordanstown School for the Deaf and he assures me that the one example that I know of personally where Catholic parents were anxious not to have their children educated in the Jordanstown School for the Deaf because it did not have a Catholic ethos were facilitated by the Department of Education in the North financially and also sympathetically encouraged to look elsewhere for the education which they wished, which was in Dublin.  This is not a once off, it has happened on a number of occasions and without any fuss.</P>
      <P>Senator McGuinness spoke about legislation which should entitle this child to education in Britain or in the North. We would appeal for reciprocity particularly at this time of Anglo-Irish dialogue. I also question whether what has taken place contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights.  With these three matters in mind I appeal to the Department and particularly to the Minister to look again at what is happening to young Emma particularly in the light of what Senator McGuinness said about her ability and also about her parental preference. Choice is of the essence and it is up to the Irish Republic to show an example in this area if it is serious in its intentions of enticing the rest of Ireland into unity with it.</P>

      <P>My Department and I had a considerable amount of correspondence in relation to this case.  I came from Cork to Dublin to deal with this <Col N="328" /> matter because it is an important one, but I did not have time to go through the file in great detail.  The matter before the House tabled by Senator McGuinness is:</P>
      <P>The failure of the Department of Education to provide for proper educational facilities for a profoundly deaf child who resides in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There are proper educational facilities for deaf children in Dublin and these are available to the child in question.  The child is a girl who has been educated hitherto at ordinary national schools, with additional speech training at the children's hospital in Harcourt Street.  She also had the services of a visiting teacher of the deaf for a few hours each week. Visiting teachers of the deaf are employed by the Department of Education to assist pupils who are hard of hearing but who are otherwise capable of benefiting from education in an ordinary school.  I am happy to say that it has been reported that the child has made remarkable progress.  She is now 12 years old and due to commence her post-primary education.  The normal venue for the education of profoundly deaf girls in Dublin is St. Mary's School for Hearing Impaired Girls in Cabra.  This provides for the primary and post-primary courses for pupils from all parts of the country on both a residental and a daily attendance basis.  It has a full range of staff, equipment and facilities and is the equal of any school for the deaf and hearing impaired anywhere.  It would be a more suitable and proper educational facility in this case in view of the child's residence in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the only option.  It is possible, as this child has demonstrated in her primary education, for a deaf child to attend an ordinary school if sufficient additional help in facilities appropriate to the case are made available.  In correspondence with the parents two ordinary post-primary schools, in addition to St. Mary's, have been suggested.  These schools have had experience of catering for children with various kinds of handicap. If either of these schools was chosen the services of the visiting teacher of the <Col N="329" /> deaf would continue to be available to the child and it would be a matter for my Department to consider what further back-up services might be necessary.  The way the subject for debate was phrased does not give any indication that there is any question of the Department being asked to fund the education of the child outside the State.  In fact the Department were requested to pay for the education of the child at a school for the deaf in England, plus the cost of regular transport to and from that school six times a year.  Nobody with expert knowledge of the education of the deaf maintains that the English school is educationally better or more appropriate than the Irish schools for the deaf.  The advice of my Department inspectorate is that the school for the deaf in Cabra is internationally recognised, has been in existence for over 100 years and has pioneered the development of educational service for the deaf in this country.  Some children from the North attend this school in Cabra.  The stated reason for the parents wishing to send their child to school in England is they are members of the Church of Ireland and would like to send her to a school under Protestant or inter-denominational management.  There is no indication of the phrasing of the subject for debate that there was a religious dimension in the matter but since I am aware that the Senator knows that there is that dimension I will deal with it briefly.</P>
    <P>The Cabra schools were founded by and are still under the management of Catholic religious orders as the Senator already mentioned.  I cannot accept that this would constitute any ground for the Department to fund the education of an individual child in a foreign school at a cost nearing £9,000.  St Mary's Cabra, has hitherto catered for non-Catholic pupils and has respected in every way their denominational affiliation, including the need for special suitable arrangements for the religious education of pupils.  At a recent count there were three non-Catholic pupils in the post-primary sector of the school and a total of ten such pupils in the schools altogether.  Facilities are available for visits to the school by a <Col N="330" /> Church of Ireland minister.  If all this were not sufficient the school in Cabra is officially recognised as a national school and rule 69 (2) (a) of the Rules for National Schools states:</P>
    <P>No pupil shall receive or be present at, any religious instructions of which his or her parents or guardians disapprove.</P>
    <P>It would be unwise for the Department to agree to finance the attendance of a child at a foreign school where adequate facilities exist in this country.  To do so on denominational grounds would leave the Department open to requests for members of various denominations in the country who, on the grounds of the special needs of their children, could request financial assistance from the Department to have their children educated at special schools abroad because such schools under the relevant denominational management are not available here.  I am advised, given all the circumstances of the case, that a favourable decision to grant-aid the education abroad of the child in question is not justified on religious, educational or financial grounds.  Such a decision could be seen as reflecting strongly on the educational provisions made in this country.  It could also be construed as inequitable discrimination in favour of one family as distinct from many other families in similar circumstances with regard to the religious denominations and educational needs who have found the educational arrangements made for their children in this country quite acceptable.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I have an interest in this case because I am responsible for special education.  I accept advice.  I am not an expert on matters of that sort but I accept the advice from those people who are qualified, trained and who have spent years in the special education branch of the Department of Education.  The inspectorate, with whom I discussed the case, are satisfied that the educational facilities available to this child are adequate.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness made a point of <Col N="331" /> which I took note and Senator Robb also made some points.  I intend to look further into them and I will communicate with them.  Senator McGuinness said that there was not a full range of subjects available for leaving certificate students at St. Mary's School.  My information is that that is incorrect, but I intend to have a further look at that and will communicate with the Senator.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb made the case about the constitutional matter in relation to this child and the right to be educated at a school of her choice.  I am not a legal expert but we have advice on this from the Attorney General's office, because <Col N="332" /> we took a very serious view of this, and we are advised that we do not have a constitutional obligation to provide what is demanded by both Senators here this evening.</P>
    <P>I will have another look at the points raised here.  My information and advice from everybody concerned is that the facilities available to this child are adequate, that other Protestant people are availing of the services here and are quite satisfied with what is provided in St. Mary's School in Cabra.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 16 October 1985.</P>
