      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Lynch that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to exploit the completion of the extension of Saint Oliver's post-primary school, Oldcastle, thereby honouring the commitment given and approved by the Department of Education in 1969, when the Gilson school was amalgamated with the Meath VEC.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Brian Mullooly of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The position of those students in the National College of Art and Design who applied for and were accepted into a four year degree course in Art and Design Education, since it now appears that the College is not and never was in a position to provide this course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard both matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Lynch's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator <Col N="730" /> Mullooly may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in that order.  Regarding No. 2 a commitment was given by the Leader of the House that this would be given a priority position on the Order Paper.  Unfortunately, the Department of Health was not in a position to respond to it today and the most important thing from the Leader's point of view was that the House would have an opportunity to discuss this within the statutory period of 21 sitting days.  Today is the eight sitting day of the House so there is no urgency about the actual date for it to be taken. It will be taken as soon as possible, but definitely within the time to meet with the wishes of the movers of the motion, Senators Brendan Ryan and Catherine McGuinness.  It is also proposed that we adjourn for tea from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different inconveniences involved in postponing a motion.  One is that it is inconvenient for Members of this House and in my view when things are inconvenient for Members of this House, then the House should do its best to facilitate them.  But when an undefined body called a Government department finds something inconvenient and one of the Houses of the Oireachtas reorganises its business in order to meet the convenience of an undefined body called the Department of Health, it seems that the sovereignty of Parliament, apart from any other inconvenience might be threatened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the Department of Health being inconvenienced by the taking of this motion today, the people who have proposed and seconded the motion are considerably inconvenienced by it not being taken.  I find it somewhat offensive that I am informed in good faith, when I inquire, that this motion is being taken today and then the first time I hear officially that it is not being taken is when I <Col N="731" /> come in here to hear the Order of Business. Then I am told it is not because there is a problem with this House but because some undefined body, not a Member of this House and not answerable to this House, called the Department of Health, finds it inconvenient. Now, of course we have another 13 sitting days, but it would be very helpful to know when we are going to take it, because commitments that are entered into in good faith as I know they were, should always be honoured or, if they cannot be fulfilled, alternative commitments should be made and made with the same concern for people's convenience as seems to apply only to those unnamed persons in Government departments.  I bitterly resent the manner in which this motion was brought on to the Order Paper, listed as the second item on the agenda and then apparently pretty casually dismissed because it would cause inconvenience to people who are not part of this House or Members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just like to join Senator Brendan Ryan in what he said about No. 2 on the agenda, particularly as I am well aware that the commitment to list the matter on the Order Paper was made in good faith by the Leader of the House, and there is no possible blame attached to him with regard to the fact that it was not taken. Also, it seems that it would have been convenient for the Minister himself to take it this afternoon, because the Minister is here to deal with the Nurses Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I feel it is not the Minister's convenience that is in question but the convenience of &mdash; as Senator Ryan says &mdash; unnamed other persons who, so far as I understand, did not become aware that this was listed until a late time, despite the fact that they were supplied with the information.  I do not like to see motions which have been put down by Members of this House &mdash; certainly with much greater inconvenience to my colleague, Senator Ryan, than to myself but at the same time with inconvenience to Members of this House &mdash; removed from <Col N="732" /> the Order Paper by what appears to be some kind of bureaucratic slip-up rather than any fault on the part of the Leader of the House or any inconvenience on the part of the Minister himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what my two colleagues have said; of course they are right.  I want to ask the Leader of the House about a matter which I raised last week, Item No. 22.  I pointed out last week that we, rather sanctimoniously, passed a motion condemning the hanging in South Africa two weeks ago.  I asked the Leader of the House last week what plans this Government had for allowing time for a Bill which is on the Order Paper here to be discussed in this House, that is the Bill to abolish hanging.  The Leader of the House said that he was in discussion with the Minister for Justice about this matter.  I would like to know whether the Acting Leader of the House is defending the refusal of the Government to give time to the abolition of hanging in this country because it is the policy of his party and when he intends to give time to Item No. 22.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unusual for me to be getting up here and not criticising Ministers for their discourtesy to the House; it is refreshing to find that the discourtesy being shown here today has apparently been shown by officials.  It does seem strange that since the Minister is in the House this particular matter could not be discussed because it does not seem to be a very controversial one.  I am not too sure whether controversy could arise on it but nevertheless it is obviously something which is going to have many repercussions throughout the area of health for elderly people.  Therefore I feel it could be discussed today, especially when it is proposed to take Items Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 on the Order Paper today.  I cannot see how we can take Items Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 today.  I would like to know, from the Leader of the House, what he means by taking those Items and having a break between 5.30 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.  The Report Stage of the Nurses Bill is obviously going to take a certain <Col N="733" /> amount of time.  I cannot see that Item No. 3 will be disposed of in a very short time and obviously, Items Nos. 4, 5 and 6 will take a considerable time.  I would like to know exactly what the time scale is.  Are we going to continue with Item No. 6 before going to Items Nos. 4 and 5, since we have already started that discussion? What exactly is the time scale for today's business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>To put the record straight, it is a matter for the House to decide on the Order of Business.  I have suggested it in the order announced at the beginning. One of the questions arising is the commitment of the Leader of the House to item No. 2.  Far be it from me to defend the Public Service or a Department, particularly when the Minister is present, but I would like to put it on the record of the House that the Department were only aware of this resolution this morning. Where the communications breakdown was, I do not know.  What I am suggesting is that if the Minister is to respond properly to this motion, he would have to be briefed.  The motion is not specific in that it does not give reasons why the order requires to be annulled.  Perhaps if this was communicated by the movers of this motion and if the Minister was in a position to respond to it at the end of the debate on the Nurses Bill, 1984 &mdash; I cannot determine how long that will take but if it were completed quickly and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not.  It is the right of this House to discuss the legislation fully.  If the Nurses Bill, 1984, is completed within a reasonable time and if we can have some communication from the movers of item No. 2 as to what area they are concerned about, then a proper briefing could possibly be available for the Minister at a later time during the day to enable him to take item No. 2. The Leader of the House in giving his commitment said he did not want it to be established as a principle or as a right to have it taken but he felt that the House would want to facilitate the Members <Col N="734" /> within the statutory sitting days.  There will still be ample time to do that.  It does not remove the motion from the Order Paper.  We would probably be in a position to take it tomorrow morning or, if the Senators could facilitate us, we could probably take this evening.  That is a matter for the House.</P>
      <P>With reference to Senator Lanigan's question, I have no idea how long any of these items will take.  We will take them in the order I have announced them for today, as tomorrow's Order of Business could be different.  With regard to item No. 22, the Leader of the House gave a commitment to Senator Ross last week that he would have discussions with the Minister for Justice with a view to finding out when it could be taken.  I would like to apologise for the Leader who is absent through circumstances outside his control. I did not enter into any consultation with the Minister for Justice; the Leader of the House did and gave that commitment. I do not know what the response in that case is.  The motion will be on the Order Paper and the matter can be raised again when the Leader of the House is present.  The Senator can then find out what the response was to his discussions with the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>I think the Order of Business as I have proposed it is not unreasonable.  If Senators Ryan and McGuinness will communicate with me afterwards, once we have got into discussion on the Nurses Bill, then we can decide whether we are in a position to take item No. 2 later on today and then it would be a matter for the House to decide if this was all right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Just on a point of information, and in defence of the officers of this House, I would like to say in reply to what Senator Ferris has said <Col N="735" /> that my understanding is that the officers, in their normal course of duty, sent the proofs of the Order Paper in the ordinary way to the department and to say that the department only heard of it this morning is not quite exact and I would not like it to be thought that the officers of this House were at fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I wonder if the Leader of the House could tell us when item No. 21 will be taken, the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1985, or if the Bill is being withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, may I ask the Acting Leader why we are not going to continue on with item No. 6 rather than start on item Nos. 4 and 5 which are related subjects and possibly could be taken together.  We have started the Annual Report on the Ombudsman.  Most of the items on the Order Paper within the last few months have been dealing with reports from committees or from various bodies.  It would be much better if we could finish off the business on hand before heading into other areas.</P>
      <P>There is a certain amount of heat generated in this Chamber verbally from time to time but I do not think there is any need for the waste of energy that is going on at present and for the past three weeks.  The heat in this Chamber would drive anyone out of it; I am not talking about verbal heat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had explained my position regarding the Order of Business. It is a matter for the House to agree to it or not.  I think I am not unreasonable, as I have tried to facilitate Senators Ryan and McGuinness on item No. 2, and if they will communicate with me afterwards so that we can get a proper briefing we may be able to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other questions will not arise unless we complete the order I have suggested and then, of course, the questions raised by Senator Lanigan will come into <Col N="736" /> play.  He discussed with the Leader publicly last week the advisability of taking certain resolutions together.  The Leader replied in detail as to why that could not be done; but a commitment was given by him that No. 4 was a matter of some urgency.  This was raised by other Members, it was suggested that it should be taken and that is why it is on the Order Paper.  It is a report from the Joint Committee on EC Legislation and it takes note of developments there.  It is one in which a lot of Members have an interest and there are people prepared and ready to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the matter raised by Senator Ellis, I suggest he consult with his own party to decide on the priority they want for any particular legislation. It is not withdrawn or otherwise.  It is still on the Order Paper and will be ordered by the Government at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>We have three amendments.  Amendment No. 2 is an alternative to amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 3 is consequential on amendment No. 1.  Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 may, therefore, be discussed together.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 12, to delete lines 41 to 50, and in page 13, to delete lines 1 to 8, and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;20.&mdash;(1)  Where a person who is either an officer or a servant of the Board is &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)nominated as a member of Seanad Éireann, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)elected as a member of either <Col N="737" /> House of the Oireachtas or of the Assembly of the European Communities, or</P>
    <P>(c)regarded pursuant to section 15 (inserted by the European Assembly Elections Act, 1984) of the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977, as having been elected to such Assembly to fill a vacancy,</P>
    <P>he shall thereupon stand seconded from employment by the Board and shall not be paid by, or be entitled to receive from, the Board any remuneration or allowances in respect of the period commencing on such nomination or election or when he is so regarded as having been elected, as the case may be, and ending when he ceases to be a member of either such House or such Assembly.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments, and they relate to section 20 of the Bill, is to protect the employment of staff of An Bord Altranais who may be nominated for Seanad Éireann or who may be elected to either House of the Oireachtas or to the Assembly of the European Communities or regarded, pursuant to the European Assembly elections legislation, as having been elected to the Assembly until the commencement of such nomination or election.  I should explain that the present position is that under section 21, which is the standard provision for statutory bodies, a person would stand seconded from employment by the board for the period of his or her nomination as a Member of the Seanad or appointment to the European Assembly or nomination as a candidate for election to either House or to the Assembly.  Objections were raised in the Seanad, notably by Senator Patrick Durcan, to the provision regarding nomination as a candidate for election to the Seanad on the grounds that under the current Seanad electoral legislation a person can be so nominated without his or her consent and cannot then withdraw <Col N="738" /> his or her candidacy.  It was contended that valuable persons may be lost to statutory bodies because of nomination for election and they may not in fact succeed in being elected.  I have agreed with Senators that this is an undesirable situation and I propose to amend section 21 accordingly.  I feel, however, that following the precedent which I set on the Combat Poverty Agency Bill, any amendment should also provide protection for persons who are nominated for election to the Dáil and to the European Assembly.  The amendment before the House now provides accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would simply like to say that I welcome the Minister's amendment and in doing so I want to indicate at this stage that I will not be moving amendment No. 2 which is in my name and the name of Senator John Browne.  I welcome the fact that the Minister appreciates the difficulty which the section as originally drafted and passed by the Dáil would create.  I am glad the Minister has responded to the arguments which we raised at Second Stage and again on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I would make the broad point that since this Bill came before the House last July it has had a lengthy and thorough debate.  I want to thank the Members of the House for their contributions.  The Bill has been amended in several respects since it first came before the Dáil in May 1984.  The amendment today on the election of Members or staff I shall have to bring back to the Dáil.  There can be little doubt now but that cohesive and comprehensive legislation has been enacted.  I want to thank not just Members of the House but also the nursing profession, the very many representative bodies and the many individuals who made representations to me and to Members of all sides of this House and also the Members of the Dáil in relation to the Bill.  In the very early stages I did invite comments from interested parties on the Bill and I certainly received them in abundance, both written and verbal since the Bill was initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final comment before we hear the views of Senators is that it was gratifying to me and to my departmental colleagues <Col N="740" /> to find such an extraoidinary level of interest in the Bill among nurses and among personnel connected with the health services generally.  I admit that my exchanges with them have not been without some contention on occasions but that is part and parcel of putting new legislation on to the Statute Book.  I would be concerned if a major Bill of this nature had been received with apathy in the areas it directly concerned.  We now have a Bill which is a worthy addition to the Statute Book and is a very firm foundation for the regulation and development of nursing for many years to come.  I thank Members and you, A Chathaoirleach, for your assistance in facilitating a constructive debate on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I call Senator Fallon, I want to say the debate is wide open and Senators may talk for as long as they like but only once and only on what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not be very long. As the Minister has said, this debate has gone on since May 1984 and the Bill has been discussed not just by politicians but by nurses.  The man in the street has taken a particular interest in this legislation.  I would like to pay tribute also to the great nursing profession we have in this country. My hope would be that this Bill would be appropriate for the needs of the nursing profession for many years to come. An Bord Altranais have been very successful and tribute should be paid to them again.  They have done a good day's work for the nursing profession.  New medicines and new techniques are bringing dramatic changes.  We come back to the question of perhaps one of the disappointments in the Bill in that we did not introduce the conscience clause.  This clause operates in the North of Ireland in some form.  Many nurses would have a great welcome for a clause of this nature because of the changing times ahead. Perhaps in the future it can be brought in somewhere else.  In the last few weeks as a result of the problem in the Galway Regional Hospital more and more nurses <Col N="741" /> have taken an interest in it.  Since that episode nurses have written to me more than ever before on that section.</P>
      <P>Overall, we are in for a period of change in the whole area of medicine. This Bill provides for the establishment of a board to be known as An Bord Altranais.  This board will provide for the registration, control and education of nurses and other matters relating to the practice of nursing and the persons engaged in such practice.</P>
      <P>My hope will be that when the election for places on this board takes place the nursing profession will give very serious consideration to the type of people they would like to have on the board.  They will have in many ways total control of the board.  One of the biggest changes that has taken place is that the Minister has increased the number of nurses by election from 15 to 17, which was a significant move.  I know that the nursing profession, as a result of all the discussions and debates that have taken place right across the board, will give a lot of consideration to the type of people they would like to have on the board. That is very important.  It should be highlighted that when the elections begin for this board only the very best of the nursing profession will win their places in those elections.  My hope is that this legislation will be appropriate for the years ahead, whether it be 25 or 45 years, and that the new board whenever it is elected will have a very successful tenure of office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are living in a time of tremendous change and we, as legislators, have a duty to recognise that fact. In so far as we legislate for particular interest groups in our society we have a duty to ensure that the legislation we enact reflects that change and caters for those interest groups in a protective way in the years to come.  I believe that in our debate and deliberations on this Bill and in the legislation we have ultimately produced here we have done that.  We have on the one hand established a framework within which the nursing profession can develop constructively and openly over <Col N="742" /> the next 20 or 30 years.  On the other hand, we have recognised the individual nurse as somebody who has a particular relationship with a patient, a relationship that is different from that of a doctor and a relationship which reflects very much the positive characteristics and the caring capacities of that individual nurse.  I would compliment the Minister for getting that balance right in this Bill.  It is difficult to get that balance right.  It is difficult in an age when the nursing profession will increasingly be under threat of attacks of various kinds.  It is increasingly difficult to get that type of balance right and to ensure on the one hand that they are protected and on the other hand, the public they serve are protected and given the kind of service they deserve.</P>
      <P>The new board, as the Minister has said, will be dominated by nurses.  These nurses will be representative of the broad range of the nursing profession.  That board is a suitable mechanism to guide the profession forward.  The fitness-to-practice procedures which we have established within this Bill are adequate.  They are also procedures which get the balance right as between the rights of the nurse and the rights of the members of the public.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill in relation to education and training of nurses and particularly the provisions in relation to registration.  If this type of legislation is to be effective there must be an adequate registration system.  The current system of registration of nurses is unsatisfactory in that there appears to be a large register there, not necessarily a live register.  The enactment of this Bill will ensure that there will be a live and relevant register of nurses in operation. That will make the administration of the nursing profession much easier for administrations.  I expressed my views on the right of conscience aspect.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggested last week that section 51 dealt with the right of conscience.  I will be guided by the Minister on matters of this nature since he is the person who is promoting the Bill.  I share the concern expressed by many nurses that that section was not made a little stronger and that it did not move in a different direction.  On the other hand, I listened to the arguments which the Minister put forward, discussed his point of view with various nurses and I think a broad sense of satisfaction has descended upon the nursing profession.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by complimenting the nursing profession, the matrons and individual nurses, male or female, who approached me and many public representatives regarding this Bill.  We frequently introduce legislation in this House which affects people and we get no response from those people.  It is a great thing when people for whom we are legislating show such an interest in the legislation.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister. The Minister has become the great hate figure of certain sections of Irish society.  He has become the butt of many comments of an unfair nature from Opposition speakers, not merely in this House but outside.  There was a note struck throughout this debate, both inside and outside the House, that &ldquo;this Minister&rdquo;, not &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;, was reserving to himself powers for a particular and peculiar reason.  I do not believe that argument.  Those who put forward that argument did so without any basis. The manner in which the Minister has approached this Bill, his openness in bringing it before both Houses of the Oireachtas, his willingness to listen to every argument and to accept amendments is a clear reflection of his democratic nature.  I thank him; and I think that the nurses of Ireland, when they fully appreciate this Bill, will also thank him.</P>

      <P>I would like to say, before we complete this piece of legislation, that my regret is that the nurses of this nation did not lobby in time for a Bill that is going to affect them more than they had realised.  I understand why the nurses had not time to go through it section by section because they have more than enough on their plates when you have only one nurse to 50 patients.  They would leave it to us as legislators to make sure that the proper Bill went through, that it would not affect them in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must take the Minister to task for something he said in the Dáil on 5 December 1984 when he was speaking about the fees.  He seemed to think that the nurses were objecting to paying a fee. That is untrue.  The nurses were concerned with this section of the fees in case it got completely out of hand; they were only asking that it be kept under control. The Minister for Health said that it should be remembered that there are young nurses who would go on a Continental holiday spending £300 at the end of a year's work, that it would not cost them an awful lot of thought, and that they were screaming about paying a fee. That was an awful remark for any Minister for Health.  He knows as well as I do <Col N="745" /> that those nurses are entitled to whatever holidays they want.</P>
    <P>The Central Applications Bureau is accepted in total by the nurses.  There are hospitals that are asking for some system of selection for their candidates.  This is where I ran foul of the Minister in his remark that it was only for people who had pull and influence.  There would have been more amendments to this Bill if the nurses had the power and the lobby and the heavyweights behind them outside the House that the dentists had at the time the Dentists Bill was going through. The nurses are on a lower level and they had not got that kind of muscle.  This is why I feel strongly about the sections that they feel strongly about.  I would hope that An tUachtarán, Dr. Paddy Hillery, will take a look at the section that you, a Chathaoirleach, tell me I cannot talk about and that is the conscience clause.</P>

      <P>I have to clear one point. Senator McGuinness, whose views I always value and I hope I will always do so, on Committee Stage thought I was only interested in the rights of a nurse and that I would forget the rights of a patient.  I was well aware that the right of the patient is equal to the right of the nurse.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his Bill.  I will not make the type of plausible speech that Senator Durcan made because Minister Desmond would think I had gone cuckoo.  That is not my style.  I welcome the Bill if it corrects the wrongs that were there.  I was one of the people in my party who saw long ago what the nurses would have wanted.  I do not claim all the credit but this Bill might have gone through the other House much more quickly if I had not been aware of some of the sections and the effects they might have had.  I support the tribute to the nurses.  It may not be too long before we get back into power and there might be a few sections that we would repeal.</P>

I would ask that future legislation should not wait for us to amend it in this regard. I thank the Minister, because this is about the third piece of legislation on which he has accepted amendments from us in this regard.  He did likewise on the Dentists Bill.

      <P>The nurses made representations directly to us, and not alone to us but to the Minister.  There were proper consultations and meetings with all the people concerned before the Bill actually came before the House.  The trade unions representing the nurses were fully briefed and consulted with, but it is our job finally <Col N="747" /> to legislate.  Having listened and talked to nurses about this legislation, I know they welcome it.</P>
      <P>The Cathoirleach ruled on the question of the code of ethics and ethical conduct and behaviour.  The Opposition made an unsuccessful endeavour to get an amendment passed, but the level of debate in that endeavour was so high and so good and the response from the Minister was so explicit that the nurses, who were originally concerned about this section, are no longer concerned because this Bill does not ask the nurses to do anything that would be unethical or immoral.  It sets up a nursing board which in turn will have the right under the Bill to set down a code of ethics.  I am very pleased that the majority of members on the board will be nurses.  Up to 20 of the 29 members can be nurses.  I have the greatest respect for the profession and am confident that their election process will ensure that the people who adequately reflect their views will be elected to the nursing board.  I have the greatest confidence that they will set down, in the interests of their profession, a code of ethics and behaviour that will be becoming to the nursing profession, to which we have all paid tribute.  None of us has been slow to compliment this profession because it is not just a job, it is a way of life, a vocation.</P>
      <P>When we legislate for people of the standing of nurses it is important that the legislation would reflect to a great extent the views that they express to us.  I am satisfied that the representation they will have on the board will adequately do that.  To legislate beyond that would be putting requirements by legislation on the incoming board which would make them ineffective.  For that reason the Minister's response to the debate at that level was welcome and certainly was understood by nurses who took the trouble to read it and discuss it in their groups.  There are nursing groups meeting to discuss this and to discuss the Minister's response. There is no doubt whatever now in their minds that their fears in this regard were unfounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> There is general approval for the Central Applications Bureau.  I have made my views known on the importance of this, how important young aspiring applicants for nursing consider it and the inconvenience that will be removed.  At the moment they have to apply to various training hospitals and health boards throughout the country at considerable expense.  I am satisfied also from the Minister's response to this section that the private institutions and other hospitals will have a say finally in the type of nurse they employ and that is their right.  It is accepted by the Minister that, even in spite of the Central Applications Bureau, the process of involvement of these people at that level will not be interfered with.  It could be that for many reasons, commitments that the Minister has given publicly in this regard are ignored; but the important thing is that he has given them.  It is on the record of this House and I am sure that the people involved will accept that for what it is worth.  I am not making a political comment; it is the truth.  The Minister has legislated in more areas in the Department of Health than many other Ministers for Health in all Governments.  The report from the joint working party, which was the foundation of this Bill, was published ten years ago. How many Governments have we had in the past ten years?  How many Ministers for Health have we had?  But this Minister for Health has actually introduced into the Houses of the Oireachtas legislation which affects this very important profession. For that reason it has been widely recognised and accepted throughout the country for what it is &mdash; legislation that was necessary.  I compliment the Minister and all those assisting him for the way in which they promoted the legislation, the way in which they have dealt with amendments and the level of the debate.  It has served a useful purpose in this House in that we are seen as having an involvement in the process of legislation.  In the case of other pieces of legislation with which we have been involved only the Dáil seemed to be significant.  I am thankful that in this area, and indeed in regard to the Dentists Bill, the Seanad was seen for <Col N="749" /> what it is &mdash; an important part of the legislative process of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am proud to have been part of that procedure and I compliment the Minister for the way in which he dealt with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>After 250 years this House is experiencing a period of recovery from rather difficult dry rot and after 25 years our legislation relating to nursing is recovering from a period of lack of reform.  I am glad that, after three years of legislative endeavour on the part of the Government, on the part of the senior officers of my Department, on the part the parliamentary draftsman and, finally, on the part of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the legislation is now on the point of presentation to the President for his consideration and signature.  I wish to thank the Cathaoirleach for his assistance in facilitating the very constructive debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>To conclude, I want to put a few final points to bed, and I hope they will stay in bed for another few decades.  Firstly, regarding the conscience clause, there is no conscience clause in Northern Ireland, and we should be very clear about that. There is a piece of abortion legislation in Northern Ireland and within that specific legislation there is a conscientious objection provision.  The clause operated by the nursing boards in Northern Ireland and Great Britain is identical to the one we have in the Republic.  It is a very general one, namely, that any nurse should make known to the appropriate person or authority any conscientious objection which may be relevant to his or her professional practice.  It is a very broad observation, but it is not a specific opt-out conscience clause.  There is a lot of misunderstanding in that regard, not least in our own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I want to assure Senator Honan that I shall stand over my observations regarding the capacity of the nursing profession to pay retention fees and registration fees.  I have been upset that some nurses have objected to the introduction of an annual retention fee. The registration fee currently is about <Col N="750" /> £50.  The annual retention fee, as far as I can recall, is about £12 per annum.  To pay £12 per year to keep one's name on a register in a situation where the nursing profession in this country is relatively well paid in the public sector, is not unreasonable. There is many a student nurse, as I said in the Dáil, who can afford, without any misgivings, an annual holiday of £300 or £400 a year.  The least we might ask is the introduction of a new retention fee because the new Bord Altranais, the National Nursing Board, will be self-financing from the 26,000 nurses and it will receive very limited assistance by way of Exchequer funding.  But it is essential that it should be self-financing in its training work, in its general registration work and in the operation of the Central Applications Bureau.</P>
    <P>I come to the bureau itself.  I am pleased that, after all those years in which there has been not just perceived inequity in terms of the right of entry into the profession and the opportunities to go into the profession but also a great deal of concern, that structure, on an enabling basis only at this stage, has been introduced. That is of considerable merit. Therefore, I would make a final plea to the nursing profession that they should participate in the elections.  The opportunity will be there very shortly to elect the 17 members on to An Bord Altranais. I hope the elections are held as soon as possible.  I hope there will be a very substantial turn-out in the election itself. We are currently working out the regulations relating to the election.  For the first time proportional representation will operate in the elections for the various panels.  I would certainly hope that there will be no delay in going ahead with the elections as quickly as possible.  After 25 years we have now got, by and large, a reasonably good Bill.  There has been a protracted period for representations and I think we have endeavoured to be as cooperative as possible in considering the representations.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to thank Members again for their co-operation at all times in the <Col N="751" /> passage of this Bill and to thank them for their contributions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem about dealing with statutory regulations and statutory instruments is that we have only got a blunt instrument at our disposal.  The blunt instrument is simply to refuse to approve the regulations or to annul the regulations, as it would be in this case, rather than refuse to approve them.  Therefore, one has the difficult position of effectively being liable to be accused of throwing out babies and bath water together.  Nevertheless there are &mdash; and I will go through them in some detail &mdash; important reasons why it would be better if these regulations were to be approved in an amended form. I cannot propose amendments.  It is not my legal right to do so.  This House cannot propose amendments, but the Minister could redraft the regulations and introduce <Col N="752" /> new regulations without any great difficulty, in my opinion.  It would do a lot to improve the quality of the service that is being given in private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that we are not talking about tiny minorities of people here.  There are well over 5,000 people resident in private nursing homes, private hospitals and voluntary nursing homes.  Of those well over 5,000 people over 80 per cent are over 65 years of age and close on 60 per cent are over 80 years of age.</P>
    <P>That is quite a substantial number. That number of people represents almost one-third of all the people over 65 years of age in this age group who are in long term care.  It represents 1 per cent of the total population over 65 years of age.  It represents one-third of all the people who are over 65 years and in long term care. So we are talking about an important area of long term care for our elderly people, people who are, by and large, not particularly vocal, not particularly able to express themselves or to lobby on their own behalf.  Therefore, we have a particular obligation to be sensitive to their needs and to be careful and conscientious in what we do for or on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Of people who are in private nursing homes, the figures available to me would suggest that about 30 per cent of them are either bedridden or can do no more than sit in a chair.  Close to 30 per cent of them are also defined medically as being in such a state of confusion as to need virtual constant attention and support to do anything.</P>
    <P>I would not want to overstate at all the present level of State supervision.  We have this provision for approved private nursing homes, but this approval is not really so much a stamp of approval that standards are of a particularly high standard as it is of a willingness to give statutorily to individuals a level of support by the State.  Indeed, such approval of such private nursing homes has virtually ceased in recent years because of the state <Col N="753" /> of public finances.  But let it be said that in the Eastern Health Board area the majority of private nursing homes do not come under the heading to being approved.  That does not mean that they have not been inspected; it does not mean anything about their level of standards. But a large number of them are not even subject to the level of inspection to meet approval.  In my own area, in the Southern Health Board, there are only four approved private nursing homes for incapacitated people and there are 16 which are not approved.</P>
    <P>It seems that apart from the regulations introduced in 1966 the most important obligation imposed on persons opening private nursing homes for private profit must be that they must notify the relevant health board.  Conditions in these homes have been a matter of concern for a long time.  The level of concern was indicated and came to a climax in the sixties and resulted in the passing of the 1964 Act, the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964.  This Act contained a number of provisions but, I want to quote from one because it describes the official philosophy for dealing with and regulating such homes.  I am quoting from section 2 (1) of the Act of 1964, which says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, for the purpose of ensuring adequate and suitable accommodation, food and care for incapacitated persons while being maintained in homes and the proper conduct of homes, make such regulations as he thinks appropriate in relation to homes.</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section regulations under this section may &mdash;</P>
    <P>There is a long list, not all of which I want to quote in detail but it states that the regulations may prescribe requirements as to the care of incapacitated persons, prescribe requirements as to the qualifications of the staff of homes, prescribe requirements as to the design, maintenance, etc.  of homes, prescribe requirements as to accommodation, <Col N="754" /> food, cleanliness, the description of the homes, and indeed there is a particular provision that people can be interviewed in private if complaints are being investigated.</P>
    <P>The detail of the standards in those areas were to be prescribed by regulation. These regulations were finally published in 1966.  If it was not such a serious matter the regulations would be almost laughable because they simply insert words such as &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; and &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; and say no more than that.  For instance in terms of the prescribed requirements as to the number and qualifications of the staff of the homes the regulations themselves simply say:</P>
    <P>Sufficient and competent staff at all times having regard to the number of incapacitated persons.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sufficient and competent&rdquo; being the detail that was elaborated on in the order. This arises in a number of cases.  For instance, the prescribed requirements as to accommodation detailed in 4 (d)  of the regulations is as vague as one could ask it to be.  It says:</P>
    <P>Sufficient supply of piped hot and cold water and suitable and sufficient sanitary and toilet facilities.</P>
    <P>These words &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; and &ldquo;sufficient and adequate&rdquo; surface again and again in the 1966 regulations.  Consequently, what we were dealing with until recently were, by and large, words like &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; and &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; and &ldquo;adequate and sufficient&rdquo;, which were undefinable, and because they were undefinable they were, effectively, unenforceable except in conditions of extreme squalor.  There were no real written down minimum standards.</P>
    <P>In recent times it appears public controversy has been fuelled again. There have been a number of comments in the media.  In 1983 the Bray and District Council of Trade Unions produced a report on conditions in their own area. The general concern was quite global.  It had to do with suitability of buildings, the adequacy of nursing staff, in particular <Col N="755" /> the number of nursing staff, the qualifications of nursing staff and the training given to nursing staff, the need for special equipment and facilities in such nursing homes and, by and large, the widespread allegations that such special equipment and facilities were usually lacking.  We are talking about sanitary facilities, toilet facilities, washing facilities and such things.  Many people alleged that these were singularly lacking in many of these private nursing homes.  The absence of any programme of activity for people resident in these homes was widely adverted to, in other words, anything that would enable people to maintain their normal level of function, separate entirely from any programme of rehabilitation. There was almost a complete absence of such facilities.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board, in a report produced in July 1982 said the following:</P>
    <P>Complaints which were made concerning unsatisfactory conditions in private nursing homes generally, generally refer to understaffing, overcrowding, inadequate heating, insufficient or poor food and unhygienic conditions or practices.</P>
    <P>Consequently there was an increasing, widely recognised need for an improvement in the regulations of those private nursing homes which do not meet the proper standards.  Nobody is suggesting that all private nursing homes for elderly incapacitated persons are inadequate but there seems to be a widely perceived view that there are some which do not meet the proper standards.  There may be a considerable number which do not meet these standards but the powers which currently exist for regulation of such nursing homes are inadequate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that he proposes to introduce a scheme of licensing but that will require amending legislation.  In his speech to the annual meeting of the Irish Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association on Friday, 9 March 1984 the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the standards <Col N="756" /> for accommodation and facilities for nursing homes, as set out in the 1966 Homes for Incapacitated Persons Regulations, are strong or detailed enough to ensure that the needs of people in the homes are properly catered for.  I do not think that the monitoring arrangements which apply are adequate.</P>
    <P>That would represent a fairly strongly worded statement from the Minister of what many people feel about such homes, that the powers are insufficient and the regulations are insufficiently detailed. The Minister produced regulations which were widely looked forward to.  I believe there was a considerable level of consultation before they were produced although I would be interested to know if the National Council for the Aged, who have been given a commitment that they will always be consulted on matters of this nature, were, in fact, consulted before these regulations were promulgated.</P>
    <P>There are many good things in the new regulations.  There is a quite detailed provision for the keeping of proper and adequate records.  There is an obligation on health boards to inspect all such nursing homes every six months, which is more than welcome.  There is provision that facilities must be made for occupation and recreation.  There is specific provision, for the first time, for lighting, that there must be overbed lamps and there must be provision for night lighting. These are simple things but very important if proper standards are to be maintained. There are specific minimum temperatures specified, 65 degrees fahrenheit in bedroom areas, 70 degrees fahrenheit in day areas, and that is also very welcome.</P>
    <P>It is because in many other areas similar detail has not been listed that we find these regulations inadequate but where they are specified they are very welcome. A simple provision, for instance, that there must be a washhand basin in each room, which seems like minimal standards for people who are in institutional care, is also very welcome.  Unfortunately, and in the light of the inadequate <Col N="757" /> enforcement and the widely reported inability of health board officials to enforce the previous regulations, words like &ldquo;suitable and sufficient&rdquo; are still widely used in the new regulations.  This is a matter of great regret.</P>
    <P>Article 9 of the new regulations says:</P>
    <P>In every home there shall be provided for patients maintained in the home suitable and sufficient care, suitable and sufficient accommodation, suitable, sufficient and nutritious food, properly prepared, cooked and served.</P>
    <P>We have again these undefinable, unquantifiable and therefore immeasurable terms, &ldquo;suitable and sufficient&rdquo;. Under Article 10 (1)  (a) we have a provision that says:</P>
    <P>suitable and sufficient equipment and facilities, having regard to the nature and extent of the incapacity.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (b) we have the requirement that the home should be provided with suitable and sufficient lighting, heating and ventilation, with bed and bedding appropriate to the incapacity of each patient, with a separate kitchen, which is a useful provision.  Article 10 (2) (a)  specifies:</P>
    <P>In every house there shall be provided adequate accommodation and space.</P>
    <P>Here is the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; again. Words such as &ldquo;adequate&rdquo;, &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo;, &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; are undefinable, immeasurable, unquantifiable and therefore, unenforceable. Article (10) (4) states:</P>
    <P>The responsibilities on a person carrying on a home shall be to provide a sufficient supply of piped hot and cold water.  A sufficient number of toilets must be provided which are designed to provide access to wheelchairs.  There should be a sufficient number of commodes, baths and showers.</P>
    <P>Nobody is telling anybody what is a sufficient number or how you decide whether there is or is not a sufficient number. Words like &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; and &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; and so on are all very well to use.  They <Col N="758" /> represent pious aspirations but they are not enforceable.  It is by way of regrettable contrast I have to quote from proposals for draft regulations produced by the Eastern Health Board in 1982 where they suggested on accommodation standards as follows:</P>
    <P>A single room should have a minimum area of 9.3 sq. metres and a shared room should have a minimum area of 7.4 sq. metres per bed.</P>
    <P>They are the sort of minimum standards that are measurable and are, therefore, clearly enforceable and because of this they can be insisted upon.  They specify that there should be one toilet per eight patients and not less than one bath for every 15 patients.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to judge whether one bath for 15 patients is adequate.  I am in a position to state that, if you do not specify standards that are measurable, if standards are not specified that are quantifiable, there are no standards.  As a result you have only opinions and the matter will end up in detailed controversy in courts.  How can a health board official or an officer of the Minister's Department insist that standards are inadequate if there are not specified, quantifiable and measurable standards to be met?  That, in my view, is the nub of the disappointment and dissatisfaction that many people have expressed to me about these regulations: that where they should be specific they are sadly, regrettably and painfully inadequate.</P>
    <P>I find it ironic that where we are talking about facilities for elderly people, who are paying quite dearly for services, we use words like &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; and &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; in terms of regulating the standards of their comfort, whereas the courts in a big city &mdash; New York &mdash; in a country that is not known for its commitment to the welfare state when they were defining what shelter should be provided for homeless people, basic minimum shelter, they insisted that the shelter should have at least the following: a minimum bed size &mdash; unspecified in our regulations &mdash;<Col N="759" /> a minimum number of toilets &mdash; unspecified in our regulations &mdash; and a minimum area per person sleeping in a night shelter in New York.  There is no such specific minimum for people in a nursing home being run for profit in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why it is necessary to leave words like &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; and &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; in when competent authorities like the Eastern Health Board are able to work out precise minimum standards that they would regard as enforceable.  It is not unusual or strange to specify quantifiable standards.  We do it in respect of industrial safety, building regulations and planning permission.  Members of the House have personal experience of the planning authorities setting regulations in great detail which people must observe. Why therefore do we have to leave these very vague and consequently unenforceable standards?  It is a pity that what is obviously a well-intentioned improvement in standards &mdash; and quite dramatic in some areas in the levels of standards of care &mdash; will be spoiled by an apparent unwillingness to be specific in areas of basic care.  It is because, having read the regulations and having listened to what people have said to me, that I believe the inadequacies of the regulations are so considerable that I therefore have to move that the regulations be annulled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this motion, I wish to say that a great deal of the area has been covered in some detail by the proposer of the motion, Senator Brendan Ryan.  However, to add to what he has said, I agree with him that it is somewhat difficult in this House to try to deal with a matter where one appreciates that efforts are being made by the Minister to bring about improvement and yet we feel they have not gone far enough. The only motion open to us to put down was one annulling the regulations, and it is certainly quite clear that neither Senator Ryan nor myself wish to go back to the 1966 regulations.  We feel that the regulations as proposed by the Minister do not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> I would like to compliment the Minister on his activity in pressing ahead with putting in amending regulations.  It is a very good sign of the Minister's goodwill in the situation that he is trying to improve the situation, so we just ask him to improve it rather more.  As far as the Minister is concerned, it may seem to him that we are criticising the various things he has done; but perhaps he can comfort himself that the reason this is happening is because he is someone who is actually doing things.  In a sense when you start trying to improve things you will always get people who will say &ldquo;you are doing this but you should go further.&rdquo;  We are taking the trouble to recognise that he is trying to do something about the situation and we are just asking him to do something a little more effective.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is true that the new regulations which the Minister has put forward are very much an improvement on the regulations of 1966.  They have introduced matters like the heating of homes, providing of an activity programme, the lighting of the homes and so on which were quite unspecified in the old regulations and which make for a very much improved situation.  The 1966 regulations could briefly be described as short, vague and unenforced.  Certainly the present regulations are an improvement.</P>
    <P>I have taken a particular interest in this area over many years and I am sure the Minister will remember that in the early sixties Senator Mary Davidson conducted a one woman campaign about the necessity to register nursing homes and improve standards in nursing homes. Certainly events which have transpired since that date can have done nothing but prove how right that Senator was in her day in putting this forward.  In fact, the 1964 Act was the culmination of her efforts and the fact that she simply refused to sit down and shut up on the subject of nursing homes.  She kept bringing in Private Members Bills to the Seanad and so on.  It does, therefore, seem to me that it is the tradition of this House that we should be trying to improve and make sure that regulations <Col N="761" /> covering nursing homes are efficient, effective and enforced.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the National Social Service Council &mdash; later the National Social Service Board, I was very conscious of the level of complaint and the level of difficulty that was being encountered by all workers in voluntary bodies about the standard of accommodation in nursing homes.  In fact when one set up a seminar, a meeting or anything to do with the needs of the elderly, at which one had voluntary bodies, representative volunteer workers, every single time the biggest and most frequent complaint and the most frequent question was, &ldquo;what about the standards of these nursing homes and is there anything that can be done about it?  This is the thing we really want done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Obviously, neither I nor any of the voluntary workers were criticising all nursing homes.  There are excellent nursing homes for the elderly and for incapacitated persons and we have personal experience of them.  The difficulty is to try to ensure that all homes come up to the standards that are set by the better ones.  It was extremely noticeable that among all the social workers, both statutory social workers and social workers employed by voluntary organisations, worries about nursing homes were extremely widespread.</P>
    <P>This matter, as Senator Ryan said, has been raised in the media from time to time.  There was a particular programme on RTE television about the standards of nursing homes and more recently on radio programmes letters have been read out from people and complaints made about the difficulties that individuals have had with nursing homes, elderly people left without heat, without adequate feeding and, in particular, the system of giving someone a fairly inadequate meal at about 5 p.m. and then nothing until the next morning.  That seems to be one of the complaints that is fairly widespread.</P>
    <P>I understand the National Council for the Aged have been studying this.  While their report on it has not yet been published I hope the Minister will go back to them and perhaps consider improving the <Col N="762" /> regulations in view of the kind of things they have said.  It is also the personal experience of so many people, who may have elderly relatives, that it is extremely difficult to find a nursing home of a reasonably high standard and those that have a high standard have long waiting lists.  Many of us have had personal experience of elderly relatives who have gone into a nursing home expecting it to provide reasonable standards and then find on visiting the elderly relative that perhaps the relative has not had a bath for the last month, that clothes are not sufficiently often changed and so on.</P>
    <P>It cannot be that this need does not exist when one hears on so many fronts the kind of complaints that I have been talking about.  They have been dealt with also by the Bray Trades Council and by other bodies.  In particular a difficulty arises because a lot of the buildings which are nursing homes are old three or four storey buildings some of which were used as boarding houses or guest houses for a type of tourist demand that no longer exists.  This would perhaps have been particularly so in the Bray area which was referred to by the Bray Trades Council. Therefore, these particular buildings may create difficulties for elderly or incapacitated persons.</P>
    <P>With regard to the number of nursing staff the Eastern Health Board in the document referred to by Senator Ryan sought a power that the health board should be allowed to nominate the numbers of nursing staff that should be available in each home whether in the day time or at night.  One of the difficulties is that there tends to be a very low level of qualified nursing staff at night in these homes and yet it is a fairly well known medical fact that very often the metabolism of elderly people is at its lowest ebb in the early hours of the morning between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. and it is very often then that they are taken severely ill and that they suffer strokes and other kinds of disabilities.  In a sense it is at night that a qualified nurse may be needed there.  The health board were not asking for something foolish when they asked for the power to be able to state the number of <Col N="763" /> nursing staff they felt were needed in each nursing home.</P>
    <P>In general the complaints have referred, as Senator Ryan said, to understaffing, overcrowding, inadequate heating, insufficient food and unhygienic conditions.  While I accept that the Minister's present regulations go some way towards solving this problem the difficulty is that we are left in so many areas with these words like &ldquo;sufficient space&rdquo; and &ldquo;suitable accommodation&rdquo; where we should have nominated a particular area of space to be available to each patient, a particular number of toilets to be available per patient, a particular standard.  Even say we provide for an over bed light it should not be so difficult to provide that lighting should be at a certain level, that there should be a certain wattage of bulbs and so on because one can get very dim lights being put on which make reading very difficult for elderly people whose eyesight may not be very good, whose sole amusement is reading and who would like to be able to read at least a daily newspaper and in winter darkness in the daytime need not just a light but a light of sufficient strength to allow them to read.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Ryan in saying that what we would look for is in the areas of the Minister's regulations, where he is using these words like &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; and &ldquo;suitable&rdquo;, that we should have specific provisions as to how much, how many, what level and so on and also, of course, I feel that the essence of these regulations is the ability to enforce them properly. This was largely where the 1966 regulations fell down, even in so far as they did provide standards they were not really enforced.  I would very much welcome the provision that the homes were to be inspected every six months.  I hope that sufficient resources will be made available in the health boards and through the Department to enable this inspection to be carried out properly.  This is an area in which we are protecting the most vulnerable in our population.  No matter how <Col N="764" /> good our regulations are unless we provide the resources to enforce them properly the regulations will not be of any great use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this motion which actually calls on the House to ask the Minister to annul the order he has made.  I share the concern of Senators on the other side of the House.  The vehicle available to them is a blunt one.  We all admit that the regulations are a step in the right direction. The Senators are suggesting that they have not gone far enough.  I have the greatest reservations whether asking the Minister to annul the regulations will serve the purpose and I would have to ask the House to reject this motion as it is worded.</P>
      <P>It gives us an opportunity to discuss this whole area of private nursing homes for incapacitated persons in the presence of the Minister who has made these regulations and after 21 sitting days they will come into operation.  If, after listening to our debate, the Minister will be in a position further down the road to bring in some of the other requirements that have been suggested that will have been a very useful exercise.  As a previous member of a health board and a member of The Care of the Elderly Committee I have some reservations in this area.  If the Minister were to go as far as all of us would like it is inevitable that some nursing homes would close.  That would not concern me unduly if the State were in a position to accommodate the people who would then be without a home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an extraordinary thing to have to say but that is the reality of the situation as I have experienced it and as I know about it to this day.  There are some nursing homes, and many of them are in my constituency in south Tipperary, which have achieved a very high standard of nursing care of old and incapacitated people.  They have done so with very little assistance from the State.  I am suggesting that if we use a very big stick now without some assistance towards them to implement the regulations that we set down we will be doing a disservice to the <Col N="765" /> old people who are in these homes by choice.</P>
    <P>We have the situation where some nursing home beds are subvented by health boards and some are not.  Some of the homes that are subvented are of a lower standard than those that are not subvented. In the process of registration of nursing homes in the past, the board, once they had approved of the nursing home and registered it, had no further recourse to the nursing home except when there was a complaint lodged by some medical person or other indicating that the level of care given in the home was not sufficient.  What I have advocated as a member of the community care team in charge of the elderly is that where health boards subvent beds those boards should have the right to insist on having a say, through the process of assessment, about the type of people who would occupy the beds which are State subvented.  They should certainly have the right, by the process of assessment, to decide if and when a person could be discharged back into the community or out of that particular subvented bed, on the basis that if you subvent beds and do not follow up with control on them, those subvented beds will remain filled by people who might not even need beds but who, because of family situations and social reasons, still occupy such beds in a nursing home when, in fact, they could possibly afford to be in a hotel.  That is the stark reality of the situation, as I have come across it.  Health boards, this Minister and his predecessor have made major contributions in the whole area of the care of the elderly.  In south Tipperary they have set up, as a first pilot scheme, the whole process of assessment of people going into geriatric institutions and/or into psychiatric institutions.  In the past people were just committed to these homes, whether geriatric or otherwise, by their relatives, without a proper assessment of whether they should be in a home or not.  Today we find that almost 50 per cent of patients in psychiatric hospitals should not be there at all.  They are <Col N="766" /> there for social reasons.  They are not psychiatric patients.</P>
    <P>Before we set up the assessment unit at St. Patrick's in Cashel many people were committed to the geriatric home there and never saw the light of day again simply because they had not been assessed properly.  Now, thankfully, we have made some effort in this area to ensure that patients who are submitted have to go through this process of assessment. The assessment team decide whether the person should be at home, preferably in the community, or whether he would benefit from day-care centre treatment and all the facilities that go with that, or whether he should be admitted as a person suitable to live in a welfare home.  I object to the name &ldquo;welfare home&rdquo; because it has a whole lot of connotations that I do not agree with, but the whole concept of welfare homes is a tremendous breakthrough.  People are allowed a lot of freedom to come and go as they please and to participate in the full life of the community and still have shelter to come back to.  The health boards have taken a major step forward in this whole area of the care of the elderly.</P>
    <P>The Minister's regulations are a major step forward.  Public opinion has demanded that there would be a step forward in this area.  It is appropriate that if homes do not come up to the minimum standards required then they should fail in their registration.  Certainly, homes that do not come up to the standard of nursing care should not be subvented by the State.  There are minimum requirements that we would expect of this particular type of nursing home.  They give a tremendous service in the community. It is one that cannot be replaced by the State.  That is an unfortunate thing but it is a reality.</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the total population of private nursing homes but if, tomorrow morning, the Minister brought in regulations which could not be complied with, then certainly the State would have to satisfy me that they could take up the slack that would be created if all these people were suddenly discharged from <Col N="767" /> homes that were closed down.  That is not to say that there should not be acceptable standards and that the Minister and health boards should have a say in what those standards should be.  I welcome the fact that these regulations confer certain rights on health boards that, apparently under the previous regulations they did not have.  For that reason I welcome them.  If the resolution was carried it would be a backward step.</P>
    <P>I am looking forward to the Minister's reply in this area to see what other action he intends to take.  I would ask him and the health boards throughout the country to decide that where people are giving a very high standard, comparable and sometimes better than that of the State they should be given assistance.  They should serve particularly people who are in possession of medical cards because there are times when people like that cannot get into our institutions because of the long waiting lists.  The population of elderly people is increasing with the advances made in medicine.  With the care to the elderly given by health boards the numbers of older people dependent on a proper and adequate service is increasing.  It is a problem that we will have to address at national level, as well as through health boards, through capital programmes and also through regulations in nursing homes.  We have a responsibility for such homes through the registration process.  The regulations are a step forward.  I welcome them.  I certainly would not like to have them annulled.  I would be surprised if the Minister did not have the fullest consultation with the people involved in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief observation on these regulations.  Like the previous speakers, I welcome any regulations that will provide a high standard of care for the various nursing homes we have throughout the country. Senators B. Ryan and McGuinness were suggesting that these regulations do not go far enough.  My view is that we have many nursing homes which are giving a fantastic service now and have done so in <Col N="768" /> the past.  They have a very high standard of nursing care, of hygiene and of food; but I believe that if every regulation in this book were to be implemented some of them would close.  Many of them are just one-nurse homes and maybe in some cases a family, a nurse and a husband, running it or maybe a nurse with casual staff doing first-class work for the old people and people who are infirm.  I repeat again that if all these regulations were to be fully implemented such homes would have to close.  For example, many of the homes that I know could not afford to provide a visitors' reception area and adequate facilities for patients to receive visitors in private.  That would be the case in many of the homes.  Neither would it be possible to provide an office for staff and for general use.  All of this would involve very high expenditure.  This kind of expenditure might not be possible in the homes I am thinking of.  I stress that they are doing a fantastic job of work without the kind of things that are referred to in the regulations.</P>
      <P>There are many regulations that are important in regard to fire precautions and hygiene.  Some of the regulations could provide problems for some of the nursing homes that I am aware of in my area.  The question also of the health board and of many of the geriatric homes under their control makes us realise that to bring them to the standard required in these regulations would cost quite a considerable amount of money.  With the restrictions we have on finances I am not sure that the health boards can afford such expense.  If they had to effect such improvements the money should come from central funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that these regulations represent a huge improvement on the regulations of the past.  I would not like to go much further at this point in time.  If many of those regulations were to be fully implemented then many nursing homes would close for the reasons I have given. Nevertheless, it is important and right that the Minister and the Department of Health should from time to time examine these homes and that the health board as the agent for the area concerned should <Col N="769" /> examine them periodically.  The regulations recommend that they should do so every six months.</P>
    <P>By seeking very high standards generally we cannot ignore what is already there.  We cannot ignore that to improve further the actual fabric of the building would cost many thousands of pounds. Such funds might not be available.  At the same time, people are happy in the nursing homes with the kind of care they receive.  Overall, I would not like to annul the regulations, as the previous speaker has said.  We should aim for a high standard, which is what the Minister has done.  A higher standard might create serious difficulties for many of the nursing homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report. While I acknowledge Senator B. Ryan's deep dedication to the interests of the less-well off in society, I would be annoyed that he should ask the Minister to eliminate this instrument and to say that we should be considering something new.  There is always a need to consider something new.</P>
      <P>When one looks at this report and the updating of it, and looks at the regulations, if they are all right naturally one would welcome them.  At the same time there are many questions that have to be asked.  In my area the question of the private nursing home is always under consideration. This relates to the private nursing homes which are minding the less well-off and the people who cannot care for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Southern Health Board area there are certain problems which are beyond the scope of the private nursing home.  In the eastern side of the Southern Health Board, which is the Youghal area, we have homes for the elderly.  They are not really like a big old hospital or an area where one would see a lot of elderly people together.  They are community homes where there might be ten or 15 people staying together.  They consist of a communal area and their own rooms for the residents.  All this costs very little. In comparison with the cost of subsidising the private homes and even with the costs <Col N="770" /> of our old hospitals where we have a lot of elderly people staying, these places must be better.  I have some information to the effect that they cost much less.  I do not understand why we are not broadening our minds and creating in all community areas a facility where our elders can be seen to be staying in one place.</P>
    <P>I readily admit that, unfortunately, in modern day living we have a situation, unlike our forefathers before us, where we are not prepared to look after our elderly even though very little may be wrong with them.  They might only be old.  We have a situation where people are prepared to put their elders away. That is a fact of life.  We must accept it. We must consider that because a person is old and maybe a little bit feeble does not necessarily mean that he is sick.  One cannot say that a person should be in a nursing home when in fact he is only very old or perhaps not able to get around easily.  A perfect example is the welfare home I have already referred to.  The word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is one I do not like and it should be abolished.  We have a home down there in Youghal which is like a home from home.  There is a situation where people can ring a bell if they should need somebody, can go out or be brought out and can have visitors at any time.  It does not look like a nursing home, a hospital or a sick area.  We should not call these places sick areas when only elderly people are in them.</P>
    <P>In each parish, or perhaps in every second parish, within our society we should have community homes.  There is no reason to give an impression that because a person reaches the age of 66 or 74 and loses his memory he should be put away into a place which is unsuitable for him and which he does not like.</P>
    <P>The realistic factor is the cost.  The cost of doing this must be thought out properly by the people involved.  A situation could evolve where better facilities could be obtained for less money.  One Senator mentioned day centres.  These community homes can become a day centre for people from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. and then such people can be brought home at night.  These people can enjoy <Col N="771" /> themselves in the day in these homes while other people can live in them. There are four of these centres on the south side of Cork city.  They are catering for a total of 80 elderly people &mdash; not sick people.</P>
    <P>There is a need for constant updating of facilities.  As Senator Ferris said, people are put away who are not sick at all.  There are such people in Our Lady's Hospital in Cork.  They should not be there.  We must face up to this fact.  We have a moral responsibility to rectify this and to bring the problem back to the local parish area and let them take responsibility. The person can say that his or her grandmother is only 200 yards away but is well catered for within the community home.  It must be less expensive in comparison with a bed in any hospital, whether it be voluntary, private or a semi-private nursing home or health board hospital.  The cost of a bed in a health board hospital is enormous, irrespective of who the patient is.  It is obvious that if this were done in a community area it would cost less.  Is the Minister aware of this when he is putting emphasis on the updating of the regulations?  For example, in regard to heating, the Minister says that the bed area at night should be at least 65 degrees and the living area by day should be 70 degrees.  I know of areas in my own home town where there is no way that facility can be obtained in nursing homes.  I know such facilities are not going to be provided, even though the Minister will emphasise the point. They are lucky to have a bed.  Is there any direction in regard to how many patients should be in the home, what distance should be between each bed?  How many windows should there be in a room with so many patients?  How is that defined? It is admitted that if a patient is in bed the room should have a natural lighted window.  I appreciate that, but that means there can be four patients in the same lighted area.  That is unfair.  We should be considering what is best for our elderly.  It is our responsibility to do that, so let us do it right.</P>
    <P>Let us readily admit that there are <Col N="772" /> massive areas in our society throughout the country that are not good enough for our elderly people.  I do not like the emphasis on constant nursing.  It is a fact of life that many of these patients are in these nursing homes because they are not wanted elsewhere.  The fact that they are old, does not necessarily mean they are sick.  To give the impression otherwise and say we are going to stash them away &mdash; and that is exactly what we are doing and I have seen such people put away &mdash; is a total disgrace.  Senator Brendan Ryan has seen it in the Cork area.  We are readily admitting that people are being put where they should not be.  That is our responsibility.  It is the taxpayers' money which is paying for that.</P>
    <P>I admit that I have a responsibility as a member of a voluntary hospitals board and as an ex-member of the Southern Health Board.  If we give proper priority to considering the amount of money that we spend in the health boards and what it is worth per head for geriatrics, I would gamble on it that we could create a better and happier society for these people in their own local communities by the provision of local people minding them by day and night.  The staff should be nurses, and probably semi-retired nurses.  I see no reason why that cannot be done.  This is not my idea because I have seen it in other cities.  This has been done in east Cork.  Youghal can be proud of what they do for their elderly but unfortunately, it is only for a certain few.  One does not see the community care house.  It is only one-storey and there is a garden in the middle.  There are one or two such homes in north Cork.</P>
    <P>I have seen this situation in north England, in Bradford.  They build community homes where the elderly have their own bedrooms and their own television room. There is a person in constant charge but they do not see that person from one end of the week to the other.  They have their own washing machine area, their own bingo and television area and they can use the facilities as they want.  They keep their own rooms at little cost.  At first they cost money, but at the end of the day one is not paying out hundreds of <Col N="773" /> pounds per week per bed.  Maybe we should broaden our minds.  I know the Minister has the interest and the dedication. It would be wrong of me to say otherwise, I have heard him speak about it often.  Is there a possibility of the Minister setting up a body of people who would be totally dedicated and would look at this in a sincere way and say, &ldquo;yes, this is the thing to do for our elderly within their own community&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other speakers on this matter, would suggest that it is not the regulations that should be annulled at this stage.  I have a feeling that even the movers of the motion do not feel that the regulations should be annulled. Basically, what they want to do is to see a strengthening of the regulations to make certain aspects more specific. Whether that is what is in their minds or not I feel that it is good that we were allowed to go through these regulations because they are extremely important for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>There have been homes which in the past have not been up to the standards which were necessary for the proper care of our elderly and incapacitated people. The standards in certain homes were atrocious.  It has been noticeable that in the registered homes over the past years standards have improved immensely. Many of the sections that have been added to the regulations of '64 have already been implemented in the better regulated homes.  There are homes which are not well regulated.  I suggest that in a lot of cases the blame could be put on the health boards or on the people from the Department of Social Welfare who are supposed to inspect places where food is kept and where hygiene standards are supposed to be upheld.  If these people had been doing their job over a number of years, standards would have improved faster than they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main reason for speaking is to express the hope that these regulations would not alone apply to homes which are open for profit.  I suggest that these regulations be equally enforced on public homes and on homes which are being run by health boards in particular.  I am sure <Col N="774" /> there is not one Senator here who does not know in his own area of a home for elderly people for which money is being sought from the Department of Health and Social Welfare.  Such money cannot be got and these homes are in an atrocious condition at present.</P>
    <P>There are elderly people living on second floors of hospitals around the country, in conditions which are not suitable for ambulant patients not alone non-ambulant patients.  It would frighten people here if I passed on the comment that was made to me by a person when asked: &ldquo;What would you do in case of a fire? &rdquo; Even though it was a frightening answer I think that it should be given. He said: &ldquo;You would have a choice, you could fry them or you could drown them&rdquo;. That is not the kind of home I would like to see continuing throughout the country. The health boards are doing their best, but because of financial constraints they are not getting the amount of money they need in order to change these homes into homes which are modern, clean and up to the standards which are laid down for private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>There are homes around the country in which patients are being kept in upstairs rooms from which there is no adequate egress.  There are not adequate safety precautions.  There are not adequate fire attendants who work in these homes cannot do their job properly even though they are working to their maximum capacity.  They are working in homes which are in some cases up to 300 years old.  The homes have very steep stairways with no adequate fire escapes even though there are notices which state that there are fire escapes.  It would take a very fit, healthy man to get out of some of these homes.  In bringing in these regulations and enforcing them, I hope the Minister will ensure that every home which is under the care of the Department of Health and Social Welfare will be brought up to at least the standards that are laid down in these regulations. There are a number of homes which are at this stage coming up to the standards <Col N="775" /> required and I have no doubt that the Minister got in touch with the people who run these homes when he was making up the regulations.  Mention was made of the part that community homes can play in the care of the aged and incapacitated. Senator Cregan mentioned that an extension of these homes would be very advantageous and that because the people would be living in their own areas they would feel more at home and they would get a better local visitation scheme.  They could keep in touch with the people they went to school with and grew up with &mdash; keep in touch with the social scene &mdash; and in that way they would have a better life even though an incapacitated one.</P>
    <P>There should be more concern given to the co-ordination of the means of assessment for entry into these community homes and the homes for the aged which are run by the health boards because in certain cases elderly people are admitted to them and once they get in they are there for the rest of their lives. They are not properly assessed before they get in.  The assessment that takes place is probably not the same type of assessment that would take place in the case of an elderly person going into a long-stay hospital for elderly people under the health board.  Most community homes are run by community voluntary social service groups perhaps aided by the health board.</P>
    <P>Once a person is comfortable in a community home it is very very hard to take him out again.  It is very very hard to get him back into his home.  It is equally very hard sometimes to persuade the sons or daughters or their relatives that these people are fit to go back into their own homes.  Too often people are kept in homes even though they are quite fit to go back to their own community.  Again, in a lot of cases where people are in homes for the incapacitated and aged under the health boards there is no adequate means of rehabilitation.  In some of these homes which are sponsored by the Government the rehabilitation system, because of constraints of finance <Col N="776" /> and space consists merely of patients supporting themselves on a pair of bars.  In most homes there is not even an infrared lamp to give heat treatment.  This is not the fault of the very excellent people who spend so much of their time caring for elderly people, but in their caring they get more and more frustrated because it appears that people are being dumped into these establishments and are not getting adequate care in terms of the ambience of the home or the treatment necessary to rehabilitate them or to reconcile their sons and daughters into accepting them back into their homes when they are well able to do so.</P>
    <P>Finally, a lot of these regulations are overdue.  They are necessary and I sincerely hope that the Minister will ensure that there is not a home in the public sector which will not be brought up to these standards.  If that does not happen there is no point in having regulations for private nursing homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very interesting to hear the contributions of the Senators regarding this problem.  As a consultant surgeon in a small rural hospital it is inevitable that one is faced with the difficulty of coping with psycho-geriatrics with no home to go to.  Physically they are no longer sufficiently strong to forage for themselves.  One also comes across the difficulty of placing such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago &mdash; this is a story which will highlight one aspect of the problem &mdash; I was confronted by an irate Methodist minister who told me that the hut in one of the hospitals to which I was attached was not fit for animals, let alone human beings.  It was not the hospital where I mainly work, and I hasten to add that I had only recently arrived in the locality concerned.  I went to inspect the hospital to find that at night there was one nurse to attend some 17 to 20 very old people and certainly very grossly incapacitated people, many of them with catheters and some of them semi-comatose.  She could get another nurse from the main hospital by pushing a bell.  What was needed was a much greater human commitment, but then we come up against the cutbacks, <Col N="777" /> and the Minister knows all about the cutbacks. So what do we do?</P>
    <P>I suggested to the Minister that he might go back to all the Churches &mdash; as you know in Northern Ireland there are many of them &mdash; and ask for one volunteer for every night, and then go to the relatives of the people concerned and ask for one volunteer from all of the relatives for every night and then say to the tenants' associations and community groups that there is a big problem and seek one volunteer from them.  So it would be a rota of one night in 50 or 60 nights.  But the problem only starts there because when those well-intentioned people arrive at the gates of the hospital there will be members of my profession and the nursing profession standing across the gate saying: &ldquo;No, you have not the right certificate and we are not insured for you. You cannot come in here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the problem that Senator Cregan identified so well, and that is how do we involve the local community and how do we break down the resistance of institutional imperialism and institutional barricades?  How do we jump over them or mow them down so that we can get at the problem and do something about it?</P>
    <P>The question of awareness arises. National social service is, for very good reasons, anathema to the trade union movement; but national social service properly thought through, with all properly built-in protections, could be a very good way of educating the young emerging citizen, particularly at this time of terrible unemployment, about what actually goes on in our country.  One of the things he might be engaged in is attendance in such institutions, helping out in psycho-geriatric or long-stay institutions or even in hospitals where such patients are, to use the in-term of today, &ldquo;stashed away&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Another factor one has to consider is the goodwill that is available in every community throughout Ireland if it could only be tapped.  At present there is very little access, except in situations such as the one described in Cork, to a network <Col N="778" /> of all the agencies that can provide support. Here again it needs to have a focus. I have heard a day centre mentioned. In Northern Ireland the day centres are associated with the social workers.  Some very excellent day centres have been built in the last 15 years.  A day centre could become the focus where representatives of the medical profession, social workers, schoolchildren, the unemployed, the clergy, relatives, the occupation therapists, if there are any, physiotherapists and so on could meet.  Even if they met once a year in a local community health guild and that the topic of discussion was: &ldquo;What are we doing in this community for our phychogeriatric, geriatric and long stay patients&rdquo;, the aim would be to raise the level of awareness so that they would become interested in the problem.  At the moment far too few people know anything about it except that old Aunt Lizzie is on the top floor of one of the various hospitals that have been mentioned here and they cannot take her home because there is fear.  One of the ways we cope with it in our neck of the woods is that we tell the relatives the position.  We bring them together and say: &ldquo;You are not going to be left with this problem.  Take Aunt Lizzie home for 48 hours and see how you get on.  We promise we will take her back.  Or take her home for the weekend and we will take her back&rdquo;.  Once the threat has been removed of the total responsibility for an almost impossible problem which cannot be coped with adequately by a hospital institution on the one hand, by social workers on the other, by GP's, by nurses or by family &mdash; once you begin to get involved in the lot and there is trust you begin to build up a feeling of community. Then an awful lot can begin to happen.</P>
    <P>That comes back to community.  We can talk until the cows come home about what we should be doing &mdash; and it is easy to talk about it here as most people are well-intentioned towards a renaissance of community spirit &mdash; but we cannot achieve that as long as the community that we talk about is too big and the power held in that community too little. We must start to decentralise really one <Col N="779" /> of the most over-centralised countries in western Europe.  We must give back to the people power to do what they feel is right in the community where they exist and the opportunity to become more aware about the problems.  So, if we are talking about these institutions, I would make one practical suggestion: that they do not need an inspectorate of experts from Dublin with a set of regulations in their hands the length of your arm.  What they do need is concerned people locally who are articulate and the balance of one or two from outside of the community so that it does not become an exercise in self-protection for the person who has the most clout to run the worst home.  We then begin to try to answer that what is happening in these homes becomes known to the community which they are serving and we do everything we can to raise levels of awareness about the problem among the people who are affected and allow them to have the power &mdash; it is a long-term thing but we must move in this direction &mdash; to take the decisions.</P>
    <P>We shall effect the changes which Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator McGuinness would like.  But at the bottom of it all, until we move in that direction we must have regulations which ensure a basic standard.  That is why it is important to take cognizance of what the proposer and seconder of this motion have said.  But there are many imaginative things that could take place.  We recently tried a dog-handling service &mdash; you may laugh &mdash; in an old people's setup in Ballymoney, where youngsters go down with their dogs once a week and the old people love it.  They have actually something to touch, to communicate with.  Perhaps young children have the same effect, but as long as we keep classifying society into strata and sects, we will continue to fragment our communities and we will lose what Senator Cregan has been trying to tell us about, and which it is possible to recapture.</P>
    <P>Before I resume my seat I would suggest that it is very well worth exploring the day centre and how you can develop the day centre concept.  It is certainly <Col N="780" /> worth exploring the need for networks for particular problems and how to bring them together in a focus in the community. It is necessary to get back to the concept of smaller communities and to give them the power to be effective in community and, above all else, we do need an exercise in the raising of awareness about all that happens inside our communities and in this particular instance it is about what is happening with regard to the treatment, care and reintegration of old people where they live.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief.  I realise that this motion was motivated by people who have a great concern for human beings who have to be taken into care in this way.  I am sure there are many places throughout the country where standards are not high enough.  I believe that in many instances a little love, a little concern, and a little attention will make up for many defects. I think we need that at all times.</P>
      <P>I agree that standards must be very high, but rather than annul the regulations we should have them removed to incorporate the immeasurable standards that the Senators who proposed and seconded this motion spoke about.  I agree that too many of our old people are committed to homes, institutionalised, put into a virtual prison for a great part of their lives.  In general the State does encourage society to keep its elderly people.  I do not think it is realised generally that people who build new houses can also get a grant for a granny flat under the same roof of the house.  The maximum limit for a new house for grant purposes is 1,346 square feet for which there is a grant of £2,000 and a mortgage subsidy of £3,000.  For those who build a granny flat for their in-laws or relatives there is a further grant of £2,000 if those people have not claimed a grant before in their lifetime.  But the regulations empower people to build a granny flat as well as build the house.  This is an encouragement.  Too few people know about this and for that reason too few people avail of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> I also feel that the essential repairs grant is very important and helps to keep elderly people in society.  By and large it is intended for a house that has passed its useful span but on which a moderate outlay will keep the house fit for the time of the people who live in it, the elderly people.  I welcome the increase in that grant.</P>
    <P>The disabled person's grant of up to £4,000 is most important.  It has helped many people to remain in our society.  I appeal to the Minister, as I have done before, to ensure that people who qualify for these grants would have simple plans prepared by the local authorities in their area.  For example, in the area of Dublin Corporation people who qualify for disabled person's grants have the plans prepared by Dublin Corporation.  This is a great help and I see no reason why it could not be extended throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In the latest revision of the reconstruction grants some tangible encouragement should have been given to build extensions to homes for the purpose of housing elderly relatives.  This could be looked at. I know at present there is a great scarcity of space in geriatric hospitals.  I know that in St. Joseph's Hospital, Trim, which must be one of the best geriatric hospitals in the country, there is a long waiting list. Many people on the waiting list will die before they can be admitted.  This is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I agree generally with what the Senators have said.  I agree that the highest standards are essential but I feel we should incorporate what we have and build on it to achieve these higher standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is important that we get the opportunity, which Senators McGuinness and Ryan have given us today, to discuss the Homes for Incapacitated Persons Regulations, 1985. As Members of this House are all too well aware, regulations do not very often reach this Chamber or the other House, or are discussed in sufficient detail.  There are certain regulations which have a major impact in one area of Government <Col N="782" /> policy or another.  This is a particularly important motion regarding an area of concern to a number of Senators who have contributed today and no less so to myself.  I have been calling for a considerable time to have the 1966 regulations, which were brought in to govern the standards of accommodation of the elderly, updated and made more pertinent to conditions as they now are.</P>
      <P>My concern about the regulations the Minister has laid before the Houses and which are under discussion today is not that they are not welcome but that they are not going anything like far enough and, to some little extent, I feel there is a certain face-saving element in them.  It has to be said that in the course of the last 12 years &mdash; and speaking particularly of the Eastern Health Board area with which I am much more familiar with than I am with the country at large &mdash; the commercial nursing homes, the places to be governed by these regulations, have increased in numbers to a very large degree.  In 1970 there were only 23 beds in the Eastern Health Board area which received <i>per capita</i> payment from the Eastern Health Board as assistance towards the patients in the homes, whereas in 1982 there was 1,371 patients receiving that <i>per capita</i> assistance.  I do not need to contrast for the Minister the difference between what is provided in this country by way of <i>per capita</i> assistance to the elderly in homes when they are in care in private nursing homes such as those we are discussing and what is available in the United Kingdom.  There is a vast difference in the scale of assistance and in the scale of provision for this category and for our senior citizens.  I am concerned, along the same lines as Senator McGuinness and Senator Brendan Ryan, with the vagueness of the regulations. On page 5(10) (2) we talk about:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>adequate accommodation and space in single and shared sleeping areas . . . adequate day space for each patient in an area separate from the circulation and sleeping area, and adequate dining and sitting room space for mobile patients . . . doorways and corridors <Col N="783" /> which allow for easy use of wheelchairs and walking aids and access ramps where appropriate, a visitors' reception area and adequate facilities for patients to receive visitors in private.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of making my point I will quote a relevant section from a report of the Eastern Health Board dealing with private nursing homes.  It was produced in July 1982.  It states:</P>
    <P>The Nursing Staff vary in terms of numbers, qualifications and training. ...almost all of the buildings were not designed for their present use.  Adaptions which had been carried out could only be regarded as partially successful. Multiple occupation of rooms with more than 3 beds per room was quite common.  Ventilation space available for each individual could only be regarded as barely adequate.  Few homes have separate day or dining rooms.  A lift is rare and fire hazards must be a cause of concern to many proprietors.  The quality and standards of toilet and bath facilities are much less than ideal for the needs of the elderly or infirm residents.  Provision of special equipment and facilities such as assisted baths, specially equipped showers and toilets, wheelchair toilets and other aids, for example, ramps, grab rails and hand rails, is lacking in a number of homes.  Only one of these homes has a room available for mortuary purposes.</P>
    <P>I could develop what I have been saying to make my point even more substantial because the reality is that within the Eastern Health Board area the private nursing homes have been taking up the lack of provision for the elderly by the Department of Health directly through its agency, the Eastern Health Board.  There is a disparity between the services provided for the elderly in one health board area and another.  I know that most of the buildings that are provided were built in the 18th century or 19th century.  Little provision has been made by way of institutional care by the Department of Health or by its agency, the Eastern <Col N="784" /> Health Board, or its predecessor, the Dublin Health Authority, since the foundation of this State.  On the one hand we are not providing the regulations; on the other hand we are not providing a sufficient <i>per capita</i> assistance to those running the homes.  Thirdly, there is not a sufficient scheme of encouragement by way of loans and grants to make these regulations have teeth, upgrade the facilities and help not just the patients but also the proprietors who are running some very good homes.  In instances, however, they are running homes that should be closed.  These people should be assisted to bring their homes up to an adequate standard.</P>
    <P>We are not really looking at this problem in a global enough way.  I hope the Minister will be able to do so when responding and that we will be able to make some attempt to provide the assistance &mdash; we must face up to assistance by way of loans and grants &mdash; to the proprietors of these homes in order to upgrade, improve and to bring facilities up to date, to conform to the aims that are in the regulations before us.</P>
    <P>I welcome the regulations, although I do not think they are adequate.  We must get something done to improve the standards by way of assisting those who are operating these homes when otherwise the responsibility would be on the Department of Health.  We should inaugurate a scheme of considerable loans and grants to be made available to achieve objectives which could be achieved so that we can expect standards of a higher kind than are contained here, providing for more detail in regard to the amount of space per patient and the amount of day room and other facilities which should be available, down to the number of nurses and so on.</P>
    <P>This is an area we really need to take on in a spirit of &mdash; I refer to my colleague, Senator Cregan's contribution earlier &mdash; trying to achieve better standards in these homes by the suggestions I have put forward. But equally we should look at the prescribed relative's allowance, which at present provides £24.60 per week, as one attempt to rectify the need for support in <Col N="785" /> the community care area for the home in the first place.  I do not see why we are not opening up that allowance and making it more generally available to families.  At the moment if you have children over 18, provided they are not handicapped, you are not eligible for that assistance.  That is the sort of area that could, in the first instance, begin to improve conditions in the community by way of encouraging families in difficult economic conditions to keep their elderly at home, to maintain them and to give them an adequate standard of care, nutrition and heating, with all the extra expenses involved.</P>
    <P>These are very real considerations for people who have to consider what to do in relation to an elderly person.  We should not just increase the availability of grants and loans to the proprietors of homes but to those who might start a neighbourhood type of development, activities for the elderly such as Senator Cregan mentioned.  For example, in the eastern region the vast majority of these facilities are to be found in the Dún Laoghaire and Bray areas.  There is not enough encouragement to each community in each neighbourhood to go ahead and provide facilities themselves.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister is only regarding these regulations as an interim measure and that we will hear more from him about how he is going to seek to encourage those running the nursing homes.  This should be done in a spirit of partnership with them, given that the Department itself over a much longer period than the Minister has had responsibility for has not been seriously providing the level of institutional care that is needed alongside the development of community care.  We should seek to work a scheme of encouragement to ensure that the standards are seen to work and that we are not simply introducing those regulations after a long period of neglect in relation to regulations when their effect will be minor enough.  We have got to ensure that whatever regulations are passed now are improved in the foreseeable future and will be the kind that will raise standards in some <Col N="786" /> of the homes that are a real cause for concern.  I need not make this point any more to the present Minister who is well aware of the complaints that arise about a small but a worrying number of homes. The standards need to be improved and I do not think these regulations, as they are now before us, can have sufficient effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the many Senators, particularly Senators B. Ryan and McGuinness, for their expression of concern about this fundamental issue.  However, I strongly differ in that I believe the expression of concern does not warrant the annulment of the regulations.  I can assure Senators that the introduction of these regulations is not &mdash; and I want particularly to assure Senator FitzGerald on this &mdash; a face saving exercise at all.  The reality is that I am the first Minister for Health in almost 20 years to bring in new regulations relating to nursing homes.  It has been a difficult exercise.  I have consulted with the health boards throughout the country, and I had the observations of the Eastern Health Board on these regulations, and the observations were not that they were inadequate.  I had observations from the National Health Council and from the Council for the Care of the Aged.  Admittedly, that latter council had some reservations.  I assured them that I would, as a continuing exercise, take into account the reservations they had regarding the precision of some of the standards and that I had taken into account the reports of the two studies which the National Council for the Aged had done in the general areas.  I want to state that these regulations will certainly enhance the role of the good nursing homes and result in the closure of those that should be closed and which are particularly inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations are reasonably specific in relation to a number of areas.  Admittedly, I have not been able to lay down precise criteria as to the square footage in relation to bedroom accommodation and living room accommodation for those homes because they vary so much.  The <Col N="787" /> particular conditions of those who occupy them also vary.  The criteria would be so subjective that it would not be possible to lay down specific standards.  With due respect to Senator B. Ryan, who mentioned the New York criteria in terms of the homeless, I can assure him that the criteria laid down here and the inspection powers of the health boards are far superior to anything which might be alluded to in that regard.  For example, the regulations do specify that the health board will be empowered to lay down the number of persons in each particular group.  The accommodation will vary considerably throughout the country but I have no doubt that the health board staffs in carrying out the inspection of the accommodation will ensure that there is not gross overcrowding to the extent that proper care cannot be provided.</P>
    <P>These are the only two areas where there is a degree of imprecision and it is a necessary degree of imprecision because we have to bring in new regulations &mdash; the old regulations are entirely out of date and we have to introduce them.  In some respects they are intermediate in their impact and when they are in we will certainly review them again.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the definitions relating to accommodation, and relating to sufficient, suitable and nutritious food properly prepared, cooked and served, I cannot be precise in those areas for the simple reason that it is not possible at this stage of drafting the regulations.  In many other areas, notably those relating to records, which are of critical importance in the running of any nursing home and in terms of employment, for example, we have been precise.  No Senator alluded to the fact that I have included the definition of a &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; a nurse meaning a person registered in the general division of the register of nurses established under the Nurses Act, 1950.  In other words, a psychiatric nurse cannot be in charge of a nursing home, which is a critical change. This has not been alluded to.  There has to be precise records of the employment of persons within those homes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="788" /> I would stress that the general atmosphere and level of care in a home cannot be defined in a statutory way.  One could have a home acting with great precision within those regulations and yet it could be a diabolical place.  The level of assessment has to have the broad criteria of sufficiency and adequacy.  These words in the legislative framework and in the framework of going to court to enforce the regulations do have a statutory meaning. They are not redundant, contrary to the inference of Senator B. Ryan and Senator McGuinness.  I have been assured by the parliamentary draftsman that such a subjective assessment can be made on foot of a complaint by a health board inspector and a court of law can arrive at an assessment in those areas where there is not precision.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that in the area of fire procedures, including the question of fire drills, escape procedures and facilities, the regulations are quite precise.  They are also precise in relation to the entitlement to enter and inspect the homes and inspect the records kept in the homes and to provide facilities, which are of critical importance here, for designated officers of the Minister for Health or the health board to conduct interviews in the homes with persons residing in them or with staff.  That arises where the Minister has reasonable cause to believe that a patient in a home is not or has not been receiving proper care and attention.  That usually arises in terms of a complaint, so the procedures for dealing with complaints are precise in that regard.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to heating and lighting, the provisions of cold water, hot water, the general sanitary arrangements in the homes are quite precise, be they the operation of sluice rooms, the provision of hot and cold washhand basins, the provision of commodes and toilets.  I have not laid down the precise minimum number of toilets per person, per room because the nursing homes vary so much it is not possible to say that there shall be X number of toilets because some homes are on a single floor, some are three storey and some are even four storey with fire escapes and the level of toilet and <Col N="789" /> sanitary arrangements within each home can very greatly.  I would be particularly concerned about doorways and corridors which should allow the easy use of wheelchairs and walking aids.  These are just some of the areas where there is substantial precision.  We produced, as I indicated, ten pages of duplicated regulations in that area.</P>
    <P>By contrast, when one goes back the 1966 regulations did not provide for the maintenance of any records in homes. The 1966 regulations, for example, made no provision for the care of the dying and there is specific provision written in here. The provision was not made for the notification of deaths.  The basic provisions of the 1966 regulations were quite inadequate in terms of sanitary requirements and they were equally inadequate in terms of safety precautions regarding fire prevention, the safe keeping of drugs and patients' personal belongings and, above all, the general storage of food and general maintenance because an outbreak of illness within a home can frequently be traced to the food supply situation.</P>
    <P>The regulations, while they have had to be broad in some respects, are, I think, a very substantial improvement on the 1966 situation.  There are currently some 200 private nursing homes in the country with about 7,000 beds and there are about 6,000 people catered for in those homes. With the increase in the number of nursing homes and the growing elderly population in the country I think all Senators here will agree with me that there is an urgent need to update the Homes for Incapacitated Persons regulations.  I must stress that in several of the health board areas there is a parallel development.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the points made by Senator Lanigan.  A great deal has been done in the past three or four years in his health board area.  There have been major changes in Clonmel, major improvements in Carlow and Dungarvan, just to take three areas of the South Eastern Health Board.  In relation to the Eastern Health Board area we have made very considerable changes.  One of the things I find disappointing about many <Col N="790" /> public representatives &mdash; not Senators &mdash; and many people who are interested in this area is that they do not visit those areas.  I recommend that people should visit St. Mary's in the Park where a great deal of money has been spent and facilities have been enormously improved for the general geriatric and psycho-geriatric population and the care of the elderly. Brú Chaoimhín has been substantially improved.  Anybody who wants to may come up to Vergemount in Clonskeagh, to Leopardstown Park Hospital or to the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook where we are pouring in a great deal of money now. All of that money has been spent in the last three or four years and I have deliberately taken the money out of the acute hospital area &mdash; and I have acquired an appalling reputation because of the abysmal perception as to what constitutes health in this country &mdash; and put it into those areas.  As a result there have been substantial improvements in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>For the special new geriatric units we have made every year a growing capital provision.  Right around the country in the past five years and notably in the past three or four years there has been a very substantial improvement in the general level of facilities for the geriatric population who require institutional care.  I use the word advisedly because unquestionably the best care anybody can get is in their own home for as long as possible with the backup of day care services, home help services and community care services in small units.  That is the best level of nursing home care; your own home for as long as possible.  Unfortunately we seem to have opted to put people into hospitals and a great many of the residents in our acute hospitals are over the age of 65.  At any one time approximately four out of every ten people in the beds in acute hospitals are over the age of 65.  One frequently gets the impression that more and more people are admitted into such hospitals and of course that imposes an enormous strain on the Exchequer and the provision of health services.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I come to the central point <Col N="791" /> made by Senator Ryan and Senator McGuinness, namely that they feel that more precise standards should have been included in the new regulations.  I would point out that great consideration was given to the contents of these regulations including consultations with the health boards, the National Health Council, the Irish Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association.  They were consulted and I met them formally and a copy of the regulations was forwarded to the Council for the Care of the Aged.  It is my view that the provisions contained in the regulations give the health boards reasonable powers to ensure that private nursing homes operate to acceptable standards.  Regulations containing a multitude of very precise standards would be extremely difficult to enforce and they might defeat the whole purpose of the exercise.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of implementing the new regulations.  There is no point in the House enacting them unless they can be effectively implemented.  The responsibility for maintaining standards in private nursing homes in the first instance is a matter for the individual health boards.  As I have already indicated the new regulations provide for the inspection of nursing homes by health boards at least twice a year.  That is the minimum laid down.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important, therefore, that these regulations be properly enforced. My Department will shortly be holding detailed discussions on this aspect with representatives of each of the health boards.  When these regulations have been in operation, say for 18 months or two years, I will certainly have another look at them and where there is a need for more precise definition or for amendment of the regulations, I will have no reluctance to come before the House with such amendments.  I intend to monitor this situation.  These regulations represent a significant step forward in the establishment of proper safeguards for the care of patients in private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> My interest in this whole area was originally aroused by Senator Mary Frances Davidson who was mentioned by Senator Catherine McGuinness, and who was a distinguished Member of this House and who campaigned right through the early sixties in the Seanad where she had many motions down relating to the 1966 regulations. Indeed, Miss Davidson, now very elderly, lives in a nursing home herself. The reform and development of these regulations in many respects can be attributed to the single-handed campaign which she conducted at that time.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the House and Senators Ryan and McGuinness that I would be very reluctant to annual the regulations. However, I will keep the regulations under close review.  I would welcome the observations of individual Members on the implementation of the regulations in their own health board areas.  They should write to me or to the Secretary of the Department, Mr. Liam Flanagan, in relation to any aspect, incident or complaint.  The Department of Health are entirely sensitive and non-bureaucratic and expeditious in taking up complaints.  Senators should feel free to send in complaints in writing.  We are not interested in rumour or stories; we are interested in facts as they are known to Deputies and Senators who are prepared to stand over their allegations.  I can assure every Member of the House that they will be rigorously and impartially investigated by the health boards and by the Department of Health officers where necessary.</P>
    <P>A good day's work has been done in implementing these regulations which are overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  This was an extraordinary debate in the sense that it began, as we had intended it, as a discussion on a statutory instrument and it then extended into a debate on the way we care for our old people generally.  All the better for this.  What was at the back of everybody's contribution &mdash; the Minister and all Members of the House &mdash; was the quality of care that we give to our old <Col N="793" /> people at a time when they are vulnerable. I relished the comments of my colleague from the North, Senator Robb.  It is always stimulating to hear a member of that most protected of professions talk about that profession with a healthy scepticism that it badly needs &mdash; that it is only made up of human beings with the same needs and the same inadequacies and the same willingness to protect its own interests as every other profession.  Senator Robb and I have often agreed on this as we have agreed that the engineering profession &mdash; which is my own &mdash; is indeed similarly capable of looking after its own interests.  I will carry with me for a long time his phrase on the imperialism of institutions: it is a classic of what happens to people when they try to be helpful or flexible.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to hear something that has come up again and again; he mentioned our unwillingness to care for our elderly relatives and the demand for institutions.  There is some truth in that but it is ironic to hear men talk about the unwillingness to care for the elderly members of our society and for elderly relatives because while I cannot talk yet, there is not much evidence that men ever cared for elderly relatives either at home or indirectly.  It has been a responsibility and a burden that women have carried all through history.  It is perhaps the understandable and justifiable reluctance of women to carry yet another burden unpaid for, unthanked and unnoticed into late middle age that has precipitated some of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To wring our hands and to see it as simply a decline in community values is too simple; it has far more to do with the fact that women are refusing to have yet another one of men's burdens landed exclusively on their shoulders.  It also has something to do with the fact that the ruthless and viciously competitive society that so many people approve of destroys values like sacrifice, commitment, and the whole concept of love without a price is ridiculed.  Indeed it is often ridiculed by the same people who stand officially for traditional values, as they see them <Col N="794" /> themselves, but then support an economic and social order which fundamentally is in conflict with values like love and commitment and sacrifice.</P>
    <P>It is true that neither I nor Senator McGuinness unequivocally wishes to throw out these regulations: there is too much in them that is a considerable improvement; there is too much in them that is light years ahead of what was there in 1966.  The reason for our raising this matter in the way it was done is that it is the only device available to us to raise the matter which would not have imposed constraints and postponed discussion on it until after the regulations had come into force.  It is more appropriate to have these regulations discussed before the statutory period elapses.  It increases the usefulness of the discussion and it is also one of the few unqualified powers the House has.  If this House chooses not to approve statutory instruments or chooses to annual regulations, we cannot be overruled by the other House; it is an unqualified power which this House has.  It is the only power the Seanad has which is not a delaying power.  Regulations like this can be annulled by either House of the Oireachtas and, therefore, it is a worthwhile procedure to use.  It is a very blunt instrument but I wanted to seek answers and to get clarification.</P>
    <P>One of the issues that was raised in the light of my seeking clarification as to the lack of specificity in certain areas, particularly in areas relating to sanitation and bed spaces and so on, was the worry that people have that if you make the regulations too strict it will result in institutions being closed down.  This should be thought out because if we believe that there are minimum standards below which it should not be tolerable for any institution which is caring for old people to go, then that particular argument cannot hold.  If there are minimum standards, then we should be in a position to specify them.  If we do not know what they are, they do not exist.  This is separate from the argument of whether they have to be written down in numbers.</P>
    <P>You cannot say that if we make the regulations too strict institutions will <Col N="795" /> close down.  This means we are saying that, because there is so much poor provision around, it is all right to leave people in poor provision.  What we want are honest minimum standards which reflect honest attempts to define what we regard as the acceptable standards for our old people.  Therefore, as the Minister quite honestly and bluntly stated, I hope that these regulations will result in some institutions being closed down because if they are half as bad as some of the appalling stories that surface in the media from time to time they deserve to be closed down.  Whatever is wrong with hospitals in the public domain &mdash; and many of them are inadequate &mdash; they are at least accountable in a clear-cut and definite way.  Consequently, after a long and useful discussion, it comes back to the issue that I raised and that Senators McGuinness and FitzGerald raised, which is why in certain areas the regulations are not more specific.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his characteristically able defence of the regulations pointed to all the good things and there are a lot of good things.  The reason he gave was that these homes varied so much in terms of the number of floors and the number of patients etc. but the fascinating thing is that the health board within whose area of responsibility close to 50 per cent of all the nursing homes in the country are situated &mdash; that is the Eastern Health Board &mdash; and therefore must be a representative sample of nursing homes generally, did see fit to propose very specific regulations about floor space, numbers of toilets and things like that.  It is very difficult to accept that what the Minister says is the reason, is the only reason, why.  If the biggest health board in the country, with the biggest reason for concern in this area, could identify what they regarded as acceptable minimum standards, given their expertise, given their knowledge and given the number of institutions they had experience of, I cannot understand why the Minister could then ignore that particular health board and decide, presumably either on the advice of his own officials <Col N="796" /> or the advice of other health boards, such specific regulations were neither feasible nor presumably desirable.  That is what is at issue between us.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the standards in New York and I was not trying to be flippant; I was simply pointing out that in very, very difficult and very demanding circumstances other bodies had found it possible to be specific because they recognised that without specific regulations it becomes extremely difficult to enforce them.  It means that each individual case will have to go to a court to have words like &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; teased out in detail whereas if you have specific, numbered, quantifiable regulations, quantifiable standards, then these things do not have to proceed to the court because officials can say: &ldquo;This is not adequate because it fails to meet a specific standard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I accept what the Minister has said in the spirit in which he has said it, which is that this is not a once-off exercise to be filed away in the Oireachtas Library never to be looked at again, that this is something that is capable of future revision, future amendment and future upgrading.  I hope I am proved wrong and I hope that the complaints will peter out. I hope that we will not hear complaints about overcrowding, about people being frozen with the cold &mdash; though that should not happen under the current regulations &mdash; about poor sanitation and so on because everybody in this House shares exactly the same concern which is that our old people should be looked after properly.</P>
    <P>Consequently I have no intention of pushing this motion to a vote.  I am very glad that we had the discussion.  I would like to thank the Minister for agreeing to discuss it after particularly short notice. I am grateful for the detail of his reply, grateful that we had the opportunity to discuss it and with your permission, A Leas-Chathaoirleach, I would like to withdraw the motion.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Near the conclusion of my contribution last week I mentioned that <Col N="798" /> the present situation in the area of family law and marital breakdown was a disgrace. I also pointed out that I thought the legislators had a lot to be ashamed of for their lack of attention to so-called family and matrimonial law.  Matrimonial law and family law have become very complex now.  We do not have any straightforward legal remedy to cancel a marriage.  There are partial remedies but these are partial remedies to very complex problems.  Overall the system could be considered to be rigid, uncaring, out of date, selfish and, to a great extent, through lack of dialogue, a lack of awareness. That is the type of tone I finished up with last week at the end of my contribution. Throughout my contribution I was trying hard to stress the problems of immature and teenage people who enter into marriage.  I was also trying to give some emphasis to the fact that if we had divorce legislation people might be less inclined to solve their marital problems.</P>
      <P>Before divorce legislation was introduced in other countries nobody ever knew how many unhappy marriages existed.  When talking about the problems of teenage marriages, the expression I used in another area was the incidence of love, sex and marriage.  I was talking about the question of people in their teens who have to go through a process of sorting themselves out, rejecting things and establishing ideas.  In that sense when they are in the process of being rebellious both at home and at school there is a great likelihood for teenagers and immature people to enter into marriage.  It looks very good to begin with but sadly becomes more difficult as life goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment does not seem to be a deterrent to people in this category.  I know of quite a number of people who wish to get married who will take the risk of being on the dole and will take the chance to getting a council or corporation flat at the low rent.  Some of them will even take the chance of living with parents for a time until they can get themselves established but because of their immaturity they never really build the edifice.  When the glamour wears off one <Col N="799" /> or both of the parties the difficulties arise. For example the high cost of food, rent increases, cost of clothes, entertainment, perhaps cramped accommodation while they are waiting for the council or corporation flat and so on.</P>
    <P>When the first baby arrives that makes matters worse instead of improving them. Initially, after the first baby is born it can be a delightful period for the grandparents and there is a temporary sort of admiration of the couple and the child. That also wears off.  The dirty nappies and the frequent feeds added to the unsatisfactory surroundings cause them to become quarrelsome and a question of separation develops.  We have time and time again used the phrase, marry in haste, repent at leisure.  That is one of the penalties of people who are immature about love, sex and marriage or who enter into marriage in their teens because they are in revolt.</P>
    <P>We should not be carried away with the idea that it is only teenagers or immature people that this can happen to.  It also happens to many marriages between older people.  They suffer to some extent the same chain of events &mdash; cramped living conditions, several children, the demands the children make, redundancy and so on.  That is the broad area I was dealing with in my contribution last week.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise that women no longer have to accept that two standards of sexual permissiveness exist &mdash; a liberal one for the menfolk and a moralistic one for themselves.  I suppose one could say that in the early sixties a lot of this started to change.  That is gone now.  The overt promiscuity that develops leads to marriage breakdown, but it is not always the cause of a marriage breakdown.  For example, a temporary affair or two brief affairs may not be the cause of a marriage breakdown.  What happens is that the people who get involved in a court case because the marriage has broken down for other reasons are quick to latch on to the question of infidelity because it seems to be the quickest way to get something done, particularly in a situation where family law is complex and piecemeal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> We have gone over the ground of immaturity, mental and physical cruelty, reluctant parenthood, sexual incompatability, media problems that arise, redundancy, chronic illness which has a drastic effect on marriage and divergent interests. You also have the chronic drifter and the matchmaker who make their contribution towards the breakdown of marriages.</P>
    <P>It seems that we have run into the inevitability of sorting out the conflict between two conclusions, the conclusion that you should have the final termination of the marriage and the other conclusion that you have something else.  The only way to resolve that is by putting it to the people in a referendum.  We have had enough discussion, we have had plenty of dialogue, we will have more debate in the Dáil in the near future and we will have a very extensive discussion there. By that time we should be well on the way to saying that a referendum would be held in the lifetime of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Problems do not begin and end with a counselling service; they do not begin and end with premarital courses.  We have certain types of people who are of low grade mentality, who are of low character and standards.  It makes no difference what sort of advice these people get, they will not change.  There is one thing that we should recognise: there is one problem, and it is not knocking the Church by any means.  There is a big dilemma for the Irish people in getting around to the idea of a referendum and it comes from the Church.  We have heard people saying that the lawyers are more with it than anybody else about the problem of marital breakdown and that they understand the human torture and so on.  I do not accept that.  A lot of us in this House know a lot about the matter.  The people who would know a lot more than any of us are the people in the confessional, the Church people.  I do not speak of them as a separate religion.  The majority of people in Ireland are Catholics.  The bulk of the problems with regard to the 70,000 people caught in the trap of marital trouble end up in the confessional at some time.  Therefore there is a very wide <Col N="801" /> experience among a lot of Catholic churchmen of the difficulties that exist. The one problem they have is that they can never tell the people concerned that they should go for a divorce because it is against the teaching of the Church.  They can only advise people about separation and that is the end of it.  When a marriage has irretrievably broken down there is the possibility that the churchman in the confessional, who knows the problems, can only recommend a separation because the teachings of his Church forbid him to go to the point of breaking up a marriage altogether.  That seems to be a terrible inconsistency.  Nevertheless, it is one we will have to deal with in the near future when we are trying to get around to a referendum.  This is something people should bear in mind.</P>
    <P>It is not a new thing for the Labour Party to take this stance; it is nothing to be boastful about.  I believe divorce is a disaster; it is destructive.  Marriages irretrievably break down and therefore we must deal with them in the proper way.  When we were taking that attitude at our annual conferences over many years we suffered many difficulties through the media and through the reaction of other political parties.  I do not know if it is a political stroke but somebody is taking the high ground on the question of moving Bills for divorce and so on.  One must question the sincerity of it.  There is a debate going on about marital breakdown.  The other House will soon have a discussion on it.  Suddenly someone who has opposed people in another party raising it finds a good reason why it should be here.  One does not often get a chance to make a comment like that.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Chair for accommodating me as I know there are a lot of people who wish to speak.  I <Col N="802" /> feel in my position, invited by both parties to come to Seanad Éireann as an Independent, it is very important that I participate in this motion, and I am very glad to do so.  I hope that what I say will be taken in a constructive light, because that is the spirit in which it is intended.  It is important to expose the implications of this motion in relation to the perception that the people in Northern Ireland have of the Republic and, in particular, the way in which the Northern Protestant community look at it.  After all, if the Constitution and the people of the Republic are earnestly seeking to invite what I have often referred to as the Irish minority to come with them in a spirit of unity to create a new Ireland for the future, we must start by asking ourselves &mdash; I will conclude by asking the question again &mdash; are we certain that we are interested in creating a pluralist Ireland rather than a Catholic country? That is an important question and I would respect the answer either way.  It must be honestly faced and there is an opportunity in this debate to let it be known not only to the people of the Republic but, more importantly, to those at present who feel most threatened by the advances they feel are being made by this State on the integrity of the territory in which they have lived for so long.  This is what is perceived.  Therefore, it is very important that we ask ourselves how are we going to go forward &mdash; are we sincerely interested in developing a pluralist Ireland that can accommodate all the minorities and traditions of any significance in the country as Irishmen, or are we mainly concerned to establish the development of a Catholic country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown in years to come will be seen as a milestone in the development of Irish family law.  I would, therefore, commence by paying tribute to those members of the joint committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Willie O'Brien.  I hope that every person administering the marriage rites throughout Ireland will ensure that they obtain a copy of this report and study it.  I will go further and say that nobody should be <Col N="803" /> administering marriage rights, be they in a civil capacity or in a clerical capacity, without reading this report because it highlights many of the difficulties which Senators have alluded to.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it should be produced in a slightly more readable form.  Perhaps the summary at the end should be extracted and points from it highlighted for the benefit of young people who may be considering marriage and who may want to know what the legal implications of what they are doing are and the social consequences of problems which occurred in the past for other people. Most people entering into marriage are not very interested in social consequences at that stage but they might wish to know more about the legal implications.  Here we have a report which should provide a standard guide to the State aid available to them and the mechanisms whereby in future we would hope to develop a more humane and more urbane attitude to the whole problem of marital breakdown or marital difficulty.  This report is a very humane document which has tried hard to struggle with the problem, not in a legalistic sense but in a human sense.  It has taken into account the great difficulties &mdash; social, emotional, and psychological &mdash; of those involved in this dilemma.</P>
    <P>I hope in the course of my contribution to develop a personal viewpoint on the matter of divorce which might well be held by my co-religionists in the North and also to try to link this up with what I see as essential: that we must always keep before us the sanctity of marriage vows and what we mean by marriage vows, how they are obtained, how much is understood about vowing at the time the vow is made and how much responsibility is taken by those who deliver the vow at the time that it might have to be broken if this legislation is to pass on to a situation where divorce is permitted.</P>
    <P>In that respect I will argue very strongly for the removal of all clauses in any civil Constitution which seeks to establish any absolute position, particularly an absolute position based on a particular set of moral perceptions in relation <Col N="804" /> to the moral law with which any group of significance in the society profoundly disagree.  As I said in another debate allied to this subject, the essence of being human as opposed to being divine is to entertain the possibility of doubt.  Therefore, absolutism in a Constitution that claims to speak for the people as a whole has no place at all.  That is not to say that absolutism cannot be the prerogative of a particular Church if that Church so wishes to hold on to absolute views on the basis of divine inspiration.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell briefly now on the aspect of minority and human rights.  We can go back to the peace settlement of 1919 when there was a break up of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire.  At the Treaty of Versailles there was a great deal of consideration given to minority rights.  It has always interested me how the great allied powers who had won that war seemed to be so concerned about the rights of minorities inside the defeated territories but they certainly never expanded those rights to include minorities inside their own territories.  In fact, at one stage in the debate when the right of minorities as a global concern was dealt with, they retreated from making it an all embracing right.  Nevertheless, the rights of minorities were discussed at that time.  Generally speaking, the various arrangements for the protection of the rights of minorities provided for:</P>
    <P>Equality before the law in relation to civil and political rights, freedom or religion, own language and maintenance of own religious and educational establishments.</P>
    <P>In a different context I have argued in the North of Ireland for the right of the Irish language to have a place in the curriculum of the so-called State schools and I have urged in respect of interdenominational schools that they cannot be inter-denominational unless they respect the right of the minority language in the territory of Northern Ireland.  I, therefore, feel that I am on fairly strong ground when I now make an appeal for other rights which are related to rights which the Protestant community firmly believe <Col N="805" /> it is reasonable for them to have in relation to their own religious precepts.</P>
    <P>Under the universal declaration on human rights everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this declaration without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language or religion.  There is reference to the right of religious groups in the international United Nations covenants on civil and political rights.  In the report there is a section which deals with the conflict between the Irish constitutional position on the prohibition of the dissolution of marriage and the European Convention on Human Rights.  Article 14 of that convention states:</P>
    <P>The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any grounds, such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with the national minority, property birth or other status.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the rights and freedoms set forth in this convention we have only to read article 8. I will not bore you with the tedium of re-reading it as I am sure some Senators must have alluded to it.  It is contained within the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. Perhaps I could just briefly allude to it.  It states that everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.  We can go through a number of such conventions, articles, and so on and so forth, but the point that I am making is that we have evolved, particularly in western Europe in recent times, to a point where minority rights are becoming a very important issue indeed.  It is when we talk even of the right to self-determination as any member of the Northern minority will well know, that this is now seen by any reasonably-thinking and certainly any far-thinking person as a right to self-determination for minorities as well as majorities.  The question, of course, is how do we arrange an accommodation? <Col N="806" /> I will come back to that later in the context of this debate.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to me that there were 700 written submissions and 24 oral submissions, so that the subject is something which has engendered a great deal of debate.  From the outcome we can say that that debate is constructive.  It has not only shown why there should be change but it has also put forward the arguments for why change is fraught with pitfalls and dangers.  Therefore, it has alerted the writers and those who took the time and trouble to debate the issues contained in the report to dangers in making swift, far-reaching changes in this particular law.  It has resulted in a number of very positive proposals being made to try to cope with the effects that such change might bring about and to try as far as possible to ensure that the change would be for the benefit and well-being of the people and not for their further disillusionment.</P>
    <P>A few points that I will just highlight relate to the process of education.  It is essential that we make our young people more aware of what is involved in living in a highly complex society in relation to the marriage bond.  There is a lack of the support of the extended family which used to exist and also, I am afraid, the lack of what I was alluding to in another discussion this afternoon: the lack of a feeling of community cohesiveness. There is a great sense in many people's lives today of isolation and loneliness. Out of that isolation and loneliness, particularly if talents have not had an opportunity to fully develop, and if the person has lacked this opportunity for full individual development, there is a lack of confidence.  Where there is a lack of confidence it is very easy to become threatened, defensive and negative and for aggravation and frustration to lead on to the sort of frustrations that exist in a home which lead eventually to the fragmentation of the marriage and the dissolution of it.</P>
    <P>The point about counselling is vital. The idea of a pre-marriage counselling service is an excellent one, as is the idea of counselling for the married person. At times I could well have done with a <Col N="807" /> counsellor myself.  Occasionally, when I am rushing off at about 6 a.m. in the morning in the dark to the Seanad having operated all the previous day, a counsellor at the back door might be perhaps as appropriate as the petrol pump attendant if I have not filled the car the previous night.</P>
    <P>I thought it was excellent that the report stressed the need for mediation. Having decided the number of options, does one want a bi-partisan discussion about one's future?  Does one want a tri-partisan discussion?  Does one want a mediation service?  Does one want an umpire?  I asked Senator Rogers earlier would she like to have her marriage umpired and she assured me she would not.  We both agreed that &ldquo;mediation service&rdquo; seemed to have hit the right word and the right tone.  It has at least stimulated the imagination as to what might be possible in the context of a complex society with increasing marital problems.</P>
    <P>The idea of lowering the minimum age for marriage down to 18 years is excellent. If we have given majority to our citizens at 18 years of age, as I have said frequently in this House, we should trust them as citizens who have the unique gift of youth to contribute to our society.  Just as age has its own gifts in wisdom and experience, so youth has something to say in terms of vigour, vitality and inspiration for the rest of us.  I cannot see, if we have now agreed to give our citizens the right to full responsibility at 18 years of age, that they should not be allowed to freely enter into marriage at that age. The idea of having guardians and the court involved in the 16 to 18 age group is logical.  We have used the age 18 years for good or for bad as the dividing line between the minor and the major fully mature citizen.</P>
    <P>Some of the factors involved in breakdown were alluded to.  The one I highlight is the waning influence of the extended family.  Again, this highlights the need to think in Ireland, as we move to the future, of how we can reduce the scale of our enterprise so that whenever change is coming about it is related to a scale to <Col N="808" /> which we can easily relate, so that we are challenged rather than threatened by it, and we are more likely to have an input into the changes which affect us.  I think the community scale as well as the extended family are factors of importance in marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>We come next to the problems caused by marriage breakdown.  There is an allusion to the increasing numbers of illegitimate births and the increasing numbers of single parents.  This comes back again to the whole business of the late 20th century alienation, where man is not only separated from mankind or human kind, separated from his neighbour or family, from his work, but even from the deep inner self.  There is a great conflict between the projected image. What we are doing very often is related to what we hope to get in the next moment rather than being a person in the moment in which we are involved and finding that as our focus for full development.  The whole problem of alienation is a big issue which we as a society have not really addressed ourselves to sufficiently.  We hear about alienation in another context, but I wish people would expand the whole area of discussion into much wider issues than just how one feels in the North.</P>
    <P>I have asked the question whether our alienation means that personal relations are not able any longer to sustain the penetration and permanency of an enduring growth involved in the unity of two people in the bond of marriage.  I have been to fishing communities in the north of Scotland.  I used to spend a lot of time with them.  I could see there very unalienated people with a deep and abiding affection and respect for themselves. In one sense it was quite a precarious society, and certainly an unsophisticated one, but in another sense there was a very real sense of human worth.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that the adversarial nature of the legal system has been addressed.  One has only to be witness in the High Court &mdash; and I am sure it goes for Dublin as well as Belfast &mdash; to be appalled at what I have referred to elsewhere as the professional class conspiracy and the intimidating effect of the whole <Col N="809" /> legal process in the High Courts of law. There may have been a time in the past when that was essential in order to keep the natives under control, but that time and that day has long gone.</P>
    <P>What we are interested in now is trying to create support for people who are in distress and to realise that there is no one cause for an effect.  The idea that a woman who falls into a hole in the road dug out by another man can sue the man or the person for whom the man works and that he becomes blame-worthy entirely for the falling into the hole is a nonsense.  The person has her faculties and the hole has none.  The question I, therefore, ask is can we not begin to see? That is why I am delighted about the highlighting of this adversarial legal approach.  We are taking about a multitude of causes producing an effect.  This requires wisdom and an instinctual approach much more than a legalistic and highly rational one.  We will never go anywhere if we are only concerned with what goes on in the head.  The spirit and the heart are part of the whole and in recent decades we have discarded them at our peril.</P>
    <P>The effect of destructive parental interaction all ties up with what we have already mentioned.  We mentioned the feelings of alienation, isolation and loneliness, the feelings of inadequacy and lack of importance, the feelings of not having power to do anything effective in life and not having an outlet for creative activity. This drives people in on themselves.  It certainly has had a more terrible effect on the male rather than the female.  I do not wish to sound chauvinistic when I say that a woman, in a sense, in spite of the terrible hardships she has had to suffer in the home, has had a tremendous forum for her creative outlet in her home which man, I hope, in the coming decades will share much more, but to date he has not felt quite as much at home in that sharing as he should.  I am very beholden to a certain Senator who suggested that that might be my own problem too.  As a result one has had to try to make some <Col N="810" /> adjustment.  As the report says, adjustment for spouses and children is very painful.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the question of the law of nullity.  I was appalled to hear that there had been no legislative intervention in the law of nullity since the Matrimonial Causes and Marriage Law (Ireland) (Amendment) Act, 1870.  It is very valuable that the report highlights the ambiguity between civil and church law.  Let us be fair.  We are talking about the church law in the Republic of Ireland. We have not come to the Constitution yet.  It affects essentially over 95 per cent of the people living here.  We are talking about a small minority, in spite of the fact that it has considerable significance in the context of the overall conflict and problems of Ireland.  This question of the conflict and of the ambiguous nature of the civil and the religious law needs to be looked at very seriously.  Again, I will be alluding to that shortly.</P>
    <P>The professional class conspiracy is certainly highlighted by the fact that the cost of a day's outing in court to bring a case of nullity and have it defended, is £3,000.  That is an appalling indictment of our system.  Perhaps that is because it goes on to speak of the complexity of the procedure.  Again, one is delighted to read that this report is addressing itself to simplifying the procedure.</P>
    <P>The inconsistency of human judgment is alluded to.  Even learned judges can differ in their appreciation of cases on different days and at different times in the same way as examiners can, as some well-known examiners in this House know only too well.  They can, depending on their form, allot marks in different ways at different times.  That is part of life's experience.  We cannot expect total consistency.  Otherwise we would be living in a different type of world.  We must strive to bring consistency into the operation as far as is humanly possible. With reference to involvement of the religious communities, it is stated in paragraph 7 (1) (24) (c):</P>
    <P>it would be desirable that the nature of a contract and its legal consequences <Col N="811" /> should be made clear to the parties at the time of the ceremony.</P>
    <P>I would say &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; to that.  That comes into the whole business of the preparation for marriage, the education for marriage and the responsibility of those who have the sacred and social task of administering the marriage vow.  It would be nice to think that we could move rapidly into a situation where the nature of the contract and its legal consequences would be made clear to the parties at the time of the ceremony.  That is why I would stress once again that this report should be compulsory reading for all those who are responsible for bonding within the context of State law.  Nullity should not result in illegitimacy.  We have argued that before, and I am sure we will argue it again.  It seems a very unfair start to life that the child should be found guilty &mdash; if &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; is the right word &mdash; for something that was not in any way its responsibility.</P>
    <P>The grounds for judicial separation have been considerably expanded.  That is a good thing.  In fact, the whole emphasis is to be on breakdown, rather than on specific fault.  I would support that to the hilt.  It is more vague in one sense and in another sense it does specify that breakdown is what we are trying to cope with, and we are not opening the sluice gates, as is one of the fears, to making divorce readily available for anything less than what is seen to be transparently a situation of breakdown.</P>
    <P>The legal remedies as outlined in paragraph 7 (3) (6) lay down that the court should have the power to decide: (1) who shall have the right to live in the family home; (2) how various properties should be divided; (3) how best interests of children will be protected; (4) how maintenance is to be awarded; (5) that a legal separation agreement may be converted into an order of judicial separation; and (6) that irretrievable breakdown should be the one overall ground for judicial separation rather than alluding to the fault principle.  The emphasis later on in the sections dealing with maintenance is vitally important.  I have not had many <Col N="812" /> people who asked me to take up issues since I was fortunate enough to be nominated as an Independent here, but one of the issues certainly has been the problem of the defaulting party not paying the allowance which the court said should be paid to the other party.  I was, therefore, very pleased to find that the State should be empowered to make payments of maintenance to victims of default and that is the duty of the State to recoup from the defaulting party, not leaving it to the unfortunate party who is at his or her wit's end trying to obtain what is his or her legal right.</P>
    <P>The pursuit of defaulters into member states is mentioned.  That is excellent, because certainly in regard to the closest member state, you only have to hop across the Irish Sea to escape legislation in this respect.  I stand to be corrected there.  Certainly, the pursuit into member states is an excellent idea.  Perhaps this is something which is being discussed in the present ongoing Anglo-Irish talks as one of the peripheral issues.</P>
    <P>The idea that the judge should have support in terms of a legal social service attached to the courts is essential in today's complex world.  Judges, by the very nature of their occupation, are unlikely to be wandering around with the Simon Community at night, or out in the local docks, or trying to see what the queue is like at the employment exchange.  It would be very unlikely &mdash; and it would be unreasonable of us to expect &mdash; that they would be able to put themselves into the position of the deprived people in our community whose marriages are breaking up.  They have difficulty enough in coping with those who belong to their own social class.  They need some sort of professional help to put the problem into perspective and to show the various ways in which it can be addressed with the agencies that exist in the State and, hopefully, with those which will be developed by the State as a result of this report.  Of course, the establishment of a family tribunal is very much to be commended as part of this ongoing process.  There is an interesting reference in 41 (3) (2) to the Committee <Col N="813" /> on the Constitution, 1967.  I am sure some Senators must have alluded to it.  It states:</P>
    <P>In the case of a person who was married in accordance with the rites of a religion, no law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of that marriage on grounds other then those acceptable to that religion.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to add that it might be necessary to add a clause to the effect that the above was not to be regarded as contravening any other provision in the Constitution prohibiting religious discrimination. I would like to alert the Seanad to the fact that as long ago as 1967 it was recognised that there were distinct rights pertaining to Irish people of different religions and that something had to be done to accommodate those rights.</P>
    <P>Various arguments have been put in favour of divorce, saying that it is an injustice not to have it.  By not having it, there is no recognition of any new relationship by the State, regardless of how wronged the person entering into the second relationship may have felt. There is no real legal protection for parties, plus or minus their children, with regard to maintenance, succession, violence, and so on.  The children are illegitimate, as yet.  The family suffers substantial disadvantages with regard to tax and social welfare.  There are effects also on the first marriage remnants &mdash; and I have used that word deliberately &mdash; because too often when we are discussing this problem we forget that there may be a party left with nothing only a memory of a tragedy and a broken home, a broken house and a broken life.  How are we going to legislate for them at least make them feel that they can reintegrate into society?</P>
    <P>All the minority Churches, with the exception of the Church of the Latter Day Saints, are in davour of divorce.  I thought the Quaker suggestions particularly apt.  They suggested that there should be a period of five years of marriage before any permissible divorce and <Col N="814" /> a six-month interval before the abdication and commencement of proceedings.</P>
    <P>The ban has not prevented marital breakdown, as we know.  The level of marriage breakdown &mdash; and this is a highly significant observation &mdash; North and South are similar in spite of the fact that divorce has been available in Northern Ireland since 1937, perhaps not without significance as the year in which the present Constitution was ratified and became law.</P>
    <P>To deny the right to remarry to a spouse subjected to cruelty seems to be cruel in itself, without any social advantage accruing to the State.  There are a number of arguments against divorce. Senators will have read them.  There is the floodgate theory, and the theory that divorce will reduce the protection to the family afforded by the present Constitution and could reduce the determination of the couple in difficulties to try to make a success of the marriage.  I will come back to that in my concluding remarks.  There is the theory that it will produce confusion among children deprived of near relationships.</P>
    <P>However, in the report the committee counter this with positive proposals. There must be better education for marriage, a higher age for marriage and more extensive counselling.  The report goes to show how this counselling can be brought about in terms of its chapter on mediation, which should be essential reading for anyone interested in the subject and, finally, the idea of a new family court structure.  I am not proposing, because of time, to go into the details of these as they can well be read.  I certainly support the conclusions.  They have been documented and we have now got a base line from which to move forward.</P>
    <P>I would not like to conclude, however, without making some mention of one of the two most important aspects of this, that is, the effect on society and on the individual of the vow.  In today's society vows can very often be taken lightly, because the full implication of what one is about is not completely comprehended, nor are the parties sufficiently penetrated <Col N="815" /> by what they are doing to be aware of the consequences of its undoing.  I would like to put on record &mdash; and I gave it considerable thought some weeks ago lest in my position as a northern Protestant I should be misunderstood in relation to the great concern the Catholic Church has shown over the centuries for the indissolubility of marriage and for the sanctity of marriage &mdash; that marriage breakdown represents failure.  Legislation which would make such failure worse is, in my view, bad for the family and the community. The emotional failure and the undermining of self-confidence which such failure inevitably causes is transferred to children and such children lose confidence in establishing relationships.  On the other hand, in legislation which recognises failure and tries and seems to come to terms with it, and which is concerned to repair at least in part and in as far as it can the damage created by such breakdown, there lies the essence of my hope &mdash; and I imagine the hope of many others here &mdash; for rehabilitation and expression of our compassion.</P>
    <P>Let there be no mistake about it &mdash; a broken vow is the expression of a broken person.  If, in connection with such broken vow there is no feeling of guilt, it is only possible to conclude that there was no properly understood vow in the first place.  Guilt and remorse cannot be separated from the breaking of vows properly understood.  Such guilt and remorse are destructive to the development of any subsequent inter-personal relationships and as a result are destructive to the fabric of society as a whole. Guilt and remorse can be just as destructive as dead marriage.  We have got to consider how we can influence people involved in such a dilemma to follow a process of reintegration or, in theological terms, atonement.</P>
    <P>If there is no guilt and remorse, I can only conclude that the taking of the vow did not penetrate the inner being of the person in the way that vows by definition should do.  The flippancy of the participant may be no worse than the failure of the vows' administrator to impart the <Col N="816" /> meaning of what is involved.  We must ask if those who choose to take a vow had been adequately prepared by those who administer such to receive into their inner being the significance of what they are affirming and the choice involved in making such affirmation.</P>
    <P>In marriage, then, there are three human parties involved in the vow &mdash; the couple and the administrator.  Ideally, the unalienated bonding of two unalienated people should allow them to realise a capacity for the infinite in the totality of their relationships.  This is the ideal.  On the other hand, destructive bondings is fragmentary and leaves persons out of tune with themselves and increasingly separated from the other.  Rebonding, without resolution of the alienation of the broken bond, can only be a diminished bonding in relation to the capacity of the whole person defined in a loving relationship with another person &mdash; completeness.</P>
    <P>We must, therefore, be clear what we as a society, through the support given to the administrators of our vows as well as to the couple concerned, have created in marriage, just as we must be clear about the effects of what is being broken when marriage is dissolved.</P>
    <P>The Church that administers the vow of marriage can understandably be aggrieved to be denied any role at the time of the dissolution of the marriage. We cannot swing from a position where the Church had too great a say to a position where the Church has no say.  It seems therefore that the Church responsible for the administration of a marriage vow should be asked at the time of any dissolution of the bonding created by that vow, two questions: one, what preparation was made for the marriage vow of the persons concerned, as administered by the clergyman concerned?  And two, what was the degree of understanding transmitted to the parties of the mystical, legal and social implications and obligations of the vows which they are or were asked to take?  If the State has had no role in the making of the marriage at the time of a marriage, there is logic in the suggestion that the Church should <Col N="817" /> have the sole right to annual a marriage or to refuse such annulment of a marriage celebrated by it.  State involvement in marriage annulment would suggest the need for State participation &mdash; a State ceremony as well as a Church ceremony at the time of a marriage &mdash; and the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown makes such a recommendation.</P>
    <P>Remarriage in a Church, for example, in the Presbyterian Church, without first undergoing a reintegrating process to atone for the broken vow of the first marriage seems to me as a Presbyterian a disturbing contradiction.  Just as community confession in the remote past was a means of expurgating guilt and reachieving wholeness or atonement, so it would seem that the contradiction inherent in the remarriage of a party to a broken vow can only be resolved by recourse to such redemptive process so that the parties involved can be reintegrated as whole persons into the wholeness of the community represented by the institution that administered the initial vow or vows broken by them.  The failure to heal the effects of this breakdown compromises integrity as has been felt at one time or another by us all.  In the clinical situation I see it often and in its most extreme and aggressive form it leads to nervous breakdown and much worse.</P>
    <P>The mystical dimension of marriage and the moral law are central to the potential of marriage for loving family care.  However, the State has to cope with many situations in which the parties seem neither to be aware of mystical union nor to be fully appraised of the reasons for the moral law or of the effects of contravening it.  This is where the State should become involved; and this is where this report is to be commended.  This is also where we, as Senators, should challenge absolute positions in written consititutions which should, of necessity, reflect the degree of consensus that must be the basis of any claim to unity underwritten by them.  In other words, the imposition of uniformity cannot create unity; unity <Col N="818" /> is a paradox for it is based on the acknowledgement of diversity.  In a State where second bondings do not infringe State law &mdash; and Ireland is one of those &mdash; the denial of divorce is nonsensical.  I support this view with a quotation from W. B. Yeat's speech in the Seanad in 1925:</P>
    <P>You are going to have indissoluble marriage but you are going to permit separation.  You are going to invite men and women in the prime of life to accept for the rest of their existence the law of the cloisters.  Do you think you are going to succeed in what the entire of Europe has failed to do for the last 2,000 years?  A great English judge, speaking out of the immensity of his experience, said that there is no cause of irregular sexual relations so potent as separation without the possibility of remarriage.</P>
    <P>In 1937 the divorce issue was again raised in the debate on the Articles of the new Constitution.  In discussing a matter which would have such profound implications not only in the south of Ireland but in the whole of Ireland, the debate had to be stopped twice in order to ensure the presence of a quorum of 20 delegates &mdash; there were over 20 present here earlier on.  The Constitution of 1937 which contains Articles 41.3.2 was eventually ratified in a referendum by the people with &mdash; please note &mdash; 685,000 approximately votes cast in favour; 525,000 votes cast against; 31 per cent of those entitled to vote did not do so.</P>
    <P>A quick mathematical calculation will show that less than 40 per cent of the people in the Republic voted in favour of the 1937 Constitution &mdash; hardly an overwhelming result.  That was the year in which divorce was brought in by law in Northern Ireland.  In the same Constitution are the controversial Articles 2 and 3.  We who live in Northern Ireland should ask what might have happened had it been possible to canvass the Northern vote to which these Articles apply and to which the Constitution seems to lay claim.  If some Senators will argue that that is the fault of the Unionist population, I feel I have a perfect right as an <Col N="819" /> Irish Protestant who wishes to live in an all-Ireland State, to make this point.</P>
    <P>As long ago as 1967 the Report of the Committee on the Constitution made constructive recommendations with regard to Article 41.  One might ask why so little has happened since that report was published.  I could go through the six main points but I am sure that other Senators have already done so; the points can be found in that report to show in effect that Vatican II had changed the attitude of the official Catholic Church in this matter and that the State in many ways had a more harsh interpretation of the problem of marital breakdown than had the Church in consequence of what was decided in Vatican II.  In section 127 of the 1967 Report of the Committee on the Constitution it states: &ldquo;It is unnecessarily harsh and rigid and could, in our view, be regarded at being at variance with the accepted principles of religious liberty as declared at the Vatican Council and elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was further acknowledged then that something had to be done to regularise the position whereby those with money, know-how and nerve could leave the country to obtain what more modest people who lived within it were being denied.  The people of Northern Ireland would like, just as you would like, to live in a society without the strains and pressures that encourage the degree of alienation which results in increasing marital breakdown.  Yet they need reassurance that when it has occurred people will not be obliged to face the future in the loneliness of isolation as the only alternative to bonding illicitly with no legal protection on the grounds that failure is final and a second chance is not to be tolerated.</P>
    <P>A number in the region of 50,000 people suffer from irretrievable breakdown. Should there be an average two children per couple involved, then a further 50,000 Irish citizens are affected. This is not all.  If the Italian experience is anything to go by, it is estimated that prior to the granting of divorce, one-third of those separating in that country had <Col N="820" /> re-established new extra-legal families. Should these bondings average one child each, we can then add approximately a further 15,000 affected children to the number of people in the Republic of Ireland affected by marital breakdown &mdash; I emphasise irretrievable marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>The objection to divorce, therefore, cannot rest on the fact that it brings the relationship to an end.  That can already be done by a separation order.  The objection to divorce would therefore seem to be that it releases partners for re-marriage; yet annulment already permits parties to enter into a second relationship through marriage.  I mentioned a story I heard last week and I can verify it, that a couple whose marriage was in the process of breaking down went to a compassionate priest who said; &ldquo;Keep trying for another two years and if it does not work out we will probably be able to get you an annulment.&rdquo; I can understand the compassion but I cannot understand the inconsistency because in effect he was saying &ldquo;Even if you have not had a valid marriage&rdquo;&mdash; which in fact is what would be said if the annulment were granted &mdash;&ldquo;go ahead and live together&rdquo;.  That seems to be a contradiction of the official Catholic position on marriage.  I would hope, however, that in exposing that particular episode &mdash; I am exposing it from the point of view of commending the priest for his compassion but also to highlight the contradictory position in which those who are the officers of the Church find themselves when confronted with the human situation that everyone knows existed among their parishioners.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, as regards the objections on the grounds of morality the State can no more alter the moral perception of a Church then can a Church be allowed to dictate the legal position within its State for those who belong to other Churches within that State.  Finally, the Constitution should reflect the degree of consensus that must be the basis of any claim to unity.  A significant proportion of the Irish people, whose consent for unity is forever being sought, is not impressed by absolute positions being <Col N="821" /> defined for them in the Constitution. There is no way that such positions will ever yield the consensus which has thus far eluded us and about which we hear so much.</P>
    <P>Let us have a referendum on Article 41.3.2 so that we can see what the reality is and let it be in the lifetime of this Parliament so that we may determine whether or not in our own lifetime it is realistic to go on hoping for Irish unity, whether we can read the smoke signals from the 26 Counties which say, &ldquo;We, as good Catholics, will remain true to our Catholic religion but as Irish democrats we will permit those of you who feel just as convinced about what you think is right for your people, to have it, and to have it protected by the laws of the land.&rdquo;  That is what this referendum is about.  Shirk it, and it is another episode, as I said once before, in the tale of Mickey Mouse and do not let us see Mickey Mouse rise again in the course of this debate.  Face it with courage and tell the people what is involved, because there is much more involved than just the pure Catholic position on marriage.  That I respect; but I cannot, as a person who spent 15 years striving in a very difficult situation to promote a new concept of what we could all do together, ever tolerate absolute positions on moral questions in a Constitution made by Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first of all, to welcome the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  In doing so I would like to pay a tribute to the members of the committee for the commitment that they showed and the time that they took to tease out the very complex and difficult issues involved in the field of marriage breakdown.  I would also like to pay a tribute to the many groups and individuals who made submissions to the committee and in particular to those groups who came along and made verbal submissions, groups of people from the legal profession, Church groups and groups of social workers and people who had great experience of working on the ground and seeing the practical implications of the serious problem which is an <Col N="822" /> increasing one, unfortunately, in presentday society.</P>
      <P>The committee report in effect is not, as some people more or less dubbed it in the beginning, the report of a committee on divorce.  It was, as it should have been, an examination of all the aspects of marriage breakdown, and of course divorce is one of the suggested remedies for the tragedy of marital breakdown.  This report looks at all the aspects involved. It looks at the causes, at the resulting problems, at possible remedies and indeed at the possible consequences of such remedies for society as a whole and for individuals.  There is a great measure of agreement and consensus in this report on very many aspects of the problem.</P>
      <P>That consensus and that agreement are reflected in the submissions of many of the groups and particularly in the verbal submissions and the report itself reflects this agreement.  The agreement is in the areas where there is a great emphasis on the need for priority to be given to the protection of marriage and of the family within the State.  There is total agreement on that and those people who came along to the committee to argue in favour of legislation for the dissolution of marriage also put forward the view that the priority was the protection of marriage and the family and prevention of marriage breakdown before they would suggest what really was the last resort of divorce. There is agreement in the report, and it is in keeping with the ethos of this country, North and South, that marriage is indeed the basis for a stable society; and I think everyone involved in the compiling of the report and in the making of submissions was in agreement on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, there is an ideal which is the ideal of all those who are involved in this problem whether they be the legislators, those who made submissions or indeed those who may find themselves in the unfortunate position now of marriage breakdown and that ideal is that marital breakdown should be prevented and that all the resources of the State and the Churches and the community ought to be used towards the prevention of marriage breakdown.  Having accepted that as the <Col N="823" /> ideal position, in reading the report and in reading the submissions that were made &mdash; and I cannot say that I have read all the written submissions; I have read the account of the verbal submissions &mdash; the reality is that marriages are breaking down, an increasing number of marriages are breaking down in this society and we have to take from that as legislators that it is our job to legislate for that reality differentiating it from what we would like to see as the ideal.</P>
    <P>The report deals in detail, first of all, with the causes of marriage breakdown and it puts forward proposed remedies and ways of eliminating those causes. Like any other problem the problem of marital breakdown can only be resolved if we look at the root causes and not simply attempt to deal with the symptoms. A number of the causes are indicated in the report but in particular marriage breakdown has been attributed to certain factors.  First of all, there is the personal factor, the factor of relationships, of the lack of understanding of couples entering into marriage of the responsibilities, of the duties and indeed of the difficulties and hardships of making a marriage work.  There is the factor of age, and I think in that respect practically every group which made submissions to the committee emphasised &mdash; and all of them were speaking from experience &mdash; the need to raise the legal age of marriage to 18.  I do not think I have heard anyone in the debate in the Seanad so far do anything except agree with that.  It seems entirely logical and reasonable that people entering into such a life commitment with such responsibilities and with such implications ought to be mature enough to understand what they are about and therefore be able to carry out the commitment which they have entered into in the full knowledge of what they are about.  Therefore the age is a very important factor and it transpires from the submissions that were received that a great number of the marriages that are breaking down or have broken down are in the lower age groups.</P>
    <P>There is also the factor of a lack of <Col N="824" /> understanding and that is not entirely in the young age group.  The proposal in the report for pre-marriage counselling and for education is vitally important in this concept of preparation for marriage.  In dealing with education it is not merely the education of young people who are about to enter into the marriage state &mdash; in other words, the pre-marriage courses &mdash; but it is the general education of people, the emphasis in ordinary education on relationships, on preparing people and helping them to communicate, on helping them to develop their full personalities and helping them to be themselves, have confidence in themselves and to know what they are and who they are and therefore to become fully mature people with a fully developed personality.  Our educational structures ought to concentrate to a much greater extent on that side of a person's education and therefore produce mature adults who are well able to cope with the stresses and strains of the marriage relationship.</P>
    <P>There are also of course, as well as the personal factors, the environmental factors, and those are listed in the report as housing and economic circumstances and the problems that are presented particularly to young married couples who are struggling in difficult economic circumstances and the strains that places on a marriage.  In relation to that, I would like to say that Article 41 stresses the importance of the protection of marriage by the State and perhaps we should ask ourselves if, in effect, the economic and housing policies of our Governments have always lived up to the wording of this article.  Have they always given to the family &mdash; in the sense that the family should have at least the basic essential of good housing and adequate economic circumstances &mdash; the means to make it possible to protect the fabric of the family?  Perhaps the State has not lived up to its responsibilities in that respect. Whereas there is a lot of emphasis on other parts of Article 41, that particular aspect is one that must be stressed, that the State can and must live up to its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> Improving education for life and therefore for the commitment of marriage will not only have the effect of preventing &mdash; one would hope &mdash; a great deal of the marriage breakdown but it will undoubtedly also have the effect of improving the quality of the marriages which are perhaps reasonably good, fairly good, sometimes even very good marriages but which can always be improved, marriages which are not reaching breaking point and will never perhaps break but their quality can even be improved by a much better educational system and by a better preparation for marriage in the first place.</P>
    <P>The areas of education, economics and housing are areas which can be dealt with by the State and are not areas of contention. I would urge that those areas should be dealt with as a matter of some urgency. In the verbal submission of the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council it was interesting to note that in regard to support for marriage and the advisory service &mdash; in this case for marriage breakdowns or marriages about to breakdown &mdash; in Northern Ireland the total expenditure in the form of grants to the Marriage Advisory Council was 75 per cent of the whole whereas in this part of Ireland the total expenditure was 20 per cent of the whole.  That tells us something about ourselves in this part of Ireland and about our commitment to the idea of protecting marriage which we so cherish in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I come now to the area of actual marriage breakdown, when we have reached the stage where a marriage is breaking down or has broken down.  The emphasis in the report in this area is on mediation and conciliation services.  This emphasis comes from all the groups who made the submissions and all those groups who have vast experience of dealing with the traumatic experience that people have when they are in the situation of marriage breakdown.  I am talking particularly about the verbal submissions that were made by the Law Centre solicitors, the solicitors of the Incorporated Law Society, the AIM group and the Catholic <Col N="826" /> Marriage Advisory Service and also the Dublin Regional Marriage Tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank you for allowing me to raise this most important issue on the Adjournment. I also wish to thank the Minister for his presence here again tonight.  As the Minister is probably aware, the history of education in Oldcastle is perhaps unique in Ireland.  The Gilson School, Oldcastle, was established in the year 1829.  It was founded by Laurence Gilson and was an endowed school.  Laurence Gilson was a native of Oldcastle.  He was a ne'er-do-well and emigrated.  Some years later he returned dressed as a tramp.  The Gilson family would not admit him to their home.  He returned in a coach of four, wearing a bowler hat, and he was welcomed by everybody.  When he died he left his money for educational purposes to the people of Oldcastle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular school was a primary school and a secondary school.  As well as the usual educational facilities it provides horticulture, woodwork and cookery.  In fact the founder of the school at that time had the full concept of vocational education in mind.  When the need to provide a new post-primary school in Oldcastle arose numerous meetings were held between the members of the Meath Vocational Committee and the school management board.  The school management board in Oldcastle was established at the foundation of this school.  It had an equal representation of both the Catholic and Protestant community.  Back in 1829 we had a school in Oldcastle which provided the primary education curriculum plus woodwork, horticulture and cookery. Subsequent to the meetings between the Meath Vocational Education Committee and the Gilson board an amalgamation <Col N="827" /> took place in 1969.  A special board was then set up comprising of members of the Gilson endowed school and the Meath Vocational Education Committee.  At that time an undertaking was given that facilities equal to those in comprehensive school would be provided.</P>
    <P>At that time all comprehensive schools had a full size gymnasium and canteen. An extension was provided between 1970 and 1972 to provide general classrooms and prefabs for a number of years.  The Meath Vocational Education Committee and the Department of Education decided to carry out the building programme to the school in three phases. Phase 3 was the proposed gymnasium, which is the matter for discussion tonight, which has not yet commenced.  Agreement was reached with officials of the Department to draw up plans for the gymnasium in 1973.  The plans were shelved by the Coalition Government in 1974.  A further survey was carried out to assess accommodation requirements in 1980.  Approval for the extension to cater for 450 pupils was given on the 21 May 1980.  Plans were prepared by the architects and approved.  More detailed plans were prepared which were not approved because the Department statistician, Mr. Paul Doyle, detected a drop in school enrolment at that time.  He awaited the statistics from the primary schools in the catchment area.  After a 15 months lapse these statistics seemed to show that the attendance at the school would settle at approximately 375 pupils.  In 1983 approval was granted to draw up plans and include a PE facility.  These plans are still progressing at a very slow pace.  The last set of drawings were submitted to the Department in May 1984 and approved in April 1985.  The next set of drawings is now almost completed by the architect.</P>
    <P>As a matter of interest, the enrolments in St. Oliver's Post-Primary School, Oldcastle, are as follows: 1980-81, 404 pupils; 1981-82, 442 pupils; 1982-83, 444 pupils; 1983-84, 459 pupils; 1984-85, 452 pupils. The enrolment for this year is 440 pupils. It is my understanding that when the special board was set up it was to be <Col N="828" /> autonomous.  I was a member of Meath Vocational Education Committee and a member of the board from 1974 to 1979 and from my experience it is completely restricted in its operation in so far as it has to seek approval from both Meath VEC and the Department of Education for sanction of any decisions taken.  I understand that the school management board wrote to the Minister, Deputy Hussey, last April requesting a change in the composition of the board.  To date no satisfactory reply has been given with regard to that request.</P>
    <P>The original meeting held in 1969 between Meath VEC and the governors of the Gilson School was chaired by Mr. Seán Ó Mathúna of the Department of Education and a definite undertaking was given to provide facilities equal to those in comprehensive schools.  My main bone of contention is that both the Department and the various Ministers for Education, of all Governments, have reneged on that commitment.  I call on the Minister to honour the commitment given and expedite the plans for the completion of the extension to St. Oliver's Post-Primary School as guaranteed at the initial amalgamation meeting.  Both myself and my family got our education at that school as did almost every family in that catchment. We have a fine school in Oldcastle with a very proud record but the facilities we had expected from the beginning have not been provided.  The old board amalgamated with the VEC and at the time that was a major breakthrough in the education system.</P>
    <P>We have many problems all over the country trying to establish community and other new schools.  In some towns in the country, there are schools run by the Christian Brothers, vocational schools, convent schools, and yet in other towns there is not a decent school.  I am thinking particularly of Kells or Ceanannus Mór. We were hopeful we would get a new school with the amalgamation of all three bodies there but there has been a lot of hassle.  If you want a perfect answer go back through the books and see what happened in Oldcastle.  We are very proud of our school there except that <Col N="829" /> we have not got the facilities that were guaranteed at that time.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this matter and provide that extra facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I apologise to the Seanad for the delay in coming here.  There was a breakdown in communications somewhere because I was informed by my office that I should be here at 8.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>The commitment to which the Senator refers is presumably an understanding by the school authorities at the time of the amalgamation of Gilson school, Oldcastle, with County Meath Vocational Education Committee, that the school would be provided with full facilities on a par with comprehensive schools being provided at the time and that these would include a physical education hall in due course.</P>
      <P>It was the intention of the Department at the time that a physical education hall should be provided by the earliest possible date.  However, as a result of the huge increase in demands for additional classroom accommodation in the seventies to cater for increased enrolments it was found necessary to suspend the Department's programme for the provision of physical education facilities for the time and subsequently to limit the number of projects for such facilities which could proceed to tender each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to St. Oliver's at the moment is that a major extension to the school is being planned.  The project is at present at an advanced stage of architectural planning and when completed the school will have all the facilities being provided for the school of its size, that is, contrary to the numbers given, 375 pupils.  The new accommodation being provided comprises two general classrooms, one mechanical drawing room, one language room, a guidance office, a remedial group room, toilets, cloakrooms and social area.  In addition to this the extension will include a physical education hall together with changing rooms, showers, cloakrooms, toilets and so on.  Planning of the project is at present <Col N="830" /> at stage 4, that is the working drawings. These were submitted to the Department earlier this month and are being examined by the Department's technical advisers.  Senator Lynch mentioned that the architect was dealing with them.  We are at the fourth stage in the Department and are examining those at present.  In this connection, there are approximately 200 projects at various stages of planning.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, while every effort is made in my Department to process the various stages of planning as quickly as possible, there is some delay in each project. It is hoped that this examination will be completed shortly and the Department will then be in touch with the County Meath VEC regarding progress to the remaining stages to be completed, preparation of bills of quantities and tender documents.</P>
    <P>The working drawings are completed by the architects.  We are examining them in the Department to see that they are in accordance with the rules and regulations laid down.  Once they are completed and once we have found that they are satisfactory, then we get to the bill of quantities. Once the bill of quantities is prepared and submitted and found in order the county VEC are advised to proceed to tender stage.  When preparation of these documents has been completed by the vocational educational committee's consultants they will be forwarded to the Department for examination.  On completion of this examination the question of allowing the project to proceed to tender will arise.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that in considering this question the availability of capital and the Department's other commitments and priorities will have to be taken into account.  In the circumstances I cannot say whether it will be possible to let it go to tender at that stage.  The Deputy can be assured, however, that I am at all times looking at this project very sympathetically because we are aware of the problem there.  We are aware that there is an urgent need for this new school.  I sincerely hope that there will not be any delay in sending this to tender. Once it has gone to tender then it is a <Col N="831" /> matter for the builders and the county VEC.</P>
    <P>I understand that the school has made representations that the physical education hall be provided in advance of the proposed extension and that it has been explained to them that the hall has been planned as part of the extension and that if it were taken out now and planned as a separate building it would mean doing away with all the works and plans to date which would involve considerable payments to the design team for work done already.  In my experience any alteration of the plans at this stage would do nothing but delay the completion of the school.  If you call for a change of plan it <Col N="832" /> has to go back to the drawing board.  I would advise everyone concerned, while giving an undertaking that there will not be any undue delay, that any change at this stage would result in serious delays in finalising this application.  I assure the Senator that at no stage during the planning of this project has there been any avoidable delay on the Department's part.  As far as the Department are concerned the remaining stages will be expedited as far as possible.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 31 October 1985.</P>
