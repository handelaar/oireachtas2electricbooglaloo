      <P>I have notice from Senator Jimmy Deenihan, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The immediate need for the Minister for Education to sanction the extension to Listowel Vocational School in view of the poor condition of existing accommodation and facilities which is impeding the educational progress of students in attendance there.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senators O'Leary and Howard of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The position which has arisen in connection with the execution of work on the Seanad ceiling by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael D. Higgins of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the public disquiet following media reports of the guidelines circulated to members of the Catholic Managers Association, the need for the Minister for Education to confirm that these guidelines which restrict appointments to practising Roman Catholics are not the ones which will <Col N="576" /> prevail in the making of appointments as national teachers and that professional qualifications and competence as a potential teacher will be the criteria that the Department of Education will require.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Patrick Durcan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health to ensure that the guidelines issued by his Department for determining eligibility for the general medical card service provide, in the case of farmers who are in receipt of unemployment assistance, that the income determined on factual assessment for that payment, be accepted as the income guideline for eligibility for the general medical card service also.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael Smith of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Labour to give immediate sanction to the request by the Young Nenagh Committee for a further 12 months extension to the Community Training Workshop.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Deenihan, O'Leary, Howard and Michael D. Higgins as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I regret that I have to rule that the matters raised by both Senators Durcan and Smith are not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.  I have selected Senator Deenihan's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at 8 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators O'Leary, Howard and Michael D. Higgins may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, with all due respect and deference to the Chair, I find it difficult to understand how the Chair can decide that the matter I put down for raising on the Adjournment is one for which there is not ministerial responsibility.  I put it down on the basis of a document published by the Department of Health, being a summary of health services, 1985, for which the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare has responsibility.  I would submit, with all due respect, that there is ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Acting Leader of the House when it is proposed to take Item No. 15.  I asked this question four weeks ago of Senator Dooge.  It is about the Bill for the abolition of hanging in this country.  Senator Dooge assured the House that he was in communication with the Department of Justice about it and he has not come back to us.  Yesterday two people were sentenced to death by hanging in this country.  I want to know whether the Government intend this charade of people being sentenced to death and the sentences being commuted, to go on, whether it is intended to keep this on <Col N="579" /> the Statute Book and not enforce it or whether it is intended to accept my Bill for the abolition of hanging and to give time for it.  It is a farcical situation that we have this Bill here, that we do not know what Government policy is on it and that the courts are continually sentencing people to death for capital murder and the Government are commuting sentences. I want to see a decision from the Government on this, one way or the other.  I have asked about it several times and I have got no answer.  We have had a debate for three&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill, 1985: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to increase the borrowing limit to which the Housing Finance Agency is subject under section 10 of the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981, which established the Agency.  It is proposed to increase the amount which the Agency may borrow from £200 million to £500 million.  At the same time the opportunity is being taken to propose a few other minor technical amendments to the present legislation.</P>
      <P>The funds raised and distributed by the Housing Finance Agency since its establishment have made a very significant contribution to the housing programme and have greatly benefited the housebuilding sector of the construction industry.  The loan scheme operated by the Agency provides a source of loan finance for those on modest incomes and, thanks to the income related and low deposit features of the scheme, thousands of people, who otherwise could not aspire to home ownership, now own their own houses.  The increase in the borrowing limit of the agency, as proposed under this Bill, is necessary to enable it to continue this good work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of the agency in 1981 represented a breaking of new ground in the raising and provision of funds for house purchase.  As Senators will be aware, the agency raises funds on an index-linked basis from institutions such as life offices and pension funds.  It makes the money available for the purchase of houses by way of loans which are repayable on an income-related basis.  The popularity of this kind of mortgage scheme with potential house purchasers is evident from the fact that lending by <Col N="581" /> the agency has increased from £55 million in 1983, its first full year of operation, to £72 million last year and an estimated £90 million in the current year.  This last figure includes a further £4.5 million increase which, I am pleased to announce to the House, I am authorising in the agency's allocation for 1985.  It brings to £25 million the addition which has been made in the course of the year to the amount initially provided in the 1985 public capital programme.  The increased capital allocation to the agency means that it is in a position to meet, as they arise, the demands for loan payments.</P>
    <P>The level of the capital allocation for the agency together with that made to the local authorities for their own house purchase scheme is clear evidence of my own commitment and that of the Government to maintaining a sufficient level of mortgage finance from public sources to enable those on relatively lower incomes to reach the desirable goal of owing their own homes.  The schemes are, of course, very significantly complemented by the other incentives available from my Department, such as the £5,000 grant for those surrendering local authority houses, the £2,000 new house grant and the £3,000 mortgage subsidy.  I am especially pleased that a large number of persons availing of these loan schemes and the other grants and subsidies are either vacating local authority accommodation &mdash; and in the process freeing these dwellings for letting to persons on the local authority waiting lists &mdash; or would, in the absence of the schemes, fall to be housed by local authorities.</P>
    <P>The ability of the agency to meet demands made on it for mortgage finance depends essentially on its ability to raise funds at competitive rates by the sale of index-linked stock.  While the financial market has not recently been generally favourable to the sale of such stock, the agency has still succeeded in raising substantial funds each year.  An unsatisfactory feature of the various stock issues has been the increasing yield the agency has had to pay to investors.  I am pleased that the yield of 4 per cent for the latest placement marked the first occasion the <Col N="582" /> cost of funds to the agency has declined. I am hopeful that this will be a continuing feature of future issues.</P>
    <P>Sufficient funds have not, however, been available from stock issues to pay current demands due to conditions in the financial market.  The agency has, therefore, had to resort to short term borrowing from the banking system.  Regrettably these short term borrowings have proved more expensive than stock issues and they have had an adverse effect on the agency's ability to avoid losses on its activities.  Notwithstanding the increasing yield that has had to be paid on stock issues, the overall interest rate charged to those borrowing from the agency continues at a very reasonable level &mdash; the rate most recently applied was 10.2 per cent.  This has been one of the tangible benefits of the Government's success in reducing inflation to low single figures.</P>
    <P>The scale of the agency's activities means that the borrowing limit of £200 million, as fixed under section 10 of the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981, now needs to be increased.  Section 2 of this Bill proposes that this limit should be increased to £500 million.  The actual amount of borrowing permitted each year for the agency will, as previously, be fixed in accordance with normal procedures under the annual public capital programme and any subsequent adjustments to it.  In my view the new limit of £500 million proposed strikes the right balance between the necessity to give reasonable scope to the agency and the need to ensure that the Oireachtas will again have an opportunity of reviewing the activities and operation of the agency in about three years time.</P>
    <P>The original intention was to deal with the limited measure now proposed in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, debate which commenced in the Dáil yesterday.  This was on the strength of an interpretation that the limit of £200 million under existing legislation applied to the amount of funds actually accruing to the agency on foot of stock issues. Section 2 of the Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Act, 1982, referred to, and I quote, the &ldquo;money actually borrowed <Col N="583" /> by the Agency&rdquo;.  But recent legal advice is to the effect that the limit properly relates to the nominal amount of stock issued, disregarding any discounts at which the stock might have been issued. In the circumstances, it became necessary to bring forward the present Bill since the more detailed Housing Bill will take some time to be enacted.</P>
    <P>In addition to raising the borrowing limit, section 2 of the Bill permits the agency to raise funds by means of promissory notes or bills of exchange and changes the basis for calculating the amount of foreign borrowings for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the overall borrowing limit &mdash; these are by way of amendments of section 10 of the 1981 Act.  The agency will, by virtue of section 2 (a) of the Bill, have the option, in the future, of utilising promissory notes or bills of exchange in the course of its funding activities should they deem these means appropriate.  In calculating the amount of foreign borrowings, the appropriate exchange rate will in future be that which prevailed at the time of borrowing rather than, as at present, the exchange rate prevailing at the particular time the calculation is made.  The new rule will ensure that the borrowing limit is not exceeded simply because of an appreciation in the value of a foreign currency in which money was borrowed.  I should mention, for the information of Senators, that the agency has not to date raised any funds through the medium of foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill is entirely consequential on section 2.  It extends the powers of the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowings by the agency of funds raised by way of promissory notes and bills of exchange.</P>
    <P>To conclude, the amendments proposed in the Bill are of a limited nature, providing for an increase in the statutory borrowing limit of the agency and, as I have outlined, for a few amendments of a technical nature.  Enactment of the Bill will enable the Housing Finance Agency to continue its valuable contribution to the financing of our housing programme <Col N="584" /> and to making home ownership available to persons of modest means.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time this Bill was introduced I did not feel that it was very attractive.  When this enabling Bill to increase the ceiling from £200 million to £500 million came before us I immediately set about trying to find out where exactly this money was being spent. When I spoke here on the early stages I found that the scheme was not attractive. It is still not attractive in my part of the country.  To quote some figures to show how it has fared in my own county to date, I find that up to 31 October 1985 we had only 47 loans issued, a total of £723,000.  When I read this Bill and found that another £300 million was required I could not imagine where this money was being spent.  I would like the Minister to tell me if this is a city-orientated Bill for the eastern part of the country or for Cork city or is it in the greater built-up areas that it is attractive?</P>
      <P>I have quoted the number of applicants that have been issued with grants in the county that I come from.  We had a housing meeting quite recently and we discussed the Housing Finance Agency Bill and that is what we found.  There are certain anomalies that are not attractive. The one that comes to mind first of all is that if you were the holder of a loan and for some reason or other you had to change your job from one county to another you might well end up with a house valued at maybe £30,000 or £40,000 carrying a debt of almost £70,000 to £80,000 at the time of your changing or selling that house.  Of course it would put you in the position where you would be unable to sell that house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest problem or the fear in most people's minds is that the scheme is linked to inflation.  The income of 18 per cent has now risen to 20 per cent.  That also gives a change in your percentage income.  The SDA loans have been going like a bomb in most of the western counties and will continue to do so, I am sure. Had the ceiling of £8,000 of an income limit been increased the SDA loan would <Col N="585" /> far exceed the Housing Finance Agency loan in its attractiveness.  From our experience, we spent £5,423,000 in 1984 on SDA loans whereas we spent only £723,000 on the Housing Finance Agency loans.  Many resolutions have been forwarded to the Minister's Department to increase that ceiling by at least £2,000 to £4,000 to give people with SDA loans an opportunity of building their own houses and building the houses of their choice in their own area.</P>
    <P>What I see wrong with this is that it is based on inflation.  If you borrow a huge amount of money &mdash; £22,500, or if you are on a housing list £27,000 &mdash; a 2 per cent or indeed a 1 per cent rise in inflation can have a considerable effect on your position as applicant for a Housing Finance Agency loan, That is the fear I find in most people's minds and that I believe is why the scheme was not attractive in the west.  I would like the Minister to tell me specifically where the bulk of applications came from because that I think our experience is general as regards the western region.  Maybe we are more cautious in the west about borrowing than in the east.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me that the scheme has not got the attractiveness that one would like it to have.  I am not opposing the Bill today.  If there are people who still wish to avail of this type of loan and feel they are in a position to pay it back, then that is fine.  If we were taking some of our people who are in desperate need of housing and giving them proper houses, I would welcome it.  But, if you look at the statistics again <i>vis-a-vis</i> second-hand houses and new houses, you will see that while the scheme was normally for first-time purchasers or first-time builders, now the majority of loans are for people who are in a house at the moment and are changing from one house to another.  They are buying second-hand houses &mdash; perhaps better houses than those they now live in &mdash; and they are availing of the loans to better their own housing.</P>
    <P>The statistics show that more secondhand houses are being availed of with this <Col N="586" /> type of loan than new constructions.  The scheme does not relieve the plight of the construction industry at the moment.  If the figures are right, buyers of secondhand houses seem to be availing of the grants.  The pool of houses which were not bought, which were in the bank awaiting purchase and are now being purchased under this agency, may relieve the construction industry in some way because most building contractors have a number of houses still vacant in Dublin and awaiting a tenant or purchaser.  If the scheme was doing that I would say it would be an attractive one to avail of; but, if it is not doing that, I feel it is not solving the housing problem and is not doing anything for the construction industry.  Probably fewer than half the number of houses in the pool or the housing bank in the cities and elsewhere throughout the country &mdash; but more so in the cities &mdash; would be affected.</P>
    <P>The SDA loan is a most attractive loan in my area.  I would suggest to the Minister that if the ceiling were raised many people would feel that with the £16,000 SDA loan plus the £5,000 grant, they would be able with their own savings to build their own type of house and be in a position to repay the cost at a fixed rate. I welcome the reduction in that fixed rate, from 12½ per cent down to 11 per cent. That is something to be welcomed. Rather than an increase with the inflation rate, as with the Housing Finance Agency, with the SDA loan you have a reduction in interest rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is relevant, but I accept your ruling.  We are discussing this new loan launched by the Housing Finance Agency and we are equating it with the existing type of loan.  I am <Col N="587" /> bringing out some facts that may prove to the Minister that in my area &mdash; I have given him figures &mdash; the SDA loan is more attractive than the Housing Finance Agency loan.  I do not see it giving any great relief to the construction industry because when houses are purchased with these loans and other houses are vacated and not reoccupied, they will go into a derelict condition and our housing stock will deteriorate.  This does not take people off the local authority housing list. There is no income limit in the case of people applying for this loan and they are not limited to 1,346 sq. ft. either.  For that reason the upper income group will be availing of this loan rather than the people who would be on our housing lists in local authorities.  That is another reason why I feel it is not attractive in my area.  I would welcome the figures from the Minister and any other information he can give me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, we know what the Bill is doing.  It is increasing the borrowing limit of the agency from £200 million to £500 million.  This is something we have been concerned about because the agency has had problems in trying to meet all the demands that have been made on it.  This is contrary to what Senator O'Toole was saying, that nobody is looking for the loan or nobody is benefiting from it.  I am surprised that County Mayo seems to be the exception.  There may be a reason for that.  Almost 2,000 people in local authority houses have already qualified for Housing Finance Agency loans.  I want to compliment the Minister on increasing this borrowing limit which is very important to the agency to ensure that it continues but also to say that with the whole package that is now available for people to build or buy their houses a lot of activity has been generated both in the area of building new houses and improving existing houses.  Anything that is helpful to the building industry must be welcomed.  This particular agency was to facilitate particular classes of people that were not facilitated under previous loan schemes.</P>

      <P>The special category loan which is specifically for tenants of local authority houses has no income limit and increases the borrowing amount to £20,000.  They are two very important categories of loans and ones which we should promote because at least somebody with a secure job, living in a county council house, can borrow with a certain amount of confidence at a fixed rate of interest.  This would be their first preference if they have a job that is reasonably secure.  The Minister recently ensured that all manual workers in county councils will have security of employment.  For the first time in the history of the State we are treating ordinary county council workers in the same way as the county manager and I must compliment the Minister on that.  People in that category would naturally prefer to be able to borrow on a fixed rate of interest, particularly now as the Minister has reduced the rate to correspond with the reduction of interest rates in normal banking terms and has matched the drop in the inflation level on which this Government should also be complimented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look specifically at the Housing Finance Agency and the terms applying originally &mdash; and the rate of repayment at that time was 18 per cent of your income and it is now 20 per cent &mdash; many people had reservations because they did not understand the full implications of how their loan was going to be repaid. The advantage of it is that the level of income is increased to £10,000, and the amount of money that it is possible to borrow is also increased from the £16,000 of the SDA or the £20,000 in the special category up to a maximum of £27,500. There are some areas in which that kind of money is required to buy or build a <Col N="589" /> house depending on where you live in the country.  Obviously in County Mayo house prices are cheaper than in Foxrock. If we have people who want to better their housing, in whatever part of the country they live, we must ensure that all sorts of facilities are available to them through Government agencies, and for that reason I welcome this measure.</P>
    <P>In addition to the amount being increased there is a clause that allows particular age groups of borrowers to multiply their total annual income to determine the amount of a loan they can have.  Inbuilt into the repayments is insurance cover that in the event of one or other of the spouses dying during the period of the borrowing the balance of the actual amount borrowed is written off by insurance cover.  This is a major contribution to the easing of people's minds when they are borrowing.  Naturally we are all worried about too many people borrowing more than they can afford in the interest of trying to better themselves.  We have in recent times difficulties with people who borrowed relatively small amounts on SDA loans being unable to meet their repayments in spite of the lower rate of interest.  That is something none of us would welcome. The county councils and the lending agencies try to deal with these cases as fairly as possible.  Eventually after a number of years if no effort is being made they are forced into a situation where they have to go through a process of taking back the house from the person to whom they loaned the money.  It has not happened very often.</P>
    <P>People tend in this day and age to borrow a little more than they can afford. The HFA is important in that the rate of payment is determined by one's ability to pay.  It is something like the differential rent system &mdash; if you have a good income, you pay a fair amount of money on the loan.  If one is unfortunate enough to lose one's job account can be taken of one's changed circumstances.  That is something to commend it.  It has served a very useful purpose in the country as one of the options available to people.</P>
    <P>I have a primary concern for people in <Col N="590" /> local authority houses because for many of those the first chance they ever had of a decent house was when the county council bought the site, built the house and gave it to them on a differential rent and that was our only commitment.  I remember a previous Taoiseach saying that we should not build too many local authority houses because it is bad to do that.  The Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, has the excellent record of building more houses than any other Minister in the past.  He built 7,004 local authority houses last year.  He has since implemented these grants which he has referred to in his speech, the £5,000 grant for surrendering your council house, the £2,000 new house grant if you build a new house and the £3,000 mortgage subsidy to help with your loan repayments.  You literally have a present from the Government of £8,000, £9,000 or £10,000 for people who want to make the effort to improve their situation.</P>
    <P>From any point of view, ideological or otherwise, it is a good thing if one can move people down that road with assistance which will have a spin-off benefit for the building industry.  All the new grants are of benefit to the building industry and will help to close off the black economy about which we have all been worried. Some unemployed people can do jobs and little additions themselves and cannot afford to employ a contractor to do the work.  Anything we can do to ensure that builders are in the registered net so that the Government can get whatever contributions they should be making, should be done.  The Government then can do more in return through incentives.  I welcome the Minister's recent incentives by way of grants and in this Bill he is ensuring that the agency will have sufficient money at their disposal.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority I know that the manager announced recently that the agency had problems in meeting the demands.  The Minister has shown that the amount of money loaned by the agency has increased dramatically over the last number of years and have created such a demand that we, as legislators, should ensure that they have the <Col N="591" /> power to borrow more and to be indemnified by the Minister for Finance in their borrowings and, in particular, in their foreign borrowings.  Up to now the agency has not had to borrow outside of the country to meet demands.  It is good when we improve the ability of an agency to help people and it is good when a Minister recognises the various needs by way of grant incentives, mortgage rebates and mortgage assistance.</P>
    <P>For the first time over the last ten or 15 years people can help themselves with a bit of Government assistance and the end result is the amount of decent houses being built by people, the level and quality of the houses the Minister is building with chimneys, cookers in most of them, central heating in some of them and a standard of public authority housing that has never been achieved in this country before.  There is a great demand for local authority houses.  In the city there is a tremendous demand for additional housing. People are attracted to centres of activity such as Dublin or Cork.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole seemed to suggest that when people leave the house they are in to go to another house the original house falls down.  I am not aware of that happening because if a person leaves a private house he will sell it and if he leaves a local authority house it must be in good condition before he will qualify for the £5,000 grant.  Otherwise the inner city of Dublin would die.  Many changes were made, and they were started by Jimmy Tully, to ensure that the centre of the city did not die and there are major in-fill projects all over the city which have taken place through Government assistance to ensure that the city does not die and is somewhere where people can be proud to live and be part of the old Dublin.</P>
    <P>Much emphasis has been placed on that policy.  I do not know of anybody who moves out of a house and lets it fall down.  If it is a private house the owner will do something about it or if it is public the public authority will do something about it or if it is that bad they will demolish it and rebuild other houses on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> When we come to discuss the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Building Land we will be able to deal with that question.  It will have to be addressed by local authorities who have access to derelict land to ensure it is not allowed to remain, which for some time had been the policy of speculators who acquired land waited for the appropriate time to develop it.  We are making progress in that area and we are making progress in the area of CPOs which will be speeded up and give more power to local authorities to buy up the land that can be used for the benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>This Bill is to be welcomed.  It is a very short Bill.  I hope the Opposition will agree to deal with all stages of it today because the sooner we put this on the Statute Book the better.  The sooner the agency can have the legislative power to borrow the sooner they will be able to meet the demands.  It behoves all of us to speed up that process.  We could go into the various details of whether a person will owe more in ten years time than they borrowed.  People have these fears with regard to a HFA loan.  People fear that if in ten years' time their wages have doubled they will be paying twice as much for the house and that their children will finish up paying off the debt.  Perhaps the Minister would try to alleviate those concerns.  Many people on lower incomes opt for the HFA loan because the repayments are reasonable and people on high incomes who have been excluded from other loans opt for the HFA loan.  It is part of a package of trying to assist people to better themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. As the Minister has said, the measure is limited and does not give us the scope we would wish to have in dealing with housing problems but it gives us an opportunity to refer to some of these.  I should like to be associated with Senator Ferris in the compliments he has paid to the Department of the Environment. Over a long period I have had dealings with them and I have experienced nothing but courtesy and help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> There are and have been great pressures on funds for building.  One of the reasons for this pressure is the success of the £5,000 grant scheme to local authority tenants who provide houses of their own. We should compliment the Department on this.  I refer to one unwelcome aspect of this scheme which is well known.  In the country where this scheme is a success the better-off tenants are those who are moving.  When I say the better-off I mean those who have their families reared and have more finance than parents with young children.  They are leaving and the example and headline they set is missing. In all schemes it is necessary to have this example to which others can aspire.  What might be regarded as the better class tenants are leaving.  This should be looked at.  I do not say that in a critical manner in complimenting the Minister on the success of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred to the popularity of this kind of mortgage scheme with potential house purchasers and he said this was evident from the fact that the lending agency has increased from £55 million in 1983 to £72 million last year and £90 million this year.  In that sense it is popular.  It had advantages and disadvantages.  There is a saying in our part of the country: &ldquo;When all fruit fails welcome haws&rdquo;.  I believe there are many people who have to avail of this scheme to build their houses.  They do not qualify under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts loans scheme.  I also believe, like Senator O'Toole, that the conditions could be changed with regard to these loans.  These loans cost the country nothing.  I do not see why they should be confined to people with an arbitrary income of £8,000 and why the £16,000 could not be increased.  If that were done many people who are now availing of these loans would not use them.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the agency is to raise extra funds for house purchase loans on a self-financing basis.  The benefits of this loan are set out by the agency.  Some of the advantages are that it can cut down the size of the deposit.  The average new modest type house costs about £26,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> A person with an annual income of £8,000 can get an ordinary loan of £16,000 from the local authority under the existing SDA scheme and a grant of £2,000.  This means that he must find a deposit of £8,000.  Under the agency scheme he can get a loan of £22,500 and a grant of £2,000.  This cuts his deposit to £1,500. Secondly, the agency scheme can reduce the amount of loan repayments in the early years which is a very important consideration.  For example, a person with an annual income of £8,000 can normally borrow up to £20,000 from a building society to build a house.  His repayments in the first year will amount to approximately 43 per cent of his income and this proportion will normally decline in later years.</P>
    <P>Under the agency system a person borrowing two and a half times his income in the previous year will repay each year on the basis of 20 per cent of the gross income of the borrower or his spouse, whichever income is the greater, in the previous tax year.  Other advantages are that the scheme is available to single people, people who may not have arrangements made to marry.  Senator Ferris mentioned the mortgage protection policy for each loan which covers the borrower in the event of death or permanent disability.  This is a marked benefit, a sum of 0.2 per cent is added to the interest rate to cover the cost. Borrowers are entitled to income tax relief in respect of interest paid in an income tax year subject to the conditions that apply to all house purchase loans. These are very important benefits.</P>
    <P>There is also very serious disadvantages. The most serious disadvantage is that the capital increases over a long period of years.  With the SDA loan there is a reduction on the capital.  Even though in the early years it is very small, nevertheless there is a reduction in the capital and it is for a fixed period.  This is open-ended. The agency gives an example in its leaflet of the situation where a person would borrow.  The example it takes is of a loan of £22,500 where the borrower's income for the previous tax year was £7,500 and the interest rate is 5 per cent <Col N="595" /> above inflation.  The person starts off with a loan of £22,500.  After five years the capital outstanding is £30,261.60.  After ten years the capital outstanding is £39,308.50.  After 15 years the capital outstanding is £48,258.  After 20 years the capital outstanding is £53,405.50.  After 25 years the capital outstanding is £46,225 and after 30 years the capital outstanding is £8,510.04.  That peaks at 21 years to £53,000.  After borrowing £22,500 at 21 years the amount outstanding is £53,356.86.  The increase in the price of houses was perhaps intended to balance that increase but for the past two or three years we have had no increase in the prices of houses.  Prices have remained static.</P>
    <P>It seems that there must be something very wrong with the situation where £22,500 is borrowed and after 21 years the capital outstanding can be £53,356.86.  A person who wanted to change houses would probably find that by selling his house he would not be able to redeem the amount outstanding.  I know the agency recommend that repayments should be in excess of the 20 per cent minimum.  The tax relief was not included in that table and neither was the mortgage relief subsidy of £3,000 which at the early stages would make a considerable difference.  There must be something very wrong with that situation. I have been associated with quite a few people building houses.  They would be people who would be hoping to build a house, move to it and sell it after a time and move to a better house to improve their circumstances.</P>
    <P>That would be impossible to do with this type of loan.  This loan is geared to younger people.  Senator Ferris mentioned that there is provision for giving reduced loans to people up to the age of 55.  That is the limit.  It is intended for younger people and people who are going to move to a particular house and stay there.  That is a serious disadvantage and is an area the Minister should look at.  I realise that people who will avail of this loan are people who would not qualify <Col N="596" /> for the SDA loan, the building society loans or any of the other loans.  The farmers are catered for by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I am not sure about the self-employed.  Perhaps the Minister would refer to that.  As has already been said, the increase does not mean more houses.  There has been a drop in the number of SDA loans.  In 1980 the number of approved applicants was 10,381 while in 1984 it was 4,959.  There is an overall drop of 1,806 in loan approvals.  More second-hand houses than new houses have been approved for Housing Finance Agency loans.  This is something that should be reversed.  The position would be far better if it was the other way.</P>
    <P>New private houses completed in 1981 amounted to 23,236 while in 1984 there was a drop of 5,295 to 17,941.  Originally, the minimum repayment on the HFA loan was 18 per cent of the previous year's income.  I would like the Minister to comment on the reason for the change of 2 per cent.  The SDA and HFA loans do not cost the State any money.  I made attempts at different times to find out what the actual position is with regard to this, but they are self-financing.  I would like the Minister to comment briefly on that.  I fail to understand why the conditions cannot be improved.  If the loans do not cost the State anything and if, in effect, through them we are getting more houses built, why can these conditions not be improved and the ceilings lifted?</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem with regard to defaulters.  Many of the people who are unable to repay their loans are people whose circumstances have changed.  They may be people who have lost their employment and require help.  While provision is made for people whose spouse dies or who becomes incapacitated &mdash; a decision is made in those circumstances to set off the amount outstanding &mdash; something should be done for those people who through no fault of their own are unable to make repayments.  It was suggested in the other House that perhaps the local authorities could take over those houses and rent them out to the <Col N="597" /> owners.  In that way they would not lose face.  This is something that should be looked at seriously.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris referred to direct labour.  There is a radical change in this area so far as the Department of the Environment are concerned.  I only want to refer to this in passing, but it is a serious mistake.  Most of the people with whom I have been dealing in regard to new houses or the reconstruction of old houses are people who would carry out most of the work themselves.  They would do the masonry work and carpentry, as well as the painting.  They would be unable to have the work completed if they had to engage a contractor to do it. This is a complete change in the position of the Department of the Environment in regard to loans.  The Minister should look again at the area of direct labour. We all welcomed the reconstruction grants.  The fact that people must engage a registered contractor will mean that many people will be unable to have work completed.  Most people would carry out the work themselves.  This solution seems to be eliminated.  That is a mistake and should be looked at again.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the special category grant of £27,000.  It refers to a family of at least three people &mdash; for example, a married couple with one child &mdash; who had been for at least one year on an approved waiting list for rehousing.  Perhaps this could be changed to provide for a married couple.  I also referred to the case where somebody dies or becomes permanently disabled.  It is important that this contingency should be covered.  The house must be under the grant qualifying limit of 125 sq. metres or 1,346 sq.ft.  It must also be above the minimum qualifying limit of 35 sq. metres, and 30 metres in the case of flats.  This is an unnecessary restriction. People who are availing of this loan might want to build bigger houses.  I understand the reasoning behind the Department's regulation with regard to the size of house, but with regard to HFA loans this restriction should not apply.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that I welcome the Bill.  The HFA loans have many <Col N="598" /> benefits, but they have a serious disadvantage in that the capital increases for a considerable length of time.  Also, it is open-ended.  In certain circumstances the loan might not be repaid after 50 years. Having regard to the situation, which everybody says must change, that house prices have not increased over the last few years, some element should be introduced into the HFA loans scheme to ensure that the capital will not increase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  I have seen a revolution in house purchase and house ownership since 1981.  Earlier this year we made modifications to bring about a situation where more people would be allowed to own their own houses and would be paid £10,000 to move from their existing houses.  I am a little confused.  In 1981, when the Bill was introduced, there was a guarded welcome for it from the Opposition.  Up to the present, over 11,200 people have availed of HFA loans.  That is not to be passed over lightly.  We should not give the impression that it is not a good thing to purchase your own house.  I congratulate the Ministers who since 1981 have improved the allocations to the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
      <P>There are some aspects of the agency that might have to be questioned.  There are some other people who should be able to avail of HFA loans but, unfortunately, cannot do so.  A person who availed of a building society loan might be in the position through his own misfortune, of not being able to repay that loan.  He might not have the opportunity of availing of the HFA loan.  Other people might be in much better circumstances and could avail of the same loan and get the £5,000 grant, the £2,000 first time buyer grant and the £3,000 subsidy.  Are we making fish of one and flesh of another? In fact, that is the situation with people who are in arrears with building societies. I know of people whom I cannot assist further and who are in dire conditions because of building society loans.</P>
      <P>I have written to the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, several times on the matter, emphasising particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="599" /> Unfortunately, the agency is not in a position at this time to assist such a person.  That is sad even when they have gone so far to assist people in other areas. I was one of the chief motivators of that scheme.  I always felt, since I came into public life, that we should be doing much more to assist people to do something for themselves rather than doing it for them. That has been proven.  For instance, because of the HFA loans and other grants now available, we have a situation in Dublin for the first time ever, where there is accommodation available to people within a very short time of applying. In the Cork area we have gone from a situation where three and a half years ago one was waiting about three years to get accommodation to a situation where one can now be accommodated within a very short period of time.  But, unfortunately, people who are in trouble because of recessionary times cannot be assisted. I wonder if we could assist them.</P>
    <P>Some people ask about the amount of money that they owe after so many years. It should be emphasised that the agency say that one is not totally committed to paying only 20 per cent of gross earnings. There is mortgage relief on the interest. Let us look at inflation.  If inflation rises at an average of 4 or 5 per cent per year, we must compare that to the position in the early Seventies when inflation was running at 25 per cent to 27 per cent.  At that time did we ever envisage that a house costing £2,500 in the early seventies would be purchased after about ten years for about £20,000?  That is a tenfold increase.  A house for which a loan of £22,000 was given could be worth in the region of £70,000 allowing for inflation over 20 years.</P>
    <P>The last speaker made a point that after 30 years one still owes about £8,000. Could anybody tell me what, after 30 years, that £8,000 will be worth?  Very little, indeed.  The way inflation is going one would probably be able to pay it off with two-monthly payments from his wages.  That is the reality; these matters must be clarified.  Over the last four years the HFA scheme has been a success.  This <Col N="600" /> is evidenced by the number of people now taking HFA loans.  In Dublin alone we have nearly 1,500 houses coming on the market because of the Housing Finance Agency grants.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that everybody in the country gets the best accommodation possible.  We are inferring that, because a person wants to come out of a local authority house with a £5,000 grant and the agency loan, he is a better tenant than the other person who does not want to come out.  We have no right to say that a person who is able to improve his position is a better class person than the person who cannot afford it.  I will not condone that argument.  Some people are worse off than others.  We have no right to say that, because they are not as well off as the others, they are therefore less worthy people.  For public representatives to give that impression for any political gain is most unfair.  We should certainly not give that impression at any time about any class of person.</P>
    <P>I have heard from one party &mdash; and it is not the main Opposition party &mdash; that they are totally opposed to anybody getting £5,000 to move out of local authority house because they feel that they have no right to move out.  They feel that these people, who could afford something else, should stay there &mdash; that if they moved out those who remained would feel inferior because of their poorer financial position.  That is nonsense.  Many of the people going into those houses have £20,000 or £25,000 a year.  There is nothing at all wrong with that.  It is great to see two sons and a daughter &mdash; probably two carpenters and the daughter working in the bank &mdash; all of a sudden having a lot of money.  The so-called Workers Party are saying that there is no way such a family should move out of a local authority house to make room for a person who is in need of it.  They condone that.  How unrealistic can they be as a socialist group?  They say they represent the workers, which they do not, because if they had their way they would have them living in 300 square feet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know I have moved from it a little bit, but I felt I had to make that point.  It is most unfair to give that impression.  The agency is not doing that. The agency has created a situation where, for the first time ever in this country, we have people owning houses who never thought they would be buying their own accommodation.  This is borne out in Dublin city, where over four years ago there were massive problems with nothing available for the less well-off.  That is the main point that has to be made. There is an impression that a person cannot apply for a loan unless they are 12 months on the accommodation list. That is not the true situation.  Any person can apply for it.  But if one needs to get the £27,500 one needs to be on the housing accommodation list and to be an official listed member for 12 months, with three of a family or more.  In other words, one must have one child and then one would be allowed to get up to £27,500 plus the £5,000, plus the £2,000 and plus the subsidy.  That is a total of £37,500 with a purchase order of £34,500.  In other words, one can buy up to the amount of £34,000.</P>
      <P>Did people ever dream that they would see that situation?  Imagine the situation if one were to go to a building society to try to get the £30,000, if one had £3,500 of one's own.  There would be an enormous cost.  I have known of a case in my own area in which husband and wife were not even sleeping with each other because they could not have a family because of the mortgage repayments.  The repayments to the building societies were too high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all respects the building societies have done an excellent job through the years.  They have not perpetrated any massive robberies in the country from our people.  I would readily admit that. At the same time we must admit that for the first time ever we brought about this agency loan which got a guarded welcome from some parties and a very guarded welcome from the solicitors of the State who said it was not workable. We had a situation where the solicitors of the State had opportunities to avail of <Col N="602" /> building societies' privileges that they do not have with the Housing Finance Agency.  That is a point that is borne out. It has been pointed out over the last few years that even with some opposition and everybody talking against it, 11,200 have availed of it.  It is going to continue that way.  We have created that situation and rightly so.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to welcome this Bill.  As the Minister said in his speech, the Bill proposes to increase the amount which the agency may borrow from £200 million to £500 million and at the same time to propose a few other minor, technical amendments to the present legislation.  Senator Cregan referred to people who gave it a guarded welcome. I must confess to Senator Cregan and others that I was, at the start, a doubting Thomas.  I know of a few people who were suggesting to me that they would look for the HFA at that time.  I was inclined to push them towards the SDA. I am still not madly in love with the HFA because it has little difficulties, but I realise that it has given so much help to so many people that obviously they see it as very important.  It has helped them to buy a home of their own, which is something we all aspire to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My attitude to the HFA has been to ask can the applicant get a loan anywhere else &mdash; from a building society or the SDA &mdash; and, can they afford to pay that loan?  If the answer to those two questions is &ldquo;no,&rdquo; then obviously &mdash; and I would have no hesitation in saying to them that they should look at the HFA.  There should be no difficulty with HFA if a person has a worthwhile job, and is under the income limits of the terms of the scheme.  There is no reason, with a 20 per cent payment of his wages going to the HFA, that the full debt should not be cleared off in a period of 25 years in the same manner as the SDA and other loans.  There is a big danger that we would have to watch very closely and examine as fully as possible, that is the danger that if a person has no job he can and will become a tenant of the HFA.  That situation could happen in the future or at any <Col N="603" /> time.  It is one that we would not welcome and should not allow to happen, if at all possible.  I know of cases &mdash; but not too many &mdash; in which people have actually gone unemployed in order to avail of the cheaper repayments on the housing loan. Again, that is a situation that we should not encourage.</P>
    <P>I have always been a great fan of the SDA.  I must confess that.  At the moment I certainly think £16,000 is on the low side.  I am an even greater fan of the special category SDA which is for local authority tenants at £20,000.  The gap between the price of the house and say, the £16,000 of the present SDA, it too much.  Certainly, the problem there is that a young couple have to borrow elsewhere from a bank or from a credit union an extra £5,000, £6,000 or £7,000, which can be crippling.</P>
    <P>I know that a call has been made many times for an increase in the SDA.  I would agree with that, but I can see the Minister's thinking that perhaps it should not go up that way but that we should get our money from pension funds, as we are getting in the HFA, and that is preferable. Nonetheless, the SDA, in my opinion, despite the high repayments is still a very attractive scheme.  Again, with the £5,000 grant, which is there for the local authority tenants who vacate their houses, it is all the more attractive. Indeed, I am pleased with this £5,000 grant that has been mentioned.  It has, more than anything, helped to increase the demand for the HFA right across the country.</P>
    <P>While the HFA has been successful &mdash; in my own county there have been nearly 100 loans in the past year &mdash; the house building industry continues to plummet. I was reading in yesterday's <i>Irish Press</i> the statement by Mr. Tom Reynolds, managing director of the Construction Industry Federation, that in the first ten months of this year a 16 per cent decline was recorded in the Irish private house building sector.  Again, in the knowledge that the HFA is successful, I find that hard to believe; but obviously he knows. The general feeling from builders in my <Col N="604" /> own area is that house building, despite the HFA, is not on the increase at all. Certainly, Mr. Reynolds' figures could well be accurate.  Indeed, the whole construction activity in Ireland next year is forecast to fall by 7 per cent compared with an EC average of 1.1 per cent.  Obviously, those figures are very depressing indeed.</P>
    <P>An artificially high price has been created for second-hand houses.  This is primarily as a result of the HFA.  Under a building society or the SDA loan, the size of the loan reflects the level of repayments. In the case of the HFA, as we all know, repayments are based on income. The repayments will be the same for an applicant on a £20,000 loan as it will be for a £25,000 loan.  Applicants, in my opinion, are not particularly worried about the price of the house.  They are not concerned about the amount being borrowed and this helps to create an artifically high price for second-hand houses. Obviously, it must be a worrying feature that people should not care now much they pay for a house in the knowledge that it is still costing them 20 per cent of their salaries.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty there too.  This may be a little contradictory of what I said, but a question arises of who qualifies for the loan.  As I understand it reading from the leaflet, you must have a certificate of your own and, if married, your spouse's gross income for the previous tax year in the form of a P60 of taxable income; or, in the case of farmers and persons who are self-employed, a copy of the last agreed tax assessment together with the accounting date from the Inspector of Taxes in respect of the preceding tax year.</P>
    <P>That paragraph would indicate to me that it excludes people who might be, for whatever reason, on a permanent disability pension.  Take the case of a person in receipt of a permanent disability pension of, say, £120 a week, that is, about £6,000 per annum, normally that person should qualify, assuming that person is a tenant of a local authority, for a loan of <Col N="605" /> £18,000, which is three times his £6,000 per annum, less £5,000, which would give him a loan of £11,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Fallon, I do not like interrupting any of my colleagues, but this Bill is dealing with additional funding to the Housing Finance Agency.  You can, of course, make references to grants, etc., but not in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to avail of this opportunity to highlight the little difficulties.  I am totally in support of the Bill.  I want to make that clear.  If it can be improved, then why not improve it? The category of people I have mentioned are denied, it would appear, getting a loan because the application says it must be earned income even though that person, from the funds he has, would be able to pay a loan of the size I mentioned.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the Bill and to the HFA generally, I would like to refer to &mdash; and perhaps the Minister will comment on it &mdash; the variable interest rate. Initially, as we all know, it was inflation plus 3½ per cent.  Inflation at the time was at a high rate.  Now it is inflation plus 5 per cent.  I am wondering why it should increase.  It seems it increases because of the people who are providing the money, the financial backers, the pension funds, and so on.  The worry I would have is: will that 5 per cent become 6 per cent next year?  Will it become 7 per cent the year after?  Obviously, that would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill.  The CII report indicates that next year our Government should base their budgetary strategy on a 3 per cent inflation rate. Obviously, that is going to make the HFA that much more attractive, provided the variable interest rate does not go up again from 5 per cent to 6 per cent or 7 per cent or more.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also &mdash; and I do not wish to detain the House &mdash; the question of the redemption of a loan.  The Minister might also comment on that.  This always causes problems for many people.  It seems there is no difficulty in the ordinary straight <Col N="606" /> forward redemption of an SDA or building society loan.  In this case, bearing in mind the interest rate which at the moment is 10.2 per cent on repayments, the redemption rate, as I understand it, is now running at 14 per cent.  This seems very high.  It seems to me it is a figure that has been kept deliberately high, just in case inflation suddenly gets out of hand and begins to rise again.  I would imagine that is the thinking behind it.  If I am wrong, the Minister will tell us.</P>
    <P>What I understand happens is this.  The redemption figure is set at 14 per cent and perhaps eight months or a year or a year and a half later, if it is proved that the inflation rate is not what we thought it might be, then further money is given back to the person redeeming the loan.  I am wondering if that could be speeded up.  Could we be more specific and more definite and give the correct redemption at the time the loan is redeemed?  I support the view expressed that Irish people like to own their own house.  I was a doubting Thomas.  But I feel there is a lot of merit in the HFA loan.  It has without question given homes to people who would never have a home.  The very fact that you are looking for permission to increase the amount which the agency may borrow from £200 million to £500 million is in itself a success story.</P>
    <P>The principle behind the type of loan &mdash; the income-related mortgage &mdash; is basically sound.  It is sound as long as the prices of houses can continue to be reasonable and as long as people continue to have a job and inflation remains at a reasonably low figure.  If those three factors continue, I believe that the HFA will certainly continue to be in demand in a big way.  It will continue to give people who might never have owned a house in their lives or who might never have dreamt of owning a house in their lives, the opportunity to own their own homes.</P>

      <P>We will see as we proceed. On one of the comments that Senator Fallon made <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Construction Industry Federation and Mr. Reynolds, quite frankly the farmers have a reputation for the béal bocht and so on &mdash; not ever getting enough.  At times that complaint does not have a great deal of validity, but at other times it has.  There is one thing consistent about Mr. Reynolds: he is constantly preaching doom and gloom, yet any objective assessment would show that the best friend Mr. Reynolds has is the present Minister for the Environment.  Without the activity generated by the Minister's Department, the friends of Mr. Reynolds, his associates in the building profession and the business profession, whose money is invested in the Cayman Islands and elsewhere, would have nothing to do.  The reality, as far as the building industry is concerned, be it houses or roads, is that it is all generated by the State.  It is time Mr. Reynolds realised that.  Some of his colleagues say that the only way we can do anything about the construction industry is to bring the Opposition back into Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill extends home ownership.  In Ireland there is a very high ratio of home ownership.  Obviously, it is the preference of very many people.  I found it very interesting that during a general election in Britain three years ago, when Michael Foot was leader of the British Labour Party, one of their main policy planks was the non-sale of local authority housing. As part of their party programme they prohibited the sale of local authority houses.  I went on a canvass with one of their candidates and I found it was a most unpopular stance to have.  It was quite obvious from the response that people wished to own their own houses.  That policy in the British Labour Party was subsequently changed after their defeat. There is a desire by people to own their own houses not just for the sense of ownership but also because they have a capital asset which protects them in years to <Col N="608" /> come and they are not paying rent for which there is no return.</P>
    <P>Activity within the Department such as the reconstruction grants and the various building grants has transformed the situation in the last number of months.  The position today is that the Department cannot cope with the applications.  There are thousands of applications coming in from around the country.  It is very obvious that the amount of work and employment that will be generated from this scheme will be very very significant. Senator Fitzsimons in making his contribution mentioned the problem that one has to be a registered builder to avail of these grants.  It prevented, for instance, a handyman from doing his own extensions and repairs.</P>
    <P>The reality is that it is not the Government's job nor should it be their intention to expand the black economy.  The black economy at the moment is healthy enough without active assistance from the Government by way of taxpayers' money.  It is absolutely necessary that the people who apply for those grants deal with a legitimate builder who is within the tax system and who contributes tax in the normal way for these commercial people.  As I said at the outset, this Bill extends and helps to extend the principle of home ownership to people who aspire to have their own houses.  I agree completely with Senator Cregan who spoke about differentiating between those people who avail of the facility and people who wish to remain local authority tenants.  There should be no distinction. It is a matter of choice.  The State has one obligation, that is to house those who cannot afford to house themselves.  That is its major obligation.</P>
    <P>The other obligation which it now takes upon itself is to encourage people who are in a position because of improved financial circumstances or whatever to own their own house.  The State is right to encourage that sort of movement because it has two very important effects. It frees a local authority house for somebody on the list and it creates employment in the construction industry.  I welcome the Bill.  I simply wanted to put <Col N="609" /> on record my appreciation of the work done by Deputy Kavanagh not just on this issue but certainly on the housing grants issue which is a major one and recognised throughout the country as a most imaginative decision by the Government and by the Minister concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Since house improvements have been mentioned I what to take this opportunity of generally welcoming them, but to say that in trying the scheme to accredited builders the Minister might take into account individuals who are able to provide and carry out extensions to their homes.  There are categories of people who are in a position to do this work themselves and it is important that some consideration would be given to that aspect of the scheme because it may well mean that they might not be in a position to afford to call in an accredited builder.  Having said that, I was one of those who was absolutely sceptical about the Housing Finance Agency scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no problem in admitting that it has been a much greater success than I anticipated some years ago.  It goes without saying that groups of people who would have no opportunity of owning <Col N="610" /> their own houses have been facilitated by this scheme.  It opens up a new source of finance for housing at a time when the housing and construction industry is in difficulty.  We need however to further educate the people as to the long term implications of the Housing Finance Agency loan.  It is possible for persons to buy out their houses completely within 20 to 25 years given a set of particular circumstances.  Taking past history into account and different rates of inflation obtaining from time to time and external pressures over which one has no control, it is very important that people engaging in this loan, as far as the operation of it is concerned, would be fully abreast of its operation and aware of these difficulties and not find themselves, after paying the loan at whatever rate is applicable over 25 years, that they are not next or near to actually owning their houses.</P>
    <P>It was because of this factor in the beginning that I resisted to some degree the implementation of the Housing Finance Agency scheme because there is a great traditional historical attachment in this country to home ownership.  Long may that continue but we are remarkably out of step with what is happening in other parts of the world in our determination to own houses from the very beginning. There are instances now, because of job insecurity and other problems that have arisen in the economy, where it may not be wise to pursue that course for all categories of people with the same determination as has been the character of the scheme in the past.</P>
    <P>If we could be sure that we would have a continual low inflation there is no doubt that the provision of additional funds in this scheme would be very worthwhile.  I would echo also the point made by Senator Fallon and other speakers that while it cannot be limited to new housing construction schemes we should try to ensure that on balance it is aimed at construction of new houses rather than inflating as it sometimes can the value of secondhand houses.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two queries that I would like the Minister to reply to in relation to the situation where, because <Col N="611" /> of varying situations which I referred to a few minutes ago, the principal earner can actually change in a family from one person to another.  I understand that under the terms of this scheme where the principal earner is paying the loan and dies during that year, the normal house protection insurance policies will cover that loan and that is the end of it and everything is secured.  Where the principal earner changes during the lifetime of the loan &mdash; and it may be even intermittent change &mdash; because of employment problems which we are all too familiar with, is the scheme or the agency empowered to make changes in order to ensure that where the person who was the principal earner dies but who is not the main earner in that particular year, that family would be covered in the same way as they are covered with building society and SDA loans.  It is probably early in the stages of this scheme to be referring to matters like that but these legal problems, from time to time, can arise and we should take account of them.</P>
    <P>Overall, the House welcomes the Bill provided that we can have conditions of low inflation.  There is no doubt it can add to the stock of houses owned by categories of people who would not otherwise own them.  In spite of other pressures there is no doubt also it will help the housing construction industry. We have to be factual with people and they have to understand that there is no guarantee that after 20 or 25 years they will own their own houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly welcome the Bill.  It is increasing the amount of money available to operate the finance agency. There are a few comments I would like to make in this regard.  It would be a little unfair of me to suggest that the Opposition party were opposed to the agency simply because they were in opposition. The real, honest position is that many of us did not know how it would work and were not sure how it might apply and how people might get caught up.  The facts of life are that the scheme has caught on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> In 1982 in County Donegal there were 435 ordinary SDA loans, 25 Housing Finance Agency loans; in 1983 there were 395 ordinary SDA loans and 44 Housing Finance Agency loans; in 1984 there were 405 ordinary SDA loans and 81 Housing Finance Agency loans, and to date this year there have been 264 ordinary SDA loans and 75 Housing Finance Agency loans.  The number has trebled in three years.  There is still an element of doubt and I am not so sure that everybody understands that the loan scheme is available. I would declare immediately that I have an interest in this, not just as a public representative but as an auctioneer and as an agent for a building society. When I say the building society agency is not related to it, I want to declare my interest lest some public magazine or paper at some future time might declare my interest for me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not vested but it is factual and not very profitable.  The scheme is useful.  It has been undersold certainly by the local authority with which I am familiar, Donegal County Council.  They have undersold it likewise because they were afraid of it.  I am not so sure I totally understand the implications of it despite the fact that I have to try to explain it as often as a sale may arise as a result of the scheme.  For instance, in the documentation supplied by my council, where a person borrows £20,000, starting in the previous tax year with an income of £7,500, after a period of 13 or 14 years that person can owe as much as £34,000: that assumming an annual inflation based at 10 per cent.  If annual inflation is running lower &mdash; it is the aspiration of this and other Governments that inflation would run lower &mdash; salaries will not rise as quickly as they have been rising, therefore, repayments will not rise as quickly as this would suggest and ownership might not take place as early as this anticipates, which is 23 years.  That, in itself, is not necessarily a bad thing because we have a very high percentage of house ownership in this <Col N="613" /> country, higher than most European countries.  I am not so sure that it is a good idea that the burden of repaying on a house loan should be met by one generation, by one man and his wife &mdash; perhaps this is not so when the family come to an earning stage but by and large it is.  The idea of spreading the loan over that and the next generation is not such a bad idea.  Should the figure keep rising the amount owed on the house becomes higher than the house value because house values remain more static, or in the present recession might even drop as the years go on.  So the person borrowing the £20,000 owes £34,000 after 14 years and, assuming that the house value will have increased somewhat but may not have reached that level, he feels he is in trouble.  On the other hand, you can take the simple viewpoint that, I own this house, it does not matter how long it goes on until I complete the repayment of the house but the payments I am making are relevant to my income and, therefore, it is a good thing that I own the house rather than pay a rent on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider a couple of aspects of the scheme as it exists.  A person in a special category has been housed.  That person has had the benefit of rehousing by the local authority. Another person goes a step further and proceeds to start to buy out his house &mdash; it may have commenced before this scheme was introduced &mdash; and because he is buying out the house he is losing a substantial amount of capital.  He may have made more of an effort to improve the house while he is in it or since he started to buy it out.  Yet his ambition might have been &mdash; if he had known that a scheme like this would ever come on the horizon &mdash; that he would like to get out of that house, despite what Senator Cregan was saying.  I am not sure if he himself was complaining or his opposition in the Workers Party.  I think that almost all of them would have an ambition to get out of the scheme into their own house that they themselves provided or bought.  Therefore, that person who has made an effort to help himself is suffering <Col N="614" /> because of that effort.  I am not so sure that is good.</P>
    <P>The second aspect is related to the double situation of the finance agency and the £5,000 grant.  A person gets £5,000 by vacating his local authority house and handing it back to the local authority.  Then they may borrow up to £27,000 from the Housing Finance Agency.  But there is a limit of 90 per cent and on a £30,000 house they are asked to find £3,000 cash.  We are saying to a person, who you know is earning £9,000 or may be earning more than the £10,000 limit: that in their circumstances it would be difficult for them to get money from any other source, that we know that the ordinary house loan of £16,000 or £20,000 would not meet the cost of their house, that we would like to facilitate them.  Therefore we produce this scheme and expect them to find £3,000 cash. Many of those people cannot find £3,000. The fact that they qualify and are being facilitated for this scheme, suggests that the amount of money they can find each week to hand back in repayments is less than the average person can and yet they still have to find this larger sum of money. My figures may be wrong but on an ordinary SDA loan of £16,000, 95 per cent is applicable.  In the special category SDA loan of £20,000 98 per cent is applicable. Yet in the Housing Finance Agency it is 90 per cent in both instances.</P>
    <P>There is then the matter of legal costs. When you are in the auctioneering business you meet these cases.  I must say in all honesty that all auctioneers have not been forthright with clients in explaining to them the costs they were going to incur.  Many clients have found themselves in dire straits.  That is one example, the legal costs, bridging interest have not been explained fully in some instances with other lending agencies.  Where do the couple find the £3,000 or £4,000 which they require?  It is almost impossible. While I think the scheme is working and the figures from my own county of Donegal have moved from 25 people availing of the scheme up to 75 in four years, I am still a little sceptical about it.</P>
    <P>In 1982 in Donegal the SDA loans were <Col N="615" /> £3.7 million.  It moved up to £4.1 million and has levelled off at £3.8 million.  The Housing Finance Agency loans were nil in 1982 and went up from £.4 million to £1.2 million and to £1.75 million.  That is a large sum of money, a total of £5.55 million in loan aid going into Donegal. That must surely be welcomed, side by side with the recent announcement of the reconstruction grants which were mentioned by one or two speakers from both sides of the house and which, with your indulgence, a Chathaoirleach, I would like to mention in this regard.  The new grants are to be welcomed; they are a great boost, particularly in rural Ireland and in inner towns and cities.  We hear a lot about inner cities but not as much about inner towns, small towns like Ramelton, Milford, Letterkenny, Raphoe and Convoy where the inner part of those towns is dying in almost all of them because the local authority development or private development is taking place on the outskirts.  There is always a millionaires row in any town.  The hearts of those little towns are dying off.  I believe that this new grant of £5,000 for the pre-1940 house will revitalise the hearts of those towns, and that type of thinking is good.  That type of thinking, aligned with leaving alone the schools and the Garda barracks in those villages and towns will help to keep those rural towns and villages alive.</P>
    <P>One case I have come across creates a lot of sadness.  It is that of somebody who has endeavoured to carry out his own improvement and finds half way through that is has been made known that there is a grant available but the work must not have commenced.  I am making a special appeal to the Minister publicly, as I have already made it privately, that an applicant may make an application, have the inspector along to examine the improvement and where there is an amount of work remaining to be done, the cost of which is greater than the amount of grant available, that person will still qualify for whatever grant is available.  I would ask the Minister specifically to mention that in his reply, not to reply formally to it, <Col N="616" /> but to go back to his Department and see if he can do something about it.  These cases have arisen.</P>
    <P>All these reconstruction grants are to be welcomed.  It will take some time before the benefits go right through the community, but there are very major benefits &mdash; the direct social benefits to the householders, the indirect benefit to the builders, to the people they employ, to the people who provide the materials and the undisguised effort to get people moved out of the black economy and into doing work that is above board.  That is no harm.  That is very useful.  The stage has been reached where it is almost impossible to get people to work who are paying their taxes.  If that is unpopular, then so be it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Housing Finance Agency, I would ask the Minister to look at the possibility &mdash; I do not know how he can do it without totally buying the houses for them &mdash; of arranging some way to find that £3,000 or £4,000 that can be crippling.  For years past people have been coming on to the local authority housing lists who in normal times would have been attempting to build or buy their houses.  They have stopped.  We have a very long housing list in Donegal. I do not think we will ever meet it.  My colleague, Senator Cregan, says that in Cork the need is almost satisfied.  I believe that in Clare they are ahead of themselves.  I do not know what it is like elsewhere.  That is not the situation in Donegal, possibly because we are not encouraging the schemes that exist.  I believe that is part of it.  I have time and again asked officials of our county to publicise the schemes.  There is still a little bit of fiddle.  I would suggest that the Minister or his Department do another publicity campaign to remind people of what is available.  In the property pages in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> or other papers every week you will see houses for sale at £27,000, £27 per week repayments. This can be presented by auctioneers so as not to be always totally true but near enough to it not to be a lie or not to be wrong.  They do not spell out the hidden costs, and there are very real hidden <Col N="617" /> costs.  People must be protected from the hidden costs and yet must be advised of the real grant aid and loan aid that is available.</P>
    <P>By and large, I welcome the extra money that has been made available to the scheme.  I believe that a publicity campaign should recommence on it to advise people of its availablity.  The Minister should look at the two aspects I mentioned: the money that has to be found &mdash; roughly 10 per cent &mdash; and those people who have started to purchase and who have spent some money and have probably improved their house and made it more habitable than the one next door.  This is very often the case.  I welcome the scheme generally.</P>

      <P>I would like to preface my remark by supporting Senator Loughrey in regard to home improvement grants. We all know that this grant scheme was abused in the seventies and eighties and, unfortunately, was discontinued by this Government.  I understand that at that time people actually were building extensions and turning them into garages.  That was an abuse of a grant scheme.  What Senator Loughrey says makes common-sense to me because people do not apply for a grant for a bathroom &mdash; more important still, they do not build a bathroom and provide water and sewerage unless it is absolutely and totally necessary. Some flexibility at this stage should be introduced into that scheme.  No matter what we say here or what is on the application form, people simply do not realise that it is an absolute condition that the work must be inspected by a Department inspector prior to commencement in order to qualify for the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, I would like to support Senator Smith in what he says.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses.  We have completed a study on construction and one of our main aims was to try to eradicate this black economy that is rampant in the country at the moment.  All the members of the committee felt that where an unemployed tradesman wished to carry <Col N="618" /> out repairs to his house he should, if at all possible, be allowed to do so and qualify for the grant.  It is a minor adjustment to that home grant scheme which our committee recommended.  Unfortunately the scheme was announced by the Government &mdash; not intentionally, I hope &mdash; taking the real gut out of our report in advance.  The scheme is a recommendation from our Joint Committee and we fully support it.  I welcome the Bill which, in essence, will relieve the HFA of the necessity to rely as at present to a great extent on short term borrowing, which is costly but understandably necessary due to the restrictions under which the agency operated up to this.</P>
    <P>Like many other Senators who spoke when the scheme was introduced in the late autumn or early winter in 1981, it met with a mixed reaction from members of local authorities wo were very much involved in the loans and grants system. I viewed it with a certain amount of scepticism mainly because of repayments and the time schedule that would be involved on a percentage basis of income which is now at a reasonable 20 per cent.  There is a need to fill the gap that exists between people who qualify for the SDA loan and those who are slightly over the limit but who have not got the financial resources to provide their own homes.</P>
    <P>The HFA scheme has been successful in my own county but in certain areas it has not got off the ground.  It may be because people who consult members of local authorities are still being told to be wary of the scheme, that their grandchildren could be paying off the mortgage. In County Meath it has got off to a good start.  The number of applications up to October was 460 and of those 320 have been approved.  About 250 of these applications have been completed and payments made.  The Minister should also take note of the fact that the £8,000 limit on SDA loans for all practical purposes is bringing in a category of people who have a family to rear and their income is under £8,000.  They could not be categorised as people with full ability to repay and meet their commitments.  My county council recommended that the SDA loan <Col N="619" /> upper limit be increased to £9,000 and that the HFA upper limit be increased also.  That proposal is with the Minister at present.  There is merit in that idea.</P>
    <P>In the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report published last Thursday we noted the fact that we interviewed the Housing Finance Agency.  We were more than pleased with the performance of the agency.  There are about seven people operating the scheme and they have proved to be very efficient.  The number of staff is astonishingly low for the amount of money involved but they are gradually computerising the system, which will make it even more effective. We were concerned with the delay in sanctioning payments and issuing cheques.  This has now been brought down to about three weeks.  It is interesting to note that the State was responsible for 43 per cent of new house purchase loans in 1984 through the Housing Finance Agency and through the SDA loans provided by local authorities.  We took evidence from the representatives of the Housing Finance Agency and we were impressed with it performance in providing 11,000 house purchase loans totalling £217 million since the inception of the scheme in 1982.  We accepted that the issuing of long term index-linked stock is the most appropriate form of funding for any agency which provides 30 year house purchase loans.</P>
    <P>The committee felt that the present restriction confining the issue of this stock to insurance companies and pension funds should be eased to include other financial institutions.  I should like the Minister to take special note of that recommendation from our committee. Such a change would give the agency more flexibility in arranging its funding. We found the agency had to rely heavily on short term borrowings in order to boost its financial position and this was more costly.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to give some thought to another proposal that our committee made with regard to legal and conveyancing arrangements.  We find that the real problem does not lie with <Col N="620" /> the repayment of the SDA loan or the HFA loan.  It is what happens in between where people have to rely on bridging finance.  The banks have nothing to shout about in this regard.  Our proposal is that as a first step in reducing legal fees and simplifying the conveyancing system, the requirement that the house purchaser and lending agency each have their own solicitor should be dispensed with.  Serious consideration should be given to ending the solicitors' monopoly of conveyancing. That is a very good recommendation. I hope that the Oireachtas Joint Committee's report on construction will be before this House very early in the new year so that we can have an indepth discussion on it.  I welcome the Bill and support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I am pleased to welcome the Bill and support it.  Members of the Seanad will recall that the original Housing Finance Agency Bill was passed in this House early in 1982.  In December of 1982 the Seanad passed the Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill, 1982, and here today we are considering the second Housing Finance Agency (Amendment) Bill, 1985, which is a remarkable amount of legislation for what was a fledgling institution such a short time ago.  The fact that we are debating this Bill gives us an opportunity to reflect on the progress, growth and development of the Housing Finance Agency since its inception.  I propose to briefly look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of a local authority it has been my task to promote the Housing Finance Agency, whenever I felt it was appropriate and proper to do so, with suitable couples who were seeking housing finance.  It is important that people borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency would find that it met their particular needs.  Members of the Seanad who are also members of local authorities, which is the case with the majority of Senators, will agree that the body of representations they deal with are heavily weighted with urgent housing requirements. These have to be taken seriously. The need to own a home underpins the <Col N="621" /> deep-rooted desire and need that we all have for security and stability and a basis in our lives.  That is the right of all young couples who are embarking on marriage and a shared future together.</P>
    <P>As Senator Lynch said, when the Housing Finance Agency was first mooted it occasioned mixed reaction from commentators at the time.  There was a great deal of cynicism and an even greater misunderstanding of what it was attempting to achieve.  Many people, including Members of this House, had misgivings about how the Bill would operate.  The fact that we are considering an amending Bill to the Housing Finance Agency Act and that that Bill increases to £500 million the limit to which the HFA may borrow indicates that the agency has fulfilled a need which is beyond our wildest expectations, when we remember that the present borrowing limit, as specified in section 10 of the Housing Finance Agency Act, is £200 million.</P>
    <P>I would like to add my voice to what other Senators have said and I wish to pay a sincere tribute to the managing director of the agency, Mr. Jim O'Hare, who is so ably assisted by the chairman of the board, the board members and the small staff of the agency, to which Senator Lynch referred.  It is interesting that such a large amount of capital is being administered by such a small body of people.  It speaks well for the dedication and thorough manner in which the people who work at the agency manage their affairs.  To get a fledgling organisation off the ground so effectively is the best possible tribute to those who organise and administer the agency on behalf of the State.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the HFA as laid down in the legislation are first, to provide long term finance for house mortgages to certain categories of persons. The perceived need for the agency was to provide mortgages in what has come to be called the gap area between the normal local authority mortgage schemes, otherwise known as the SDA loans, and the other mortgage institutions. It is inevitable that with any new <Col N="622" /> scheme the lack of experience in demand patterns will give rise to a problem of arranging finance.  When that demand pattern is further upset by the introduction of special incentives, as arose in the case of the £5,000 grant for local authority tenants and in addition increased subsidies, it rendered the problem being faced by the agency far more acute.  This difficulty was even further aggravated by the increased reliance on short term borrowing to bridge the gap between long term funds available and current demands and the dramatic increase resulting in short term borrowing costs.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Housing Finance Agency was charged and obliged to have heretofore untapped sources as its funding reservoir.  Initially, it operated on the basis of short term borrowings from commercial institutions.  Then, following amending legislation, it became funded mainly on a long term basis by way of index-linked bonds; and the enabling of the agency to raise funds by means of promissory notes or bills of exchange, which we are dealing with today, is a very welcome feature of this legislation.  The agency was experiencing some difficulties in obtaining funds at a rate which would enable it to lend to mortgagees at a reasonable rate.  This inability to obtain sufficient long term finance as and when required has led to the additional need for increased short term borrowing.</P>
    <P>A third important objective of the agency was that, taking one year with another, all the costs of the HFA were to be met.  The bottom line as far as the financial stability of the HFA is concerned is that it should not lose money. This raises interesting questions as to whether its basic objective is a commercial one or a social one or, as I expected it probably is, a mixture of both.  It is inevitable that with some clients payments will slow down and there will be a certain percentage of failure.  This causes losses to the agency and raises the question of a bad debts provision which should be built into the system and reflected in the lending rate.  I would be interested in hearing what the Minister would have to say about that and I would also ask him <Col N="623" /> to consider the possibility of having local collectors dealing with Housing Finance Agency loans, perhaps operating through the local authorities or at least under their aegis in some way.  That would be a useful development.</P>
    <P>The factors to be quantified in this area are (1) the accrual estimate of the loss which is being incurred by the agency, and (2) the level of plus factor in the lending rate to meet this.  I wonder how the agency feels it should deal with its bad debts, because these are going to occur when we have a poor economic climate, despite the best efforts of Governments, and it is inevitable that people are going to default on their payments. I wonder if from time to time the agency should examine whether it should review its position in constantly issuing new loans and concentrate all its efforts on minimising loss by a concentration on improved repayments.  I know that where it is necessary the agency is obliged to have forced sales from time to time.  We should examine possible alternatives to deal with this difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is evident from figures the agency have published that action would need to be taken on a number of fronts.  The margin to borrowers should be increased. The measure today would probably be helpful in that we are securing long term funding from less volatile markets, and that is significant.  It is important that we should have good collections; and in some cases, where it is evident that a tight financial situation cannot be coped with by the borrower, we should consider early repossession followed by a quick sale.  These are matters largely for the board.  I think the Government should have something to say about the determination of the brief of the board in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are experiencing an increased arrears situation on all collections due to a variety of reasons.  These reasons are mainly political.  They vary from cannot pay to will not pay, and of course there are family problems which make it difficult for people to meet their commitments.  It is an interesting situation <Col N="624" /> now with the recently introduced Bill on the homeless.  I am concerned that it is the local authorities who have the responsibility of providing accommodation for the homeless.  People who have taken out a loan from the Housing Finance Agency and who default on payments are then the responsibility of the local authority to house.  That is a situation that is open to abuse and I would like the Minister to refer to it in his reply.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to make my contribution to this Bill.  I am very pleased to see the Housing Finance Agency go from strength to strength.  Again, I pay tribute to all those concerned in its day to day running.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this Bill is necessary because under section 10 of the Housing Finance Agency Act, 1981, the agency is subject to a borrowing limit of £200 million.  The main purpose of this Bill is to increase that limit to £500 million.  The Minister did not indicate when the existing limit of £200 million is likely to be exceeded or if it has already been exceeded.  He said that the additional £300 million which is being provided for in this Bill is likely to be sufficient to meet the needs of the agency for approximately three years.</P>
      <P>This Bill, of course, does not mean that there will be an extra £300 million immediately injected into the house building sector of the construction industry. The £300 million will be spread over at least three years.  The amount which the agency may borrow in any particular year will be fixed in the annual capital programme. Before the introduction of Housing Finance Agency loans the only loans which were available from local authorities were the SDA loans.  One would have thought that the introduction of the Housing Finance Agency loan scheme would result in an increase in the total number of loans being processed and granted by local authorities.  But this has not happened because, as the number of Housing Finance Agency loans has increased, there has been a considerable reduction in the number of SDA loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> Therefore, the overall number of people availing of loans for the purchase or construction of houses has not increased.  In fact, it has decreased.</P>
    <P>One of the factors which has attracted borrowers to the Housing Finance Agency loans is that the maximum Housing Finance Agency loan is £22,500 for the ordinary borrower as compared with £16,000 for the ordinary borrower under the SDA loan scheme.  Therefore, the Housing Finance Agency loan scheme has not generated any increase in house construction or any improvement in the demand for new houses.  It is true to say that this Bill will not make any contribution whatever to reducing the record levels of unemployment in the construction industry and particularly in the house building sector.  Senator Fallon said that Mr. Tom Reynolds, managing director of the Construction Industry Federation, said that in the first ten months of 1985 a 16 per cent decline was recorded in the private house building sector.  One of the major factors which has contributed to the decline in the house building sector is the 100 per cent increase in VAT which was imposed on the building industry in last year's budget.  This has led to a decrease in the number of new houses under construction in the current year and, indeed, there has over the last three years been a considerable decrease in the number of new private house completions. Senator Fitzsimons referred to the fact that in 1980 there were over 23,000 new house completions and that in 1984 that figure had dropped to under 18,000.  Therefore, if we accept Mr. Reynolds' projections, the number of private house completions in the current year will be down to a figure under 17,000.</P>
    <P>During this debate passing references have been made to the recently announced house improvement grant scheme.  I would like to make a passing reference to that scheme.  Under the conditions of that scheme the work involved can only be carried out by a registered building contractor.  Is the Minister aware of how difficult it is at present for a person to become registered as a contractor?  I <Col N="626" /> am aware of the case of a man who was for a very long time employed in the building industry.  Approximately two years ago that man became redundant. He had to go on unemployment benefit. He became aware of an opportunity to tender for some local authority houses which were advertised for tender.  When he went to the local authority to get the necessary tender forms and to discuss the matter with the local authority he was told that a tender would not be accepted from him unless he was registered.  He was told that the procedure for registration was that he should go to his local tax office and that there would not be any difficulty about becoming registered as a contractor.  He went to the local tax office and explained his situation there.  He explained that he wished to tender for some local authority houses which were advertised for tender and that he had been informed by the local authority that he had to be registered before a tender would be accepted from him.  He was asked what work he had on hands at the time.  He explained that he did not have any work on hands, that he had been employed in the building industry but had become unemployed and was in receipt of unemployment benefit and had not worked since he had become unemployed. He was told that he could not be registered unless he had some work on hands and was advised to go back to the local authority to tender for the work in question and if he was given the contract for the work then he would be registered. He went back to the local authority and was told the same story he was told on his first visit there.  The time for acceptance of tenders expired and he did not have an opportunity to submit a tender because he could not register as a contractor. I sincerely hope the Minister will use his good offices with the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that this red tape will be done away with.  Otherwise there will be a shortage of registered contractors to carry out the works which will be approved under the house improvement grant scheme.</P>
    <P>The first sentence of the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with <Col N="627" /> the Bill states that the main purpose of the Bill is to increase to £500 million the amount the Housing Finance Agency may borrow for the making of loans for the construction or building of houses. The reference in that sentence to the construction or building of houses is a little misleading in that at present almost 60 per cent of the Housing Finance Agency loans which are approved are approved for second-hand houses. Approximately 40 per cent, or slightly in excess of that, of the loans go towards the purchase of new houses.</P>
    <P>The categories of persons who qualify for Housing Finance Agency loans exclude certain people.  For instance, there does not seem to be any provision in the scheme for persons over 55 years of age to obtain to a loan under the Housing Finance Agency scheme.  Take the case of a tenant of a local authority house who wishes to purchase the house in which he is living.  That tenant will not qualify for a Housing Finance Agency loan; but, if he decides to buy the local authority house after it is allocated to him and before he has started to pay rent for it, then he is eligible for a Housing Finance Agency loan.  I believe there is an anomaly there.  It is something the Minister should look at and it is an area where he might make a recommendation to the Housing Finance Agency because, while the conditions applicable to Housing Finance Agency loans are made by the Housing Finance Agency, they are subject to the approval of the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make a recommendation or a suggestion to the Housing Finance Agency that a tenant who wishes to purchase the local authority house in which he is a tenant should be allowed to do so and he should be eligible for approval for a Housing Finance Agency loan.  It is conceivable that a person might decide, in a matter of months after becoming a tenant in a local authority house, that he wished to purchase that house.  Under the present conditions of the scheme he is not eligible to do so. <Col N="628" /> The amount of the loan is what makes it attractive as compared with the SDA loans.  But again, like the SDA loans, one of the snags in the scheme is that generally speaking an applicant for a Housing Finance Agency loan must be a first time house buyer or building a house for the first time.</P>
    <P>Previous ownership of a house debars a person from qualifying for a Housing Finance Agency loan, unless the person is moving to a new area or moving more than what is referred to as commuting distance away from the area in which he is living.  I feel that in both the case of SDA loans and Housing Finance Agency loans, if this condition were removed, it would generate considerable activity in the house building sector and in the housing market.  Many people, for family reasons or other reasons, find that after a number of years their existing house is not suitable and they wish, if they had the opportunity to do so, to move into possibly a larger house or possibly a smaller house.  I believe that type of movement would generate activity in the housing market and in the house building sector.  The fact that both those loan schemes are generally confined to first time house builders or house purchasers is an inhibiting factor as far as that type of activity is concerned.</P>
    <P>Some other speakers referred to the fact that the Housing Finance Agency loan can escalate to an enormous figure and that a stage can come during the repayment period when the amount owed on a Housing Finance Agency loan may be considerably in excess of the value of the house.  That will create serious problems in the years ahead for some persons who have borrowed under this scheme.  I believe the implications of this aspect of the Housing Finance Agency loans should be spelt out far more clearly for intending borrowers.  The local authority, the agency which implements the scheme for the Housing Finance Agency, should have discussions with every applicant for a Housing Finance Agency loan. Indeed I would go so far that every local authority should have an official who was well versed in all aspects of housing loans <Col N="629" /> and financial matters, who would discuss with every applicant for a housing loan every aspect of that loan.  Particularly in the case of the Housing Finance Agency loans, he should point out the implications to would-be borrowers.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Housing Finance Agency loan it is also important that it should be emphasised to borrowers that they should, if they can, repay above the minimum amount in order to keep the debt from escalating.  For instance, a person with an income of £7,500 per annum, who is under 40 years of age, can qualify for a £22,500 Housing Finance Agency loan.  Now at the minimum repayment of 20 per cent that person will be paying back £1,500 per annum and that is considerably less than the annual interest on the £22,500.  Therefore, the difference between the repayment of £1,500 and the interest on the £22,500 is added on to capital causing the debt to escalate year after year.  That person might be in a position to pay more than £1,500 in such a case it should be emphasised to that person that it would be in his or her own interest to do so.</P>
    <P>Changes in the conditions of the Housing Finance Agency loans are made by the Housing Finance Agency but are subject to the approval of the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance.  One change which has been made since the scheme was introduced is that the minimum repayment has been raised from 18 per cent to 20 per cent. Indeed, the minimum repayment was less than 18 per cent in the case of those persons who received only a loan of two or two and a half times their income.  Now for all persons the minimum repayment is 20 per cent.  I should like the Minister, when he is replying, to outline any other changes which have been made in the conditions of the scheme since it was introduced.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Bulbulia that there should be some bad debt provision built into the scheme because it is inevitable that bad debts will occur and nobody wants to see, if at all possible, evictions or forced sales.  Other Senators have referred to the cost of bridging finance <Col N="630" /> and how that cost can become a very serious burden on a borrower if there are considerable delays in the processing of the application or in dealing with the legal formalities in connection with the application.  The legal costs involved in the purchase of a house have been referred to.  As a result of these and other factors many borrowers today are in serious difficulties with loan repayments.  The Housing Finance Agency loan scheme has a role in the financing of house purchase, but as a public representative I am reluctant to advise people to take up Housing Finance Agency loans unless they are in a situation where no other loan is available.  In order words, I would only advise a person to avail of a Housing Finance Agency loan as a last resort. However, I accept that most people aspire to own their own houses and if the only way in which they can achieve that is through availing of a Housing Finance Agency loan, then fair enough.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion made that the income limit for SDA loans should be increased.  I would support that suggestion.  I would like to see the income limit for SDA loans increased to the same level as the income limit for Housing Finance Agency loans.  I believe this would give people a choice.  They would have the choice then of applying for the higher loan which is available under the Housing Finance Agency scheme or the lower maximum which is available under the SDA loan.  They would have the choice between the different systems of calculating repayments.  The existing situation, where you have two different income limits for the two types of loan, tends to push people into Housing Finance Agency loans.  That is something that is not desirable and it should be looked at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the welcome extended to this Bill because I appreciate the good work being done by the Housing Finance Agency in so far as it enables people who otherwise would not be in a position to do so to buy or to build houses on their own.  If we take, in conjunction with the Housing Finance <Col N="631" /> Agency, the good work being done by the SDA and the recent very significant improvement in housing reconstruction grants, it must be said that the Minister and the Government are doing a good deal to improve the housing situation. The very large improvements in the grants for windows and doors and the extension of houses will play a very big part in improving the housing stock in this State.  I will not debate that any further because the ground has been covered by other speakers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Housing Finance Agency, it would be good if there was a little more flexibility.  The officers of the local authorities should have a little more power to deal with some of the cases that arise and I will cite just two and finish at that.</P>
      <P>I had the experience of a man in Cavan who retired from the Army and sold his house because he wanted to go back to his native Cork.  Having sold his house he found employment that suited him in Cavan town, but because he had sold the house it was next to impossible to get him a loan under the Housing Finance Agency.  The county council officer felt it could not be done.  However, I must say, in fairness, on appeal to the higher executive of the Housing Finance Agency they obliged him; but a very long time had gone by.</P>
      <P>One last case is the case of a man who had to leave a street where there was a lot of traffic because the noise of the traffic was very injurious to his wife's health.  There was evidence from a GP and a consultant that it would be wise because of the condition of her health for him to move to a quieter section of the town but he could not get a Housing Finance Agency loan.  That is all I want to say.  I appreciate the good work being done by the Housing Finance Agency.</P>

      <P>I would like, first of all, to apologise on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, who is unavoidably absent.  I want to thank the Senators, particularly those who have made a contribution to this very important Bill. While the present Bill is a fairly modest one proposing financial and technical adjustments, it has given Senators an opportunity of discussing to some degree the wider question of the progress of the Housing Finance Agency and its loan scheme which continues to attract considerable public interest, as is demonstrated by the strong demand for loans.</P>
      <P>The provision of mortgage finance for housing, particularly for those on modest incomes, is a matter which affects the vital interests of a great many people; and the Government are concerned to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to ensure a continuing adequate supply of such finance.  The measures proposed in this Bill, particularly the increase to £500 million of the borrowing limit, are urgently required to ensure the continuing smooth functioning of the Housing Finance Agency.  A priority is to assist persons in rented accommodation to provide their own houses and become home owners, freeing a house for a person in need of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the situation of the construction industry, it should be mentioned that as a result of several Government initiatives taken in the interests of the housing programme the decline experienced by the house building sector of the industry has been less than that experienced in the industry as a whole in the circumstances of recent years.  The setting up of the Housing Finance Agency was one such measure and this was complemented by the introduction of the £5,000 grant for tenants and tenant purchasers surrendering local authority houses and now by new schemes of improvement grants and inner city developments which were announced recently.  The generous and <Col N="633" /> imaginative approach we have taken in regard to improvement grants contrasts with the dropping of the old improvement grants scheme in 1980 by another administration.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the points made by Senators.  I would like to thank them for raising those points and I am sure that consideration will be given by the Minister to any points I do not deal with here.  Some of the contributions, I understand, ranged over a wider housing area than is encompassed by the Bill.  As Senators are aware, the Minister commenced the Second Reading in the Dáil yesterday of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1985, and this is a very wide ranging Bill which will give Senators an opportunity of contributing and raising points with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole expressed his preference for the SDA loans scheme.  The position is, of course, that both schemes meet an essential need.  The agency loan enables many people who could not do so under the SDA scheme to purchase their own house.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to the relative numbers of new and second-hand houses for which Housing Finance Agency Loans were paid and suggested that the slight margin in favour of second-hand houses indicates that the agency is of little benefit to the construction industry. I cannot, of course, accept this view. In the first place most of the borrowers who did choose to purchase new houses with their HFA loans would not have been in the housing market at all without this scheme.  Secondly, the health of the second-hand market is essential to the health of the housing market as a whole, and the sale of second-hand houses in many cases facilitates the purchase of a new house by the vendor or by somebody else involved in the chain of sales and purchases.  It is well recognised within the construction industry that the Housing Finance Agency has been of substantial benefit to the house building sector.  Incidentally, I might point out that in the first six months of this year the number of loans paid by the agency for the purchase <Col N="634" /> of new houses in fact exceeded that paid for second-hand houses.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan raised the question of using Housing Finance Agency loans to assist householders who are experiencing difficulty with their mortgage repayments. There are many difficulties associated with such a course of action which would be at variance with the purposes for which the agency was set up.  The agency, as Senators know, was set up to provide mortgage finance for the first time purchasers of moderate means.</P>
    <P>If the agency embarked on the course suggested it would likely come to be a lender of last resort and regarded by other lending institutions as a means of overcoming their problems with defaulting borrowers.  This would result in the agency having to devote a significant amount of its limited funds to this purpose. One consequence would be a shortage of funds for first time purchasers, which the agency was set up to help.  In addition, the agency could end up with an undue proportion of potentially risky loans.  I have, of course, every sympathy for borrowers with any lending institution who find themselves in difficulties, but I am satisfied that this is not a satisfactory means of coming to their assistance.</P>
    <P>Senator Loughrey suggested that the agency should provide 100 per cent loans to borrowers.  While such a course might at first sight be attractive as a way of bringing home ownership within the capacity of marginal buyers, there are, I fear, some serious drawbacks.  Because annual repayments are based on a percentage of a borrower's income, they do not in the early years meet the interest liability accruing on the loan.  Unpaid interest is then capitalised.  Obviously, the bigger the loan the greater the annual addition to the amount outstanding.  The result could quickly be, first, that the value of the house no longer provides adequate security for the amount outstanding in the event of default by the borrower; and, secondly, that the loan would not be paid off by a borrower by the time he reaches retirement.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to the SDA loan scheme and, in particular, to the income <Col N="635" /> limit of £8,000 and the loan limits of £16,000 for ordinary loans and £20,000 for special category loans.  These limits are kept under review, but Senators will appreciate that in considering the possibility of increases the many other demands on the available resources have to be taken into account.  Even with the existing limits it is clear that the scheme meets the needs of many borrowers, as some £70 million was provided in SDA loans last year and a similar amount will be taken up this year.  The SDA scheme should be seen in the context of the many other incentives provided by the Government to encourage house purchase such as the £2,000 new house grant, the £3,000 mortgage subsidy and the £5,000 grant for those surrendering local authority houses.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked where the money was being spent and suggested that the scheme was orientated towards urban areas.  It is, indeed, time to say that the Housing Finance Agency scheme has proved particularly attractive in urban areas.  In 1985 one-third of the total allocation of £90.5 million will be utilised in the Dublin area.  This is a reflection of the response to the scheme from the public and, of course, of the population pattern whereby a large proportion of our population is concentrated in that area.  However, as the Senator pointed out, the SDA scheme continues to be very popular in his own area and in many other areas also.  The provision of funds for mortgage finance must be seen in its entirety and the SDA and the HFA schemes are complementary.  It is also true to say that the Housing Finance Agency scheme is by no means confined to urban areas and significant numbers of persons in rural areas are also availing of the schemes.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch suggested that the restriction of the institutions permitted to purchase Housing Finance Agency stock might be worth considering.  There are certain technical obstacles in the way of such a move.  Furthermore, the view is that this measure would probably not greatly increase the amount of funds available <Col N="636" /> to the agency.  However, should there be any indication that for any reason this situation might be changing, we would certainly look at the question again.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia mentioned &mdash; and it was also referred to by some other Senators &mdash; the problem of default on loan repayments.  This has, of course, been an aspect of the experience of all lending agencies.  It is to be expected that the Housing Finance Agency will experience this problem to some degree. The provision which the agency has had to make for bad debts to date has been fairly modest.  The position regarding the provisions to be made this year will not clear until the agency's accounts are finalised in the next couple of months.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also mentioned the position in relation to Mayo County Council.  Since the inception of the agency a total of over £2 million has been allocated to Mayo County Council, just under half of which was allocated this year, and over 100 loans have been taken up by borrowers in that county.  In total, the agency has to date provided about 11,200 loans.</P>
    <P>There are some other points made by other Senators.  As I said at the outset, I want to apologise for the absence of the Minister for the Environment who was not here to reply but did take some notes, and I am sure his officials have taken the details of the points that were made which were very relevant to this debate.  I would like again to thank all the Senators who contributed to it.  I listened to some very constructive debates to this very important Bill.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to thank the Senators on behalf of the Minister for the Environment.</P>

    <Title>Report on Prison Reform: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the enlightened and practical prison reforms proposed in the Whitaker Committee Report, and calls on the Government to implement the Report as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator M. Higgins.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some criticisms of the report but it deserves to be welcomed. It contains a level of compassion, perception, understanding and an unwillingness to be shanghaied down roads of popular frenzy at present in the way it looks at the nature of crime, the response to crime in society, the role of the prison system in responding to crime and also <Col N="638" /> the role of the prison system in dealing with people within it.  In particular I am pleased to repeat what I said when we last discussed the prison system and that is that I was satisfied when I saw the name of the chairman of the committee, whatever my disagreements with him on social and economic policies, that it would be the committee's report and that nobody like the Department of Justice or any other interest group would shanghai it.  I am satisfied that this is the report of the committee.  It is important to remember that it is not the report of some bunch of well-intentioned liberals.  There are involved a number of prominent business persons, trade unionists and people with expertise in various areas to do with life in our society.  Therefore, this report is an authoritative review of prison life and, indeed, of the whole problem of crime.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report of the committee and am happy about most of its recommendations. I am not nearly as happy about the likelihood of the recommendations being introduced or operated.  For example, it recommends that St. Patrick's Institution be closed as soon as possible.  I understand that the Minister for Justice has already rejected this.  The recommendation, I believe, reading the evidence, is based on the idea that St. Patrick's Institution, far from preventing people from committing offences creates a climate in which people are far more likely to be encouraged to commit offences than if they never were in the place before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reading this report, we need to think about the functions of prisons.  People can see prisons in three different ways. They can see them as institutions of restraint to keep people out of the way for a while and prevent them from doing harm to society.  They are people who are seen to be such a threat to society that society needs to be protected from them. They can be seen as institutions of rehabilitation within which people are put into an environment in which they are encouraged by various means &mdash; some incentives and some, perhaps, pressures to take a different view of society and <Col N="639" /> their own role in society and give them personal skills, educational and others, to make it less likely for them to resort to crime in the future.</P>
    <P>There is the concept of prison as retribution, that people are in prison so that we can get our own back on them for what they did to us.  When people speak in a detached way about prisons, they tend to emphasise rehabilitation most and play down retribution to the maximum possible extent.  On the other hand, when we have any serious upsurge, real or imagined in our crime rate, the whole emphasis is turned on its head and we have half of the Irish establishment &mdash; largely political &mdash; baying for retribution, demanding to have more prisons opened, to have the regimes made tougher and demanding to have what are alleged or perceived to be excessive degrees of comfort removed.  Much of this is people talking about what they think would be the sort of prison that would bother themselves. Most of the people who are talking about making prison regimes hard are people who are of their nature petrified of the prospect of ever ending up in prison although the nature of the crimes they will commit guarantee that they will never go to prison.</P>
    <P>Thus, the people who bay loudest about prisons saying they should be harsh regimes are, by and large, those who own cars and drive them without much concern for the quantity of alcohol they have consumed and pose a far greater threat to the safety of ordinary citizens than most of the youngsters who swagger down O'Connell Street looking dangerous late at night.  Yet these children who swagger down O'Connell Street have every chance of ending up in jail but those who drive a car under the influence of alcohol have virtually none.</P>
    <P>One could go through a number of other areas &mdash; those who fiddle their taxes and owe the State hundreds of millions of pounds will never go to jail but most of those who between them steal £40 million &mdash; which is a tiny fraction of what is being stolen from the State in terms of unpaid taxation &mdash; will end up in prison. <Col N="640" /> Even though polite words are used about prisons and noble sounding and progressive phrases issue from Minister upon Minister, the reality is that prisons are seen as retribution of a kind which gives various Governments at various times a convenient bolt hole down which to disappear whenever public opinion becomes outraged.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the area of rehabilitation is ever sacred if public opinion gets sufficiently outraged as was evidenced by the disgraceful decision to close the educational facilities in a number of prisons in order to meet with an alleged epidemic of joyriding in Dublin and Cork.  The epidemic turned out to be a non-event when the statistics were published revealing that we had far less incidents of car theft in 1985 than in 1984.  We responded to the epidemic in 1985 largely, in my view, because a couple of major newspapers had made hay out of generating hysteria on that issue.  What we have then is the closure of educational facilities and the deprivation of prisoners who are already in prison and who could not be blamed for the so-called incidence of crime.  They are being deprived in order to satisfy the hysteria of a manipulated public opinion to see that something should be done.</P>
    <P>This created enormous tension in prisons. Those who wanted to do something with their lives and make some use of the time that they would have otherwise wasted were the ones who suffered most from pathetically hysterical Ministerial responses to short term public pressure. There is a certain public psychology that we do not want to talk rationally about crime.  Crime is one of those issues that we prefer to treat in an emotional way.  There is a need for a profound emotional response of compassion and concern for the victims of crime but compassion and concern for the victims should never be confused with outraged cries for vengence and retribution against the perpetrators.  The two things are not necessarily related and are not synonymous. This is why we have always had this difficulty of looking objectively at prisons.  We need to have the feeling that <Col N="641" /> they are places in which people, if they are not whipped, at least feel the worse for it and, therefore, we can feel better for their feeling the worst.</P>
    <P>It is in the context of identifying that prisons, if they are to serve any purpose, must contribute to the benefit and the good of prisoners that the report recommends that, as far as possible, people should not be imprisoned and that where people should be imprisoned fairly definite criteria of necessity must be met. One of those would not be the state of public opinion at a particular time or the success of a particular newspaper group in creating hysteria about a particular form of crime.  They would not be the criteria.  The criteria would be the severity of the offence and the failure of all other forms of remedy.  It is interesting that the report should identify that 14 per cent of the population in prison are there because of non-payment of fines.  If the penalty is a fine, then prison is so much more dramatic than a fine.  Whatever remedies are taken to ensure that fines are paid, prison should not be one of them.  It is a complete quantum leap into another level of penalty to send people to prison because of failure to pay a fine.</P>
    <P>Likewise, I am very happy that the committee recommend the repeal of large sections of the Vagrancy Act in line with the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  I am sorry the Minister for Justice is not here, although that is not to reflect on the Minister who is here because some of the snotty remarks that the Minister for Justice made to two friends of mine at a seminar in Limerick recently do not suggest that the Minister for Justice has much interest in dealing with the Vagrancy Act.  Indeed, his factual statements on the Vagrancy Act suggest that not only does he not have any interest in it but he does not know anything about it either, which is an extraordinary state of affairs for the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The other emphasis that runs through the report is the emphasis on the need to minimise the damage to people if they must be imprisoned and I emphasise the &ldquo;if they must be&rdquo;.  It is not a remedy.  It <Col N="642" /> is not necessarily ever a solution.  It rarely works in the way that it is intended other than in giving society a feeling that we are getting our own back.  This is not a particularly pleasant reflection on ourselves. Prisons do not rehabilitate people. They do not deter crime.  They do not, unless we lock them all up for 40 years, provide much restraint or protection for society.  Therefore, the only way they might work is in making people feel we are getting our own back to some extent. Even then that is very temporary and it is also a reflection of the lack of information that is available to people.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote from the report in the few moments that I have left because I think it needs to be said fairly clearly what the report does specify. These are rational, dispassionate people doing an intelligent analysis of what they regard as the minimum needs of a decent prison regime.  I am quoting from paragraph 7.4, page 61, of the commission's report:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Basic conditions</P>
    <P>Basic living conditions for a prisoner should correspond broadly to those available to persons with an average disposable income.</P>
    <P>Thus, prisoners should be expected to have:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a balanced diet in sufficient quantity and variety, prepared in hygienic conditions;</P>
    <P>&mdash;clothing of a kind and quality in common use and suited to their activities subject, however, to a right to wear private clothing provided it is clean and presentable and is not, because of its design or colour, prejudicial to the maintenance of custody;</P>
    <P>&mdash;normally (and always where prisoners so desire) private sleeping accommodation in single cells, with beds and bedding of normal quality;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a wash-basin in every cell and ready access to toilet facilities at all times;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a general prison environment which <Col N="643" /> is clean, bright and hygienic, well lighted naturally, and comfortably heated and ventilated;</P>
    <P>&mdash;physical and mental health care which is up to the standard generally available in the community, with ready access to psychiatric, specialist and hospital in-patient treatment, as needed;</P>
    <P>&mdash;maximum out-of-cell time;</P>
    <P>&mdash;flexible access to participation in ordered activity such as education and work, to recreation facilities and to welfare services;</P>
    <P>&mdash;facilities in the case of women prisoners to care for any child born in prison;</P>
    <P>&mdash;facilities which are adequate to practise the religion of genuine choice, with reasonable access to clergymen of choice.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of stuff which sends the law and order brigade into paroxysms of anger.  They are the specified minimum standards &mdash; and I emphasise minimum standards &mdash; that this committee regard as acceptable for the running of a decent prison.  This is not the optimum; this is the minimum that the committee specify. I will conclude by quoting one more piece from the report because I think it needs to be put clearly on the record:</P>
    <P>One-third of all offences are committed by persons under 17 years of age.</P>
    <P>As the committee says, and this is as fine a way as any with which to conclude a discussion on prisons:</P>
    <P>...the majority of young people coming before the courts have a very limited stake in conventional society. Their prospects of employment are bleak.  Their poor educational attainments and minimal work skills place them at a decided disadvantage in the labour market even at the best of times.  Their housing and environmental conditions aggravate their disadvantage. <Col N="644" /> Rarely can they entertain any realistic hope that things will improve. The reward which they perceive for conforming to the values and norms of society is continuing poverty and ineffectiveness.  It is clearly not by any reform of the criminal justice system, but rather by more wide-ranging economic and social policies, that the problem of juvenile crime can best be tackled.</P>
    <P>That is as fine a reply to the hysteria of the law and order lobby, to the media hysteria and to the occasional hysteria regrettably of the Minister for Justice, as I have ever seen put together.  It comes from a body of reasonable, rational people who have made a reasonable and rational assessment of the prison system. There are many things about this report that one could argue but as a step in the direction of rational policy in the area of prisons it is most welcome and I support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I understand Senator Harte was before the previous speaker.  It gives me considerable pleasure to be able to make a contribution to this debate, which is an ongoing one.  I have one or two preliminary points to make before going into the meat of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will spend some time then on the two aspects of the report which I think are important.  The first preliminary point I would like to make is one that I raised in this House before and I would like to raise it again.  I do not consider it appropriate for a judge of the Supreme Court or, indeed, a judge of any other court to be on inquiries like this.  I consider it a singularly inappropriate appointment to have a judge of the Supreme Court considering, among other things, the number and deployment of prison staff, the management structure, the recruitment and training of prison service staff and staff management relations in the prison service. That is contrary to the division of responsibility between the Judiciary and the Administration.  I mentioned before <Col N="645" /> that I consider that appointments of that kind have been made which were inappropriate. I could conceive of none more inappropriate than the appointment of a Supreme Court judge to a review of this type, a review which is essentially a review of matters of policy as they related to the practice of politics in this country. That is to cast no reflection whatsoever on the individual judge concerned.  No doubt, because of his personal characteritstics, he was eminently suitable for this appointment but, as a matter of principle, the appointment in my opinion should not have been made.</P>
    <P>I consider this a very valuable report. The house owes a debt of gratitude to the hardworking members of the committee including, I am sure, the judge of the Supreme Court who put together this very substantial report on the structural facilities in the prison, on the relationship between the staff in the prison and the Department of Justice and on the whole reason for having a prison service at all. They tried to address themselves to that latter point and I think they failed.  I do not think they really know why we have a prison service and I do not think I really know myself either.  It is an admission by human beings of their inability to persuade by logic and by commonsense their fellow human beings to conform to the norms of society.  It does actually represent a failure by us that there is a necessity for prison.  I am not arguing that there is no necessity for prison but it does represent our failure.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Leary, I am sorry to interrupt but there is a division in the other House and I am sure you will excuse the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue on because with the limited time available to us, it would be unreasonable not to.  I think that that is a very serious problem. I will tell the House why it is becoming so serious.  In Chapter 5, paragraph 7, and in summary form in Chapter 2, paragraph 12, some of the alternative methods of punishment to the prison service were mentioned by the committee.  Chapter 2, <Col N="646" /> paragraph 12, deals in considerable detail with the alternatives which are available to society.  For example, they mention the question of probation, fines, confiscation of income or assets in certain cases, restitution, conditionally suspended prison sentences, community service orders, disqualifications and withdrawal of licences, etc.  They are the main ones.  The problem is that there is a substantial difference between different groups of people within our society and the type of punishment which is available to us for them.  Senator Brendan Ryan said prison was not for the well off and so on.  There is some merit in what he is saying.  There is even greater merit because there is a large number of offences for which fines and other financial penalties are appropriate remedies or appropriate punishment.  I support the committee's view that fines and punishments of that kind should be used to a greater and greater extent.  Indeed, I include in that the confiscation of the income and assets of, for example, drug dealers.  It is a much harsher penalty for drug pushers than mere imprisonment.  I would much prefer to see a lesser period of imprisonment and a far harsher financial penalty.  I think a move along that road is to be commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestions to that effect in the report are worthwhile.  A problem, however, arises where we are dealing with people in society who do not have a financial stake in society.  If you have a person with nothing, there is no point in fining him.  This is where we have backed ourselves into a corner by allowing people in society without a financial stake.  You cannot fine these people because they do not have the money.  All you can do is fine them £20 and then petition the Minister for Justice to remit it to £1 because they are only on subsistence social welfare. In effect, we are incapable of doing anything in respect of small transgressions by the more economically deprived members of our community. We have no method by which we can punish them.  What happens in those cases is this.  Because they continually <Col N="647" /> commit small offences, eventually somebody loses patience and throws them into prison.  If they were financially well off, they would have got a massive fine the first time and even a more massive fine the next time.  The third time they would say &ldquo;It is not worthwhile.  I will not do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is something which I do not think this report has adequately tackled.  I do not know the answer but the important thing is, how can we reimpose in a post-Christian society a discipline on that section of the population which has no substantial financial resources?  That is a problem which has not been tackled and should be tackled.  I am certainly not going to tackle it in the short space of time available to me.  I support the increasing emphasis on substantial financial fines of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the recommendation which is contained in the summary, at paragraph 2.27, to increase the remission from 25 per cent to 33 per cent.  A tremendous incentive should be given to people who are in prison to behave themselves, and there cannot be a greater incentive than the increase in the remission.  I should like to support that.  It is a well worthwhile recommendation and one which should be implemented straight away.  However, what I do not support is the idea that the gratuity, which is referred to as being the amount of money over and above their living expenses which is given to prisoners, should be increased from £4.20 to £10.  I do not think we should financially blur the difference between being in prison and working outside where many younger people would find it difficult to have £10 surplus after all their living expenses.  In those circumstances we should recognise that it was a punishment element in the prison system for as long as we have it and we should not go along with that recommendation.  It does not appear to me to be correct.</P>
    <P>The idea of having a Prisons Board with a Director who would be responsible for taking the day to day decisions in the <Col N="648" /> prisons is a good one.  It will have the beneficial effect of separating the Minister from the day to day operation of the prisons which is in both the Minister's interest and in the interests of the prison and, indeed, of the prisoners.  Coupled with that, the idea of an Inspector of Prisons reporting directly to the Minister, not reporting to the Secretary of the Department is an excellent idea which must go hand in hand with the idea of a Director of the Prisons Board.  In that way you retain a political connection, but that political connection is by way of reporting on a situation rather than accepting day to day responsibility. Those recommendations are contained in the summary at paragraphs 231-249 of the report which is before us.</P>
    <P>One thing which I would like to devote the rest of my time to is the situation that has grown up between the Department and prison officers.  I recognise that there may well be faults on both sides.  I recognise that in paragraph 2.47 of the report the prison officers' and departmental problems are summarised and suggestions made as to the reasons for them.  I certainly recognise that within the Department of Justice the implications of having trade union rights conceded to the Prison Officers Association is undoubtedly a contributary factor.  I think that anybody who has listened to what the prison officers have said over the last few years, going back quite a few years, must accept that the attitude of mind with which they approach their work is less than what we would expect from professional people who are part of the security service of the State.  They require a drastic reorganisation of their organisation.  Their constant high profile criticism of successive Ministers for Justice &mdash; not the Department &mdash; coupled with their almost insatiable appetite for meetings with the Minister rather than the Minister's officials, gives an impression of a group of men who are unreasonable. It is something in relation to which they should certainly consider their position very carefully.</P>
    <P>I have one or two reasons why I think that that happened.  Paragraph 14.15 of <Col N="649" /> the report summarises fairly well what has happened with regard to prison officers in this country.  In 1970, 264 of them were looking after 749 prisoners. Now 1,550 of them are looking after 1,874 prisoners.  There are too many of them there.  They are overstaffed.  They are underemployed.  It is a good principle of management that, if you have people underemployed, you are going to have industrial relations problems.  You will not have industrial relations problems with a busy staff, but you will with an underemployed staff.  That is their problem.</P>
    <P>I accept that they have a difficult job. I also accept that a lot of their work is custodial, which means that they are waiting for something to happen rather than anything else.  That gives rise to a situation where, even if they were fully employed, they are still in such close proximity to one another that the little grievances that occur from day to day in any activity grow out of all proportion.  I think that the staffing levels within our prisons are excessive.  That matter has to be redressed or should be redressed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other things I do agree with as well.  I agree that the age of recruitment for the prison officers should be looked at carefully.  The upper age limit of 30 is not, in my opinion, good. You would be much better off getting in mature people &mdash; perhaps mature members of the Garda Síochána or people who are fairly well used to dealing with trouble on one level or another.  The recommendation in paragraph 2.56 of the report that &ldquo;The committee also favours a substantial extension of the present upper age limit of 30 years&rdquo; is something to which I would lend enthusiastic support.</P>
    <P>I do not really believe that there is any good, sensible reason for the change of the rules with regard to sex equality, which is referred to in paragraph 2.62 of the report.  The principle of having mixed staffing of prisons which are themselves single-sex, is not something I would find instinctively attractive.  I do not agree with it.  I am capable of being persuaded <Col N="650" /> on that count, but it does not automatically find favour with me.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, the report itself draws together the various problems associated with the prison service.  It does a substantial job in that regard.  The members of the committee are to be congratulated for that reason.  It is now the responsibility of the Government to act on this report.  If I were to pick one aspect of the report to which the Government should give top priority, it would be the question of the appointment of a Director of Prisons and the removal of the day-to-day operation of the prison from the Department of Justice in the interest of preserving the sanity of those in the Department of Justice and of public confidence in the system, together with the appointment of the liaison officer who has been referred to &mdash; he may be called the Inspector of Prisons &mdash; directly responsible to the Minister to ensure that the political sensitivity, which is such an important part of running an efficient prison service, would not only remain over the years to come but would increase and improve in the years that lie ahead.</P>

      <P>Like other Members, I welcome this report because I feel it is time our entire prison service was reviewed. Many of our prisons, as they are at the moment, are antiquated buildings of a standard which is not, in many cases, habitable.  Indeed, it is even pointed out in the report, with regard to certain sections of Portlaoise prison, that it is not up to the standard of Loughan House, for example, as a modern building in reasonably good condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prisons, while they are places of detention, should also be places of rehabilitation. It is necessary that the people who are admitted to those institutions are given whatever help possible to bring them back to where they are fit, on ending their prison sentences, to take their place in society again.  Sometimes people are imprisoned to protect the general public. In other cases they are imprisoned for their own protection, because of organisations they belong to or of groups which they may have been involved with during <Col N="651" /> their criminal careers.  We should press for greater rehabilitation of prisoners. We must press the Department of Justice to have improvements made in our prison facilities regarding education and the conditions under which prisoners spend their time.  I say that because the report cites, in a number of places, cases where prisoners are housed three and four to a small cell.  That does not help to establish good relations with the prisoners or the prison staff.</P>
    <P>There are a number of interesting items in the report regarding the cost of maintaining somebody in prison.  In many cases it would be more beneficial to the State if people who are imprisoned for petty crimes were made do community service work rather than be imprisoned. Sending somebody to prison for six months for stealing £150 is not in his best interests of him or the best interests of society.  He will come from prison with a chip on his shoulder against the society which has locked him away for a period. He will find that he is an outcast among his friends and also in society.  He would be much better if he were made to do some community service work.</P>
    <P>Our prison costs are excessive compared with state prisons in other countries. In the United States there are prisons run by public companies.  In fact, it is one of the fastest growing sections in the American economy at the moment. The amount of money being invested by people in the running of these prisons suggests that there must be very good financial returns for the investors.  It also seems to have proved quite successful from a state point of view.</P>
    <P>The increasing number of people in custodial institutions is alarming.  It appears that society is now breaking down.  There is an increase in crime and vandalism.  The perpetrators of the crimes we have had in this country in recent weeks deserve long custodial sentences.</P>
    <P>Violent crime is quite distinct from the petty crime for which many people receive long custodial sentences.  The activities in our prisons in recent times <Col N="652" /> also give grave reason for alarm.  The recent press article regarding the football being kicked in and out of Mountjoy, carrying drugs for those taking drugs within the prison, is very alarming.  It is worrying to think the people who are being supervised could have this sort of activity in their midst.</P>
    <P>The drug problem and the recent death in Mountjoy means that immediate steps should be taken by the prison authorities to have this type of trafficking stamped out and that those responsible, whoever they may be, should be dealt with in the harshest manner possible.</P>
    <P>We need to be careful with regard to our prison system.  Much publicity has been given to our prisons.  I refer especially to a radio interview which was given yesterday by Father McVeigh, with regard to recent happenings in Portlaoise. It is a matter of the gravest urgency for the Minister for Justice to investigate the accusations made by Father McVeigh.  If those accusations are untrue, nobody is telling the public that they are untrue.  People have been told by Father McVeigh of strip searching and other undesirable actions taking place in Portlaoise recently.  This matter should be examined immediately by the prison authorities and by the Department of Justice to see if the allegations made are true or untrue.  If they are untrue, they should be contradicted as quickly as possible. Many people, who may not be as critical as some of us, could be influenced by statements such as that made by Father McVeigh.  I appeal here to the Minister of State to ask his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to have those accusations immediately investigated and, if they are untrue, to have a statement issued on behalf of the Department of Justice and in the interest of clearing the good name of our prison officers. It is as important that they should be protected.  They are not in a position, individually or jointly, to make statements regarding such accusations.</P>
    <P>We should look at something which I feel is very odd regarding the prison service.  People who are taken into custody <Col N="653" /> for minor crimes, for debt payments or other such things are immediately whisked to Mountjoy and then redispatched to Loughan House.  I have heard recently of cases where people who lived within 20 or 30 miles of Loughan House were taken to Mountjoy, held overnight there and then returned to Loughan House. When the commital orders are made they should be examined to see where the most suitable accommodation is for the person being committed.  If it is adjacent to them they should be taken there rather than to Mountjoy first and then redispatched, because the cost of doing that is quite considerable to the State.</P>
    <P>We should also ask the Department to fully investigate the recent happenings on Spike Island.  There was a very dangerous situation there for the staff, and the people who inhabited the island.  The Department of Justice have not carried out a complete investigation into the happenings on Spike Island or the happenings recently in Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recent attempted breakout from Portlaoise Prison, could the Minister tell us the source which supplied the keys which were available at the piers to the prisoners concerned?  What was the source of prison warders' uniforms? Were the gates which they had access to installed by the Department of Justice through the Board of Works or were they installed by outside contractors? I believe work in our prisons should be carried out only by the Board of Works because the people who are employed there are people who work for the State and would be totally committed to the maintenance of law and order.  When one looks at the possibility of outside contractors being employed to do work within our prisons one must feel that it leaves quite an amount to be desired.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report, while I might have made those criticisms with regard to a few of the prisons.  Our aim should be to provide custodial services and detention centres which are of the highest standard in order that the people who are committed to those institutions may be given the opportunity of rehabilitating themselves in order to take their place in <Col N="654" /> society at a later date.  It would be very wrong of us as legislators to have prisons which are not of the highest standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to apologise to you and to the House for the Minister for Justice this evening.  As Members of the House will be aware, he was present for much of the debate a fortnight ago but, unfortunately, he has a difficulty this evening and he has asked me to come along and contribute to this debate on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I generally accept the spirit of the motion before the House, as I know the Minister for Justice does.  I have some difficulty in giving it my full and wholehearted support and that will be so for two reasons.  The first of the reasons that gives me difficulty relates to a matter that was mentioned in the Dáil recently by the Minister for Justice and that is simply that the recommendations that were made by the committee have yet to be considered by the Government.  The Government will shortly be in a position to give at least preliminary consideration to the issues which arise but I think every Member of the House will accept that the nature of the report is such &mdash; and this comes across from the contributions that have been made &mdash; that it requires very detailed analysis.  Inevitably, some lapse of time is going to occur before decisions can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one should infer from that that there is any lack of commitment on the part of the Government or on the part of the Minister for Justice.  As Members will recall, the decision to set up the committee was one of the very first that was taken by the Minister for Justice when assuming office.  I want to assure the House that he has no intention whatever of ignoring the report, a report which is the very first of its kind in the history of the State.  In saying he is not going to ignore it, I must also say that the Government are not going to ignore it.  That is not to say that it is necessarily going to be possible to accept all of the committee's conclusions.  If any of them is to be rejected then it will only be after a thorough <Col N="655" /> analysis has shown that the balance of public interest lies elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The second difficulty I have is that were I to unequivocally accept the motion it would be ignoring the fact that even since the report was concluded other issues have taken on an importance and a prominence which they may not have had while the committee were deliberating and which could affect implementation of some of the report's recommendations. For example, decisions are now required as to how best to equip the prison system to cope with growing medical problems. The changes which may have to be made could be on a scale not envisaged in the report and have an effect on accommodation. That was not averted to.  The type of issue which has arisen means that even if all the recommendations of the committee were generally acceptable in themselves, the changing circumstances could prevent their implementation in full, as the motion suggests to us.  At the very least there would be a need for an adaptation to changing conditions.</P>
    <P>As further evidence of that I was listening to Senator O'Leary earlier &mdash; he is a Senator I rarely find myself in disagreement with &mdash; and I heard him express unease about the suggestion that the Employment Equality Agency legislation should be applied to the prison service.  I can put Senator O'Leary's mind at ease. He will not find himself in any difficulties with the Government because that has already happened since the report was published.  For those two reasons &mdash; the fact that the Government have yet to consider the report and the emergence of changing conditions since the committee sat and deliberated &mdash; it seems that it might be wiser not to press ahead tonight. That is entirely a matter for the House. If the House were to take that view, then I am sure it would be prepared to do so only on the clear understanding that when the report is to be considered by Government the Minister would bring to the notice of the Government the views that have been expressed by Senators in the debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> While on the subject of medical services I want to refer to some remarks that were made by Senator Lanigan a fortnight ago when he said that it had been suggested that a prisoner who had a very severe physical problem was allowed on to the streets of Dublin without any care and attention.  The Senator went on to say that this person, who had a serious illness, did not get the type of help that one would expect in the situation.  I would like to assure the Senator that the person in question had not been diagnosed as suffering from a serious illness.  The individual involved, who was due for release on 26 November, was released from custody on the day on which notification was received of the presence of AIDS antibodies in his blood.  He was released on condition that he attend for appropriate medical monitoring of his condition. The presence of AIDS antibodies does not of itself mean that an individual is suffering from an illness.  I am sure that the Senator, in those circumstances, will accept that the information on which he based his remarks was something less than the complete picture.</P>
    <P>The Whitaker report before the House represents the first major independent review of our penal system since the foundation of the State.  It will be clear from the contributions that have already been made to the debate that the report is essential reading for anyone who is concerned with the fundamental issues that face our society.  Senator Higgins in particular pointed out with great force and eloquence that its interests lie not just in its review of the penal system itself but also in what it has to say about the criminal justice system and society generally. I share the Senator's appreciation that the committee took a wide view of its terms of reference and did so in a way that helped rather than confused their consideration of the specific issues they were asked to examine.  I welcome that, particularly because of the emphasis it placed on preventive action and the recognition it gave to the role of voluntary organisations and the youth service in reducing the level of crime and, in consequence, reducing the pressure on the <Col N="657" /> prison system.  May I, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Minister for Justice, echo Senators from all sides of the House who have paid tribute to the members of the committee and to its distinguished chairman for the valuable service which they have performed.  I echo Senator O'Leary's comments about the composition of the committee and, in particular, the presence of a member of the Judiciary.  I know this is a view he has held because he has expressed it in relation to other reports, tribunals and commissions. While I know the view is held with conviction, I do not go along with it in all respects.  It is happily the case that members of the Judiciary are held in such esteem in this State that their very presence on a committee of this nature can give the body status and ensure that it is seen to have an integrity that guarantees it will be taken seriously by the public and by those to whom the report referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice received the committee's report during the summer. Having received it, he then published it within a matter of days so as to encourage as thorough a public debate as possible on the difficult issues which arise in this area.  Such a debate was regarded essential. Why?  Because it was important that the widest possible public consensus should be achieved in an area so fundamental to the way that we, as a society, organise ourselves.  Against that background and in the context of the Minister's desire for the widest possible public debate this motion is particularly welcome. I thank the Labour Party sponsors of the motion for providing the House with an opportunity to discuss the report.</P>
    <P>While there was the desire for a wider-ranging public debate, unfortunately I think it is the case that the initial debate and the immediate aftermath of publication of the report was dominated to a great extent by some people who concentrated exclusively on the recommendation about establishing a prisons board. It is quite clear that a number of fundamental principles of public accountability arise in determining the nature of such a body; but, while that is clear, the Minister <Col N="658" /> has already indicated that he will be recommending to Government that a prisons board should be established.</P>
    <P>I want to sound a note of caution on this.  It would be foolish to believe that the establishment of the board is itself a panacea for the problems of prison administration.  It is a pity that concentration on that part of the report has served to obscure other more fundamental issues that were addressed by the committee. That is all the more unfortunate because the committee emphasised in their report the importance of public opinion in setting out and determining the nature of our penal system.  In relation to the prisons, they said that no reform could be accomplished without a major change in public attitudes and perceptions.  The recommendations of the report are being examined in great detail by the Department of Justice.  I am sure Senators will readily appreciate that it will be some time before the Minister can make up his mind fully on all the conclusions of the committee.  This is only a preliminary response to a couple of the major issues that have been raised by the report.</P>
    <P>When speaking in the other House on the Estimates for the Department of Justice the Minister for Justice expressed the view that people should only be sent to prison where it is clearly necessary in the interests of society to do so.  In saying that, he would not find himself a thousand miles away from some of the quotations that were put on the record of the House by Senator B. Ryan.  I accept that a lot hinges on how that phrase &ldquo;clear necessity&rdquo; is defined or identified.  Nonetheless, it is fairly clear that that approach of the Minister is consistent with the views expressed by the committee that imprisonment should be employed only as a last resort.  For some time it has been recognised in our prison administration that, as the committee put it, imprisonment is itself a punishment and that nothing should be done to inflict hardship or punishment beyond the inevitable consequences which flow automatically from the deprivation of liberty involved in imprisonment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> I welcome the extent to which there was a recognition of just how serious a step imprisonment is.  There has been too much glib talk about prisons as holiday camps.  Perhaps that represents an understandable symptom of people's frustration at crime but it is not based on any appreciation of the reality of loss of liberty. Those who continue to hold the view that our prisons represent a holiday from crime would do well to study the report and in particular the section in chapter 11 on public opinion and on the normalisation of prisons.  That section of the report gives a clear view on why imprisonment should be used as sparingly as possible and why every effort has to be made to provide alternative facilities.  Also every effort has to be made to provide counteracting facilities such as education, work, youth service, and so on.  There has been a steady commitment over the years to developing these facilities.  It also has to be recognised that the growth which has taken place in the prison population in recent years has made that difficult.  The committee's view that our penal system will be faced with enormous difficulties in the future if the growth in the numbers being committed to custody continues is manifestly and obviously correct.</P>
    <P>Earlier in this debate Senator McDonald pointed out that between the years 1972 and 1982 the average number in custody increased by 200, from approximately 1,000 to 1,200.  Since then the prison population has gone up to 2,000, an increase of almost 800.  That level of increase over such a short period, has caused inevitable difficulties for the prison system.  It reflects a conscious and correct decision on the part of the Government that people convicted for serious offences should serve the sentences imposed on them by the courts.</P>
    <P>Senator B. Ryan referred to what he believed to be a campaign of public hysteria in relation to the so-called offence of joy-riding &mdash; the unauthorised taking of motor vehicles.  He suggested that the hysteria was misplaced and pointed out that statistics show a reduction in the <Col N="660" /> number of vehicles taken.  The reason that there has been a reduction in the number of vehicles taken is because the measures taken by the Government to respond to that have been successful. Measures were taken by the Government in terms of the organisation of the Garda. There was the firm determination of the Minister for Justice and the Government that people convicted of that serious offence, which puts lives at risk, should serve the sentences imposed upon them by the courts.  I have seen in my own constituency the tragic consequences that can flow from that kind of anti-social behaviour.  An elderly lady was carried on the bonnet of a car.  I deprecate any suggestion that such an offence is to be dismissed lightly.  I believe that the level of public concern about crime has been so intense that it would have been unthinkable that people sentenced to imprisonment by the courts &mdash; courts sitting in accordance with the laws passed by both these Houses &mdash; should not be required to serve their sentences simply for want of prison space.  The Government have a duty to respond to that public concern.</P>
    <P>While I would agree with those who deplore any attempt made to sensationalise the level of crime and induce crime panic, as Senator Higgins mentioned, I recognise the legitimacy of the public concern in that area.  It is in no sense inconsistent with the approach that was taken by the committee and in no sense inconsistent with the approach that I have outlined &mdash; that sentences when imposed must be served &mdash; to say that the courts should have available to them the widest possible range of sanctions so that they would be able to impose effective and appropriate penalties.</P>
    <P>In many instances penalties, while effective and appropriate, are alternatives to imprisonment.  The courts have a fairly wide range of sanctions available to them such as probation, monetary penalties and ultimately imprisonment.  The latest addition to that range of sanctions has been community service.  Senator Ellis referred to the desirability of this sanction being available to the courts.  I <Col N="661" /> am not clear from his contribution whether he realises that it is in fact in force.  But if there is any doubt, let me dispel that doubt.  That scheme has proved to be one of the most useful additions to the criminal justice system for a very long time.</P>
    <P>From its consideration of the legislation the House will recall that the scheme provides that an offender, rather than being sent to prison, is sentenced to work in the community.  To that extent it is a real, genuine alternative to imprisonment. It is specifically written into the legislation that it is only to be used where, if it was not available to the court, a sentence of imprisonment would follow. There was a universal welcome for the legislation.</P>
    <P>Senators will be pleased to learn that since the scheme came into operation nine or ten months ago it has proved very successful.  Many of the offenders on the scheme are juveniles.  It is a particularly appropriate scheme for young people. Schooling, for example, need not be interrupted.  The scheme provides an opportunity to come in contact with those who can be genuinely disadvantaged in society and also with caring people who work voluntarily in these areas.  At its best community service can change a young person's outlook, encourage him or her away from crime and at the same time provide benefits, often substantial benefits, to the community.</P>
    <P>It interested and pleased me very much to discover that there have been a number of recorded cases where offenders who were sentenced to undertake a task of community work voluntarily stayed on when the period of work to which they had been sentenced had been completed in order to complete the projects and work with the community group to which they had been assigned.  That of itself indicates the very real merits of a scheme such as that.</P>
    <P>Since the scheme began operating there have been approximately 600 orders made.  That figure, representing a very high level of recourse, demonstrates the willingness of the courts to use new sanctions when they are made available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> From what I have said it will be clear that there will be a positive response to suggested alternatives to imprisonment if they can be judged to be appropriate responses to particular crimes and if it can be shown that they hold out a reasonable prospect of success.</P>
    <P>For the hard-pressed taxpaying community, community services and other alternatives to custody have one enormous advantage over imprisonment and that is cash.  For example, the cost of supervising someone on a community service order is about £20 a week.  The cost of keeping someone in prison for the same period is about £440.  One does not need to be a mathematician to identify the very real benefits to the taxpayer whenever a court has an opportunity to have recourse to this option.</P>
    <P>One of the more disturbing aspects of the Whitaker Report is the committee's estimate of the cost in financial terms if current trends in the growth of the prison population continue.  The committee state that if current trends continue the prison population could reach 4,000 by 1995 and that it would then cost something of the order of £300 million to provide those additional places.  They also estimate that for every 100 fewer new prisoners there will be a saving in capital outlay of £12.7 million and an annual saving of £3.8 million.  Clearly then, it is in our financial interest to develop as much as possible effective alternatives to custodial sentences.  I am not suggesting that financial considerations are the only considerations or even paramount considerations. I am not saying that they have a greater importance than social requirements, such as the maintenance of order or the reverse of that, ensuring that people are not needlessly imprisoned.  But they are there and the financial considerations are clearly significant. The committee placed considerable emphasis on them.</P>
    <P>The difficulty which arises is that it is not at all clear that we will be able to develop sufficient alternatives to custody to contain the growth in the prison population. As against that, as the report highlights so starkly, the cost of providing <Col N="663" /> prison accommodation can be enormous. It is not apparent at this stage how that difficulty can best be resolved.  I mention it only for the purpose of sounding a note of caution.</P>
    <P>There is a fairly widely-held belief, and it found echo in the course of this debate, that there are substantial numbers of people in custody at present who should not be there.  If they could be identified and diverted from the prison system, then much, if not all, of the pressure on prison accommodation could be eased.  There is some merit in that point.  There are a number of indications that the number of such offenders may not be anything like the size that some people suggest.  My reason for saying that is that there are two points to be borne in mind.  First, people serving prison sentences are there because they have been convicted by the courts, sentenced in accordance with the law.  There is no clear evidence to suggest that our courts generally are unduly punitive in imposing prison sentences.  That is obviously an issue on which every Member will form his or her own view.</P>
    <P>Second, and more capable of objective assessment, is the fact that the actual experience of the prison administration in finding suitable offenders for open centres or for early release tends to support the belief that we are now dealing with more hardened criminals.  Consequently, it is not easy to be optimistic that there is substantial scope for reducing the prison population through the introduction of further alternatives to custody. That does not mean that further alternatives are not desirable in themselves, even if they have not got the potential for large reduction in the numbers being committed to prison.  I believe that such alternatives do have intrinsic merit and need to be considered and where possible introduced.  So, it is clear that resolving this difficulty is not going to be easy.  If we can sustain significant decreases in the crime rate, then of course it is a difficulty which will be very substantially reduced. This is not an appropriate time to dwell on the obvious desirability of crime prevention other than to emphasise, as the <Col N="664" /> committee do, the responsibility of the community generally and not just the agencies of the criminal justice system in dealing with the crime problem.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators in the course of their contributions praised the efforts of prison staff and the prison administration in performing difficult jobs on behalf of society.  Obviously, I share those sentiments and I am sure that the House will continue to support the efforts of the prison system to cope with the varied and at times difficult demands that are placed on it.  On that point Senator Ellis expressed concern about allegations that had been made which he thought reflected badly on members of the prison service.  He referred in particular to remarks that had been made by Fr. McVeigh.  I assume what he was referring to was the allegation of strip searching and of ill-treatment.  He suggested that these should be the subject of a denial. The Department already indicated when the allegations were first made that those allegations were completely false.  That type of allegation has been put forward before and has been denied by successive Ministers.  It is not without note that the allegations are frequently made in the aftermath of escape bids or sometimes as part of a campaign for improved conditions, open visits and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins complained that the prison system was bedevilled by secrecy. If that were true then that would be highly regrettable.  All I can speak of with authority is the situation that has obtained in recent years.  In so far as this administration and this Minister for Justice are concerned he has tried to ensure a wide access to the prisons for interested groups.  The House will be aware that during his terms in office, many journalists have visited prisons.  Other bodies, such as the Commission for Justice and Peace, have been facilitated.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has responsibility for the running of prisons, they are run for and on behalf of the community.  It is only right that the community be as fully informed as possible of their operation. This must be seen against the background of the committee's view of the importance <Col N="665" /> of public opinion on the prisons. Naturally, everyone will accept that security considerations have to be taken into account.  But I do not think they have been allowed, nor do I think they should be allowed, to bring about the air of secrecy that was referred to by Senator Higgins.  May I say on that point, on behalf of the Minister, that he would be more than happy to facilitate any Senator who is anxious to see any of the prisons.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins also referred to difficulties in conducting proper research on prisons.  I can assure him that the Minister will look favourably on any research proposals, and I am happy to inform the House, that last Friday the Minister signed a contract for the first phase of computerisation in the prisons. The computerisation project is one of the most sophisticated of its kind in western Europe and should greatly facilitate research into the penal system.  The Department of Justice has already been in touch with the Economic and Social Research Institute with a view to setting up a committee of outside experts to advise on the type of statistical information analysis which the new system could provide for researchers.  I hope that that will go some distance to meeting the type of research facilities that were referred to by the Senator.</P>
    <P>The committee report contains many far-reaching recommendations and in my remarks tonight I have only been able to touch on some of them and to deal with some of the points that have been raised by contributors in the course of this debate.  But I want to assure the House that when the Government come to take their decisions that they will do so in the light of the valuable contributions that have been made here in the Seanad on this motion and against the background of this report, the first report of its kind in 101 years.</P>

      <P>I too, would like to <Col N="666" /> commend the committee which produced this report and to join with those Senators who have supported it during this debate. I must say it has been one of the most impressive reports produced in the social policy area by any committee or group directly on behalf of the Government.  It compares, in my view, with the report of the Task Force on Child Care Services in the quality of its analysis and in the statement of principles which it contains. That task force report was produced in 1979.  I had the privilege to be part of it, although I would not claim much credit for the magnificent results which came from that committee also.</P>
      <P>However, on that note I would like to make the following point of concern. That report, which was produced in 1979, following an interim report on the subject of child care which was produced in 1975, has not been implemented to any significant degree.  I would most strongly urge the Government to act quickly on this report and the recommendations it contains. It does serve a number of very valuable purposes particularly in the context of the very high level of public concern at the increasing crime rate over the last decade or two.  First of all, it makes the point that Ireland is not unique in facing a situation of rising crime.  It is, of course, a phenomenon common to all urbanising societies, and it would tend to suggest that the causes of crime have more to do with complex society changes than with individual decisions made by individual people in isolation to commit crime.  We are, therefore, dealing with a highly complex social issue which is not amenable to the kind of solutions which are frequently put about by those who would demand more penal approaches to what is admittedly a problem of concern to many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee also suggest that we should try to learn, from those societies who experienced rising crime rates before we did because they urbanised before we did, both what are the causes of crime and what remedies are appropriate. Its findings serve as a valuable and realistic bulwark for those of us who are trying to maintain a liberal and objectively <Col N="667" /> correct response to rising crime rates against those whose outrage leads them to demand penal solutions, which not only will not work, but which would make a bad situation even worse by making hardened criminals of those who would not necessarily fall into this category, were appropriate solutions developed.</P>
    <P>The committee rightly point to the fact that, while all crimes cannot be put down to social deprivation or to social conditions which alienate a minority of our community, a great deal of it is attributable to these social phenomena.  It is no accident that most of those who commit crime in our society come from deprived families or deprived neighbourhoods.  In this sense, crime is a response, albeit a misguided and anti-social response, from the economically deprived.  In this sense most crime derives from the class nature of our society rather than from a failure on the part of many of the individuals who actually commit those crimes.  That is not, of course, to say that individuals do not bear responsibility for their actions in many cases, but it is to say that the objective data before us suggests that crime is society based and in particular it is based on the nature of the class structures which pervade our society.</P>
    <P>In a very real sense, therefore, society is subject to the level of crime it deserves; and I am speaking here of crimes against property in particular.  For this reason, it seems, the State has a very serious responsibility in the interest of its own safety and order, to put it at its very least, to break into the class system, break it down and transform it.  This, indeed, is explicitly recognised in the report in paragraph 2.6.  I am disappointed that in the discussion we have had, with the exception of Senators Ryan and Higgins, there has not been any great consideration of the causes of crime, particularly the class nature of those causal factors.  Finally, I would urge that the Government respond as rapidly as they possibly can to the principles set out in this report and to the sense of direction given us in its recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you for allowing another speaker to speak. Indeed, I see Senator McGuinness in the House, who is associated with another group who has studied the prisons.  It is very appropriate and proper to acknowledge on an occasion like this the work of all those groups, the different inter-Church groups and the different Church groups and groups such as, for example, the MacBride Commission and now again the Whitaker Committee which, as so many Senators have said, have contributed to the debate on penal reform.  In concluding, may I thank all the Senators, including the Chair and including the Minister of State, who have contributed to this debate.</P>
      <P>May I just make a couple of points that are very important?  The danger about discussing the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System is that one might tacitly accept the necessity of prison as an institution.  I am not an idealist when I say that when I look back across the history of prison systems there is an almost unanswerable case against prison except for those who are the most serious offenders.  I would say this very carefully.  Probably the best book on the history and origins of the prison system is Michael Ignatieff's book <i>A Just Measure of Pain</i> which correctly locates the origins of the present penal system &mdash; the penitentiary system in the period between 1750 and 1850.  It is very interesting, I am sure, to historians to note the close connection between the origins of the factory system and the origins of the prison system.  In my opening speech moving this motion on behalf of the Labour Party I made the point that both were attempts at control in so far as you would control space and time, in so far as you diminished privacy.  I want to repeat that point: that it is time for those people who believe in humanity to begin looking at the historical moment of the rise of the prison which in western European circumstance is very specific,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present system came into existence at the end of transportation.  Before that, there were arbitrary punishments, mutilation, death and so on.  And the <Col N="669" /> classical period of criminology is one that made, if you like, the crime, the punishment and the procedures certain, but it equally unleashed a view in society that society could somehow or another control itself, make itself survive without problems and reproduce itself only in circumstances where it controlled what is called misdemeanour.</P>
    <P>I would offer people the example of the origins of Bridewells.  The Bridewells were in existence at the end of monastic charity and it was due to the fact that people were wandering the roads, as they were referred in the text at the time, as masterless men with the idea of there being nobody to control them in an ownership way, within the servitude of labour that the Bridewells came into existence.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks, I want to say that this motion does not accept the historical inevitability of prison.  The second <i>caveat</i> I want to make, and I could not make it strongly enough, is the appalling illogicality in the suggestion that the crime rate can in fact be answered by a prison response.  The crime rate is located in the wider society; it is located in the terms of the rate, as I have worn myself out saying, due to different kinds of situational or circumstantial, socio-economic causes in its incidence by a personal decision which is sometimes exercised responsibly and sometimes not so informed.  But the question of crime and the society cannot be answered solely by a prison response and it is only people who are not aware of the literature on causes of crime, incidence of crime and the fluctuations in crime who are looking for a prison response.</P>
    <P>In fact, the reason I am late, a Chathaoirligh, is that I have just been visiting a prison.  I am grateful for the facilities afforded to me to visit that prison.  But I will come back to your own remark about the openness of the present system.  It is still not an open system and I will believe it is open when I see the research that is carried out in the prison system in the same way as in any other <Col N="670" /> area of life.  The research is not there to prove it.</P>
    <P>To move on to the contributions that have been made I would urge Members of the Oireachtas, Senators and Deputies to visit prisons so that they will know what they are talking about and I would particularly invite those people who want to solve the crime rate by sending more people to prison, by having more overcrowding in prison and by building new prisons, to visit the prisons and to speak to prisoners but, rather like Northern Ireland, it is easier to speak about it than to go there and it is easier to speak about prisonisation than it is to go and acquaint yourself with the experience of prison.  I am a little weary of listening to people coming out with these speeches to the effect that it is all a matter of tackling the crime, these people who have created moral panics in this country and who have, I believe, set up an atmosphere in which we cannot thoroughly examine either the crime rate or the experience of prison.</P>
    <P>Are people aware, for example, that in Mountjoy there is available to 160 prisoners one hot water tap, two large plastic containers with two cold taps available to maybe 60 people at the same time?  In my opening speech I noticed some people leaving rather quickly after I had drawn attention to the potting out ceremonies which have been retained in this prison in Ireland, as they have been retained in other prison systems not only because of the difficulty and the economic expenditure required in improving sanitation but because of the ideology of such a destruction of privacy.  Is there anything more demeaning than people with pots with lids queueing to empty them through a grating as they do in a prison in Ireland, with all the fumes and smells and degradation that goes with it? What kind of a society can justify that kind of an experience?  Let the newspapers print that; let the <i>Evening Herald</i> go and print that and the <i>Irish Independent</i> group set up an illiterate kind of panic, putting victims on the front pages to suggest that any kind of incarceration <Col N="671" /> is really too good for the people who commit crime.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion that I am not here to justify any crime that is carried out against anybody and I am not insensitive to the feelings of victims and I am worrying about the growing crime rate but it behoves us, those of us who are sent here to legislate, to draw distinction between two quite separate things, the rising crime rate to which we must address our minds and our responses to the sanctions that we impose and the procedures we use to impose those sanctions and the particular form of sanction that the prison experience is.  The prison experience involves the loss of liberty, loss of freedom to make a decision in relation to your space and your time.  The average prison routine, as I read it out in my opening contribution in moving this motion, is one of 16 hours locked up and I said that it is in all our interests to examine why we have prisons, why we have prisons like those we have.  I am glad to see that the Whitaker report went some way towards making a number of fundamental suggestions.</P>
    <P>Why do we need women's prisons? What, for example, is the justification for them.  There is no point in wheeling out one woman who has been guilty of a crime of violence and saying &ldquo;For this woman alone we need a woman's prison.&rdquo; I worry about only one item in the report &mdash; because I praised the report unreservedly in my opening speech and in response to the speeches that have been made &mdash; and that is the cost that is given for keeping a prisoner in prison.  I would like to think that when we come to develop a critique of the prison system &mdash;and this report of Dr. Whitaker's committee is a very valuable contribution in that regard &mdash; we would not only look at the prisons and reform them for the economic reason that it is simply too costly to have them, but look at the origins of the prison system, why we have it and why we insist on it; what happens the individuals who have the slow form of death through recidivism?  Why, even for the eight hours that they can come out <Col N="672" />&mdash;and you take the training or education period out of that &mdash; and which give perhaps a period of unsupervised recreation in the prison yard, they stay in their cells and do not come out.  As a Legislature what is our function?  Our function, and the test of our humanity, is to look at the most vulnerable sections of the community and ask ourselves the question: &ldquo;What responsibility have we in their regard?&rdquo; It is not our responsibility solely to listen to groups of people who would want us, as I say, to build more and better prisons and so on.</P>
    <P>This report now joins the McBride report; it joins reports like the report from the Council of Churches, the report from within the individual churches, and there have been contributions from both sides of this House.  What is needed now &mdash; and I repeat it &mdash; is a time scale for action.  It is not a matter of putting an administration on the rack; it is not a matter of comparing one administration with another.  What is needed now is to take the modest, strained proposals of the Whitaker Committee, put a time scale on them and say that within two years we will have, in fact, made all of the changes that are made.  But I hope that if we consider doing that and, as the necessary legislative reforms come before this House and the other House, Members of both Houses will have used the intervening time to visit the prisons; to consider the prisons, to talk to prisoners, ask how we come to have them, so that when they make their contributions they will be informed by humanity rather than economics.</P>
    <P>I am asking what kind of a society is it that needs the concept of control.  Is it in fact that we have to dehumanise so many people so as to allay the fears that are lurking within ourselves?  Perhaps it is our own fear we should address, and perhaps it is our inability to address these fears in ourselves and in the structures of our old society that makes us keep these antiquated structures, these barbaric practices &mdash; and it is no condemnation of those who work in them.</P>
    <P>For all of these reasons I thank everyone who has contributed to this debate, <Col N="673" /> including the Minister of State, and I hope that we will hear the time scale I speak of and the reforms being implemented.  I repeat what I have said: what we want is an open approach towards justice in the courts, among offenders, in the prisons and so forth and the test of that will be the public research when legislators can go in without notice at any time to any prison.  That will be an open prison system, not one where you have to arrange elaborately a specified visit so that arrangements can be made in advance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister of State for his attendance here tonight.  I must also acknowledge both his and his Department's commitment to school building in north Kerry. Recently three new extensions to secondary schools have been completed and officially opened by the Minister of State in the area.</P>
      <P>Since the major extensions were added to Saint Michael's College, Listowel and the Presentation Convent, Listowel, Listowel Vocational School now unfortunately finds itself in a disadvantageous position <i>vis á vis</i> the above two schools. The enrolment figure for the 1985-86 school year is considerably lower than that for 1984-85.  The number of students in the school has dropped from 326 to 306.  No doubt the attractive educational environs of the new extensions compared to the damp and rundown condition of the ten pre-fabs in the old vocational school is having an influence on where parents are sending their children to school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I would like to compliment the principal and staff of the vocational school for their dedicated work over the years in providing an excellent education especially in the area of preparatory courses.  The school also runs a very successful pre-employment course <Col N="674" /> with almost a 90 per cent placement last year.  This course has been in progress since 1978 and has found a widespread acceptance and approval from employers in the local community.  There are ten pre-fabs in the school.  Included among the pre-fabs is a science laboratory, a geography room, a library and an exercise room.  Surely a pre-fab is not the ideal accommodation for a science laboratory? These pre-fabs are now almost 15 years old and are in continuous use despite their deterioration.  Efforts have been made to maintain them on a regular basis but they are now falling apart.  Almost 50 per cent of the school's teaching activity takes place in the pre-fabs.  No doubt this is a very difficult environment for teaching and learning to take place.  Both the teachers and the pupils have suffered frequent colds and flus because of the damp conditions, and in saying this I am not exaggerating.  It is commonly accepted locally that this is the case. Some time ago during a visit to north Kerry the Minister for Education saw the conditions of the pre-fabs for herself and I must say was rather appalled and agreed that the pre-fabs should be replaced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Listowel Vocational School provides a wide and comprehensive range of subjects. It provides the only facilities in the area for the teaching of metalwork, woodwork, engineering and building construction.  I do not have to tell the Minister the importance of the above subjects in this area of modern technology. Besides, industry in Listowel requires a highly educated workforce in the engineering and technical areas.  A number of our industries are in the engineering sector and require a workforce with an expertise in fitting, welding and toolmaking.  Industries like Kerry CoOp, Stag Cutlery, Stelrod &mdash; to mention but a few &mdash; are very dependent on the expertise that is being acquired in the vocational school.  Listowel Vocational School is ideally situated to provide this talent and it is imperative that they have every facility to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> Finally, while recognising the enormous expenditure on educational facilities and building in the north Kerry area over the past three years, especially in Listowel town, nevertheless I believe there should be no further delay in the proposed extension to Listowel Vocational School for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are fully aware of the needs of the vocational school in Listowel and I have sanctioned quite a large extension to that school to enable it to cater for an enrolment of 325 pupils.  In addition, reconstruction work to the existing building has been sanctioned.  The planning of the extension has reached developed sketch scheme stage and the present position is that County Kerry Vocational Educational Committee were authorised by my Department on 25 July last to proceed to the next stage, which is the preparation of the working drawings.  This documentation is presently awaited in my Department and when it is received it will be examined as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The question of the provision of permanent accommodation at Listowel Vocational School has been under consideration for some time in the context of the second level educationl needs in the area as a whole.  In this regard a local proposal for the development of a community school for boys in Listowel was rejected at a public meeting in the town in April 1982.  It was following this decision that the development of the vocational school got underway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Architectural planning of the extension was initiated at a meeting in my Department in December 1982.  The proposed extension, which will replace existing unsatisfactory temporary prefabricated building structures, will provide 1,068 square metres of accommodation, comprising a science laboratory, metalwork room, general classrooms, social studies area, commerce typing room, general purpose physical education area and ancillary accommodation. <Col N="676" /> The estimated cost of this extension is £750,000, including building work, fees, furniture and equipment.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve effective monitoring and control in the planning of school building projects, and so contain our building programme within our available resources, and also to meet school building needs at the most economical level possible, well defined procedures must be complied with.  These procedures have been developed in response to the demands for the provision of suitable buildings in accordance with carefully worked out space requirements and cost planning, with the purpose of having school buildings provided as speedily as proper planning allows.  Standards of school design, cost control and effective administration have been set, adherence to which will ensure that the programme of educational building required will provide buildings which will serve their purpose well and represent good value for money.</P>
    <P>I understand the feeling of school authorities and the parents of the children who naturally wish to have the accommodation as soon as possible and who think that, once their application for such accommodation has been approved, it should only be a short time before the children are occupying their places in the new school or extension.  However, it has been the experience in my Department that, in order to ensure that there is no duplication or wastage of resources, no errors made in planning which will lead to costly extras in the constructions phase of the project, we must have effective monitoring and control of every project at pre-contract stage.  The progress of any project depends to a large extent on the speed with which a design team can complete successfully the various stages.</P>
    <P>It is against the background of these criteria and procedures that the progress of any projects must be viewed.  As I said earlier, planning of the Listowel project commenced in December 1982 and an outline sketch scheme was received from the committee in October 1983 and a developed sketch scheme in May 1984. At this stage it became necessary, in <Col N="677" /> accordance with paragraph 5.12 of the Programme for Action in Education, to explore the possibility of rationalisation of facilities in the area.  However, this examination concluded that, having regard to all the circumstances, rationalisation was not a feasible alternative.</P>
    <P>The developed sketch scheme documentation which had been submitted required clarification on a number of technical matters.  These were put to the committee in April last and subsequently an on-site meeting was held in July to resolve the issues.  I repeat that the Department are fully aware of the accommodation conditions at the school.  I assure the Senator that I am only too well aware of the condition of some of our schools, particularly the prefabricated buildings.  I have visited a number of schools and am aware of the conditions under which some of our teachers have to work and children have to be accommodated.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that when the stage four documentation is received in my Department it will be dealt with as expeditiously as possible, as indeed will all the remaining stages of planning.  The Senator is probably more influential with the Kerry County Vocational Educational Committee than I am.  He probably knows the CEO and the members <Col N="678" /> of the VEC.  We are waiting since 24 July for the working drawings which have to be examined to see that they are in accordance with well-defined procedures in school building.  Once these drawings are approved the school will be attended to as quickly as possible.  I do not doubt that the school is in bad condition.  In view of the seriousness of the case made by the Senator, there should not be delay in forwarding the working drawings from the Kerry VEC.  If the Senator would make representations to ensure that they are forwarded to my Department and that they are, as I have already stated, in accordance with the well defined procedures laid down by my Department, the project will be pushed as quickly as possible to the next stage, which is the provision of the bills of quantity.  When it comes to that stage it will have to be again examined in my Department.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the conditions in the school.  There will be no undue delay as far as my Department are concerned in this matter.  If the Senator will use his influence in County Kerry, together we can speed up the provision of Listowel Vocational School.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 December 1985.</P>
