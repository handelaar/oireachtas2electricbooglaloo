      <P>The need to acquire the Christian Brothers Property in Curandulla, County Galway, to enable a reconstructed boys school to be put into immediate service.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business at 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>Can anyone tell us why item No. 3 on yesterday's Order Paper was taken after 8 o'clock yesterday evening, even though the Leader of the House <Col N="1572" /> stated on the Order of Business that if we were close to finishing an item at 8 p.m. that was all that would be taken? Some of us were left quite unaware that item No. 3 was to be taken.  It was taken at 8.10 p.m.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if there was any misunderstanding in regard to yesterday's business.  Senators will appreciate that there was a very long debate on item Nos. 1 and 2.  Indeed, it would have been my wish that the whole time up to 9 p.m. would have been occupied. What was done after discussion, was to agree that item No. 3 would be taken since this could be concluded before 9 o'clock and since the same Minister was involved.  I apologise to Senator Ellis and to any other Senator who may have been discommoded.  It was quite inadvertent and I certainly was not aware that anyone did not know the situation.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment.  Section 2 provides for the insertion of a new Schedule into the Social Welfare (Consulidation) Act, 1981.  Schedule 3 to the Consolidation Act contains the rates of benefit and they are up-dated every year.  When the Bill was circulated in December last, the most recent up-dating had been affected by the Social Welfare Act, 1984.  Since then we have had a further Social Welfare Act, 1985 which inserted a later Schedule.  The amendment now proposed simply makes reference to this later stance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister what is the definition of an &ldquo;adult dependant&rdquo; which is mentioned in the section? Section 199 of the Principal Act defines adult dependant as meaning a person who is wholly or mainly maintained by that person and does not include a person in employment other than employment specified in paragraphs 4, 5 and 10 of Part II of the First Schedule.  As I understand it, employment specified in paragraphs 4, 5 and 10 of the First Schedule of the Principal Act really relates to employment which is incidental or minor and which is so specified under the regulations made by the Minister to be minor.  The Minister is right to exclude that as being significant.  He then goes on: &ldquo;a person who is self-employed&rdquo;.  Do the limitations in paragraphs 4, 5 and 10 of the First Schedule, which relate to incidental employment, also cover people who are self-employed but who are self-employed doing a job which is in itself incidental? This could be read that anybody who is self-employed, no matter how low his or her income, no matter how incidental the work, would not be able to qualify as an adult dependant.  Paragraph 4 says: &ldquo;Employment specified in regulations as being of such a nature that is ordinarily adopted in subsidiary employment only and not as the principal means of livelihood.&rdquo; Paragraph 5 says: &ldquo;Employment specified in regulations as being of inconsiderable extent&rdquo;.  Paragraph 10 refers to a different matter.  Basically, what about a person who is self-employed but is doing a very minor job?  Are such people covered by this?  By reason of the fact that they are self-employed, no matter how minor the employment or incidental the employment, are they taking themselves outside the definition of adult dependency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to say <Col N="1575" /> that this section redefines the concept of adult dependency to provide for equality of treatment for men and women.  It is the key principle in the legislation.  It abolishes the automatic presumption that wives are almost always dependent on their husbands.  Under existing provisions, a married woman is a dependant and her husband receives an increase of benefit for her simply if she is living with him or where they are living apart if she is wholly or mainly maintained by him.</P>
      <P>A married woman can claim an increase for her husband only if he is incapable of self-support by reason of physical or mental infirmity and if wholly or mainly maintained by her.  Under the new definition either spouse will be regarded as a dependant, if he or she is wholly or mainly maintained by his or her spouse.  Such dependency will be deemed not to exist where the spouse is in employment but not part-time employment of a subsidiary nature or of an inconsiderable extent; is self-employed, or is in receipt of benefit in his or her own right.</P>
      <P>A new non-discriminatory financial and economic basis for dependency is being substituted for the existing one which will enable men and women to qualify for increases under similar conditions. The change will mean that married women will be able to claim their husband's dependence in circumstances where they cannot at present.  It will also mean, however, that some married men will lose out as their wives, in employment or on benefit in their own right, will no longer be regarded as dependants. Of the 170,000 married men receiving increases for wives, only about 20,000 would be affected by this change.  Special measures will be introduced to alleviate the effects in many of these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new definition enables the Minister to specify additional persons to be adult dependants, that is in paragraph (c).  It is intended to provide by regulations that persons with earnings of less than about £50 per week will be deemed to be adult dependants.  This will be a permanent feature of the new arrangements. Paragraph (c) would also apply to <Col N="1576" /> the self-employed.  That is the intention, to provide by regulation that persons with earnings of less than approximately £50 per week will be deemed to be adult dependants.  It will be necessary to make separate regulations for each because in both the regulations for insurably employed people and the regulations for self-employed people the principle will be the same &mdash; about £50 per week.  They will be dealt with under separate regulations. I think that answers the Senator's query.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that explanation.  It is very important that we would get it.  A problem would arise, for example, if a woman was doing knitting at home or something of a very minor and incidental nature.  Under the old regime that would not have made any difference but under the new regime it would, except that the Minister has now indicated that the incidental nature of the employment, which is going to be covered by the regulations will extend both to a person who is in employment and a person who is self-employed, if the activity which is being carried on is one of a minor nature.  I think this is a very significant statement by the Minister and one which will protect these incidental bits of work that people do from time to time and not take them outside the range of the social welfare legislation, merely by reason of that.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 4 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 deals with increase of maternity allowance and the rules for that.  Would the Minister like to comment on that?  He is introducing a new part to section 26 of the Principal Act.  Like a lot of these things, to make any sense of them we really have to go back to the Principal Act.  The old section <Col N="1577" /> 26 was quite simple.  It said &ldquo;Subject to this Act, the weekly rate of maternity allowance shall be as set out in column 2 of Part I of the First Schedule&rdquo;.  Now, it is proposed to add an additional portion to that section.  I would like to direct the Minister's attention to subsection (3).  To examine it, we should look at subsection (1) which says: &ldquo;That the amount a weekly benefit shall be that set out in Part I of the Second Schedule&rdquo;.  Subsection (2) says:</P>
      <P>The increase payable pursuant to subsection (1) in respect of a qualified child who normally resides with the beneficiary and with the spouse of the beneficiary shall be payable at rate of one-half of the appropriate amount in any case where the spouse of the beneficiary is not an adult dependant.</P>
      <P>I understand that a married woman who is living with her husband who is working, and who is entitled to maternity allowance, will be entitled to an increase in respect of any dependant child of one half of the amount specified in the Schedule. I want to raise another point with the Minister in regard to subsection (3).  It states:</P>
      <P>The provisions of subsection (2) shall not apply in any case where the spouse of the beneficiary is living apart from the beneficiary and is not making a financial contribution to the maintenance of the qualified child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that we are introducing an increased maternity allowance in respect of a person who is living apart from a spouse.  The provision in subsection (2) is, as I understand it, a reduction to one half of the rate.  It says it shall not apply in any case where the spouse of the beneficiary is living apart from the beneficiary. In other words, where a wife is a deserted wife or a separated wife, she will be in receipt of the full amount specified in the Schedule.  It seems extraordinary that we are going to pay a bigger maternity allowance in respect of people who are separated as compared with people who are living together.  I understand that these are some of the quirks that can arise from <Col N="1578" /> time to time.  It strikes me as rather odd. If my interpretation of the proposed legislation is correct, a person who is living apart from her husband will receive in respect of a dependent twice the increase, that is, twice the additional amount in respect of that child as compared with a person who happens at that time to be living with her spouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the payment of dependent child increases to recipients of maternity allowance.  As the House is aware, the directive itself does not apply to maternity schemes but, because of possible anomalies that might arise, the section was put in.  Under existing provisions, increases are not paid in respect of dependent children with maternity allowances.  The provision is now being made because women who will receive child dependant increases, with disability or unemployment benefit, under the equal treatment arrangement would suffer losses if they moved on to maternity allowance.  The rates of child dependant increases are the same as the rates payable for disability benefit and unemployment benefit.  Subsection (2) provides that the child dependant increases shall be payable at 50 per cent of the full rate where the husband is not an adult dependant, that is where he is in the labour force or he is on benefit in his own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, as in the case of section 4, because of the way the legislation is drafted it is necessary to provide that the halving arrangements do not apply, the full increases being payable where the husband is living apart and not contributing financially to the support of the children. About 2,000 women will benefit from the provisions at an annual cost of £0.8 million.  I have explained that section 5 is not required by the terms of the directive but is being included because women who are on unemployment benefit or disability benefit prior to the maternity benefit claim would, under this legislation, be receiving 50 per cent of child allowances.  Of course, if this section was not put in they would suffer the loss of the child allowances when <Col N="1579" /> they would go on maternity benefit.  The section enables them to continue to a great extent on the same level of benefit, with the same level of entitlements as far as dependants are concerned.</P>
    <P>If they are in a situation where their circumstances permit them to have the full child dependency rates then, of course, they continue to have those also when they go on maternity benefit.  That is simply what the section is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point the Minister is making and I agree with it.  Am I right in saying that there will be the differential between the person who is living with their spouse and the person who is not living with their spouse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a differential in any event if under unemployment benefit or disability benefit the spouse &mdash; a wife in this case &mdash; is living apart and not getting any financial assistance from the husband, is totally on her own and the children are totally dependant on her income, be it social welfare or whatever. In that case she would get the full amount of the child dependant's allowances, as she was getting under her claim for UB or DB.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This section was discussed at length in the other House, and rightly so because it seems very wrong that two unmarried people could receive more by way of benefit than a married couple.  It is unfair and I would argue that there is an element of discrimination, perhaps not on the grounds of sex, but it is a discrimination that must be acknowledged.  I would have thought that that would not be <Col N="1581" /> allowed happen.  I know the Minister has given a great deal of thought to this and has indicated that the constitutionality question had been examined and legal advice sought.  Nonetheless, it seems to me, according to ordinary basic rights, that it is a wrong provision to have in any legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time I have heard this kind of moralising. One gets rather tired of this.  The question of benefit from the State cannot be related to the moral or immoral behaviour of any person or individual.  The question of married or unmarried people living together has nothing to do with State benefit.  It should not have anything to do with it.  The way they live is a matter for themselves.  They must make the decision to live whatever way they like and the State benefit cannot and should not come into it.  One could nearly argue that it is a human right if they want to live in sin.  Again, I repeat, it is a matter for themselves.  Let me make an observation in general terms.  In the European context more emphasis must be placed on anti-discriminatory laws.  That is what this Bill is about.  This State has been directed to cure the anomalies inside this legislation to meet the criteria laid down by the European standards of anti-discriminatory law.  That is what should be emphasised, not the question of two people living in sin.  All the moralists all over the country would cut their benefits because they are living immorally.  Such rubbish.  It is a human right if they want to live like that.  I will contest any TD or Senator publicly who dares involve himself or herself in such matters as relating State benefit to moral behaviour in this or any country in the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me make two more observations about anti-discriminatory legislation. Again, the European context outlaws all discriminatory practices.  Recently there was a court decision given against the Belgian Government.  The State had denied what we call national assistance in the North and what we call unemployment <Col N="1582" /> assistance here, that is no contributory benefits were coming so that State had to step in with this bedrock thing, no one shall be in need &mdash; the phraseology as used by the Labour Party.  An English couple who went to Belgium had a residential qualification &mdash; I think it was six months &mdash; and the courts in Strasbourg ruled the law invalid.  That is how important it is.  It meant that the Belgian Government were actually discriminating against a person from another member state.  I will give the House another example of discrimination on the moral plane as has been put forward twice here.  I was chairman of the National Assistance Board in Northern Ireland when it was first introduced and I continued in that post for a long time.  Some of the very respectable puritans from a town called Ballymena did not like the idea of a prostitute with nine children &mdash; she was not very professional &mdash; getting income under the national assistance legislation.  They did not like that and did their best, under my chairmanship, to starve that woman and her nine children, that is, cut off the benefits.  We have the same kind of thing rearing its ugly head in the Republic and I will fight it.  I did not allow that kind of thing to happen unless it was proved to my satisfaction that she was getting other income. Eventually they did this.  She was getting payment in kind.  They actually tried to get her put out of a caravan but they could not because a caravan is not a house and the legislation did not cover caravans. That is how far they went.  They tried to cut off the money from the whole family first and then the money was cut off from her.  They tried to cut off the money for the nine children.  That is discrimination.  In a wider context this is what we should be talking about.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the very fine job that has been done to remove the anomalies in our legislation, the emphasis must be on discrimination.  We are too fond of talking about the religious discrimination that was practised and is still practised in the North of Ireland.  There is very fine machinery there.  In a European context religious discrimination is practised by <Col N="1583" /> sectarians whether they be Catholic or Protestant.  There are Catholic sectarians in the North.  There is no mistake about that.  They have fitted themselves into the jigsaw there very well, especially in the professional classes.  They will not rock the boat.  We all know that.</P>
    <P>There is a very fine mechanism in the North called the Fair Employment Agency.  I can rightly claim that it is a very fine piece of machinery because I monitored that legislation when I was Ombudsman.  I was <i>ex officio</i> a member of the Human Rights Advisory Commission.  We monitored the legislation and advised the Secretary of State accordingly.  The Fair Employment Agency must be made stronger.  I am still talking in the discriminatory field because that is what this legislation is doing.  It is meeting the position inside an anti-discriminatory context, in a European context.  The Fair Employment Agency must be made stronger, if that is possible. The British as members of the European Community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 13 goes far beyond the actual change in seeking to eliminate the discriminatory aspect of our social welfare legislation because &mdash; now that the Second Stage speech is over &mdash; it re-enacts the whole method of calculation of means in respect of all the means-related benefits under the Social Welfare Act.  It is true to say that it is a completely new regime.  It may well be that it is re-enacting what was there before but there are differences.  As we are re-enacting <Col N="1584" /> the whole question of the calculation of means, there is one matter which I should like to bring to the Minister's attention which has come to me as a problem, that is the definition of what is now going to be section 146 (1) being inserted by section 13 of this Bill.  It refers to the actual way in which one should calculate the yearly value, ascertained in the prescribed manner, of all property &ldquo;belonging to him or to his spouse...which is invested or otherwise put to profitable use or is capable of being, but is not, invested or put to profitable use.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The problem that has arisen there is in relation to people who have fallen on hard times and who own substantial pieces of property.  There are two circumstances where the problem can arise.  One is where the property is not actually lettable in the present economic climate even though in theory it is lettable.  As a result of that, people are being disqualified for means-tested benefits of one kind or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other problem, which is probably even more prevalent, is that many people who find themselves in financial difficulty have substantial properties which are mortgaged to financial institutions and from which they are getting no net benefit in a year.  The way the section is drafted means that the gross value of the income rather than the gross value of the income net of any payment which the person may make in respect of the property with the financial institutions, combines to bring about a situation where a person who is penniless and is in receipt of no income is in receipt of a theoretical income by the operation of this section. The Minister will be making regulations under this section.  He talked about the yearly value ascertained in the prescribed manner and presumably there will be a new prescribed manner because it is a new section.  Will he take into account what I have said and see whether adjustments can be made which will take into account the very real hardships which are being encountered by people who, though they are theoretical owners of property, have it mortgaged with financial institutions and are, therefore, in <Col N="1585" /> receipt of no net income but are disqualified from any means-related benefit?</P>

      <P>The points raised by the Senator are not relevant to this Bill but that does not mean that what he said cannot be looked at.  It cannot be looked at in the context of this Bill because section 13 makes little change.  It only adds the words &ldquo;or his or her spouse&rdquo;. The section provides for amendments to section 146 of the 1981 Consolidation Act which deals with the calculation of means for unemployment assistance purposes. Under existing provisions the husband can only apply and any earnings of his wife are taken into account under the heading of the actual or estimated amount of any income he may reasonably expect to receive as head of the household. Under equal treatment both spouses will be entitled to apply for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;head of household&rdquo; is felt to be incompatable with the concept of equal treatment.  At the same time, unemployment assistance being a means tested, family type scheme there is no reason, in principle, not to take the income of the applicant spouse into account.  This is a feature of all means tested schemes.  We are not dealing with the means tested schemes as such today. We are dealing with the various necessary changes in the legislation to cover the equal treatment provisions.</P>

      <P>It may well be that the main purpose of the legislation is to do precisely what the Minister says, but the reality is that we are re-enacting &mdash; we are not just inserting &mdash; a complete section which deals with all means related and means testing.  We are putting in a section which will cover means related benefits and means tested benefits, not only in respect of the anti-discriminatory aspect of it, but the whole thing.  It may well be that the vast majority of what the Minister has said is already law, but we are re-enacting it.  The Minister is not <Col N="1586" /> inserting words.  He is actually re-enacting a complete section.  We are reinforcing the concepts that are already there. It is reasonable that the Minister should have a look at at the problem I am raising. I was careful to examine the position and to make sure that it was properly within section 13 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I am quite confident it is, because we are re-enacting the complete method of calculating means.  We may not be changing it but we are re-enacting it.  As such, it is proper to have a problem raised if there is a problem.  I would appreciate very much if, in looking at the matter, the Minister would give us an indication that he would at least consider the points I have raised.</P>

If we were to look at each section in the context that it is suggested we should look at section 13, we would take a long time to get through the important provisions and urgent provisions in relation to equal treatment.  I am not disagreeing with the points raised by the Senator.  What I am saying is that they are more appropriate to a different time and we can have a look at them at that time.</P>

I am not asking the Minister to change the Bill or to come back on Report Stage, but this is the time to raise them.  We are enacting legislation which, because of the way it is drafted, goes far outside the narrow provisions which the Minister has set.  I am not asking for any commitment from the Minister to change this legislation.  I am merely saying that, in pursuance of the insertion of a new section for section 146 in the Principal Act, the Minister would obviously have to consider whether the present regulations are adequate to cover it because of the changes which he agrees are being made.  In doing so, all I am asking him to <Col N="1587" /> do at that stage is to consider at that time the points I made.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 14, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14. &mdash; It shall be an offence under this Act for an investigating officer to ask discriminatory questions of a woman who is being investigated consequent on the repeal of section 136 (3) (d) of the Principal Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I believe that the very nature of this legislation warrants, in some way or another, an amendment and considerable discussion even on Committee Stage.  I accept that the Minister in his Second Stage speech gave us a very detailed examination of this whole area.  It may not be just sufficient to have appropriate guidelines available.  Any attempt to make this aspect of the legislation stronger should, and would, be welcome.  We all know that child care responsibility is just one of the very many aspects or factors in dealing with claims.  The very fact that a married woman would arrive with one or two children straight away might lead to a natural or logical conclusion where a deciding officer would wonder who would look after the children or is she really out looking for extra work and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this day and age, the fact that there are so many ways of making arrangements for child care responsibilities and for domestic responsibilities generally, in itself is not placing any restriction on people out seeking work.  Nonetheless, there is a possibility of questions being asked which might be regarded in some way as discriminatory.  We should give assurances that that will not happen.  I am not suggesting that we even put this to a vote, but it is no harm that we raise it again to emphasise the fact that the very guidelines may not be sufficient and that deciding officers should be fully aware of the whole discriminatory nature <Col N="1588" /> of this legislation and that they would treat cases with human dignity, as we all hope they would.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment tabled by Senator Fallon would have it as an offence for investigating officers to put discriminatory questions to married women.  The amendment raises a number of issues.  First, it is clearly unthinkable that a deciding officer, who could be a relatively junior member of the staff, could be put in the position of committing an offence if in a particular case he asked in all innocence what seemed to him to be a harmless question, but which by some standard could be deemed discriminatory. The legal adviser was consulted in this matter and he considered it altogether too vague to have any particular line of questioning deemed an offence.</P>
      <P>The amendment contains no definition of the concept of discriminatory questioning. It is not worded in a way which expresses and confers a clear and specific right as to how prosecutions for committing such an indefinite offence could be taken.  The amendment does not set out at all what action should or could be taken if an offence is thought to have been committed.  The penalties provisions in our existing legislation could not apply and new provisions would be needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It needs to be emphasised also that under the equal treatment provisions, legislative and administrative being implemented, all persons, male and female, in similar circumstances will be asked the same questions.  As between similar type applicants no discrimination will occur.  A clear undertaking has been given that guidelines to that effect will be issued to deciding officers.  I dealt extensively with his point in my Second Stage speech yesterday.  I said that in order to ensure that the controls are applied without any hint of administrative discrimination against women applicants the Minister stated clearly in the Lower House &mdash; and I repeated it here yesterday &mdash; and also to groups who made representations to him that he will be taking the necessary steps to ensure that in the <Col N="1589" /> future all conditions relating to entitlement to unemployment benefit and all inquiries made in connection with these conditions are applied impartially as to sex.  New guidelines will be prepared for the staff administering the unemployment benefit schemes explaining clearly the requirements of the EC directive.  No discrimination, either in laws or administrative provisions, is permissible.  In applying availability for one criterion there must be no discrimination on the basis of sex directly or by reference to marital status in questions asked or conclusions drawn.  In general, the guidelines will specify that questioning about child care arrangements should only arise when it is directly relevant to the claimant's availability.  In many cases there will be no need to question the statement which must be answered by all claimants on the relevant form.  Men and women will be treated equally in this regard.</P>
    <P>Staff will be asked to exercise special care and consideration in asking any questions in this regard and monitoring arrangements will be put in place to ensure that direct or indirect discrimination does not occur.  This is as far as we could go.  The Senator should realise that in my Second Stage speech yesterday and what I have repeated today sufficient assurance is included so that every care may be taken to ensure that nobody will depart from the guidelines that are being set down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words arising out of the Minister's reply to this.  He has given the undertaking of guidelines and he has talked of monitoring.  I would like the Minister to give a further assurance that this monitoring would be a thorough monitoring.  The Minister, by mentioning monitoring, indicates that the mere issuing of guidelines is not enough.  There must be a follow-up to ensure that these guidelines are being properly operated.  He said earlier that it would be possible for someone to ask a discriminatory question out of ignorance in this regard.  We must all appreciate that we have a very great distance <Col N="1590" /> to go in this country before all members of my sex fully appreciate how circumstances which appear to them not to contain an element of discrimination can in fact, objectively be discriminatory and can, subjectively, be extremely disturbing to an applicant.  So the mere imposition of guidelines such as the Minister has indicated would certainly not be sufficient.</P>
      <P>I do not think that to talk of guidelines at all is an adequate answer to the concerns expressed by Senator Fallon.  It is when the Minister goes on to talk of monitoring that he is beginning to come to grips with the situation.  If that monitoring were to be an occasional and a light monitoring, I do not think it would be adequate to deal with the problem that could arise.  I would ask the Minister to assure us that this monitoring will be thorough and consistent and will not be merely occassional and in cases where there are, as a result of monitoring, repeated breaches of the guidelines, disciplinary action will be taken to officers who are guilty of such repeated offences against the guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, could I get an assurance from the Minister that in regard to the guidelines that will issue dealing specifically with child-care responsibilities, such guidelines would be totally relevant to the claimant's availability to work in that area only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a comment on the amendment in so far as it relates to trying to ensure that no discriminatory questions are asked of a woman.  The fact that the amendment is not well drafted is irrelevant.  Senator Fallon in proposing the amendment made it quite clear that he was not really interested in the wording of the amendment but was anxious to get a concept across to the Minister, which is a concept we would all support.  To spend too much time worrying about how it is drafted is not really solving the problem.  There is a very serious problem here, because the theoretical and objective standards which we would expect in legislation and their <Col N="1591" /> application on the ground are very difficult things to actually reconcile.</P>
      <P>The Minister struck a very positive and correct note in his Second Stage speech. He outlined the fact that availability for work is for the moment an essential part of our social welfare code.  One of the factors which might affect that is child-minding activities of one spouse or another.  That is reasonable.  If you were to do anything else the reality is that every woman in Ireland would be in receipt of unemployment assistance.  That is the reality.</P>
      <P>If you were to say that child-minding <i>per se</i> was not to be taken into consideration, we would set up a system where every woman in the country would get unemployment assistance.  There is nothing terribly wrong with that either, except that it reduces the amount of money which is available.  There is a limited amount of money available and, therefore, the rate which you would be paid would be reduced or else taxation would increase.  Because there is a limit to taxation, the level of social welfare benefits in general would decrease.  What we are trying to do, surely, is to direct our social welfare assistance to areas where it will have the maximum benefit and where it is needed to the maximum extent.</P>
      <P>The Minister is faced with a very difficult job in trying to reconcile these two points.  The attitude which the Minister portrayed in his Second Stage speech strikes the right balance.  I support what Senator Dooge has said that in monitoring that, particularly in the early years, it would be very important that the Minister should have an active monitoring procedure. The pattern that will be established in the first few years will tend to repeat itself.  If that pattern is non-discriminatory, the matter will be correct for all time.  If on the other hand, it is done in a discriminatory fashion, then we will have a continuing problem in this area.  I certainly support the views behind the amendment moved by Senator Fallon.  It is a valuable contribution to the debate on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, we have gone as far as we can go in relation to this matter.  The next step would be to establish an additional legal basis for banning discriminatory questions.  On this question of having such an illegal basis, the legal advisor has advised that it would be inapprorpriate to reinforce in our statutes what will, in effect, be the law already. It should be remembered that, on the enactment of this Bill, the directives will formally be part of Irish law.  Under Article 5, States are obliged to abolish all discriminatory practices.  Whether that refers to questions or statements or anything else, all discriminatory practices have to be abolished.  This, of course, we will be doing.  Under Article 5, machinery must exist to enable persons who consider themselves wronged by failure to apply the principle of equal treatment to pursue their claim by judicial process.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General advised in 1980 that the existing practices, that is, the appeals machinery etc., comply with the directive in this regard.  The practice under the law is, therefore, that any persons who feel that they are not getting equal treatment in accordance with the directives have a legal basis for pursuing the complaint.  To try to reinforce the existing legal basis would, as the legal advisor advises, only complicate the matter by adding a new and ill-defined statement of rights to the clear statement already contained in the directive itself. In the final analysis what the amendment seems to want is to debar the asking of any questions about an applicant's child minding arrangements.  As Senator O'Leary has stated &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; there is simply no way we could dispense with the power for deciding officers to ask whatever questions are necessary.  This must, of course, be on a non-discriminatory basis, because deciding officers will have to satisfy themselves that applicants are available for work. In the Second Stage debate a number of other Senators, including Senator McGuinness, accepted the legitimacy of asking questions about child minding where such questions are relevant to a person's availability for work.</P>

      <P>This section enables the Minister to make special arrangements for the purpose of continuing rights.  It is proposed to make regulations under the section providing transitional alleviating measures for cases where both spouses are on benefit when equal treatment is introduced.  In such cases the husband would normally be receiving an adult dependant's increase in respect of his wife even though she is on benefit in her own right.  The social welfare system is, therefore, paying on the double for that person.  This will be changed by the equal treatment provisions and henceforth a spouse on benefit will not be deemed an adult dependant.  There are about 8,000 cases where a husband receives an adult dependant's increase for his wife who is on benefit.  He would stand to lose this increase of about £25.60 while the wife would gain £4.80.  There is a net family loss of about £20 per week.  It is proposed to pay the husband £10 per week, which is half the loss, for one year or the duration of the claim, whichever is the less, to cushion the effect of equal treatment.</P>

As the Minister has said, it is a feature of every Social Welfare Act and Social Welfare Acts are frequent.  I would ask him to make at least one small change in the next Social Welfare Bill.  In fact, what we are doing here is adding, as it were, a sixth stage to the present five stages of consideration of legislation.  It is, in fact almost a further Report Stage.  I would suggest to the Minister that it would be more appropriate, in bringing such a regulation before the Houses of the Oireachtas, it should be a positive regulation rather than a negative one.  In other words, rather than bringing forward an order which is subject to annulment by the Houses of the Oireachtas, it should be brought forward in future legislation on the basis of an order which requires the positive assent of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that and the use of the word &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; one difficulty which administrators, lawyers and <Col N="1596" /> people in public life have in understanding the code and this Bill is that there are now so many separate pieces of legislation in existence and that the consolidating Act has been amended now in so many respects.  Could I suggest to the Minister that, for the ease of all who have to find their way along the social welfare road in terms of helping people to understand the code, he should direct his Department with the assistance of the Government Publications Office to produce annually the entire code, the consolidating Act as amended in one volume.</P>
      <P>I understand that this was done in relation to the income tax code.  It is done in relation to other complex codes.  It would make the entire corpus of social welfare law much easier to follow and understand for those who have to have recourse to it.  I say this not merely from the viewpoint of a public representative but also from the point of view of those trying to administer the system.  We all frequently come across people employed by the Minister's Department at local level who have great difficulty in finding a particular provision because the Social Welfare Act, 1981, has been amended in so many respects.  This is something which could be done on a bi-annual basis as this is the Social Welfare (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1984.  I make this as a practical suggestion to make the entire social welfare code more easily available to those who have to use it.</P>

      <P>Because of the very nature of the social welfare enactments which change every year, &mdash; the rates of benefit and other changes, &mdash; the Department would require a substantial increase in resources to have a consolidation Act every year.  Every effort is being made to have a further consolidation Act as quickly as possible.  The last was in the period of 1981-1982.  Meanwhile, I would like to say that the Department make every effort to get as much imformation as possible to claimants in a reasonable and clear way.

I would join with Senator Durcan in urging a new consolidation Act.  I would not go as far as say Senator Durcan and say we should have it every year.  The Minister has a good opportunity to do this.  The last consolidation Act was in 1981.  Why not 1986 and why not at five year intervals? It is easy to count.  I would suggest that if the Department could give us every five years a consolidation of the social welfare code, the people who are concerned with it &mdash; legislators, practitioners of the law, advisers and social services &mdash; would benefit greatly.  It might mean savings for the Minister's own Department, because nobody has to be more familiar with the provisions than the staff of his own Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister and perhaps Senator Dooge as well may be missing the essential thrust of what Senator Durcan was saying.  When the Finance Acts are presented to the House every year there are usually amendments to a basic piece of legislation such as the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Everything that has been published over the years in draft since the time of consolidation is provided in loose leaf form by the Department.  Every year a loose leaf insert is published and therefore, one has not an official consolidation but a loose leaf binder in respect of all the Income Tax Acts and VAT Acts.  It is a tremendous benefit to anybody who has to look up the law in that area whether they are doing it on a professional basis or to advise people politically.  If the loose leaf system were adopted by the Department <Col N="1598" /> it would get over the problem &mdash; obviously you cannot have consolidation every year.  In addition to that you can have consolidation from time to time as suggested by Senator Dooge, but the loose leaf system which is used for the Finance Acts is entirely suitable for the Social Welfare Acts also because they come as frequently as the Finance Acts. There would be quite a sale for those. They would represent almost a self-financing exercise once the initial investment was made.</P>

I belive there is a professional firm called Professional Books which at the moment is bringing out a complete set of Irish statutes in updated form and an amendment to every basic Act will be contained within that Act with a notation on the amendment.  This could be done so far as the social welfare code is concerned by the production annually or biannually, or however frequently we have social welfare legislation, in loose leaf from to ensure that the entire code is available in one volume.  That would be in ease of the Minister's Department, in ease of all administrators and of legislators and lawyers.</P>

      <P>CIE as an organisation are undergoing change in response to the <Col N="1600" /> transport and economic environments of today.  The changes are influenced by the organisation's past &mdash; 1982 was the 13th year of losses escalating by a multiple of the rate of inflation &mdash; demand for CIE services and the need for a more dynamic organisation so as to compete effectively in the transport market.  There is also the need to take account of the CIE social role.</P>
      <P>When I came to office, my first priority for CIE was to create a new environment for CIE to operate within.  A new five-year approach to ClE's finances had been decided on within six months of my arrival.  The abandonment of the wishful thinking, the lack of control and the drift, which characterised Government's relationship with CIE for many years past, became a must.</P>
      <P>The first set of changes was introduced in June 1983.  This consisted of a package of measures covering a five-year period aimed at reducing CIE cost to the Exchequer and improving the organisation's performance.  This package included new arrangements for determining the CIE subvention, which is now limited to the lesser of either half of the board's revenue or to one-third of their expenditure.  For the first time ever payment of the subvention &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; was introduced in recognition of the provision by CIE of certain unprofitable but socially desirable services.</P>
      <P>Once that package of measures was in place to take account of pressing short and medium term issues, there was an immediate need to look at CIE and their role for the longer term.  Most of 1984 was taken up with that issue so as to build on the foundation laid in mid-1983. Conclusions on the longer term future of CIE, in the context of the McKinsey Report on CIE and other reports on the transport sector, were overdue.  The Government initiated a fresh start for CIE in <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Government subvention formula effectively provided that one-third of ClE's expenditure would be paid by the Government provided that expenditure is reduced in real terms by 2½ per cent per annum up to 1988.  This was <Col N="1601" /> extended to 1989 in the context of the national plan.  That these targets have been met so far, and without massive redundancies or cuts in service, is testimony to the wisdom of the approach. Now CIE know well in advance what their allocation is and can plan to keep within it.</P>
    <P>Previously, a figure &mdash; often bearing no relation to reality &mdash; would be notified to CIE two or three weeks before the commencement of the relevant financial year.  This lack of notice and lack of reality were constantly rewarded, not surprisingly, by being ignored.  As a result ClE's finances had rocketed almost out of control.  The deficit for 1982 was in excess of £109 million.  This contrasts badly with about £15 million, which would have been the deficit had it been kept in line with inflation over the previous 15 years.</P>
    <P>The improvement now is perceptible and real.  The years 1983 and 1984 have brought a 20 per cent reduction in real terms in the CIE deficit.  This is good news, not alone for the board, management and workforce of CIE, but also for the taxpayer who has to fund them.  While there is no room for complacency, I think it right that these achievements should be recognised and I want to congratulate again all in CIE for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The financial provisions have been accompanied by a major overhaul and strengthening of the board of CIE.  The introduction of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill and the Road Transport Bill are further steps in the creation of the new environment which I have set out to establish.</P>
    <P>The Bill to reorganise CIE into three operating subsidiaries under a parent board is in preparation.  I had hoped to have it before the House at this stage. That was not realised but it will be enacted as soon as possible and, in any event, before the end of this year.  The whole purpose of the reorganisation is not to close CIE, as some pessimists fear, but to ensure their future by organising them in a way best suited to serve the customer, whose support is vital to any company's success.  The completion of <Col N="1602" /> the reorganisation is in the best interests of the workforce and the travelling public alike.</P>
    <P>All in CIE make their contribution not only to CIE services but also to the financial results.  They have a major role in ensuring that recent encouraging trends in the CIE performance are consolidated and developed.</P>
    <P>So far in 1985, the CIE financial performance is on target for a further reduction in the deficit in real terms.  This with a deficit of £104 million for 1983 and an expected deficit of under £105 million in 1984, on the basis of excluding the special provision for capital interest charges on the DART system, represents a dramatic improvement after the trend of the previous 15 years.  Inflation has been down to low single figures over the past few years and CIE are still beating it &mdash; a cause for much encouragement.</P>
    <P>The decisions taken so far by the Government and the financial provisions made in relation to CIE were fundamental for creating a better operational environment for the organisation. Change in the environment is on-going. There is, however, no room for complacency. ClE's future must be one of efficiency and effectiveness with due regard to what the Exchequer can afford to bear. The measures which have been taken and are planned are in the longer term interest of CIE and their employees.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is of significance for CIE's operations and capital programme.  It is another constructive development in the creation of an improved operating environment for CIE.</P>
    <P>The purposes of the Bill are, first, to enable CIE to convert £30 million of the board's temporary borrowings into a loan repayment over a period of ten years with the Exchequer providing £3 million annually for repayment of the principal of the loan and, secondly, to increase the statutory limits on ClE's capital borrowing power from £230 million to £250 million and the corresponding guarantee powers of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 of the Transport Act, 1983, CIE may incur with my consent <Col N="1603" /> and that of the Minister for Finance, temporary borrowings of up to £40 million. This borrowing power would normally be used by CIE to respond to short term cash shortfalls, to meet unforeseen payments and for normal overdraft purposes.</P>
    <P>Between 1979 and 1983 the borrowing facility has been used, with Government approval, mainly to finance the difference between total CIE subvention and deficit, where the total subvention, made available was insufficient to meet the board's deficit on subventible activities. Since 1979 there was considerable expansion in the size of the shortfalls which led to the revision of the statutory limit from £5 million to £20 million in 1981 and to £40 million in 1983.  At 31 December 1983 CIE had approval for temporary borrowings up to a limit of £36.245 million. ClE's temporary borrowings have remained at that limit in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The shortfalls which arose in the period 1979-83 resulted from an assortment of reasons, for example, under-estimation by CIE, increased costs, including labour and oil charges, industrial disputes and fall-off in traffic.  Other significant factors were delays in sanctioning increases in fares and rates and subvention provisions, which were not realistically related to CIE estimates of the board's requirements. Decisions to bring the deficits closer to the subvention limit set were unacceptable because they would have involved extensive cuts in jobs and services. Inadequate levels of subvention meant that the CIE financial objectives were unattainable and led to Government approval for financing shortfalls by temporary borrowing.</P>
    <P>When I became the Minister responsible for CIE the subvention for CIE for 1983 had been already fixed at £86 million. In the review which took place immediately after the Government came into office it was clear that there was no possibility of increasing the subvention beyond that level, even though it was recognised that the board's deficit would exceed the subvention.  In the circumstances the only real alternative was to let CIE carry the shortfall of almost £16 <Col N="1604" /> million in 1983 by temporary borrowing. This was the cause of the increase in the statutory limit in the Transport Act, 1983.</P>
    <P>Interest charges paid on the temporary borrowings, which fall to be met by the board out of their revenues, in the period 1979-84 amounted to almost £13 million. In 1984 alone the interest charges amounted to about £4.5 million.  It was clear to me from the beginning that the interest charges on the temporary borrowings were a considerable burden on CIE.  I felt that the board should not have to bear the handicap of interest and repayment costs, arising in the main from the failure of Government either to provide in the past adequate levels of subvention over a number of years or to take decisions which would have enabled CIE to move significantly closer to the direction pointed by the subvention limits fixed.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the costs of temporary borrowings are high because of the levels of interest demanded for short term loans and the associated roll-over costs.  Additionally, the hard core nature of the debt was becoming a source of concern.  I came to the conclusion that a substantial reduction at an early date of the principal sum outstanding was essential and saw an urgent need to relieve CIE of the bulk of the burden as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In planning for ClE's future the Government decided to reduce the board's temporary borrowing by £30 million by re-scheduling £30 million of the £36.245 million borrowings into a ten year loan.  The enactment of the relevant provision of the Bill is necessary so that CIE can raise a loan of £30 million repayable over a ten year period in equal annual instalments, financed by the Exchequer.  The board will continue to be responsible for the interest charges on the loan as well as the balance, that is £6,245 million of the temporary borrowings, but the charges will decrease annually in line with the repayment of the principal.  It is the board's responsibility to eliminate the balance of the temporary borrowings from their own resources. The existing statutory limit of £40 million <Col N="1605" /> for temporary borrowings is being retained.</P>
    <P>The treatment of CIE temporary borrowings in this way will make a useful contribution to the regularisation of the finances of CIE by relieving the board over a period of years of substantial borrowings as well as easing the total CIE interest burden.</P>
    <P>To complete the information on temporary borrowings, CIE will need to increase their temporary borrowings by £8 million later this year and by a further £8 million in 1986.  This increase of £16 million was foreseen when the subvention allocations for 1985, 1986 and 1987 were being fixed.  This will arise from the Government's acceptance of responsibility for the interest charges in respect of the capital investment in the electrification of the Howth-Bray line.  These charges will amount to £16 million in each of the three years 1985-87.  Because of the difficult financial situation it was possible to provide no more than £8 million in each of the years 1985 and 1986, but the shortfall in subvention of £16 million will be made good in 1987, when CIE will be paid £32 million in respect of the interest charges.  These necessary additional temporary borrowings will be for a very limited period.</P>
    <P>ClE's capital expenditure is financed from the board's internal resources, mainly depreciation provisions, borrowings, leasing arrangements and Exchequer capital advances.  The borrowing arrangements require my approval and that of the Minister for Finance, who has power to guarantee them.  ClE's total capital borrowings at 31 December 1984, amounted to £216.373 million.  CIE need to borrow £15.416 million for capital purposes in 1985 so that by 31 December 1985, the board's capital borrowings are expected to amount to £231.789 million. As the statutory limit on capital borrowings is £230 million, it is necessary to increase that limit and I am now proposing an increase of £20 million to give a new limit of £250 million, which will be adequate to cater for the board's anticipated <Col N="1606" /> borrowings for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The board's original capital allocation for 1985 was fixed at £30 million and it had been expected that the existing statutory borrowing limit would have been adequate for the borrowing requirement involved in financing the CIE capital programme.  However, in an effort to ensure continuity of employment at the GAC bus building plant at Shannon, the Government decided to reschedule the CIE capital allocation for bus building in the period covered by the national plan. As a result, £10 million from the 1987 allocation for bus building is being brought forward to 1985.  This brings the total CIE allocation for capital purposes for 1985 to £40 million.  This change created the need for increasing the board's statutory borrowing limit for capital purposes at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Government, in recognition of this decision placing an additional financial burden on the board, decided that the extra financial charges arising should be recouped to CIE.  As a result £0.5 million will be paid to the board in 1985.  A similar arrangement will apply for 1986 in respect of the increased borrowing.</P>
    <P>The Government have made provision for substantial capital expenditure by CIE over the period of the national plan. The board's capital allocations for this period amount to £93 million.  Provision has been made for expenditure in this period of £36 million on the CIE bus programme, including bus acquisition. Almost £43 million will be spent on mainline rail and mainline carriage acquisition and just over £14 million will be spent by the board on their signalling/communications and normal capital programmes, including £1.16 million which has been earmarked for work to be carried out at Rosslare Harbour in 1987.</P>
    <P>The allocations for bus acquisition will facilitate continuance of the board's current bus replacement programme which commenced in 1980.  In February of this year replacement of the board's city single deck fleet was completed.  In addition, <Col N="1607" /> 184 rural single deck buses have been programmed for construction and delivery in 1985.</P>
    <P>The provision of almost £43 million for mainline rail, including carriage acquisition, will enable continuance of ClE's programme to construct 124 mainline carriages at Inchicore works by 1988. This programme which currently employs 61 persons was approved by the Government in 1982.  The total cost of the project is estimated at £53 million in 1984 prices.  The first of these carriages were put into service on the Dublin-Cork line in July of last year.  A total of 34 are now in service on the Dublin-Cork, Dublin-Waterford and Dublin-Galway lines.  The introduction of these new air conditioned carriages has reduced journey times and gives greater standards of passenger comfort than ever before.</P>
    <P>The balance of ClE's capital allocations over the period of the plan, that is some £14 million, will be spent on signalling and communications and on the board's normal capital programme.  The signalling programme which began in 1980 is scheduled for completion in 1988 and is designed to update the signalling system on the mainline railway.  The board's long term capital borrowings are very considerable indeed.  I am concerned about this level of borrowing which is a matter which will need to be given careful consideration at a future date.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to rail safety about which I am very concerned.  A few times this year rail safety, particularly in regard to the carriage of dangerous substances, made the news headlines.  I know that the chairman of CIE shares my concerns and is willing to take any necessary steps to make good any deficiencies which are brought to light.  Rail is a very safe mode of travel but continuous vigilance and awareness of the risks and dangers of rail accidents is essential.  There is a need for an on-going search for additional improvements in the interest of safety.  I am satisfied that current arrangements relating to the transport of dangerous substances by rail embody all reasonable <Col N="1608" /> and practical elements.  Nevertheless having regard to recent events, I have instituted another look at all aspects of the question of the transport of dangerous substances and involving other Government Departments and other interests immediately concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government in charting the future for CIE have fully recognised the extent of the board's difficulties and in so far as possible special measures have been introduced to deal with the situation.  The Government have also, of course, set very specific financial targets for the board but they have also made available financial incentives to help in their achievement.  These targets will not be easily achieved but they are realistic and should be capable of being realised.  It is now up to management and the workforce to ensure the future success of the organisation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>While understanding the Minister's commendation of the Bill before the House today I want to be very brief in my remarks.  Despite all the statements by the Minister and the Government that they would no longer allow the CIE subsidy to rise &mdash; and much political hooray was made of this &mdash; whether we like it or not, this is just a different way of doing the same thing. Under this Bill the Government will be borrowing £30 million.  The CIE board will be responsible for the interest on that and the repayments are at the rate of £3 million per annum.  If we want the service we have to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was not very specific regarding the legislation to divide CIE into three sections which he proposes to bring in.  Can he tell us when he proposes to introduce this legislation?  The DART service is going very well but in order to make it viable and profitable it needs a feed service.  Can the Minister tell us when this feed service will be provided? Something will have to be done urgently about one-man buses if CIE are to retain some semblance of viability.  The non-operation of the one-man service is making the service non-viable.  When will <Col N="1609" /> the unions, CIE and the Minister work out this problem?  Until that is done the viability of rural bus services is certainly not on.</P>
    <P>Over the years because of the cost of transport services from rural parts of the country to Dublin and other major cities and <i>vice versa</i> a new service of private enterprise bus hauliers has grown up. That is divided up in two different ways. First, there are certain clubs and licensed hauliers who operate a daily service from rural parts of the country to Dublin at a very reasonable cost and it seems to be profitable for them.  Their buses are packed each day.  Secondly, there is the weekend service which they run, bringing civil servants, students, etc., from Dublin to their homes throughout the country. That seems to be a very viable operation from the point of view of the private haulier.</P>
    <P>Is there not some way that we could have competition between the private hauliers and CIE which, in the long term, would give the paying public a choice in their transport?  As it is now we have to go through twists and turns regarding the registration of those travel clubs.  Those bus owners have difficulty in getting a licence to run a service which obviously is essential to the community.  Otherwise they would not be applying for a licence. This matter should be simplified soon.  It might be a bunch of nettles for the Minister to grasp, but there seems to be a glaring anomaly somewhere.  CIE cannot compete with those masses of private buses which operate daily from rural parts of the country to the city.  The Minister will have to do something about this soon because there is an outcry from the public.  The fares on these private buses are so reasonable that CIE cannot compete and, because of that fact, which is the most essential fact to the ratepayer and to the taxpayer the choice must be given and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>I pass through this city at different hours of the day and over the past seven or eight months every time I passed by the bus depot on Conyngham Road there were on average 26 buses parked inside. Could somebody explain why this is the <Col N="1610" /> case at peak periods in this city when there are queues at bus stops for inner city services?  How can CIE afford or how can this country afford to have 26 or 27 double decker buses standing idle in that one garage?  We cannot afford the luxury of handing out money to CIE if they do not utilise the facilities given to them by the taxpayers over many years with a free hand.  There is the occasional protest.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow morning we will read in the national press that the Minister is giving another £30 million to CIE.  What are the CIE Dublin city services doing to tighten up their whole performance instead of having the ludicrous situation where a bus depot can afford the luxury of having 26 or 27 double decker buses standing idle at all times of the day?  That is a fact because I have counted them.  It is time CIE got down to business and sharpened up the administration of that bus service. Something has got to be done about it.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of ClE's effort to provide a rural bus service for the people who need it.  In my own area a feed service to Galway city provided by private enterprise is now in operation. Every bus is maximised in its capacity. Every seat is full in all of those buses bringing workers in and out of Galway at a most reasonable cost per week.  Why were CIE never able to see the potential for such a development?  I will give an example to the Minister which I think it is worth noting.  There is a bus service from Sligo to Galway city.  At 11.15 a.m. it goes from Tuam town and Dunmore to Galway city.  Who wants to go to Galway at 11.15 a.m. on any morning in the week?  CIE should be able to do something about meeting the realities of the demands that are there.  I do not say that as a criticism.  I say that as a fact which has been proven by private enterprise. They can pack six or seven buses with workers to Galway city, provide the service at quite a cheap weekly rate and bring them home again in the evening at varying times so that everyone can be facilitated.</P>
    <P>How is it that CIE and their staff could not see that?  I am sure it is the same in every major town around the country. <Col N="1611" /> CIE should provide a service for those who need it rather than just giving a service for the sake of a service.  That is a criticism I made here as long ago as 1971.  I suggested that something should be done to provide a service for the working public into the major cities and CIE failed to capitalise on it.  The Minister should state publicly and categorically that as they did fail, private enterprise who are offering this service should be encouraged to continue to offer it and offer it even at a stronger rate.  If CIE have to come back here begging for money every year, we can highlight the reasons why.  It is a turnover cash situation all the time.  CIE do not seem to be able to increase it.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister about the issue of passes for free transport for old age pensioners.  Could the Minister tell me how much money CIE collect per annum from the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Transport in respect of old age pensioners?  The Minister may remember that some years ago before the creation of Bord Telecom there was a request from backward rural areas which did not have a bus service of any description, for the post van bus service.  It was a lovely idea that the post van would carry old age pensioners or a person who wanted to go shopping on a Friday.  The idea was that the postman would be allowed to have an adaptable post van in which he could carry two, three, four or five passengers.  It seems to have gone by the wayside.  It was a good idea for areas in the west coast, in the northern parts and the extreme south. Over the years we encouraged the Post Office to implement it.  It was only a small service but it was worth mentioning because people living in very backward areas are starved of transport.  That was an idea which I encouraged at the time.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned rail safety.  This is very important, I want to bring the horror of that situation to reality today.  We had an emergency just outside Athlone recently.  The Western Health Board and the North-Western Health <Col N="1612" /> Board formed part of the national emergency plan which was put into effect.  Since then a most horrendous situation has arisen in our health board area where half of our hospital services in Galway have closed down, both at Merlin Park and the regional hospital in Newcastle Road.  We have a mixed situation, where men are in wards beside women.  Half of the doctors are off duty.  Half of the theatres in the two hospitals are closed down for the months of July and August.</P>
    <P>If there was an emergency today in any part of the area from Athlone to Sligo, how could we implement the emergency plan?  It is an impossibility.  Staff who have gone on vacation for a month or two months, may be out of the country, and probably are because of the bad weather conditions we are having.  Doctors have gone away for their two months' leave of absence, and theatre staff, I am sure, are also away.  In the two major hospitals in the west coast how could we deal with the national emergency plan?  That is a serious reality.  It is a reality which the Government have not taken into account.</P>
    <P>It is an horrific thing to say that if a national emergency arose during the haulage of dangerous substances by CIE through the county of Roscommon to Sligo or Ballina at 1.30 p.m. today, we would not be physically able to bring into operation the national emergency plan.  I would like the comments of the Minister on this aspect.  Has he spoken to the Minister for Social Welfare on this aspect?  Has he warned him &mdash; as is his responsibility &mdash; that the national safety plan is in jeopardy?  Has he warned the health boards about such a situation? What could we do if such an emergency did happen?  God forbid that it should happen, but if it did, and we know it can, where would we go?  What would happen to the national emergency plan?  We would have a public inquiry which would cost 70 times more than the amount of money needed by the Western Health Board to put the national emergency plan into operation.  It is the old story &mdash; there is no point in closing the door when the horse is gone.  In this instance the horse <Col N="1613" /> would definitely be gone and even the door might be gone with him.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I would like to raise.  There was a decision recently by CIE to change the railway station in Athlone town from the western side of the river to the eastern side of the river. I just want to ask the Minister an honourable, straight question which I know he will answer in the same manner if he has the facts.  Is it proposed or envisaged in the foreseeable future to have mainline rail traffic to the west coast stopped at Athlone?</P>

      <P>I am very glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Transport Bill, 1985.  The Bill has to be seen in the context of the achievements of this Government in the period since 1982.  For the first time, in 1983 the financial performance of CIE was controlled.  We had 15 years of quite uncontrolled performance by CIE in the period before that.  Not alone had we an uncontrolled performance in relation to the financing of that company but the management and this workforce seemed to neglect the need &mdash; which should have been apparent to the management and workforce of any company &mdash; to highlight progress, to develop facilities, to be imaginative in relation to what could be done in this area.  An imaginative approach has certainly been adopted in the period since 1982.  This can been seen in the decisions taken in the bus building programme, in the mainline carriage programme and also in the success of the DART project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The message that went to CIE in 1983 was that the Government would come up with one-third of the provision for expenditure and they must reduce expenditure by 2½ per cent per annum up to 1988.  The fact that that has been achieved and that we have controlled the deficit of £104 million in 1983, and an expected deficit of under £105 million for 1984, is very worthy of commendation.  It augurs <Col N="1614" /> well for that company in the period ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are looking for £30 million today to deal with a situation which has developed over a long period and which the Minister will, no doubt, be able to deal with in some detail as time goes by.  Very few companies have not built up deficits related to earlier commitments from which they cannot walk away.</P>
      <P>A much more positive climate has begun to affect CIE, their operations, management and workforce in the past two or three years.  This is very welcome and I hope it will lead to further economies and further development of facilities such as those mentioned by Senator Killilea in some areas.  He mentioned the suggestion that CIE should involve themselves in catering for those in rural areas who want to get to work on time in the morning, who want to get home in the evening, who want to travel distances from cities to their homes.  This is an area which has not been unexplored by CIE. It deserves to be developed.  Senator Killilea commented on the need to encourage private bus companies.  In a mixed economy I do not see any reason why they should not be encouraged.  I would like to see CIE doing more in this area in the period ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the DART service a few moments ago.  As somebody who lives fairly close to the DART service I should like to ask the Minister how successful that service has been to date?  Has the usage of that line met the kind of target CIE hoped it would, or can he be happy about the trend, given the decision to spend money of the order which was spent?  Of course this money was spent before the Minister took over the Department.  I believe the DART service could have been achieved with a slightly less spend-free policy on the part of CIE and the Department of Transport as they were at that time.  The decision to put all the capital money into one service was a mistake, given the need to develop other <Col N="1615" /> facilities such as rail connection &mdash; which would have been the first choice &mdash; for a link into Tallaght and the need for a community as large as Tallaght to have a proper transport system into the city.  The provision for the service was already there.  The land was acquired for ready access from Tallaght to the city.  How successful has the DART service been and what do CIE feel about the improvement of usage of that line?  I would also like an answer to the question posed by Senator Killilea about feeder bus services to the DART line.  At what stage are the negotiations with the unions and when we are likely to have that feeder bus service developed?</P>
    <P>The DART service will be seen, in due time, to be a very successful episode.  I say that without taking away from my comments earlier on the scale of the investment in this project.  We could have gone for a lesser investment than we did, but it is a very superior service.  It transports people along from Howth to Bray but Dubliners from all over this city will be attracted to use that service during the holiday period in particular, to make their way to the beaches, to enjoy the advantages of Dublin as a seaside city.  It will be an encouragement for leisure and activities of that kind.  This will, in its own way, develop and improve the commercial interests of those who operate in towns like Bray and on the north side also.</P>
    <P>In due time this will be seen to be a very successful and important development.  It will also help tourism in this city where little has been done over the years.  I will not expand on my thoughts on tourism just now, but this city needs to come to terms with the attractions it has to facilitate tourists.  This DART project will give the people coming to our country &mdash; from the United States, from North America and from Europe &mdash; a feeling that we are a modern city and we go about our business in a serious way.  It is an example of what can be done within urban areas generally and in other areas of Dublin, with a more limited and more <Col N="1616" /> careful approach to expenditure than was adopted to this project.</P>
    <P>There is one small matter I should like to mention in relation to the DART service. It has been mentioned to me a number of times in recent weeks. Whereas the line itself and the carriages have apparently been respected very much by the citizenry and by others who use them, there has been a spate of malicious damage in the stations on the DART line in recent weeks or months which must be a cause for concern.  I wonder if the Minister could take steps to ensure that a proper system of administration in these stations takes control of that situation before real and permanent damage is done to these stations which were built with some considerable investment on the opening of the DART line.</P>
    <P>I would like, at this stage, and with the permission of Senator Killilea, to pay tribute to the Minister for Communications who is here with us today.  We are very fortunate to have the Minister, Deputy J. Mitchell, responsible for this Department in that since he was in swaddling clothes &mdash; that is a fair illustration of what I want to say &mdash; he has known about CIE.  He has lived in the home of CIE which, I think, would be indisputed as being Inchicore.  He does not live there now, but there is a strong knowledge of himself and his family in that part of the world.  It continues as a place of affection for him and the fact that we are going to be building 124 mainline carriages in Inchicore in the next period of years will be seen by the people of Inchicore and the people of the city as being part of the programme that he would like to see happen.  Similarly, in the west, since Senator Killilea is concerned about the west, the bus building programme in Shannon is coming along.</P>

      <P>I would like to deal with a theme that I have been concerned about.  The Dublin City Council and myself &mdash; originally it was an all-party group &mdash; tabled a resolution in relation to the Dublin Transportation Authority. The Bill is now with us and is to be welcomed.  The need to come to terms with the Dublin transport problem is something which is long overdue.  I will in due course, like Senator Killilea, be welcoming that Bill and giving it encouragement along its way.  We have also the Road Transport Bill.  There is one little matter which I came across yesterday which hopefully the Leas-Chathaoirleach will permit me to mention.  I got permission from the powers that be in this House to leave the House for a couple of hours yesterday afternoon.  I got to Suffolk Street, which is a tiny, winding street in the centre of the city at the bottom of Grafton Street, to see cars parked on both sides of the road on double yellow lines to see the new Dublin Gas doing a job on Suffolk Street, two traffic wardens helpless, unable to do anything to improve the situation.  For 20 minutes I could not get through Suffolk Street.  I would not like to see what might have happened if there had been an emergency. They could not get assistance from the Garda Síochána in relation to the units that come out to remove cars which, of course, should have been done in this situation.  I travelled up to the unit at Christ Church Place.  I met the sole policeman who was guarding four vehicles which were lined up without anybody to do the job.  I assume everybody here would accept that this was a street which was impossible, not just for the gardaí and the traffic wardens, but equally for an individual trying to move from the <Col N="1618" /> bottom of Grafton Street into Dame Street.  If there had been an emergency situation it would have been a terrifying prospect.  I went to that place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the Road Transport Authority Bill.  It was mentioned a few moments ago by the Minister.  That Bill will presumably have some impact in this area.  I was told by the Garda Síochána &mdash; and I communicated with the superintendent later in the day &mdash; that all his vehicles and all his men were out lifting barriers for the Rás Tailteann around this city.  There was no vehicle there to deal with obstructions to the street system.  The tiny street system of this city is a very worrying matter and I would ask the Minister to convey&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to the Garda Síochána how this matter should be dealt with in future.  They should stop this movement away from the central objective of keeping our streets open.  If cars and bicycles are not able to operate in the tiny streets in the middle of the city there is hardly much point in the bus system operating there.  I think there is a certain relevance.  We are into the transport area and we are dealing with central city streets and I thought what I had to say was very relevant and should be brought to the attention at the highest level in the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two other matters I would like to raise.  The Minister mentioned dangerous substances a few moments ago, and expressed his concern and the concern of the Government and I am sure of everybody here about safety in relation to dangerous substances. Senator Killilea also expressed concern about this matter.  I am sure I do not need <Col N="1619" /> to say anything more about that because that is something we should all be concerned about now and always be very vigilant in this area.</P>
    <P>One thing I do want to talk about is the matter the Minister was talking about earlier, about air conditioning in rail carriages. I happened to be listening to an RTE programme a short time ago when we heard of the unfortunate death of a man who was in what was supposed to be an air conditioned carriage &mdash; maybe it was not &mdash; but it got so hot that the man was lifted out and was found dying along the corridor.  He had a heart condition and he was coming to Dublin for treatment. I do not recall at the moment where he was coming from, maybe it was Cork, but he died, unfortunately on his journey.  The reason I raise this is in relation to safety.  The point was made on the radio programme that the journalist who happened to be in the same carriage as this individual and who helped the man in his final minutes said that the guard told him that it was not possible to communicate with the train driver.  The guard had no system of communication with the train driver.  Whether that is right or wrong I do not know, but it seems to be an alarming situation.  It is one thing to have problems, which we have had in the past, relating to external communication from Heuston Station to a train carriage or a driver and the failing of signals on the line, but it seems to be a vital part of any communication system in relation to railways that the personnel who are taking care of the passengers would be able &mdash; outside the point of emergency stops or of bringing the train to a halt &mdash; to have some radio or other communication with the train driver or with his assistant, or with somebody responsible for running the train.  I would like to ask the Minister what is being done in relation to the safety of passengers to deal with this question of communication with the train driver, the person responsible for running the train, if we are told that a guard on a mainline, from Cork to Dublin, cannot communicate with the train driver.  In <Col N="1620" /> every other way I very much encourage the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to commence by joining Senator FitzGerald in complimenting and congratulating the Minister on his stewardship over the past two and a half years, particularly in so far as his Ministry concerns his responsibility, his statutory and Governmental responsibility, with regard to CIE.  The Minister has brought to bear on all of us, not merely the management within CIE but on the public at large, a sense of realism in so far as the future of CIE is concerned. He has also ensured that an element of certainty has been created whereby the management of CIE can look forward to the next four or five years and determine what they have to do within particular confines and plan accordingly.  More importantly, the Minister has ensured that the financial situation of CIE will no longer give rise to the kind of concern it gave in the past when the company and their board were allowed to gallop away like a runaway train without any sense of responsibility.  The Minister stated that:</P>
      <P>So far in 1985, the CIE financial performance is on target for a further reduction in the deficit in real terms. This was a deficit of £104 million for 1983 and an expected deficit of under £105 million in 1984 on the basis of excluding the special provision for capital interest charges on the DART system, represents a dramatic improvement after the trend of the previous 15 years.</P>
      <P>We all agree with the Minister that that indicates a dramatic improvement and we compliment him.  We also compliment the management of CIE on living now within the confines and the ambits imposed upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More importantly the Minister's strategy has pulled CIE, I hope willingly, into the commercial world of the mid-eighties. The management of CIE now realise that they have to compete and be competitive and provide the kind of service which people require.  That realisation may not have got fully through to <Col N="1621" /> CIE management at every level.  CIE must be more aware of the kind of service which the public at large require.  While I appreciate that transport services in a small country such as this have to be nationally based in one sense, on the other hand, it is extremely important that within every CIE management area, there is seen to be a management team who, within their own area, can operate in a way that relates to their community and responds to the needs of that community and provides the kind of service that is required in that community.  I do not think that has been happening on the ground, and I speak particularly of the Mayo-Galway CIE area of which I have most knowledge.  I do not feel that it is happening there to the extent that it should be happening.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea mentioned a postvan bus service.  I do not remember that scheme in great detail.  That is the kind of scheme that would have a certain relevance in the west of Ireland.  I knock on doors in places like Killeen and Drummond and in parts of Ballycroy in west Mayo where people never see a bus.  That is the kind of service they would like. They live 20 and 30 miles from the nearest town but never see a CIE bus because the roads are not capable of taking a bus. I would like to see CIE developing a regular mini bus service in the remoter rural areas.  I do not see why the population of the remote regions should be deprived of a public transport service. The Minister might draw the attention of his people in the Galway-Mayo area to this.  Even if a once a week small bus service could be provided to bring the people from these areas into the towns, I do not think the cost to CIE would be all that great.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the private enterprise bus system.  This is something which the area management of CIE might look at.  I find it very hard to understand how every weekend half a dozen buses or more leave Castlebar for Dublin and charge £8.50 or £9.50 for a return fare. If it is profitable for private enterprise to do that, why is it not profitable for CIE to do it?  The point I am making is that <Col N="1622" /> the opportunities are there.  People are getting into the transport market.  Unfortunately, CIE who for so long have been buoyed with the assurance that Governments would dole out money to them when the need arose, have not considered it necessary to get into this whole area of competitiveness.  They should be encouraged at local level.  We should develop within each local CIE area a type of management team to go out and try to sell their srvice and ascertain the type of service needed in their area.  That would be a good idea.  It would be good for those involved in CIE.  It would create a sense of enterprise for them.  It would create a sense of usefulness in the broadest sense.  It would be beneficial to everybody.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few other brief points. In relation to the rail service, we in the west benefited in November last year from a form of very cheap service.  I can never understand the rail fare structure because it can vary between £10 and £30. Last November we had a much publicised reduced rail fare service from Westport to Dublin.  Every day the train was full. Every day coming home the train was full.  It appeared to operate in a very satisfactory way.  The whole fare structure should be explored.  Are we charging too much for the service we provide when trains which are not full are travelling from Westport to Dublin?  On the other hand, should not trains which are full charge a rate that is reasonable?  We should also ensure that the best possible dining car service is provided on these trains.</P>
    <P>The final thing I want to say in relation to the rail service is that the service should seem attractive.  I do not understand why most of our railway stations are painted in the dullest Office of Public Works grey when they could be brightened up with greens, yellows and reds and made attractive. When I was a child, and that is not very long ago, CIE stations could get a prize for the most colourful and best kept station.  They have now become dismal places which look a bit like the old workhouses of the 19th century.  They should be brightened up.  They should be encouraged <Col N="1623" /> to plant flowers and make the stations attractive.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I tried to raise on the Order of Business some weeks ago.  I have communicated with the Minister's office about it, that is, the closure at very short notice of the Westport bus office by CIE.  This bus office was situated adjacent to the Central Hotel in Westport.  It provided information and a baggage service and many other services. At very short notice it was closed by CIE. The Westport Urban District Council and the Westport Chamber of Commerce have communicated with the Minister about it and I have written to him.  We have had very little response.  The reopening of this bus office should be considered. I do not think it cost CIE very much to have it there.</P>
    <P>The question of rail safety, was mentioned. I would like to make one brief point on that.  CIE should take urgent steps to paint all the rail crossings.  A Member of this House died tragically at a CIE rail crossing about 15 years ago.  I had an experience recently at another rail crossing which was so badly painted that I very nearly drove through it on a misty night.  Since then I have examined other manual rail gates, and the need exists to paint all of these and illuminate them suitably.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to make is this.  The Minister is Minister for Communications and his brief includes transport in its broadest sense.  The time has come for us as a State &mdash; a small State geographically &mdash; to ask ourselves the question: Can we afford the best bus, rail and air services with airports springing up all over the place, with ports all over the country which we are still maintaining, a road system we are trying to maintain, and taxi services we do not recognise?  The Minister must examine the whole level of transport services we are providing.  We must take difficult decisions and get our priorities right as between the various services and their relevance to the people.</P>
    <Col N="1624" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill and to support the Minister and the Department, and to encourage the reorganisation they are trying to implement in funding CIE.  Over the years CIE have had some notorious loss making and, indeed, the people involved there have not been encouraged by the huge amount of adverse comment which they actions or inactions invariably attracted.  I firmly believe that the time has come for major reorganisation of the entire organisation.  I wish the Minister well in the task that he has set himself.</P>
      <P>I believe that the monopoly situation should be looked at very closely. Obviously, if we are to take the bus service, we assume there will hardly be competition on the rail network, except we read of some organisation trying to muscle in on that whether they are successful or not.  As far as the bus services are concerned, certainly it would appear that the private bus companies are able to provide what would appear to be a similar service at less than half the charges which CIE are imposing.  This is a pity.  I often thought that in the rural areas CIE might, perhaps, consider introducing smaller vehicles, maybe a 30-seater bus or a 20-seater bus or even a 14-seater mini-bus, to service the people. They have been plying these routes for many years now and surely it is not beyond the capabilities of the management of CIE to be able to identify a vehicle that would be most economical and best suit the needs of a particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month I was very disappointed to see that CIE withdrew their bus service which has been operating in south Laois for quite a number of years back.  It is a detour that the Waterford or Kilkenny bus to Dublin made which took in Crettyard, The Swan, Wolfhill and Stradbally in County Laois.  They are replacing that according to the information I could glean from the bus service with an express bus service which would stop at Crettyard and Ballylinan.  This is an outrageous withdrawal of service because it means the villages of The Swan and Wolfhill and, indeed, the town of Stradbally, <Col N="1625" /> which has almost 1,800 people, are left without any public service, good, bad or indifferent.  Yet if we are to accept and support the Minister's proposal, the taxpayers in general are making a contribution to the refunding and the reorganisation of this service.  Yet you have half of County Laois without any sort of service.  This is unacceptable. Either CIE must accept that they are in the business of providing a service or else let them allow the private sector to take over the routes and the areas on which they claim to have a monopoly.</P>
    <P>I note that in Portlaoise CIE employ quite a number of people in different areas and they certainly have an excellent workforce there, especially in the rail section where they fabricate the continuous rail, make sleepers and have an industrial section like that.  These people certainly do an excellent service and I would hope that work would continue and that the same kind of employment would be provided there.</P>
    <P>The train service is excellent where it runs.  I know from travelling on the intercontinental expresses in Europe that the express trains can fly into a station and literally stop for only one minute and people are able to get on and off in that time.  I do not know what the length of a stop is in ordinary small stations across the country here.  When one sees so many trains not stopping at the majority of stations on the main track, one wonders if the company are endeavouring to get every possible passenger facilitated and also to get them as fare paying passengers. I do not know what the views of the management and the people who are in charge are, or how much they appreciate and how much value and worth they place on the patronage of the ordinary fare paying passenger.  Sometimes one is led to believe that in this semi-State organisation the service provided to potential passengers would appear to have a very low priority indeed.  This is where the great difference between the public sector service and the private sector service lies. The private sector service is provided by private carriers who certainly go to the places where the public would seem to <Col N="1626" /> want to go and be able to meet whatever demand may be there from one week to the next.  This is a matter with which the management of CIE should certainly try to cope more readily.</P>
    <P>To travel by train is a very nice way of travelling but I had occasion a few years ago to write to the former chairman of CIE about the fact that a train was not very clean.  He wrote back and said that these trains were washed inside and outside after every trip.  I do not know on which floor in Kingsbridge this guy has his office but, obviously, it was not in the train.  If that was the case, then clearly middle management was involved.  I do not blame the man who sweeps out the carriages but there must be a supervisor over him and there must be a middle management guy over him.  So it is on management that we must lay the blame. They are not insisting that the work for which the company are obviously paying is not being carried out.  If that work is not done, it means that the public are getting a poorer service and a lower standard of service.  This is where this country as a whole falls down, that people are too complacent and they seem to accept lower standards or, indeed, no standards at all.</P>
    <P>I hope that this will be the start of a re-organisation of the entire monstrosity that we know and accept as CIE and that the end product will be a better and more economical service for the public.  That is important.  The poor people who cannot afford their own transport must have adequate transport facilities available to them.  There is no doubt that there are more buses and trains passing through the midlands which stop to facilitate the people living there.  For many years I have had an ongoing battle with CIE to have an early morning commuter train into Dublin to facilitate people who are working here in the public service or, indeed, in the private service.  Some few years ago they put on that service which certainly would appear to be very profitable to CIE as a large number of people avail of that each morning and evening. This company are certainly slow to <Col N="1627" /> respond to public demand.  I hope that the recent success of the new commuter train system in Dublin &mdash; at least from a public point of view it is successful &mdash; will encourage the company to get into a modern transport business and insist on a high standard within the service.  This is very important.  If the general public see that the board of CIE are making a major effort to provide a top class service they will not be despondent.  The Irish people, in general, are most understanding and will make more than enough allowances for the limitations under which organisations such as CIE have been constantly labouring.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish the Minister well in the task he has set out to do.  I hope this is the first of a series of legislative measures which he will introduce in order to provide the public with better transport facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to thank Senators for their contributions to this debate.  I note that in this House, as well as in the other House, there was a tendency for Members to concentrate on the problems in their own neck of the woods. I suppose that is understandable but, in truth, one of the problems which has beset CIE over the years has been a preoccupation on the part of politicians and Ministers in making sure that different representations made by Deputies and Senators are met rather than allowing decisions to be made on the basis of objective transport criteria.  That factor alone is one of the most significant contributary factors to the monstrous escalation of deficits by CIE between 1969 and 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite a scandal what happened. Of course, it was a period of very sharp increases in oil costs.  It was also a period in which labour costs nationally went up at a rate much greater than the rate of inflation.  This was not just in CIE but across the board in all areas of the economy. In any event, it was a period of as high a rate of inflation as the country has ever known.  Even allowing for inflation, <Col N="1628" /> the losses in 1982 should have been of the order of £15 million, had they merely gone up by that very high rate of inflation from 1969 onwards.  But we know the loss was £109.2 million, seven times what it should have been.  That cannot be explained away by the oil shock.  It was a refusal to face up to the fact that there was constant interference by politicians with CIE.  The Government were setting unrealistic subvention limits in the closing weeks of one financial year for results to be achieved in the next financial year. Of course, everybody just scoffed at the figures because they were unrealistic.  As I said in my opening speech, they were rewarded by not being observed.  There were no realistic targets.  The thing escalated out of control.  That was the story for 15 successive years until 1982 when we reached the pinnacle of deficits at £109.2 million.  We have got that under control.  It reduced in 1983 and in 1984 in real terms and it will reduce again this year in real terms.</P>
    <P>That reduction has been achieved to the enormous easement of the taxpayer without any massive cuts in services or in redundancies.  The House will, therefore, forgive me for ignoring those local points made by Senators and, indeed, by Deputies in the other House.  That local pressure to have all sorts of services provided, regardless of objective criteria, got CIE into financial trouble over the years and I am determined that this will not happen to CIE again.</P>

      <P>I made a decision when I became Minister that I would not deal with representations or receive deputations in relation to the operational matters in CIE.  That seemed very hard. It affected my own constituency where some changes had been made in the area of bus routing.  It has paid off as far as the taxpayers are concerned.  We should ponder that, had the trend of 1969-1982 continued, this year we would be talking of losses of the order of £150 million.  The out-turn for 1985 will be something of the <Col N="1629" /> order of £104 million.  So we are talking about dramatic savings in one year alone. This serves to highlight and very much support the change made in that regard. Finances have been got under control. This has been achieved without massive cuts in services or redundancies in CIE. We have gone some way towards creating a new environment.  This Bill goes a step further.</P>
      <P>Senator Killilea said it was just a way of giving CIE more money under a different name.  This is not the case.  What we are doing in this Bill is two fold.  First, we are making provision to give CIE £30 million which they should have been paid in the years preceding 1984 because allocations were made in the last few weeks of December of one year for application to the next year.  Not only was this unrealistic but if CIE made any attempt to live within that figure their moves were constantly resisted by politicians.  Take the example of what happened in December 1981.  The subvention set for 1982 was £96 million.  That was done around Christmas, 1981.  They were to live within £96 million.  The out-turn was £109.2 million. CIE had applied to the National Prices Commission in the meantime for an increase in fares.  Because of increased costs they could have got approval even for a 50 per cent fare increase but they applied for a lesser increase than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Prices Commission approved an increase of 25 per cent at a time when inflation was running close to that figure.  The then Government for political reasons &mdash; and I am not pointing the finger at a Fianna Fáil Government; this was the trend of Governments at the time &mdash; delayed this increase.  Of course, it cost CIE £12 million in that year.  There may be some doubt as to whether it was already clear in December 1982 that the out-turn would be £109.2 million, but with inflation running at a high level close to 20 per cent, the Government in settling the Estimates for the following year set an estimate of £86 million, which was £23 million less than the out-turn of the year just ended.  If you add 20 per cent to £109 million you would be talking about £132 million for 1983, requiring almost £50 <Col N="1630" /> million to close the gap in one year.  What is more any proposals made for reducing the subvention needed involved massive reductions in the numbers which were employed and in services and so were refused.  They were even refused minor changes in services.</P>
    <P>My predecessor deserves credit for this aspect.  What happened was that the 25 per cent fare increase was not approved from 1 July 1982 because of the very balanced situation in the Dáil.  The then Government did publish a programme called <i>The Way Forward</i> in the course of the general election of November 1982 and that included a provision for the 25 per cent fare increase from January 1983 &mdash; a six month delay.  My predecessor, Deputy Wilson, was asked during the course of the election campaign about this and was honest about it and said, &ldquo;Yes, there is a 25 per cent increase from 1 January 1983&rdquo; and he deserves credit for that honesty.  Since then a very firm policy decision made by this Government is that if fare increases are applied for and if they are approved by the National Prices Commission, we are not going to interfere and this was written into the Government decision relating to the rearrangement of CIEs finances and giving them a five year profile.  If we do make decisions or fail to take decisions on matters like this, we have to pick up the tab right away.  That is a discipline for the Government.  No application for fare increases has been interfered with since. Some people might say it is a good thing, others might say it is a bad thing.  If Governments in future are to stop fare increases, which have been justified before the National Prices Commission, the Government are going to have to pick up the tab.  It is only fair to CIE.  Much of the £30 million we are talking about is to repay CIE what it should have been paid long ago by Government. Governments avoided by fair means and foul giving the subvention which was required to provide that type of level of fairness.  That is why there is provision in this Bill to provide £30 million over a ten year period.  We pay £3 million a year. That is to correct the imbalance of the <Col N="1631" /> past.  It is not a subsidy for services for this year or future years.  It is to pay for past services.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea asked when will the restructuring Bill be here.  The restructuring Bill should be before both Houses of the Oireachtas very quickly after the summer Recess.  I am very anxious that we get the restructuring Bill setting up the three subsidiary companies passed quickly so that the final phase of the new environment, which I have been trying to create, will be put in place hopefully by the end of the year.  I know that there are quite a number of people in CIE very worried about their future because of these changes.  It is only human to be concerned when there is uncertainty. That is natural.  I want to end the uncertainty as quickly as possible by bringing forward the Bill and implementing the restructuring as quickly as possible, hopefully by the end of this year.  People will be much more relaxed and enthusiastic once the restructuring has taken place. What has been achieved in the past two and a half years so far, and what will be achieved in the remainder of this year is nothing less than providing an exciting new future for CIE which most people would have thought impossible two and a half years ago, when things looked very gloomy and the whole show looked like going over the cliff.</P>
    <P>Both Senator FitzGerald and Senator Killilea asked about feeder commuter services for DART in general.  In 1983, pre-DART, the total number of rail passengers on the Howth to Bray line was 5.39 million; in 1984 it was 7.5 million. The feeder bus services for DART is something that I have spoken about on a number of occasions in the past and I am very concerned that they have not yet been agreed.  This is intolerable.  I told the chairman that I expect this problem to be resolved quickly.  There is a huge public investment in the DART system. There is a great deal of public excitement about it.  Mosy people find the DART system very acceptable and a very agreeable addition to our transport infrastructure, even if it is costly.  In order to <Col N="1632" /> minimise the losses we have to have the feeder services.  It is ludicrous that there should be so much resistance within CIE to those services.  I would appeal to everybody concerned to come to agreement quickly on providing the feeder services. It would appear that this problem is tied up with the one-man bus question, which has been going on for a long time also. These two questions ought to be tackled.</P>

      <P>Senator Killilea and others raised the question of private bus operators.  Could this competition be legalised and simplified?  At the moment, there are quite a number of private bus operators licensed for different routes. This is governed by the 1932 Road Passenger Act.  There is a review of this Act now almost completed as part of the overall review of national transport policy which I intend to address in a Green Paper, which I expect to publish in the next month or so.  The final version of it is on my desk.  It will be going to Government shortly.</P>
      <P>At the moment there are two schools of thought about this.  One says remove the restrictions completely, let everybody just compete freely.  The other school of thought is that that is &ldquo;for the birds&rdquo;. The fact is that commercial operators will have no problem in providing bus services when they are ensured of having their buses full &mdash; weekend travel in particular &mdash; Dublin to Tuam on a Friday evening, or Dublin to Ennis, and back to Dublin from those places on a Sunday evening. That is no problem.  What about all the off-peak services that CIE have to operate? No private operator is going to operate many of those services because they are intrinsically&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is true also. There is room for CIE to get their cost down and a great deal has been achieved in the past two and a half years in the provincial bus operation as in all the other operations.  There is still a great deal of scope for further reduction in their cost so as to make services more viable.  There are, undoubtedly, a number of services which no private operator could touch because they are intrinsically services of a social nature.  This is the dilemma.  Do you give the potentially profitable services to the private operators with CIE left to provide the social service at a cost to the taxpayer or do you say no, we are going to have profits within the provincial bus services?</P>

      <P>Senator Killilea raised the question of the Athlone railway station change in location.  There is no significance in that in relation to rail services to and from Galway or the west.  CIE thought it necessary to provide the best site available in the general area and that was east of the river rather than west of the river and I know that that was a matter of some disappointment.</P>

      <P>I take the point.  Senator Killilea asked about the cost of transport as far as other Departments are concerned.  The Department of Social Welfare in 1984 paid CIE £21.568 million in respect of free travel for those who were entitled to it under the social welfare code.  The Department of Education school transport scheme cost £29.382 million in 1984 and the Department of Defence free travel scheme cost £1.751 million in 1984.</P>

      <P>The position here is that CIE's deficit has exceeded its subvention for a number of years.  In 1983 it exceeded its subvention by £16 million. Yet the deficit for 1983 was a dramatic improvement on the previous deficit and it was the first time in 15 years that the deficit had been reduced.  We are acknowledging the sins and and omissions of previous Governments.  If we have not paid CIE what they are entitled to we are making good £30 million of that.  They should have been paid it in the past.  We have not got the whole £30 million now but we are going to pay it at £3 million per year over the next ten years.  Meanwhile CIE can borrow it by way of ten year loan.  We will repay the principal and CIE can repay the interest.</P>

      <P>With regard to borrowing for capital purposes I mentioned on Second Stage that I thought CIE should be more imaginative in meeting the services in any area.  I was disappointed that the Minister said he was not interested in entertaining representations from people from the provinces who wanted to maintain a semblance of a service in their own areas.  It is just not acceptable that CIE or any organisation with a monopoly can completely withdraw from giving a service.  I am not quarrelling with the Minister but he has said that the Department of Social Welfare paid £20 million, the Department of Education £29 million.  In the Luggacurren area of County Laois, which is a quarter of the county, on 4 June CIE withdrew their only service, which was a two days a week service where the bus from Kilkenny to Dublin deviated at Crettyard and went on to The Swan, Wolfhill and back down to Stradbally. Stradbally is a town with a population of almost 2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister saying now that he is going to provide £30 million in back payment of a subsidy that CIE should have got over the years and still leave a huge area of a county without any service? That is unacceptable.  I do not care where the money comes from.  If there is a £105 million subsidy being paid to CIE I hold that the people in my neck of the <Col N="1638" /> woods are as much entitled to benefit as are the people anywhere else.  Why cannot CIE not trim their cloth according to the measure?  They run a 52 seater bus across the country roads.  Why can they not, where there is a small demand for the service, run the bus on one or two days a week and put in a smaller bus to meet the local demand?  They are not being asked to do it for nothing.  If it is old age pensioners who use the service they are being paid £22 million a year by the Department of Social Welfare. Bianconi had the mail coaches 100 years ago and the mail was collected twice a day in every post office in my county and there must be 30 of them in the county. Why can they not even fall back to an old mail coach system and at least offer the people some service to get from A to B? I do not accept the Minister's line of argument that he is not open to representation. We are entitled to have a service if it is being paid for by the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take issue with Senator McDonald on this.  This is the fundamental point.  Do Senators genuinely think that buses should be provided whether there are any passengers to use them or not?  It is the same with the railways.  The Government are paying two-thirds of the CIE subsidy for railways &mdash;£70 million, or something of that order &mdash; yet railways only account for four per cent of all passenger miles travelled. There is a great nostalgia about the railways. Nobody wants the rail lines cut; no town wants the station closed, yet the vast majority of the population of towns that have stations do not use the railways. So for nostalgic reasons we pay a lot of money for the railways.  The fact is that the only services that are cut by CIE are services which are being little used and if they are little used there must be more economic and more viable ways of providing those services.  I am not saying that we should abandon rural areas completely because services are being used very little, but we have to think of alternative ways of providing those transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to representations on these <Col N="1639" /> matters, it is to the chairman and board of CIE that Senators, Deputies and others should make their representations and not to me.  We have a board appointed to run CIE and for too long in the past we have been interfering in their remits. This interference has now stopped and that is as it should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to follow the point Senator McDonald made, I agree fully with what the Minister said: you cannot expect to provide a service which is not being used but I also agree with him in that one must be realistic in providing services.  It was with that in mind that I made the suggestion that we have in rural Ireland a system of mini-buses servicing the areas which would not provide a full passenger complement on a large bus. There are many areas where there are six, eight, ten or 12 people want to get out of that area and travel 18 or 20 miles to their nearest town and it is areas like that which are being penalised.  It seems ridiculous that we have the larger buses providing inter-town services where such a service is not required.  What is required is a service by a much smaller vehicle which surely would be much cheaper and which could be much more broadly based, bringing the greatest number of people from the broadest possible areas into the centre of town.</P>

I could guarantee that the time of that bus service is between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. because that is where CIE have led astray every Government.

Who wants to travel on a bus to Galway at 10.15?  It is all right for old age pensioners.  They are the best people at getting up early to go to do their shopping and come home in the evening with the workers and fight their corner also.  I think CIE just run a service to satisfy the few old age pensioners who want to go shopping and then they tell every Minister, as they have been doing since day one, that the people are not using that service.  They are not using the service because CIE are not providing a timetable appropriate to the working public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the long and the short of it.  It is nonsense to talk about being able to make representations to CIE.  You are wasting your time making representations to them anyhow because they would not listen to you.  They would rather spend money on their little mini-vans, running around watching the private enterprise people who are thriving on the stupidity of the sales performance of CIE staff.  Private enterprise are dancing upon them and all we can see are two officials sitting in mini-vans writing down who got <Col N="1641" /> into such a private bus and where he got in and where he got out.  Two of them can spend a full morning driving around chasing private buses instead of going out and counting the number of people on buses and looking after each area.</P>
    <P>CIE do not listen to the public, they do not want to listen to the public but they want their subventions, whether it is £30 million or £108 million.  This has gone on since day one and the Minister will not be able to change it under this Bill, no matter how much he praises himself or no matter how much Senator FitzGerald or Senator McDonald or any other one praises him.</P>

      <P>I would fully support the Minister on the line being adopted in recent times in regard to what might be described as interference with the operation of CIE.  If that company are going to progress and improve their economy they have to be allowed to control their own operations.  Nonetheless, I feel that we represent the taxpayers in this House as do Members of the other House.  It would be a very sad day in this House of the Oireachtas if we did not have a system of communication with CIE.  I know individually we have a system of communication with the chairman of CIE.  We have had a number of interesting suggestions made today.  We have the suggestion of mini-buses in rural Ireland. That may not be economically viable. Those mini-buses could be travelling to different parts of a number of counties over a week.  They would not be concentrating on any one part of any one county. We have had suggestions about the aspect of employment and catering for employment. Surely in our present economic straits that should be one of the roles of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned oral communication within the mainline trains.  I also mentioned the spate of vandalism of the new stations of the DART service.  We are here as Members of this House who have the interest to come along and spend some time discussing these subjects.  Presumably <Col N="1642" /> in CIE someone at the chairman's office is reading this debate or will be reading this debate, and could respond at least to the Members who have taken the trouble to come in and contribute to it.  There could be some detailed response in relation to these issues which are of concern to us, not on a purely local level, but of concern to people generally.  With the adoption of the policy, as indicated by the Minister, of not bludgeoning CIE with political demands, there could also be an opening up of some new form of communication with CIE which could be useful in the long run.</P>

I have no doubt that transcripts of the debate will be circulated among the relevant senior executives.  I suggest to Members that if they have representations to make on particular services, or if for instance &mdash; taking the point that Senator Killilea and Senator McDonald made &mdash; the service is at the wrong time, that is the sort of local knowledge that might be helpful to CIE in deciding to change and it should be given to them directly.  I am not sure that this has much to do with section 3 of the Bill which is to increase the capital borrowing limit from £230 million to £250 million.  I am sure the House will agree that that should be done.</P>

On section 3, which concerns the borrowings of the board, I was just making the point that instead of withdrawing the entire two-day weekly service from the entire Luggacurren area they could have halved it and given a service even one day a week <Col N="1643" /> and not deprived half the country of any service.</P>

      <P>I should like the service to continue.  I hope that since the Minister has not really encouraged us to make representations, we would not desist from even looking at the progress of this famous semi-State organisation. On the contrary, I think it needs a greater input.  I know that in the three or four years I was President of the Transport Commission in Europe, every one of the major organisations there had borrowings for capital purposes.  That is very acceptable.  Certainly the inter-city transport organisations were, in the main, loss-makers. That should in some way encourage CIE to improve their service.  They will not improve their service unless they look at the passenger as the most important person in their entire operation.  That is all I am asking the Minister to do &mdash; to have regard for the people who require a service.  There are thousands of people who do not own motor cars; indeed, they have not even got a donkey and cart nowadays or for that matter a bicycle.  I ask the Minister and CIE to concentrate not only on passengers but on the actual potential passengers.</P>

I had a meeting with people from Comhchoiste na gComharchumann from the Aran Islands, and we will be meeting them again in September to report progress on the matter.

    <Title>Designated Investment Funds Bill, 1985: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate the Designated Investment Funds Bill in this House before it rises for its summer recess.  Although this Bill is a relatively short one and is technical in nature, it is extremely important in the context of the Government's promotion of investment in industry and specifically from the point of view of encouraging the provision of high risk equity investment, or venture capital as it is often known.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the technical aspects of the Bill and with the reasons for it being necessary at all a little later on, but I would like to dwell for a moment on a particular subject which is recognised as being one of the major obstacles to the growth and development of indigenous enterprise.  I am speaking of the gross under-capitalisation of Irish industry and the unhealthy trend which exists in favour of debt finance and State aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I spoke on the Second Stage of <Col N="1645" /> this Bill in the Dáil I commented on the performance of the Irish Stock Exchange in meeting the financial needs of Irish industry.  I would like to take this opportunity to make my position in relation to the stock exchange quite clear.</P>
    <P>In the first instance it is important to recognise that the exchange is the only market-place which exists for trading in stocks and shares of Irish industry and it is, therefore, an important indicator of industrial performance as well as of the financing trends in industry.</P>
    <P>For this reason I will restate some of the statistics relating to the performance of the stock exchange in the past decade. At present only 77 companies have a full listing on the exchange and this number has been declining steadily over the past decade.  Only 21 of these companies are engaged in manufacturing.  The market capitalisation of shares quoted on the exchange is under 10 per cent of the country's national output as compared with 50 per cent in the UK and US.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, many of the companies listed on the exchange do not have their shares actively traded and regular trading takes place only in respect of a small number of &ldquo;blue chip&rdquo; equities including companies involved in offshore oil exploration. The performance of the Unlisted Securities Market has also been disappointing and it has failed to encourage a significant number of smaller, high-growth companies to the exchange, which is what it was set up to do.  The failure of industry and, in particular, manufacturing industry, to utilise the facility of the USM is an important indication of the lack of equity type capital in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Now, these statistics paint their own picture and point to a declining level of activity on the stock exchange in recent years and the fact that the exchange is no longer a significant force in meeting the financing needs of Irish industry, particularly the needs of small and medium-sized industries.  The blame for this poor performance cannot be laid exclusively at the door of the stock exchange itself. Rather, these statistics are a symptom rather than a cause of the disease with <Col N="1646" /> which we are faced and to which this Government are committed to finding a cure.</P>
    <P>The causes of the disease on the other hand are manifold but can be summarised as the unwillingness on the part of Irish investors to invest in industry coupled with the unwillingness on the part of many businessmen and entrepreneurs to give up part ownership of their business in return for equity capital.  I will expand on both of these points in just a moment.</P>
    <P>One of the cornerstones of this Government's progressive policy for industrial development as outlined in the White Paper on the topic is our commitment to encouraging a greater level of private sector investment in the productive sectors of the economy.  If we can achieve this we will have achieved a revitalisation and rejuvenation of Irish industry; we will have set ourselves on the road towards industrial prosperity; we will have dealt a major blow to the spectre of unemployment in this country which threatens the prospects of our young population.  One of the most marked effects of this increased prosperity will be a dramatic increase in the level of activity on the Irish stock exchange. Therefore, Government policy is extremely supportive rather than critical of the stock exchange.  Furthermore, I am pleased to say that the officials of the exchange have responded positively to my call for the injection of new life blood and new liquidity in the Irish capital markets. Indeed, at their initiative, I hope to have discussions shortly with them to discuss our mutual objectives further.</P>
    <P>My view on the under-capitalisation of Irish industry is not a controversial one and is merely a statement of the factual position in which industry finds itself. Indeed, I have support from a number of auspicious quarters.  The National Economic and Social Council produced a report a little while ago on &ldquo;The Role of the Financial System in Financing the Traded Sectors&rdquo;.  The report shows that between 1972 and 1982 bank borrowings by manufacturing industry increased in real terms by 6 per cent per annum while production volumes increased by only 3.5 <Col N="1647" /> per cent.  The report also demonstrated that equity capital relative to total assets is much lower in Ireland than it is in the USA, Japan or the UK.</P>
    <P>The problem has also been recognised and acknowledged by Members of this House through the report of an Oireachtas joint committee on manufacturing industry.  This report pointed to the under-capitalisation of small industry in this country and added that because of low profitability and the lack of any further equity investment this situation continues during the life of the company.  The report states quite clearly that &ldquo;finance is without doubt one of the major problem areas for small companies&rdquo;.  The Oireachtas joint committee's recommendations for bringing about a reversal of these trends included the encouragement of additional venture capital investment through the banks, other financial institutions and through private investors.  I am pleased to say that I view the committee's report as being entirely supportive of Government policy in this area.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Industrial Policy outlined the Government's commitment towards the encouragement of a greater level of risk investment in industry.  It would be a mistake, however, in tackling this problem, to assume that the lack of equity capital in industry is due only to the failure on the part of the investment community to provide the finance.  This brings me back to a point I made earlier. Many businessmen and entrepreneurs have a traditional reluctance to give up part ownership of their business in return for equity capital.  Many businessmen would prefer to rely on bank borrowings and State aid rather than to dilute ownership of their business.  Many small businessmen are quite happy to sacrifice the benefits of expansion in favour of a quiet life with an acceptable level of income and they are often motivated by a reluctance to accept the increased workload and responsibilities to shareholders associated with third party investment.</P>
    <P>Much of the reason for this traditional reluctance is the fact that native small <Col N="1648" /> industry is to a very large extent based on the family model.  In such circumstances, the view often is that family ownership is sacrosanct and investment by third parties an undesirable intrusion into the family's private affairs.  However, when faced with the sophisticated business world in which we live and the harsh realities of economic recession this attitude represents a narrow-minded and potentially dangerous approach.  There is definite need for a re-think and a need to change the attitudes of some small business people towards accepting outside investment.</P>
    <P>An over-reliance on bank borrowings by small industry produces a vulnerability to movements in interest rates with which most small businesses find it extremely difficult to cope.  This is particularly so in times of high levels of real bank interest rates coupled with inadequate cash flow which is a feature of many small and particularly start-up businesses.  Small businesses also often suffer, not from a lack of commitment on the part of the promoters, but a lack of management expertise.  The small businessman will often find himself in a situation where he has to perform the functions of salesman, accountant, production manager, personnel officer, market researcher and will very often have to perform all of these functions, and any number of others, within the course of a single working day. This imposes an intolerable burden on the promoters of small industry and often leads to failure.</P>
    <P>However, both of these difficulties can be overcome by a willingness to accept outside investment.  Equity capital does not require the repayment of interest on a regular monthly basis and the payment of dividends is related to company performance. Where small industry, and particularly industry in the start-up phase, is concerned many venture capital type investors are prepared to forego the payment of dividends in the initial years in order to ensure the future viability of the company.  Furthermore, many venture capital type investors adopt the US &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; approach and are prepared to inject a certain amount of management <Col N="1649" /> expertise and guidance into the firm in return for their investment.</P>
    <P>Existing businessmen and new entrepreneurs must be prepared to accept third party investment if industry is to survive and prosper.  The bottom line is that it is far better to own 50 per cent or 60 per cent of a successful business rather than 100 per cent of one that has failed.  The other side of the coin, of course, is the need to encourage both private and institutional investors to put more money into industry and thus satisfy the demand created by the new breed of entrepreneur.</P>
    <P>There has been a marked reluctance on the part of investors to put money into industry and this trend has been particularly noticeable in the past decade.  I suspect that there are many reasons for this but certainly one of the most significant has been the disincentive to productive investment by virtue of the more favourable tax treatment of other, less risky forms of investment, such as in property and Government gilts.</P>
    <P>The Government, in the White Paper, committed themselves to an examination of the tax code to see how the elimination of this bias might be achieved.  The Finance Act of 1984 introduced a number of relevant measures such as the elimination of bond washing and the restriction of tax-based financing.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there is significant potential for increased investment in industry on the part of our institutional investors such as pension funds and life assurance companies.  It is estimated that these institutions have an income of somewhere in the region of £400 million per annum and this is available for investment in one form or another.  At best, about 20 per cent of this money is invested each year in equities.  In the UK, however, similar institutions invest up to 50 per cent of their annual income in equities.  Most institutional investment in industry is conducted through the stock exchange and, while the institutions are significant providers of funds to the private venture capital houses, I am not convinced that the potential for channelling <Col N="1650" /> investment in this manner has been fully exploited.</P>
    <P>In 1984 I had discussions with representatives of the pension funds and the insurance industry on this particular topic and the exchange of views proved very beneficial. I would hope to be in a position to renew this dialogue in the coming months as I would very much like to review progress to date and to discuss the potential for new initiatives.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the Government's commitment to reviewing the tax code with a view to removing the bias which exists in favour of less productive types of investment.  The most significant initiative taken by the Government to date in this area has been the introduction of the Business Expansion Scheme.  Under this scheme individuals who purchase the new ordinary share capital of unquoted manufacturing companies or of companies providing internationally traded services, that is, those eligible for the 10 per cent rate of corporation profits tax, are entitled to write-off the amount of their investment, up to a maximum of £25,000 per annum, against their liability to income tax.</P>
    <P>The granting of income tax relief under the scheme is, of course, subject to a number of qualifying criteria.  However, the benefits to an individual who avails of the scheme are extremely generous. This is best illustrated by the fact that an individual who is paying income tax at the rate of 60 per cent and who makes a qualifying investment of £25,000 can write-off £15,000 against his income tax liability.  In such circumstances the net cost to the investor of a £25,000 investment is only £10,000.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the business expansion scheme is a major incentive to private investors to invest in industry.  Many economists, investment managers and others have argued, however, that tax incentives such as this will not remove one of the principal obstacles to productive investment which is the lack of suitable, well planned and profitable project ideas in which to invest.  There is, some say, already too much money chasing <Col N="1651" /> too few projects.  This is an entirely subjective argument which hinges on one's definition of what constitutes a suitable project.</P>
    <P>I am entirely satisfied that there is in this country at present a significant pool of new and established businesses offering opportunities for investment.  The major obstacle is not, therefore, the lack of suitable ideas but rather the unrealistic risk thresholds demanded by both institutional and private investors.  Once again, the report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses concurred with this point of view when they stated that &ldquo;there is an urgent national need which the market has failed to deliver on&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The venture capital business in this country has not yet developed to a point where it could be favourably compared with the venture capital business in the United States.  So-called venture capital in this country is targeted almost exclusively at better established companies with a good track record.  This is not altogether surprising as I would agree that the industry itself must establish a track record before it can become actively involved in genuine high risk investment. I am, however, anxious to ensure that the industry gets every opportunity to evolve along the lines of its US counterpart. The real lack of equity investment in Irish industry is at the start-up and early development stages and this is where genuine high risk investment must take place.  There is no lack of suitable project ideas in these phases; it is simply a case that the projects which exist at present do not come within the low risk thresholds demanded by our venture capital institutions.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to encouraging the development of a thriving venture capital industry in this country and I feel we can contribute to this development by the creation of an environment which is more conducive towards investment generally and through an integrated industrial development policy which will enhance the future profitability of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> As I said earlier, both I and my colleagues in Government fully recognise and acknowledge the value of a thriving stock exchange.  However, many small and medium-sized industries are not mature enough to contemplate a listing on the exchange and it is therefore necessary to provide suitable mechanisms whereby the stocks and shares of small and medium-sized industry can be actively traded.  Furthermore, if we are serious about encouraging a greater level of private sector investment in industry we must set our sights at generating a greater level of liquidity in our capital markets than exists at present.  For this reason I would recommend the development in this country of an over-the-counter market such as operates at present in the UK.  I feel that the development of such a market is probably inevitable in any case as the financial community cannot ignore for much longer the hiatus which currently exists between small industry and the stock exchange.  The only role which I perceive for the Government in the operation of such a market is a regulatory one.  There is a danger that it will prove far too tempting an opportunity for unscrupulous operators and if we are to ensure a high degree of investor confidence in such a market it must be seen to operate in a properly regulated manner.  My Department are urgently examining what is required in this area.</P>
    <P>I can understand why the stock exchange might view the establishment of an OTC with some trepidation and indeed suspicion.  I am sure however that they, no more than the Government, recognise the inevitability of this development and indeed I think that an efficient and properly regulated OTC could be in the best interests of the exchange itself. It has the potential to provide a type of interim market for the stocks and shares of small and medium sized industry and thus facilitate their development to a point where they might contemplate a full listing on the exchange itself.  In other words, an OTC has the potential to bring about an active market in industrial <Col N="1653" /> shares from which the exchange must ultimately benefit.</P>
    <P>I have based my views on this topic, not on some abstract notion, but on the conclusions of a consultancy report on the subject which I had commissioned some time ago.  Another feature of the consultants' recommendations for the encouragement of a liquid capital market was the desirability of amending company law to allow companies to buy back their own shares.  I view this as another extremely desirable development and as an integral part of the Government's policy for the promotion of industrial investment.  I hasten to add, however, that it is an extremely complex area involving not only company law but also issues of corporate taxation and while I cannot promise the immediate introduction of enabling legislation I can assure this House that, in consultation with my colleagues in Government, and the Minister for Finance in particular, I will be examining this issue as a matter of some urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that a public expression of my political will in this regard will significantly ease the minds of private investors in industry.  The generation of a greater liquidity in our capital markets is of particular importance to the private individual in the context of the business expansion scheme.  In order to qualify under the scheme, companies must not be quoted on the stock exchange.  Investors are naturally suspicious of making any investment in an unquoted company because they fear the prospect of being locked into the shares and unable to realise their investment for <Col N="1654" /> a longer period of time than they had anticipated.  I am not convinced that this is a major disincentive to the success of the business expansion scheme particularly in view of my stated commitment to resolving these difficulties.  However, it does mean that we have to tackle the problems that bit more urgently.</P>
      <P>The business expansion scheme should not be viewed as a panacea which will overcome all the financing problems facing Irish industry at a stroke.  It is, nonetheless, an extremely important initiative. Indeed, it is an excellent scheme and one which, I regret to say has had its fair share of criticism.  This criticism has been based on the complex nature of the provisions contained in the Finance Act, 1984.  I accept that the provisions are complex, but necessarily so.  The scheme is designed to encourage investment and to target this investment at the productive sectors of the economy.  If any scheme such as this is to be successful it is essential to ensure against potential abuse.</P>
      <P>The Government have reacted to some of the better informed criticisms of the scheme in a positive way by introducing some key amendments in this year's Finance Act.  Firstly, close relatives, such as brothers and sisters, fathers and mothers and so on, who have up to now been excluded will, from now on, be eligible for tax relief under the scheme.  This is a particularly important change as we are all aware that very often the only source of finance for a young entrepreneur is from a member of his own family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, the statutory ceiling on fees which may be charged by the managers of the investment funds contemplated under the scheme has been removed. Thirdly, the time limit within which companies engaged in research and development must start trading is being extended from two to three years in order to encourage investment in this type of activity.  Finally, companies with less than wholly owned subsidiaries and those with certain foreign subsidiaries will in future qualify under the scheme.  This is also an important amendment particularly in the context of firms who have established marketing subsidiaries overseas in order <Col N="1655" /> to promote the export side of their business.</P>
    <P>With the introduction of these amendments and with the introduction of the Bill currently before the House, the Government have demonstrated a willingness to make this scheme work.  I would like to see a reciprocal willingness on the part of private industry and the business community in general on whose shoulders the success of the scheme now rests.  Continued criticism of the scheme at this stage will only serve to demonstrate the truth in the age old maxim &ldquo;give a man an inch and he will take a mile&rdquo;. While the purpose of the business expansion scheme is the promotion of equity type investment in industry, a direct, and in my view extremely important, consequence is an increase in the number of private individuals who hold shares in industry.</P>
    <P>The most obvious benefit from share ownership is the return on the investment in the form of dividends or capital growth.  People are motivated to save in order to make provision for the future. They want to do so in a way that will preserve and hopefully enhance the real value of their savings.  Investment in shares is one way of achieving this aim.  I believe that an unnecessary mystique has been cultivated, perhaps intentionally, about share ownership.  I believe also that most people, given a little time and with the right type of information, could develop the expertise to buy and sell shares sensibly and profitably.  The media already provide an extensive and valuable information service on financial and investment matters but could, I suggest, devote a greater amount of coverage to educating the uninitiated.</P>
    <P>We are, after all, a property owning democracy.  This is evidenced by the fact that up to 75 per cent of the total housing stock in Ireland is owner-occupied.  From such a platform it is surely conceivable that we should also become a nation of share owners.</P>
    <P>This Government are committed to the encouragement of a greater level of share ownership among private individuals. <Col N="1656" /> For far too long labour and capital have been regarded as irreconcilable inputs in the economic equation.  The way to overcome this concept is, in my opinion, through the promotion of employee shareholding.  As Minister for Finance I was instrumental in introducing tax concessions to promote the idea of employee shareholding.  The attractiveness of these tax concessions was greatly enhanced by virtue of amendments introduced in the 1984 Finance Act.  As a result, I am pleased to note that a greater number of companies are showing interest in the concept of employee shareholding.  I believe, however, that this notion is not being fully exploited and too few companies have seriously considered the immense benefits which can be derived from the introduction of such schemes.</P>
    <P>When employees commit their capital as well as their labour to the company for which they are working, then both they and management are united with the common objective of making their company successful.  By achieving such a spread of wealth and share ownership it is possible to eliminate the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; mentality which has so often divided management and workforce to the detriment of industry.  When looking at successful economies, the togetherness of management and labour is a noticeable feature.  The employee shareholder knows that his reward depends on the success his company has in selling its products in the market-place.  The realisation soon dawns that this, in turn, depends on the ability of the management and the workforce to act at all times in a manner consistent with the long term well-being of the company.  I know of no more successful formula for achieving this goal than through the promotion of employee shareholding schemes.</P>
    <P>The framing of the business expansion scheme to extend eligibility to employees, therefore is, a critically important factor which represents the potential of the scheme to contribute to the equity base of Irish industry and it broadens its effectiveness through the promotion of employee shareholding.  I would be the first to acknowledge that <Col N="1657" /> activity under the business expansion scheme has been less than we originally anticipated.  The Government have, however, given a new impetus to the scheme with the amendments introduced in this year's Finance Act which I have already outlined.  It remains, therefore, for us to ensure the speedy introduction of the Designated Investment Funds Bill to eliminate the difficulties associated with the establishment of such funds and so put in place the final piece of a very attractive package.</P>
    <P>Under the business expansion scheme an individual may invest directly in the company of his choice or alternatively he may invest in a fund which has been designated for the purposes of the scheme by the Revenue Commissioners.  These &ldquo;designated investment funds&rdquo; have a crucial role to play in determining the success or otherwise of the business expansion scheme.  The experience of the UK authorities, where a similar scheme has been in operation for some years now, is that up to 90 per cent of total qualifying investments are made through this type of investment vehicle.  We anticipate a similar profile of BES investment in this country.</P>
    <P>Designated investment funds are a particularly attractive proposition to investors for two reasons.  Firstly, each participant has an interest in all of the investments made by the fund and so is able to obtain a fair spread of the risk associated with his investment.  Secondly, by investing through a fund, the individual has access to the investment expertise of fund managers who identify and actively monitor the companies in which they invest.</P>
    <P>The difficulties with regard to the establishment of designated investment funds lies in the fact that they come within the scope of existing unit trust legislation and as a result have certain constraints imposed upon them.  The purpose of this Bill is, therefore, to remove these funds from the scope of the Unit Trusts Act, 1972, and thus avoid a serious legislative anomaly.</P>
    <P>Let me explain, for the purposes of clarification, the differences between a <Col N="1658" /> designated investment fund and a normal unit trust scheme.  In an investment fund each participant owns a particular share in a particular company.  In a unit trust scheme each participant owns a proportion of the total holding of the scheme rather than owning a particular asset. Also in an investment fund all subscriptions must be paid up by a specific date nominated by the manager after which no further participants may join the fund. A unit trust scheme on the other hand is open-ended and a participant may join or leave at any time by buying or selling units of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Unit Trusts Act, 1972, provides that unit trust schemes may register under the Act.  The Act specifically provides, however, that schemes which do not register are prohibited from advertising. Investment funds would, therefore, be required to register under an Act, the provisions of which are wholly inappropriate for their purposes, in order to be able to advertise and invite subscriptions from the public.</P>
    <P>Two investment funds have already been established under the business expansion scheme and as such are currently subject to the provisions of the Unit Trusts Act.  There are, however, unregistered unit trusts who have chosen not to advertise and so remain within the law.  It would, of course, be unreasonable to expect all prospective fund managers to operate within this constraint.  There seems little point in introducing such generous income tax relief as is provided by the business expansion scheme if the main operators in the market are prohibited from informing the public of their existence.</P>
    <P>In order to provide further clarification let me outline briefly how these funds will operate.  Following designation by the Revenue Commissioners, each fund will advertise its existence and invite subscriptions directly from members of the public.  It may specify a minimum/maximum subscription to be made by each individual as well as a total target size for the fund.  The fund will also specify a closing date by which such subscriptions must be received.  After this <Col N="1659" /> closing date the fund manager may make suitable investments in targeted companies on behalf of the participants in the fund.  I feel that it is important to note that fund managers will act as a nominee of each individual participant who at all times retains beneficial ownership of the shares purchased on his behalf.  The subscriptions of each participant will be spread <i>pro rata</i> over all investments made by the fund.</P>
    <P>The main objective of this Bill is achieved by section 2 which removes the designated investment funds from the scope of the Unit Trusts Act, 1972.  The remaining sections of the Bill are designed to impose certain requirements on designated funds in the best interests of investors.</P>
    <P>The main aim has been to ensure that funds will provide the maximum possible information to prospective investors. Access to information such as that specified in section 5 of the Bill is essential if investors are to make an objective decision as to whether or not investment in a particular fund constitutes a good risk.  It is worth noting that the prospectus in which this information is required to be set out must also highlight the risk involved in investment in industry and advise all prospective investors to consult their accountant, stockbroker, bank manager or other professional adviser before proceeding.</P>
    <P>I do not consider it necessary or appropriate to attempt to provide in this instance for more comprehensive investor safeguards.  Ultimately, responsibility for assessing the bona fides of a particular fund will rest with the investor himself. Given the likely profile of these investors, that is those on a high income, and the range of information with which they will be provided, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the provisions of this Bill are more than adequate to protect their interests.</P>
    <P>Finally, I consider that it is important that I draw the attention of Senators to the provisions of section 6 which impose certain obligations on fund managers in <Col N="1660" /> regard to investments in private companies. This section provides important safeguards from the point of view of the investor.  In formulating the provisions of this Bill I have had consultations with representatives of the two investment funds currently operating as well as with other members of the business community who are prospective operators of such funds and as a result of this consultation I am confident that we have taken a pragmatic and at all times reasonable approach to resolving their difficulties.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this legislation coupled with the amendments to the business expansion scheme introduced in this year's Finance Act and to which I referred earlier will, I am sure, generate a much increased level of interest and activity under the scheme.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to welcome the Minister to the House with this Bill which is of major importance as far as the stock exchange and venture capital are concerned. Looking at it, I begin to wonder do we go far enough?  Looking at the position of the American market, which it appears we are trying to copy in a number of ways, are the provisions in the Finance Act, 1985, sufficient to encourage people to put their money at risk? What we are doing here is providing another vehicle as recommended by the Joint Committee on Small Businesses who carried out an indepth examination into manufacturing industry.  The main reason for the failure of small businesses was lack of capital.  The Minister rightly pointed out that the manager or owner of a business often had to merge five or six different bodies into one to try to keep his business afloat.  We must all realise that nobody can be master of everything. We try to understand the various problems involved in running a business, but nobody can carry both ends of the string at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Business failures have been due mainly to the fact that they were under-capitalised from the word go.  The Government, the IDA and other institutions in many cases were responsible for many of the <Col N="1661" /> small businesses that failed.  One begins to wonder whether the present system whereby the IDA invest in small manufacturing industries is the best way to use the initiative of the entrepreneurs concerned.  Would it not be more beneficial if State organisations were to take a major equity in some of those businesses rather than leaving the companies short of the financial clout which is necessary to enable them to survive?</P>
    <P>When you look at the stock exchange and see the small number of Irish companies quoted on it daily you wonder do we have a very elite shop where a very small number of shares are traded on a regular basis.  The only shares that ever seem to be traded at the moment on the stock exchange are the few major companies whose prices are quoted every day, the banks, the oil exploration firms and one or two of the major manufacturing groups.  The Press are to blame slightly too in that the number of stock exchange dealings for the previous day quoted in the Press is very small.  Looking at the unlisted market you will see that about ten or 12 companies are quoted daily.  To create an awareness among the public of this type of share dealing, all companies quoted on the stock exchange should be listed daily by the national papers.  I do not think this is too much to ask of them.  If you look at the American equivalent you will see that they are quoted every day.  There is one newspaper in America which is circulated throughout Europe which quotes every share traded in in America from the biggest to the smallest.  It quotes them from the various markets in the United States. We must create an atmosphere in which people with risk money will risk it in these types of small companies which need this capitalisation if they are to progress in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it would be better to own 60 per cent of a successful company than 100 per cent of a company that has failed.  Everybody is in agreement with that.  There remains another side to it.  What price do company owners have to pay for this type of equity and is the price too high?  Would it not be more <Col N="1662" /> beneficial to ask the financial institutions who, at the moment, are exporting their profits to hold those profits inside the country?  In the past few years many of our major banking institutions have exported funds which they have taken from the Irish people to set up businesses in America or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not have the information with him today but I am anxious to know how much of the profits earned by some of the banking institutions have been reallocated to foreign investment. Recently in this House we had to carry out a rescue operation on one of the major banking institutions.  Yet the chairman told us yesterday about the healthy days that lie ahead for that company.  Is it not more important that the profits from those healthy days should be reinvested and reimbursed to the taxpayer rather than giving them to many of the individuals who made the bad investment mistakes?  If Irish business people made the same mistake as was made by AIB with regard to ICI, they could go down the tube and neither AIB nor anybody else would come in to their rescue.</P>
    <P>It is important that we, as legislators, and the Government of the day should ensure that the profits made by the banking institution which made that mistake are recouped to State finances.  At that stage a figure of £120 million was mentioned as the maximum amount that could be the loss.  In recent weeks we have seen figures of the order of £200 million.  When the figure finally comes to light in three or four years time it may be in the region of £400 million or £500 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Much as I dislike having to interrupt you, Senator, you will have to get back to the relevant remarks on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  This is the only opportunity many of us may get to express our concern about the venture capital market and the way in which some of the banking institutions are using venture capital. That is my reason for going off course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On looking at the proposals in this <Col N="1663" /> Bill I begin to wonder how many people outside will be in a position to take up the opportunities that are being provided. How many people will decide to invest their money in these smaller companies? There would need to be a tremendous incentive for them to invest in companies rather than investing in Government stocks and gilts, which would more or less guarantee an investment return.  I feel that if there is to be an incentive here the profits made from the dealings, provided they are reinvested again in a roll-over situation in this type of market, should be at a very low rate of tax.  If they are to be taken out they should be taxed at a reasonable rate but definitely not at the same rate as they would be taxed if they were to be taken as profits from gilts.</P>
    <P>The Minister should note with some anxiety that some of the recent offerings of some of the already listed companies have not found takers.  Indeed, I believe that one institution recently found itself with quite an amount of shares in an oil exploration company on its hands after having a rights offer.  What I would fear is that, while there might be the best of intentions with regard to many of these proposed share offerings, they might not receive the support of public investors to the extent required to make them successful. I hope that the initial offers which are made will be monitored to such an extent that they will prove to be a success. We do not want to see a number of groups being approved and then going out, taking in investors' funds and failing.  This could be the most damaging thing that could be done as far as what is proposed in this Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister and his Department will do their utmost to see to it that the funds which go into those companies are invested as wisely as possible. He will not always be in a position to see the cowboys who are in the business, especially when other countries come and take some of the rich pickings that are known to have been taken with regard to share offerings, especially in the United States.  There have been quite <Col N="1664" /> a number of cases where people who were not in a position to suffer losses have suffered the extent that they may have lost their entire life savings.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he hoped that the people concerned would take the advice of either their bank managers, their stockholders or their accountants before they enter into those commitments.  Is it not a fact that most Irish people, especially most Irish business people, while they will consult the people referred to often take gambles in investing in various organisations?  There should be a system whereby one would be allowed a period of withdrawal.  People who give a commitment today might be allowed seven days to withdraw that commitment if they find that they had not been given the right information, or if they had not had time to consult the people whom they feel would be in the best position to give them advice on the matter.</P>
    <P>When we look at some of the other points in this Bill we see that it is a welcome move forward.  It is welcome because of the fact that it is hoped to create the necessary climate and give the necessary encouragement to people to become involved in this type of activity. I hope that when this Bill becomes law, as we all understand it will in the near future, it will be examined annually to see how it is working, to see how the provisions need to be updated, and to see what further incentives may be necessary to get people to take this type of risk and to expand further the business side which this is meant to help namely, small manufacturing business and small family-owned companies.</P>
    <P>The provision under which close relatives &mdash; brothers and sisters, mothers and so on &mdash; of the company owners are allowed under this year's Finance Act to become involved is a very good idea. Without the support of one's family one does not get into business nor does one stay in business.  Down the years the private companies which have expanded have expanded on a family basis.  Take an organisation such as the Smurfit Group.  It proves that a well-run family company can really expand and do great <Col N="1665" /> things.  We have seen it also with regard to earlier generations or the McGrath family.  Many of the other big family businesses have been built by the sheer determination of the family members to build those groups and to invest in them. Every incentive that can be given to them to further expand should be given and can, through the medium of the Finance Act this year and through this proposed scheme, be a major help.</P>
    <P>We have a large amount of money being invested in pension funds.  It is possibly time that some of this money which has been invested annually by the workers should, on their behalf, be reinvested to create jobs and to create employment. I would not like to suggest a percentage that should be reinvested.  A write-off should be allowed to those groups with regard to any losses or a percentage of the losses which might be sustained on any of those venture schemes in which they might become involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the major banking institutions I wonder whether it would be more beneficial if they were to be allowed a certain amount of write-off for any failures which they might have with regard to small manufacturing companies in which they might have invested.  It could possibly be a way for them to create necessary investment and necessary venture capital from their point of view.  The banks are already allowed a certain amount for bad debts under which they might be included.  If they were allowed 10 per cent, or were forced to put 10 per cent of their net profits aside to be made available the following year for selected companies under the supervision of the IDA for investment that would allow such companies, which are in need of finance in their initial years, to succeed. The amount of that investment would be held as equity by the banking institutions concerned and by the IDA until such time as the proprietors of the business might be in a position to buy it out.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a welcome move forward as far as venture capital is concerned.  We could well take a good, hard look at the venture capital market in the United States, in the UK and <Col N="1666" /> throughout Europe.  We can learn from the mistakes they have made.  We can see where we can go to create the necessary climate for the man in the street to be able to go in and invest small amounts of money in these companies.  We can give him the necessary encouragement and use his flair and initiative in the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>There is one point about which we can do very little.  It is that in rural areas the only type of stockbroker service that is available to many people is through the banks.  It is often not in people's best interest that they should have to take this avenue to stockbrokers.  The stockbroker firms should look at this to see if they could establish small offices on a regional basis which would inform their head offices or the stock exchanges of the requirements of people with regard to the buying or selling of stocks.  The establishment of small regional offices by the stockbroking firms would create an awareness among people of the services which they provide and of the workings of the stock market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like first to welcome the Bill as being a positive contribution towards the future development of this concept of investment under the scheme initiated under the 1984 Finance Act, which goes under the rather unwieldy title of &ldquo;relief in respect of investment in certain corporate trades&rdquo;. The original rules laid down in respect of the scheme in the 1984 Finance Act have been considerably loosened by virtue of the 1985 Finance Act, with particular reference to investments by, and on behalf of, related individuals and the permitting of these investments as being eligible investments under the 1984 Act.  That is a very welcome innovation.  It will expand considerably the number of companies who will take advantage of this excellent scheme in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows that the scheme in general received a wide welcome on all sides of this House when it was introduced by the Minister for Finance.  Quite a number of Senators expressed concern about the areas which the Minister has <Col N="1667" /> amended.  There were also fears of lack of success based on different criteria.  There was a lengthy debate in this House as to whether or not non-manufacturing industries should be covered by this type of legislation.  I notice that the Minister has returned to that theme in his speech and has quite rightly pointed out that the exceptional taxation benefits which it is proposed to give in respect of these investments are such that it is reasonable for the State to indicate, as a matter of public policy, in what area these investments should take place.</P>
    <P>The future prosperity of the country is dependent on our primary and secondary industries &mdash; our farming and manufacturing industries.  We should concentrate our job-creation activity in these areas as the jobs will follow automatically in other areas.  The Minister is wise to resist the temptation to expand the scheme to service areas.  If he did so, he would have a far bigger take-up but, once again, we would be falling into the easy option, as we have over the years, of permitting investment at advantageous terms in low risk investment.  The purpose of permitting this investment, and permitting such a large tax write-off in this investment of up to 60 per cent of the cost in respect of a high-paying tax individual, is to encourage investment in high-risk areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister was right to be consistent in that regard.  His review of the situation is realistic.  It is interesting that the Minister has identified as a problem the narrowing range of economic activity in the Irish stock exchange.  That is a very important consideration.  The number of options available to investors are diminishing. As the Minister says, there are 80 potential investment vehicles who have full quotations on the stock exchange, but not all of those are traded actively, nor are all of those available.  Only a few and very restricted number are available.</P>
    <P>The problem we are faced with as a result of that is that this has created a climate of opinion where people have not been encouraged to invest.  The small investor &mdash; the individual who may be relatively well-off in terms of income but <Col N="1668" /> not terribly well-off in terms of capital &mdash; has been encouraged to put his money in State investment, in the Trustee Savings Bank and various other institutions of that kind.  In other countries who have a more aggressive attitude towards the question of investment, there has been encouragement through schemes such as this for the small investor to get into investment in high technology and in other manufacturing areas which, though risky, also contain an element of potential benefit which far outweighs the steady return one gets on one of the safer investments.  It is right that the Minister should give proper and due consideration to expanding and creating an atmosphere where more people will think in terms of participating as shareholders in the economic life of the country.  That is one of the cornerstones of the Minister's objective, an objective which is shared by most of the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The Bill is fairly narrow in its application in that it does not deal with investment in the companies themselves, but deals with designated funds or groups of people who are banded together in order to make these investments.  If we ever hope to encourage the man with the spare £10,000 or £11,000 to invest in these companies we must provide him with two things to enable him to make that investment. First, we must provide him with a vehicle which will spread his risk and which will not have that individual's only available £10,000 invested in one industry, which must be high risk and, therefore, is more likely to fail than an investment in a safe, financial institution. The way in which we can do that is by bringing together groups of individuals in designated funds or unit trusts, or whatever, so that the £10,000 can be spread over many investments and the return is adequate and, at the same time, there is the stability which a wider portfolio of investment would give to the individual and the security which it would give to his investment.  That is the first thing we should provide.</P>
    <P>The second thing which we must provide is the managerial ability to assess the potential investment object &mdash; the <Col N="1669" /> company which is the object of the investment, the company to which the money is going.  We must provide a vehicle for that person.  We must enable the person who has no training himself to assess whether or not the investment in a particular company is a good thing or not.  I have no doubt that both these objectives are best dealt with by the concept of a designated investment fund.  That is where people are banding together.</P>
    <P>This fund should be of sufficient size to enable people to employ professional expertise to advise them on the range and stability of the options which are available in respect of that investment. Therefore, the concept of designated investment funds, as one of the vehicles for making these investments in the corporate trades to which I have referred, is a cornerstone of the future success of this innovation.</P>
    <P>I will have quite a number of difficult problems to raise with the Minister on Committee Stage with regard to the actual operation of the fund.  I will make one point to the Minister in advance so that he can prepare the information on it.  I am concerned that the Minister, in spite of what is in the Bill, by the control which he proposes to exercise over the issuing of a prospectus will, in fact, be seen to be giving some kind of guarantee to those people who are investing that their money will be safe.  In section 5 (4) (f) (ii) the Minister says that no liability whatsoever shall attach to the Minister, and no right to the relief shall arise by reason only of the Minister having given an approval under this section.  That will protect him in some way.</P>
    <P>There are certain circumstances in which that could be quoted with approval by the Minister in the case of any individual investor taking an action for negligence against the Minister on the basis of having wrongly approved a prospectus, advertisement or brochure under section 5 of the Act.  However, it is notorious in law that restrictions placed on people's liability by statute do not always work. The courts do not like them for a very good reason.  The Minister should look with extreme care at the various subsections <Col N="1670" /> of that section.  I will be taking him through it on Committee Stage.  I will bring to the Minister's particular attention the series of statements which begin with the following phrase: &ldquo;There will be within the prospectus a statement which the Minister considers to be adequate.&rdquo; In another case it reads: &ldquo;There will be within the prospectus a statement which the Minister considers sufficient.&rdquo;  Here the Minister is being given a task to do. He is being made the judge of whether or not the information is adequate.  The Minister's decision will be paramount.  In those circumstances the disclaimer which is in the Bill, drafted as it is, or indeed any disclaimer, will not protect the Minister should he arrive at a wrong decision as a result of these subsections.  The Minister will have to examine section 5 much more carefully.</P>
    <P>I support the concept of the Bill.  It has my enthusiastic support in that regard.  It is significant that section 6 of the Bill not only introduces a new concept to the designated investment fund itself but, in fact, it amends the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1984 in quite a significant way.  I do not know whether the general public or the practising lawyers and accountants dealing with these matters are sufficiently aware of that.  In fact, the Companies Acts are being amended by section 6 of this Act.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points which I will discuss with the Minister when we come to Committee Stage.  I would like the Minister to indicate why he thinks that only body corporates should act as the owners or trustees of a designated investment fund.  In other words, an individual cannot be the trustee.  It can only be a body corporate.  I would like to know why that is the case because I am not aware that body corporates are, by and large, any more honourable than individuals in the way in which they carry out their duties.  Body corporates are as honourable as the individuals who run them, no more and no less.  I am intrigued as to why that distinction is made.</P>
    <P>I would like to come back to the main thrust of what I said.  The Bill, as such, is a welcome addition.  It creates the last <Col N="1671" /> portion of the edifice which was commenced in the Finance Act, 1984.  It will enable the two designated investment funds at present operating to operate in a more open and fulfilling fashion.  It will enable and encourage the people to commence operations in the organisation of investment funds.  For all these reasons and for many other reasons, I welcome the Bill.  I welcome the concept behind it.  I hope the Minister will be able to deal with the various problems which will arise in this most technical legislation on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to add my welcome to this Bill.  Certainly, I see it as an incentive at a time when we badly need more investment in industry.  I am glad the Minister has a protective mechanism built into the Bill.  If there are some anomalies I am sure they will be teased out during the discussions on the various sections.  The Bill is in line with our thinking in the Joint Committee on Small Businesses. The Minister quoted the fact that we felt that there was a national need which the market had failed to deliver on.  We are moving into an age and a period now where the country will be dependent more and more on entrepreneurship. There are people with new ideas and a big pool of new resources to be tapped.  At the same time, there is the traditional business person who, for some reason or another, is unwilling to expand or fearful to expand.  There is a lack of expansion in many areas where there could be expansion at present.  It is felt now that there is a risk attached to expansion. People who would like to expand are very fearful of our tax system.  PAYE is seen as a burden on employment.  Some steps are being taken such as those in this legislation.  I am sure the Minister saw this as necessary following the report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses. He must try to bring it into some state of order that would be in line with the European taxation systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a bit of a shock when the Minister quoted the National Economic and Social Council report for the ten-year <Col N="1672" /> period between 1972 and 1982.  It states that borrowings by manufacturing industry increased in real terms by 6 per cent per annum.  Production volumes increased by only 3.5 per cent.  We must ask ourselves the question as to where did the 2.5 per cent go.  That is the kernel of the problem in manufacturing industry today and, indeed, in many small businesses. It would be interesting to know where that money went.  I say much of it was used to service debt.  Part of it would have been used to pay arrears of tax, be it VAT, income tax or whatever, or interest on that tax and interest on other bank loans.</P>
    <P>I would agree that there has been an over-reliance on bank borrowing by small industries which produces a vulnerability because of interest rates.  From our experience and our investigation when drawing up that report on small businesses, we found and verified that many industries had to resort to bank borrowing and they found themselves eventually having their businesses and their homes mortgaged for life.  That is a situation from which we would certainly like to get away.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support this Bill.  I am delighted that the Minister has accepted another part of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses. There are many other areas that need to be looked at.  I am very satisfied that the incentive to invest will be there. The Minister has clearly stated that he has built in protective mechanisms in the Bill.  I would certainly support that, no matter what other Senators may think about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, as a Member of the Labour Party I want to welcome the actual principles behind the Designated Investment Funds Bill, 1985.  We accepted it on the basis that we are in a mixed economy.  In such an economy if job creation is to grow and get a chance to improve there must be a viable manufacturing sector which can compete competitively with our European partners <Col N="1673" /> and also in other world markets.  Unfortunately, over the past two decades in this country the number of people prepared to invest in manufacturing industry has been relatively small, particularly Irish nationals or entrepreneurs.  They have been very slow to go into the area of capital investment in manufacturing. Certainly, we have managed to attract foreign industrialists into this area since our accession to the European Community.</P>
      <P>This has been particularly so in the American pharmaceutical world which saw immediately the tax advantages of investing here as an industrial base.  They also saw for themselves the advantage of a ready market in the European Community. They were prepared to expend capital in developing industry.  They did that on the basis that the regime the Minister is suggesting we should set up here now has been in operation in America for many years.  The public in America were prepared to invest funds in this area. Indeed, with many of these other unit trusts and pension funds and all the other available sources of money, they were prepared to invest it in this type of funding which gave them&mdash;admittedly it was a risk area &mdash; a very high capital return for their investment.  That is what coaxed much American money from individuals and from trusts in America.  They had the opportunity to invest with publicly quoted companies.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his opening remarks, was quick to point out that where you have an industry that has a proven track record the owners tended in the past to turn to bank borrowing to keep them in operation.  We now feel that the future for small companies in the manufacturing areas particularly is such that we are advocating that people should invest their funds in this way rather than in gilt-edged securities which will give them a guaranteed income, but a very small one and one with very little risk attached to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all have experience as public representatives of trying to entice industrialists into this country or to advise Irish entrepreneurs that there is a future in industrial development here.  We have <Col N="1674" /> come across the problem where shareholders in Irish companies with vested interests precluded foreign capital being made available.  I have experience of a natural resource in my constituency, the Ballingarry Mines.  Some of the shareholders who had confidence in the future of the mine went to America and elsewhere and negotiated financing packages which would have ensured the continuance of the mine and the employment therein.  For other vested interest reasons, they were precluded from putting large-scale amounts of money into an Irish industry like that.</P>
    <P>The Minister also emphasised that it is important that we should coax as many people as posible to invest in the manufacturing sector which develops our natural resources.  We all have experience of the importance in the agricultural industry of food processing, which I presume is covered as manufacturing in this Bill, because it processes our natural resources into an added-value situation. I would hope that that would be considered in this legislation as being a proper manufacturing industry as such. Irish Leathers, in my constituency have their problems because one of their subsidiaries, Plunder and Pollock, are likely to collapse because of a lack of capital. People were not prepared to put capital into what is, in fact, a viable industry with a world-wide market and a world-wide renown for their products, simply because the vehicle was not available in which people could invest in that type of industry.</P>
    <P>Having recourse to Fóir Teoranta and other State agencies &mdash; which is really only a fire brigade action &mdash; is something we turn to when we are in desperation. The reality is that if we are to put industry on its proper footing these fire brigade actions are not the answer to the problem.  We end up with Fóir Teoranta becoming a major creditor of a company which they have assisted.  They put management consultants into companies.  At the end of the day they can call the tune and suddenly put the company into liquidation.  If the company go into liquidation <Col N="1675" /> or into receivership, their markets collapse.  There is no incentive for the receiver or liquidator to continue the company in a trading situation.  He tends to close off all the loopholes and wind up and get what he possibly can for the State and for Fóir Teoranta instead of trying to develop the company to continue their business.</P>
    <P>For that reason, in a mixed economy this type of legislation is very important because for the first time it has been categorically set down that we are giving incentives to people to put money into manufacturing industry.  It has been used widely and wisely in America, with great success.  It has also been used in the British situation, as the Minister outlined in his speech.  The Minister said that in the UK 90 per cent of the total qualifying investments are made through this type of investment vehicle.  It must be useful for us to learn that the manufacturing industry in Britain have a similar type vehicle to this.  I am sure that, with the amendments which the Minister has conceded since the 1984 Budget and the 1985 Finance Bill, the necessary adjustments in releasing some of the strictures which were written in, will be an incentive for people to put money into manufacturing industry.  I would hope it will also create an environment which will give confidence to people to do so.</P>
    <P>There are large amounts of money available in this country, whether we like it or not.  It is a fact.  There is something like £400 million available in pension trusts and other areas which in the past have been investing in secure, small-return investments on the basis that they were doing it for the safety of their investors. Still, we have had other companies that started up in that area.  Suddenly they could go broke overnight and leave many small-time investors without any hope of recovering their life savings which they had put into them.  I do not have to put on the record of the House the names of the various companies which have gone in that way.  They are well-known to all of us.  They were assumed by the investors at that time, and <Col N="1676" /> reported by the companies themselves, to be almost gilt-edged, simply because they were in the insurance business.</P>
    <P>The large pension funds should show a bit of courage now in the knowledge that, if they invest their available cash in manufacturing, that is where the future of this country is and that is where the future of our balance of payments will lie.  In a manufacturing situation the manufacturer will naturally have to develop his product at home and abroad and develop an export market for it.  That is where the future lies for us, if we are to generate jobs in this sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Government, from what they have said in this Bill, have a commitment to do that.  This Government have been subjected, particularly from the private sector, to criticism about the levels of taxation and otherwise.  The private industrial sector have received a lot of support from this Government and from previous Governments.  We have always been liberal in this mixed economy in trying to assist people to stay in business. We have handed them so many incentives in our time that you would begin to wonder what is their brief in life.  Is it just the profit motive?  Is that the supreme motive for them to stay in business, or is there a commitment to giving employment to people?</P>
    <P>Anybody who has any experience of family firms and their commitment to continue in business for the sake of their employees will know they are extraordinarily good.  Family businesses have been very successful because of that commitment. Other companies, who do not have the same commitment to their areas, to their town, or city, tend to pack up when the going gets tough and will do so at the expense of the workers firstly.  The workers have had a major input in trying to ensure that industry will be successful. They have paid their taxes.  They have complained about them but at least they paid them.  Many in the private sectors have done neither.  They have not contributed by way of tax because they had exemptions.  When they abscond, or close down, or go into liquidation the vast majority of them owe money to the State <Col N="1677" /> because what they justifiably took from their workers was not passed on to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad that somehow or other this Government want to penalise the employing sector of this community. The opposite is the case.  I hope there will be a positive response from the private sector in the manufacturing area to this type of incentive which gives them a write-off on a capital investment of £25,000 or more.  That is a step in the right direction.  I hope that the private sector will respond positively to it and generate activity in different areas.  When you are Government and doing the best you can to tidy up the financial situation of the country, you wonder why incentives like this are not taken up in the interests of the country and in the interests of creating jobs for the people and trying to keep our people at home and gainfully employed.</P>
    <P>My experience in life as a public representative is that the vast majority of people who are out of work at the moment want to work.  They want an opportunity to work.  It is always expected that Governments should be directly involved in creating employment. In a mixed economy such as ours, in which we have electoral support for this type of legislation, any incentives which are given to the private sector should be availed of quickly in the interests of the economy as a whole.  Some effort is expected of the private sector to reduce our large-scale unemployment. This type of legislation will go a long way towards doing that.  I sincerely hope that when the Bill is enacted there will be an uptake to justify the confidence we all have in that sector, particularly in the manufacturing area.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister also commented on the stock exchange.  It is appropriate that at some stage this Government should comment on the stock exchange.  Many of us have relatively little experience of it.  Those of us who have witnessed the stock exchange in action in any part of the world, not alone Ireland, know that it is an amazing system, with companies being bartered <Col N="1678" /> publicly, being bought and sold at the whims of international money markets. It amazes me how the system can stay together and work.  It always amazes me how the capitalist system seems to survive in some way.  The Minister's comments on the Irish stock exchange were relevant in that the number of companies trading &mdash; as we understand the stock exchange to trade &mdash; is so minute that one wonders why there is a stock exchange functioning at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking not only family firms but other firms who want capital, instead of just borrowing from the bank, to offer equity shares in this kind of format.  That would bring the stock exchange right back into the picture where they should be, quoting these companies. If the companies have a viable future and the investment is reasonably good, I would hope the stock exchange could play a useful role in the development of Irish manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of the Bill.  I hope the response to it will justify the confidence of the Government in, once again, looking to the private sector to play their major part in the development of industry and job creation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I pay tribute to the Senators who have spoken with such welcome and such objectivity to this legislation?  I look upon it as a reasonably major breakthrough in encouraging family groups, individuals and other groups, to stimulate activity and to stimulate the desire to invest in small industry which can play such a part.  Indeed, in the future it must play a very substantial part in providing employment for our people.  For far too long we have looked to the introduction of foreign large scale industry which, indeed, made a major contribution but which left many subsequent tragedies and losses.  Those that are built within our own community and within our own families have the best opportunity and the soundest base for a successful future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have sympathy with many of <Col N="1679" /> the points raised but they did not relate directly to the text of the Bill before us. They related somewhat to the Finance Acts and to the Minister for Finance. The main purpose of this legislation is to remove constraints that are contained within the unit trust legislation of 1972 in order to make it more opportunist and to provide a greater incentive to the individual and to groups to invest.  I believe that that will have a very beneficial result.</P>
    <P>Senator Ellis said that the State should take a greater equity stake.  The undercapitalisation of companies was clearly identified in my speech as a major problem.  It was in an effort to overcome this problem that the business expansion scheme with generous tax relief to the investor was introduced.  The Senator also asked did we go far enough.  I outlined in my speech the benefits of the business expansion scheme.  A £25,000 investment would cost a top-rate taxpayer only £10,000.  In my opinion this is a large inducement.  Furthermore, this Bill helps to provide an important vehicle through which the investment can be made.  Regarding the activity of the exchange and a small number of companies, I agree entirely that the principal problem is that many companies see the stock exchange as a suitable means of raising finance.  We must seek to overcome this.  The stock exchange needs to be more market-orientated.</P>
    <P>Senator Ellis referred to the Finance Act, 1985 which introduced measures to make the retention of profits by foreign companies more attractive.  This was one of the very strong points.  In relation to capital gains tax, I sympathise with Senator Ellis's point.  However, it is essentially a matter for the Minister for Finance to whom I will bring the observations of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In connection with the stock exchange, the rights issue by Aran Energy has failed to realise the target set.  This again is not relevant to the legislation which we are considering this afternoon.  The point was made that the Minister should take advice from stockbrokers.  However, it was asked should the provision allow for <Col N="1680" /> withdrawal of money within, say, seven days.  This in itself is not a feasible proposition because if legislation did enter into that it would put administration of any particular scheme totally out of line.  Sensible people must consider all facets before they invest their money, and they must take advice.  The majority of sensible people who have money to invest will do that.  Then, having satisfied themselves, certainly they could not go back in in seven days and say, &ldquo;Unfortunately, I feel I made a mistake.  I got the wrong advice&rdquo;, because that would make any scheme difficult to administer.  Again, the Senator made a very valuable point about the annual re-examination or the annual monitoring.  Certainly this legislation will be very closely monitored right through and this is very necessary.</P>
    <P>I am continually in contact with the banks to examine potential issues to help industry.  This is an ongoing situation about which the Department and Minister are continually informed.  Regarding pension funds, as I mentioned in my speech, I am anxious that pension funds should invest more of their funds in equities. With this in mind I propose to discuss this matter with the pension funds and the life assurance companies.  Regarding the need for the regional stockbrokers to help, I will take up this matter in my proposed discussions with the stock exchange to see if they can decentralise information centres in order to attract more people and to give them greater involvement in the light of the legislation we are now proposing.  We want widespread support.</P>
    <P>I stated that the venture capital business in this country is in its initial years. We are, of course, reviewing the situation in the United Kingdom and the United States.  We would hope to learn and benefit from the experience of these two countries and are basing much of our experience on them.  Senator O'Leary said that it is important to succeed.  I think the Government have shown a willingness to make the scheme work.  I agree with Senator O'Leary that we should not widen the scheme any further at this stage.  We should wait and see that <Col N="1681" /> the fears are realised before we overreact to further criticism.  The point was made by Senator Lynch that VAT borrowings at 6 per cent to manufacturers should increase output.  Undoubtedly, bank borrowings and interest-free payments have been the millstone around the neck of industry and have actually crippled firms.  I agree with that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris raised the point of the agricultural side and food processing as part of the manufacturing industry.  Food processing industries are qualified and are eligible for the 10 per cent corporation profits tax.  I cannot provide an answer to this.  It is primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I suspect, however, that they do qualify within the terms of the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the report of the Agenda for Practical Action I dealt with the chapter concerning women in the home.  I mentioned that we very often forget to pay justifiable tribute to those women who give up very good careers in order to stay at home with their children and whose payment would be impossible. Even the committee who dealt with this report disagreed as to how one could possibly compensate these women for the wonderful work they are doing.  I can easily understand why, because you could not possible put a value on the work that is done by a woman in the home and by a mother in particular.  They also disagreed on what kind of social welfare contributions would be needed to allow these women to have benefits.  The cost was the biggest problem.  If sympathy is any good, they have my sympathy because we do not look after them to the extent that we should because of what they are doing.</P>
      <P>I welcome one thing that has happened for the many women who go out to work each day and also combine the role of mother and housekeeper.  I welcome the fact that there are career breaks in line at the moment because even a 12 month career break can do an immense amount of good for some woman who is under extreme pressure.  In praising the role of the mother who stays in the home, in no way do I take away from the excellent contribution made by women who go out to work and who do two jobs.  Working with quite a few colleagues who share that difficult chore I have nothing but admiration for them because they are leading very difficult lives and we are very lucky that they manage to combine both tasks extremely well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee on women's affairs dealt at length with the role of women in the home in housing estates: some of the problems they have; their feeling of isolation.  Many of these housing estates, built on the edge of town, may be too far away to allow women to walk into town to do the shopping.  The questions of traffic on the road and transport have <Col N="1683" /> been dealt with quite well in the report. The main thing needed is some action to follow that.  Indeed, the question of through-traffic in housing estates is a serious problem.  In many towns now we have bypasses and, while it may be a long process before we have the main traffic taken away from the towns, and while some towns may not like the idea, this certainly would ease the dangers involved, not only for mothers and fathers, but for the many children in these estates. I welcome the idea.  In my own town a bypass is being planned at the moment. In the long term it will lead to quite a degree of safety in comparison with what we have at present where traffic is heavy and many children are in danger.</P>
    <P>They also discuss the problem of many of these housing estates being rather barren places.  That is changing a bit. Down in Carlow we had a new scheme opened not so long ago and it was a revelation to see how pleasant it was with mature, eight year old trees planted along the driveway and at least one tree in every garden.  That took away the completely barren appearance you can get in housing estates.  The people were absolutely charmed with their new housing scheme.  I am sure it will give them a sense of pride, if nothing else, and encourage them to make sure that it is kept intact.  They have set up a committee to have the grass kept in line and cut.  If a certain standard is set for people they will continue to keep that high standard.  I could not agree more with the worries expressed by the committee that some of these housing estates are so barren and give a sense of isolation and sometimes desolation that they are in the middle of nowhere.  They have only blocks of houses.  That phase would want to pass very quickly.  It does not take that much extra expense to have some trees and shrubs and make the place look as if it is a very nice place to live.</P>
    <P>The planning of schools should be part and parcel of any building estate.  Now-days long term plans for towns invariably have what appears to be a completely unnecessary lineup of facilities.  Schools are generally marked in where they will <Col N="1684" /> be needed later on as the town expands. That problem is dealt with in the report. It is being dealt with by most planners now.  We have gone beyond the stage where it is enough to build houses and hope that everything else turns out all right.  People will be walking to school; walking long distances to town.  There is also the question of providing footpaths for prams and seeing that steps are sited where necessary.  It shows that this committee were not just dealing with airyfairy stuff; they were dealing with actual problems faced by women in these housing estates.  The whole question of house design could take a lot of time because, just as architects plan schools and hospitals and so on with no particular personal knowledge of many of these things, homes are designed invariably by men, I suppose, who see a certain amount of space giving a certain return.  Women could very often have far better ideas. It is something that the committee will follow up and see to it that in the design of houses, apart from their appearance and their beauty, we are not simply getting a few more square feet out of a certain area at the expense of women in the home.</P>
    <P>The need of women for support by the health services is very important.  I welcome the whole idea that women in general will be looked after and that they will have support groups to help them. There is the question of women who perhaps will have to leave home when the family is reared and go off out into the world job hunting.  It is no harm to have services available to give them advice. Many of these are highly-qualified women who have already given up good careers, and a small refresher course could bring them back into line and they could continue to play a further role in helping this country.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome this report and I hope that many of the very excellent ideas in it and the excellent plans will be put into practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to add my thoughts to what has already been said in discussing this most valuable <Col N="1685" /> report.  I compliment the Minister of State with special responsibility for womens' affairs and the task force or working party of an inter-departmental nature which she had with her, who brought together so much relevant information and data on women in Ireland in 1985.  This is a valuable source document for all of us who are interested in this area.  I like the title of it.  It is a practical agenda for action, or an agenda for practical action, whichever way you look at it.  It means the same thing.  I hope it will act as a spur and an initiative.  I said yesterday when speaking on the EC directive on equality in social matters, that recommendations which are not speedily translated into legislation are of as much use to those whom they concern as a stone parachute.  I would like to see, as speedily as possible, very many of the aspirations in this report translated into practical legislative effect.</P>
      <P>It is important and most appropriate that here in Seanad Éireann we should have a lengthy, informed and thoughtful debate on this area.  It is a pity that of 60 Senators only six of us are women.  It is not that the male Senators have not contributed to this debate.  Indeed, I am very pleased to see that so many of them have.  I have read what they had to say with great interest.  But, again, it is just an illustration of a certain imbalance or lack of full, complete and total representation of Irish women in the totality of Irish society that there are only six of us here in this House.  An Leas-Chathaoirleach, you are the sole female member of your political party in this House, and I of the Fine Gael Party.  I feel that it is a matter of some regret.  I hope on another occasion that that imbalance will be redressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister of State who is with us here this afternoon is tomorrow leaving for Nairobi to attend a most important international conference which will mark the closing year in the UN decade for women.  I imagine that she will be taking copies of this report with her as an illustration and an indication of the situation of women in Ireland in the year 1985.  I have no doubt that the <Col N="1686" /> view and the thoughts contained in this report will be widely disseminated and discussed and considered by the women at this conference from all over the world. Its publication is timely and I have every confidence that it will travel.  It shows us what has been achieved but, more important, it indicates to us what has yet to be achieved.  We are a long way off the equality that so many of us yearn for and which has been a spur to us and has drawn many of us into the political forum in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Also attending this conference in Nairobi is Deputy Barnes, who is no stranger in the whole area of women's rights. There is also, I understand, a very representative cross-section of Irish women from the media and from many of our women's organisations.  I look forward to hearing what they have to say about that conference.  I feel, as in everything, there should be a two-way flow of information and I hope that all of us will be circularised and that there will be plenty of publicity engendered in the national press and, indeed, in the local press about this conference. Many of us would wish to be there and will be there in spirit.  So, we must rely on the free flow of information coming back to us from the conference.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge made a very interesting comment in his contribution to the debate in relation to this report.  I agree with him whole-heartedly.  He said minor reform is not enough: what we need is a revolution. It is unusual to hear somebody like Senator Jim Dooge preach revolution. He went on to talk about its duel meaning, that it could be the spinning, or the turning of the wheel, which is perhaps the more gentle and constructive motion than a rapid turnover from one state of being to another.  I would expect him to have the former in mind rather than the latter.  But, of course, he is right in saying that what we need is a revolution in thought.  We need it in the thought of women who will perceive their own situation as one that is capable of being changed.</P>
    <P>More important, perhaps, we need a revolution in the perceptions that men have of women.  This is the key note area <Col N="1687" /> and sometimes I become very despondent about this because I just do not see it happening at all.  As we sink into an economic recession the bright hopes and the sparkling future that many of us had before us in the late sixties and early seventies seem to recede that little bit more and the perceptions that men have of women and that women have of themselves have become clouded by pressing economic realities.  Some of the things that we would like to see happen appear perhaps less important when compared with more pressing and more urgent day-to-day economic issues.</P>
    <P>I feel very deeply that we should never lose sight of a vision which we have and which we share in common, that is, total equality, not in the sense of being absolutely equal in every respect but of complimentarity, of having our roles co-equal and complementary, male and female one to another.  Until this latter problem which I have spoken of, the perception which men have of women, is solved &mdash; and it can only be done slowly and painfully through the education system and through legislative reform &mdash; we will always have difficulty in relation to bringing about that complementarity and equality of which I have spoken.</P>
    <P>This report, as I say, is comprehensive. It covers a great number of areas.  I propose in my contribution to dwell on what it has to say about the health services.  It is interesting to note that the original report of the Commission on the Status of Women did not include the area of health.  Therefore, the inclusion of it in this report is an innovation and it is important because it is in the area of health and well-being of women that it is essential to lay a certain emphasis and stress.  I welcome this departure in this report.</P>
    <P>It covers many areas in relation to the health of women but one that particularly interests me &mdash; perhaps because I have had experience of it myself &mdash; is in the whole area of maternity services for women.  For many women, labour and indeed the delivery of their babies is an endurance test and an ordeal which, for <Col N="1688" /> far too many women leaves both physical and emotional scars.  We have to examine what childbirth is in the eighties and see what we can do again in the area of changing perceptions of it both among women and their spouses, the medical profession, the para-medicals and everybody who had anything to do with what should be a joyous and meaningful experience for women but which for so many is not quite that.  The way women feel about childbirth and the way they are treated when they are having a baby are in some ways symptomatic of the whole condition of women in our society and it spotlights what it is that is unique about being a woman.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly, and it echoes this attitude in the report, that no woman should ever be reduced to a state of infantile dependence when having a baby.  She should approach it in an educated, informed way and all the services that will make it possible for her to do that should be apprised of their role in that whole area.  A woman is entitled to knowledge and entitled to guidance and, indeed, to the skilled help which could allow her to play her part in her labour actively and with human dignity.  The thrust of the report in relation to the maternity services underlines that type of concept and as such I welcome it.  It is modern thinking; it is progressive thinking; it is in tune with women of the eighties.</P>
    <P>I have very strong feelings about ante-natal clinics.  I know that staff in our maternity hospitals and in general hospitals where we have maternity services work very hard and very often in situations where they are in fact undermanned and over-stressed.  But nevertheless I feel that every person who presents herself for ante-natal care should be accorded a certain dignity and should be treated not as a statistic, as one more <i>prima gravida</i> or <i>gran. multip.</i> to be seen and recorded.  Attention should be paid to the emotional and psychological need and wellbeing of that woman.  Again, that type of attitude is encapsulated in the report.  Very often, a woman who presents herself at an ante-natal clinic suffers a certain loss of identity, a rather <Col N="1689" /> frightening loss of identity.  She becomes just another pregnancy amongst many others sitting very often on a bench and her contact is minimal with the health care people whose sole function it is to look after her.  If she is a straightforward case very often she is rushed without much ceremony through the procedures related to her ante-natal visit.  That is a pity.</P>
    <P>I also feel strongly about health education where you have a captive audience in an ante-natal clinic and this is referred to in this report.  It has been my experience, as a member of the South-Eastern Health Board, which I was until last week, that the book produced by the health education bureau, the <i>Book of the Child, Pregnancy to Four Years Old,</i> was not being circulated in the ante-natal clinics in my health board area.  I note on page 116 of the report that there is emphasis on the need for the widest circulation of this booklet particularly in the case of category one mothers.  I absolutely endorse this.  I had to get a notice of motion passed at the South-Eastern Health Board to ensure that that booklet which was published with public funds would be widely disseminated and circularised in the ante-natal clinics of the South-Eastern Health Board area.  In fact, I came up against a certain reluctance to do just that.  The reason for the reluctance was self-censorious attitude which is adopted by certain health care professionals.  Because that book contained full and adequate and pictorial advice and information on family planning, certain people felt that it was not appropriate that it should be made available to those who most needed it, the mothers attending the ante-natal clinics. I am very pleased that in my small way I was able to overcome that type of attitude.  The book is now available to those who would benefit from it.  I regard it as outrageous that certain health care professionals should adopt that sort of attitude of censorship and would take it upon themselves to decide what was and what was not appropriate by way of health education for pregnant mothers. Obviously, I was gratified to see something <Col N="1690" /> which I felt so strongly about incorporated in this report.</P>
    <P>Having a baby has the most important social consequences.  Society is justifiably concerned to ensure in so far as is possible the safety of mother and baby.  We must also remember that it is also a personal matter for each mother who is having a baby and that the personal and intimate aspects of child bearing are becoming more and more ignored in favour of the larger administrative issues relating to the child bearing population as a whole. It is a great pity that just when we have the advanced technology and the most streamlined procedures we seem to lose sight of the unique personal experience it is for each mother to go through the whole business of ante-natal care, labour and delivery.  It is an area we must home in on and examine very closely; it is of the utmost importance.  If we fail in this we will fail completely.</P>
    <P>There is a certain tendency to advocate home births.  I am interested in this but perhaps the interests of the mother and the baby in most cases are best served if a birth takes place in a fully-equipped and consultant-staffed unit of a maternity hospital or such a unit in a general hospital. I understand the emphasis on home births, but home birth I think is suitable just for some people.  I wonder if we have sufficient trained mid-wives, domiciliary care and obstetricians available to give this the attention it deserves.  I fear that we have not and I would hate to think that people who decided that this is the way their babies are to be born might live to regret that decision.  By and large I believe the best way to have a baby is in a consultant-staffed unit.</P>
    <P>I also note that the report dwells on the early days of motherhood and the changing role suddenly and dramatically experienced by many women who give birth.  It also emphasises that our extended family network is not what it was, and that so many young mothers find themselves isolated from relations and extended family and work friends in their new situation of motherhood.  As a society we have failed to give a certain adequate transitional support to young <Col N="1691" /> women who find themselves in this situation. It is emphasised by the way many women feel that their self-esteem and self-image have received a sudden and perhaps unaccustomed dent in the wake of childbirth.</P>
    <P>For many women, contrary to what we see in images on television and in magazines, there is no sudden instant motherhood which attaches itself to you, and the appropriate maternal emotions do not always come on stream as they should.  Very often many women feel a sense of enormous fatigue which can lead to depression and frustration in the wake of giving birth to a baby and they have great feelings of isolation.  As a society we should recognise that.</P>
    <P>I note that in the report reference is made to the necessity for having mother and toddler groups in urban areas.  This is a useful and valuable suggestion and one which could be generated within communities and would not necessarily involve expenditure of large amounts of money.  It would create tremendous emotional support both for the women and the families generally if there was this network of contact and support from other women.  It is also very good for the socialising of young children.  It is to be encouraged if at all possible.  Perhaps many of our schools could be encouraged to make a room available after hours to small mother and toddler-baby groups in different communities.  While these people have a great wish to get together, there is a problem of accommmodation. There should be some liaison to ensure that this accommodation becomes available to them to deal with this difficulty.</P>
    <P>This transition from single status to that of wife and then mother is made much easier for people in a peasant society where the extended network exists.  In our modern world where so many people have careers, live away from home and are removed from that kind of interaction with family and friends, the need is all the greater.  We should recognise it.  Motherhood in the eighties is not the sole aim and justification of the existence of women.  Many <Col N="1692" /> people would hark to earlier times and wish that it were so.  It is not, and we must deal with what is rather than being nostalgic about what was in former times.</P>
    <P>Other areas of the report I should like to comment on revolve around caring for the elderly which is referred to in Chapter 4 on health.  It falls to the lot of many women who are in their middle years, and perhaps experiencing much trauma in their own lives by way of children leaving home, the menopause, inter-personal difficulties with their spouses, to care for elderly relatives and elderly in-laws in many instances.  A great number of people do this with skill, love and care and do it very well in an uncomplaining, patient and accepting way.  I would commend, praise, compliment and give credit to the many thousands of women &mdash; because it is particularly the function and role of women &mdash; who do this work, but for many it is less straightforward.  They experience a great deal of stress and strain in attempting to do what they would see as their duty in this regard. They are short-changed by the State because by keeping their elderly, ill, and infirm geriatrics in the home and caring for them, in effect, they save the State enormous sums of money.</P>
    <P>A woman came to me the other day to talk about this very factor.  She is caring for her own parents and her mother-in-law in a bungalow.  They have built on a granny flat.  She is typical of a great number of people who are involved in this kind of a situation.  Her husband is a builder.  We all know that industry is not in great shape at the moment.  They are going through a certain amount of economic strain and she is finding it exceedingly difficult to cope with the added burden of three elderly people.  She was looking for a part time job but one did not come on stream because jobs are in short supply.  A social welfare worker asked her if she would consider becoming a home help to care for the elderly in somebody else's home.  She was told the remuneration she would receive which is small but in the context of her own domestic budget she could have done with that money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> Not surprisingly, she asked the question: &ldquo;Could that resource not be transferred to me in my own home since I am caring for three elderly relatives?&rdquo; This is not the way the scheme is administered and she could not be accommodated. The scheme does not have the necessary flexibility to allow this kind of adjustment to be made.  It is an interesting comment on the depersonalised systems within which we find ourselves working.  Instead of going out to look after somebody else's elderly and perhaps somebody else coming in to look after hers, the necessary adjustment should have been made so that she could have been reimbursed for her goodwill in this regard.</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed some time ago by the South Eastern Health Board and an attitude of mind prevailed that to reimburse or to pay relatives for looking after their own was in some way going against the natural order.  I should like to think that everybody could take on board two elderly relatives, or three elderly relatives, or even one, and not incur any extra expenditure and not wish to be reimbursed.  It is just not possible in the Ireland of the eighties for everybody to have this traditional way of looking at things.  We need to sharpen up a bit and examine this area very closely.  Until women speak up and point to the hardship than many of them are suffering in this area nothing will be done about it.</P>
    <P>I look to the Minister of State for a response in relation to this.  A very valuable booklet has been brought out entitled: &ldquo;Who Cares for the Carers?&rdquo;, written by Mary Noonan; I like the title of it and wonder who does care for the carers; those who provide support and back-up for our elderly.  The cost of keeping the geriatric patient in hospital is great.  When we talk about transferring resources from hospital-based medicine to community care, it is an area in which we could valuably make a start and relieve the burden of so very many women.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about a certain <Col N="1694" /> unevenness among the different health boards in the way in which they provide for the area of health care for women.  I note that one of the recommendations in the report is that the Department of Health should undertaken an early review of the total volume of provision and need in the country and examine the inconsistency of provision within the different health boards.  This is important as I feel that there should be a certain harmonisation of approach within the different health board areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the health board funding of various services which relieve the plight and distress of women. In this connection, there is a need for family crisis centres or, as they were commonly called, battered wives' shelters but I do not like that terminology.  The movement is growing throughout the country and people are seeing that it is important to have this type of crisis intervention centre for families who find themselves in difficulties.  I thank the Minister of State who, from the funds at her disposal, saw that such a project in County Waterford, Oasis, received £1,000 recently. Those of us on the committee look forward to the commencement of the provision of purpose-built premises for family crisis intervention.  We are very grateful to the Minister for her support in this regard and we are also grateful to the South Eastern Health Board who have subvented this project.  Once again I congratulate the Minister on the report and thank her and the working party for putting it together.  I wish her well on the Nairobi excursion and I look forward to having the feedback in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>As requested, I will be brief in my comments as I understand the Minister is anxious to reply before the adjournment for tea at 5.30 p.m.  It is unfortunate that we are discussing this motion at the same time as we are discussing the motion welcoming the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. These two motions deal with matters which overlap.  On the other hand I am pleased and I shall reserve my comments which time constrains me from <Col N="1695" /> making now for my speech on that motion.</P>
      <P>One thing that strikes me is the change that has taken place in the past 20 years and one of the things that makes like worth living in 1985 is the fact that we are living in a rapidly changing society. It is interesting to reflect upon the fact that 20 years ago we were embroiled in a debate in both Houses on the then Succession Bill.  People on this side of the House were saying, with the notable exception of John A. Costello, that it was wrong to give a woman her statutory legal right of succession.  It was one of the big debates in the autumn of 1964.  I am glad that the Bill, as then proposed, was enacted and that our party accepted ultimately the advice of John A. Costello in dealing with that measure.  I make this point to indicate the type of change which has taken place in our society in the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>In 1971 we were debating in this House the whole question of maintenance when the statutory right of a woman, and I use the word &ldquo;right&rdquo; purposely, was simply a maximum payment of £4 per week. Maintenance was then based on the concept of desertion.  I am glad that we in this party in Government &mdash; when Deputy Cooney was Minister for Justice between 1973 and 1977 &mdash; brought in legislation which put maintenance on a proper basis and it is now based on a recognition of the rights of both partners to a marriage and to the children of that marriage, relative to total earnings of the family.  I mention this to indicate the rapid change in attitudes in relation to the family and in relation to the role of the women within the family, in particular, that have occurred in the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>The comments I should like to make relate purely to Chapter 10 of the report dealing with family law reform.  I welcome the report and I commend the Minister on ensuring that the working party were brought together and that such a fine report, dealing with every aspect of the women's role in society, was produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two areas where it <Col N="1696" /> is necessary to have legal reform.  First, there was the Children Bill.  The introductory remarks in Chapter 10 deal with the various Departments who have responsibility in this area.  I would like the Government to establish a Department with specific responsibility for law reform.  The roles and the functions of the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and other Departments should be brought together.  We should face reality and give one Minister total responsibility to introduce the necessary legal reforms which affect a family and which affect the woman within the family.  We have not faced up to this. In this Government we have a Minister with responsibility for women's affairs, with responsibility for law reform.  The time has come to establish a Department of law reform because so much needs to be done in this area.  In doing this we could take on board the fund of knowledge, information and experience available within voluntary organisations and the universities.  Like <i>Building on Reality,</i> we should set ourselves a time-scale for the enactment of legislation in particular areas.  I know the Minister is committed to doing this but I would like to see certain reforms introduced in the life of this Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the first step in the reform of the law in relation to children.  Procedures are totally inadequate. People involved in the court system, from a health board point of view, and in trying to protect children find themselves totally frustrated by the existing inadequate legislation.  We have two procedures available, the place of safety order and the fit person order which are measures that do not respect the dignity of the child, the mother or the father of that child in any situation where necessary steps have to be taken.  I welcome the role that the Minister of State played in ensuring that the first Bill has been published in the area of reforming the law in relation to children.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned in Chapter 10 is the whole question of family courts. As a lawyer having acted for women and men in family cases, I have had the horrible <Col N="1697" /> experience of having to deal with my clients in draughty corridors and dirty courthouses in various parts of the country. In so far as somebody is having his or her right within marriage determined those rights must be determined and adjudicated upon in a situation that respects the dignity of both parties.  That does not happen in rural Ireland at the moment.  Within Dublin the situation of course is different because there are adequate family courthouses.</P>
    <P>I also take the point made in the report in relation to the procedures which should be available within family courts. I take the point that existing procedures are totally unsuitable for dealing with family matters.  While I accept that there are certain constitutional difficulties in reforming the type of procedure which we have available I never stopped thinking that it was something which should be taken on board.  It can be difficult for a lawyer or for a legislator to appreciate the difficulties which existing procedures cause the parties who are in distress because within this House we as legislators, and some of us as lawyers, have great knowledge of these procedures. But somebody who comes to a court for the first time on a matter of this nature is faced with something that is absolutely frightening and very frequently as a result of that initial fright the true facts of the situation may not be outlined.</P>
    <P>I also take the point in relation to the training of judges.  We should establish, certainly within the High Court and also within the lower courts, a rota of moving or roving circuit judges who would deal specifically with family matters.  While there are constitutional difficulties there it is something which should be taken on board immediately.  We can legislate and we can provide the framework and the machinery but that is not going to win total acceptance unless we operate in a way that is acceptable to the person who is distressed and who we are trying to help.</P>
    <P>I am watching the clock.  One other matter I would like to mention brifely is the question of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wanted to clear that because my main concern &mdash; and I think this is well known by my colleagues that I like to give Senators who participate ample time but unfortunately I indicated otherwise to Senator Durcan &mdash; was that the Minister would get her own time because of her long trip tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I will keep most of my comments for the other debate but one other area which affects women and men and which is something I would like to see serious and immediate consideration being given to, is the old question of nullity.  While we are considering the question of marriage in a broader sense and while we are looking at other aspects and other reliefs available, mainly the question of divorce, I still think we should look separately at the question of nullity. The Minister should reactivate immediately consideration of the Costello report and the draft Bill which is attached to that report.  There are many people who will find relief if we have an adequate nullity procedure available in this country.</P>
      <P>It is very interesting to bear in mind that in Britain where legislation was introduced in the mid-thirties there was a broadly based nullity procedure which as far as the civil courts are concerned is much wider than ours.  We should try as far as possible to bring our nullity procedures into line with the developing ecclesiastical jurisdiction being exercised by the ecclesiastical courts of the Roman Catholic Church.  Many people are getting relief there but are finding themselves in legal difficulties from the civil point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tried to cut my remarks very short and perhaps I did too much cutting.  I simply want to conclude by welcoming very warmly the work which the Minister of State has done in this whole area over <Col N="1699" /> the past two and a half years by welcoming the report which she commissioned and which an excellent working party produced and by simply saying that this Government have two and a half years left to complete the duties and the objectives which we set out upon two and a half years ago.  I would like to see that much of the legislation, certainly in the legal area which I mentioned, will be introduced and enacted before we go the the country at the end of 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>In concluding this debate I would like again to thank Senators for their contributions and to emphasise the importance of feed-back such as I have received, particularly in the way the Senators dealt with particular sections and recommendations of the report.  The aim of this report was to review the existing situation of women in Ireland identifying the areas requiring action and to consider measures to provide more positive opportunities so that the full potential of women in our community can be realised.  I believe that the report has met these objectives and deals comprehensively with all aspects of the living conditions of Irish women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In publishing the report the Government agreed to the preparation of a programme of action in the women's affairs and family law reform area and I am now engaged in preparing this programme of action.  But reforms have already happened or are in progress in a number of areas, including family planning, dental and optical scheme for pregnant wives of insured workers, the reform of the laws on illegitimacy, child care legislation and the establishment of a pilot conciliation scheme as well as a range of developments in the education area.  The report represents the first public recognition by an Irish Government that women's affairs can no longer be a fringe interest of the concern of minority groups but very much part and parcel of the current political agenda. The campaign on the question of the <Col N="1700" /> status of women, up to 1982, has been very much carried on outside the political arena.</P>
    <P>I believe the best results can be achieved for the future by having a strong political commitment to women's rights as well as appropriate governmental machinery for initiating and monitoring improvements in the status of women.  In the light of my experience in office over the past two years and in the context of the well identified areas needing action, I am examining how my role could be strengthened to enable greater response to the women's issues with which I am so familiar and to which I have a particular commitment.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a serious and important role to be played by both the Council for the Status of Women and the groups affiliated to that body.  Substantial funding has been made available to the council by the Coalition Government and they were enabled last year to move to suitable premises in a central location.  I believe that most of the women's organisations accept that they need to act as agents of change by educating their members towards more complete participation in society and where necessary act to bring pressure to bear where specific issues are involved concerning women.  I put great stress on having a strong woman's voice outside the political arena and I think that the interests of women would best be served by having this continue because whatever machinery any Government may bring in to deal with changes or action in women's areas can change when that Government changes.</P>
    <P>As some speakers have pointed out, the underlying assumption must be that women should have the right to choose between different life patterns.  Society has the responsibility to enable this freedom of choice and ensure that the woman's child-bearing function does not operate unnecessarily to impede her full development as a member of the community. Traditional attitudes about the division of roles between men and women are to a large extent self-perpetuating and will only be changed gradually as changes take place in society.  In some <Col N="1701" /> countries, however, the process has been speeded up by increased industrialisation and urbanisation, by the decreasing age of marriage and by, on average, smaller families.  All these factors have affected the position of Irish women no less than their counterparts in other countries and indications are that this will continue in the years to come.</P>
    <P>To fail to adapt patterns of recruitment, training and promotion to the life pattern of women is, I believe as unjust as if there were positive policies preventing them from availing of such opportunities. No one would suggest that all women with family responsibilities should be forced into employment or, as I have mentioned before, made to feel that there is not a real and meaningful role for them as mothers.  Barriers should not be put in the way of women who work outside the home, nor should they be seen as a reserve workforce to be dispensed with in times of high unemployment. Patterns of employment must of necessity be adapted to women's needs and to give working women a greater choice during their child bearing and child rearing years, for instance, by the provision of flexible work hours, part time work and other similar measures.  There must also be a greater emphasis on the provision of adequate career guidance for both young boys and girls and plans to diversify the occupation categories in which women and men have by tradition been employed.  I feel these proposals are practical and possible.</P>
    <P>The publication of this report and the debate here in the Seanad are particularly timely as this day next week, as Senator Bulbulia has said, the world conference in Nairobi will already be under way.  I have the honour to lead Ireland's national delegation to the conference and present the Irish report.  The main objective of the conference will be to seek a world wide consensus on the obstacles still remaining and hindering the achievement of the goals of the women's decade. Marking the end of the UN decade for women will be delegates from 140 countries and women will number in the region of 40,000 all coming together in <Col N="1702" /> Nairobi.  It will be an occasion for some celebration.  It will be a celebration that so many of the world's women are coming together to examine how world developments treat one half of the world's population. It will be a celebration that women from diverse cultures can meet in friendship and common cause.  The expectation of women will be that the conference will reach a consensus on a range of policies which will influence the impetus towards the realisation of equal treatment for men and women in all our countries.</P>
    <P>Equality does not just mean achieving legal equality for women and eliminating discrimination.  It means women having equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities in every aspect of life, and this can only happen if women have the means, and the power, on the same basis as men, to allow them to take an equal role.</P>

      <P>The House will recall that during my contribution on Second Stage I asked the Minister to give an <Col N="1703" /> explanation on a point arising on section 3.  It appears that under section 3 the intention is that only a body corporate will be entitled to act as a trustee under the scheme.  It says:</P>
      <P>A person shall not be entitled to act as a trustee under the scheme by which a designated investment fund is established unless the person is a body corporate incorporated in, and has a place of business in, the State....</P>
      <P>I have no objection to the Minister including a body corporate as one of those who would be entitled to act as a trustee but the Minister might indicate why it is that only a body corporate can act as a trustee.</P>

      <P>This section is essentially designed to protect the interests of the investor.  Under a trust arrangement the property is vested in a trustee who must handle it in the best interests of the investors according to the trustees.  The trustees are key people. They are ultimately responsible if anything goes wrong.  It is essential that they are sound financial concerns.  As this provision is considered to be the best way possible of achieving the soundness required, it is easier to have information about the financial disasters of a corporate entity than it would be of an individual who is more free to dispose of assets or whose net assets position is not as determinable as that of a corporate entity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked at the remainder of the section which indicates that it is the Minister's intention to have that trustee with ready cash of £250,000 and the capacity to raise it to £500,000. The Minister goes further than that and says that it is only a body corporate with that kind of backing that can act as a trustee.  Is this the first time that this was incorporated in any Irish legislation? There are many other examples of persons being involved in trade having to give a guarantee.  Surely if an individual <Col N="1704" /> who was of suitable character &mdash; a body corporate has only the same character as its directors &mdash; and had pledged assets to the amount specified in subparagraph (a) that person would be in precisely the same position as a corporate body.  I do not see why we should have become so enamoured of the idea of the body corporate that we should give them powers, responsibilities and duties which are not open to natural people.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is necessary that they should be of good character.  I also understand that they should be solvent and I have no real objection to any stipulation the Minister might like to make to ensure the solvency of any individual who might want to act as a trustee, but to insist that it should be a body corporate is, I think, a new departure and certainly a departure that I am not familiar with. I am not familiar with anything similar. It may well be that in unit trust legislation there is something similar but it is quite unusual and I would ask the Minister to have another look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator put his finger on the reasons for this in his contribution. This provision is precisely the same as the one that applies to the unit trust legislation.  One must be a body corporate to be a trustee under that legislation. We have incorporated that same provision here.  It is not as unreasonable as Senator O'Leary makes it sound.  You could get an individual into a situation that at the time they become a trustee they are solid financially but they might subsequently get married and their spouse might run up debts and what was a solid financial situation could become a very unsolid one, even though their character and their own personal conduct was perfect.  A situation beyond his or her control could result in his or her being no long solid financially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That cannot happen to a body corporate. A body corporate has to have a certain situation as far as its financial provisions are concerned and would have some control over how much money is paid up and retained therein.  Its proceedings are more subject to accountability. <Col N="1705" /> One has to have accounts for a body corporate.  An individual who had unlimited liability but also unlimited freedom to do or not do what they wish with their assets, is not required to keep accounts of their entire personal affairs in the same way as a corporate body are already required to keep accounts of their affairs.</P>
    <P>If one were to contemplate doing what Senator O'Leary wants &mdash; I suppose there is no objection in theory to what he wants &mdash; we would have to devise a whole new set of practical controls to mirror those which can relatively easily be put in place in regard to corporate entities.  That would be perhaps, to perfect this legislation but also to greatly delay it.  The importance of this legislation, among other things, is the speed of entry into law.  At the moment, as I am sure the Minister for State, Deputy Moynihan, has pointed out to Senators, one cannot advertise for funds under the conceptions in the business expansion scheme for a fund because of the non-passage of this legislation.  If one were to devise the type of controls that Senator O'Leary is arguing for, one would need the summer recess to do it.  We could not afford to lose the summer recess in terms of the operability of this legislation and the advertisements and so forth for funds that would undoubtedly occur once the legal barriers which this legislation removes have been removed.</P>

      <P>The Minister need not have any fear.  He will get his Bill tonight. There is no problem about that.  No one in the House is so fundamentally opposed to the Bill that they will vote against it. If we are going to the barricades with the Minister, we will go the barricades on something other than the Designated Investment Funds Bill, 1985.  We will pick an issue which might have more immediate interest than this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will get the Bill but that does not remove from us the responsibility to try to ensure that the legislation is as good as it can be.  Legislation is an on-going process.  People often ask why do we bother with Committee Stage as <Col N="1706" /> it makes no difference.  As far as I am concerned, legislation is an on-going process and what you say now might have an effect the next time legislation is being drafted.  We have an example of that in the Combat Poverty Agency Bill where a campaign we have been running over a long period of time with regard to membership of the Houses of the Oireachtas is coming to fruition.  I do not expect the Minister to say that he accepts it and will put down amendments on Report Stage. I do not know the circumstances in which it was put into the Unit Trust Bill, and I am sure the Minister does not know either.</P>
    <P>I was not a Member of this House in 1972 and I had no responsibility in these matters, but it might have passed this House on the basis that the person who wanted to raise it was out for his tea when the section came up for discussion.  These things happen.  All we can do is raise the matters when they are appropriate and hope that those in authority will listen to us.  It is appropriate that a body corporate should be capable of acting as a trustee. If the Minister had really listened to what I said he would have noticed what I said was: that if it was necessary to have a guarantee of £250,000 or £500,000 then as long as a person could be bonded for that amount of money, I do not see why he should not be capable of acting in these ways because a bond will last indefinitely. Quite a number of people involved in insurance act as insurance companies. That is what they do in Lloyds and they do it by being bonded.  They are bonded for a particular sum of money.</P>
    <P>As for the Minister's idea that bodies corporate cannot lose money, we have many examples of bodies corporate losing £1 million, £5 million and £90 million even from time to time and or even £200 million.  They can lose money too. To be serious, when such a system is being considered again, some consideration should be given to encourage people or at least permit people to act as trustees, provided there are proper controls and provided the funding is right.  I am certainly not suggesting that a person should not be adequately <Col N="1707" /> bonded or secured in some way.  As the Minister said, this legislation is designed to protect the investor and that has my support.  I ask the Minister to see that the appropriate people take this into account if and when the matter is being considered at a later time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>I certainly have no intention of interfering with the Seanad's legislative role in making suggestions of this kind as Senator O'Leary seemed to think I was doing.  My normal instinct in response to suggestions of the kind which have been raised by him would be to try to accommodate them by means of an amendment on Report Stage, notwithstanding the fact that that would involve returning to the Dáil to perfect the legislation. I would have no objection to doing that, but that is not practical at this stage. If I were to follow that course, we would not have this legislation until the autumn. However good the suggestion is, it is more important that we have the legislation.</P>
      <P>However, I will have the suggestion made by Senator O'Leary further investigated. I have no objection to it in principle, except that I see practical difficulties in it.  I am sure there would be practical difficulties in obtaining a bond of the size required.  However, if it could be obtained, it is worth looking at.  I can say, however, to the Senator that it is my advice that the existing provision has worked well in the case of the unit trust legislation and that there has not been, to my knowledge, any demand for an amendment along the lines suggested by the Senator in the context of the unit trust legislation.  However, the Senator raises a point of principle which is not an unreasonable one and will be looked at.</P>

      <P>Section 3 states: &ldquo;...is a body corporate incorporated in, and has a place of business in, the State...&rdquo; Does &ldquo;a place of business in the State&rdquo; mean that they must own property, or is there a minimum place of business?  A place of business could be anything from a caravan to the most expensive or the most valuable office block in Dublin.  Are <Col N="1708" /> there set criteria with regard to the value of the premises which they might have?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The reference to &ldquo;a place of business&rdquo; does not mean that the place of business itself confers any particular security.  The security is conferred by subsection (a) of section 3.  The reference to &ldquo;a place of business&rdquo; is simply made to make it clear that this corporate body would be subject to Irish company law by having a place of business within the State.</P>

      <P>I do not see any great advantage in that.  The likelihood of a fund going out of business, which this legislation is designed to prevent, is just as great or as little whether they have a large office block or a caravan as their place of business.  It is the quality of their investments which determines whether they succeed or not.  Provisions are already made for security in section 3(a). Security in a cash liquid kind would be available to meet the claims more readily than would be the case than if security were in the form of a building which might not easily be disposed of.</P>

I feel that Senator O'Leary has a point here because while £250,000 might seem quite an amount of money, people could abuse it.  As an added safeguard the Minister might examine the possibility of having a bond alongside it of the equivalent amount or possibly more?</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to look at that, but I am advised that in practice it would be very difficult to obtain a bond of that size and if you made that requirement in the legislation, it could render many of these funds stillborn.  If there is any difficulty, it is something that one could certainly consider.</P>

I have no reason to believe that the figures specified are inadequate.  Certainly, if you were to make it too severe these funds might not just get going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>If the figure of £250,000 was agreed as being the limit in 1972 and we are now in 1985, I feel I am justified in saying that the Minister should look at a bonding system to increase that £2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, but I think this is reasonable enough.  It is a provision that already applies to the unit trust legislation.  Admittedly, we could have brought in a higher limit.  I suppose if you were to adjust the terms in the 1972 figure in inflation perhaps you would end up with a much higher figure than this. Possibly it would be twice as high.  However, the figure is working reasonably well in the unit trust legislation.  To be quite frank, our aim is to get more of these funds established.  If we were able to avail of this to apply more severe paid-up requirements to designated funds than <Col N="1710" /> we were applying to unit trusts that would be seen as moving in the opposite direction to the one in which we wished to move.  I have to say that Senator Ellis has made a reasonable point that these limits should not be allowed to just drift with inflation.  One of the provisions that would, perhaps, be useful in legislation generally would be some system for automatically adjusting all cash limits in one Bill every year.  In fact, the CPI would have a small bill if they did this every year.  Perhaps that is getting a little bit less necessary now as the rate of inflation is reduced to below the European average. Senator Ellis's points may have had validity in the bad old days when inflation was much higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that there should be an upper limit to the amount of involvement which these groups should be allowed to have with regard to the amounts of money which they could handle?  You can take it that there is £250,000 there.  That could become very small in consideration of the total volume of money which one of those funds might be handling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea here is that under this fund as distinct from unit trust fund, you put in all the money and it must all go in on day one.  It is in and that is it.  It is closed up.  The amount that is being sought must be specified in the prospectus, so anybody putting in the money knows, when he is putting it in, what the size of the fund is.  People know that the fund is not going to be doubled or trebled.  The figure specified in the prospectus can only go up to that figure. It cannot go up subsequently because all the money is locked in and the fund is closed once it goes in.  If the Senator is worried about a situation where a fund would just grow, that would not be the case because of the nature of this fund as distinct from unit trusts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">

      <P>I understand the position that it is not going to be a roll-over situation. You could take it that you could <Col N="1711" /> have a fund proposed at £5 million as against an investment of £250,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should be over-emphasising the amount of money that should be held in paid-up capital.  Other than anybody actually defrauding somebody, there is very little risk of the fund getting into difficulty. The fund is just taking in somebody's money and investing it in another project. As I understand the legislation, the person who originally invests the money becomes the beneficial owner in due course of the actual shares.  The fund really is only the pig in the middle.  It is not actually dealing with money except in the very initial stages.  All it is doing is holding a portfolio of shares.  Even if these shares turn out to be worth nothing, as could happen if all the projects failed, the fund is not insolvent because it just does not arise.  While it is obviously necessary that there would be some resource to draw on, and some minimum which would give the thing a respectable base from which to operate, the Minister's point with regard to the fact that it is a static fund rather than a growing fund like unit trusts is a valid point.  In those circumstances the amounts mentioned are adequate at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I can agree with what has been suggested by Senator O'Leary to the Minister.  What I see here is that you could at a later stage have somebody who might be better up in this legislation than any of us in this House and who has watched this type of situation operate in other countries.  I am referring especially to where you have a lot of this type of business on the American Stock Exchange, where you have small companies being launched and all this type of operation.  There have been problems there with regard to some of them not being able to fulfil their commitments and where unscrupulous people have manipulated the situation.  That was my reason for pushing for a bonding type system.</P>

He has explained that the fund is not one that itself would be holding money for a long period of time. It will not be trading itself in a manner that would enable the fund to run up liabilities.  It will be facilitating investments by the individuals.  I feel, therefore, that the concerns expressed by the Senator are adequately met.</P>

      <P>The idea of issuing, publishing or circulating certain documents relating to designated investment funds is a good one.  This section has my general support.  I am concerned about two aspects of the matter.  I think the Minister might be held responsible for certain things which would happen if a person lost money.  As I understand the procedure, it will be as follows.  The designated investment fund will make an application to the Minister and will in due course have to submit to him a prospectus and all notices, brochures, etc. under subsection (1) of section 5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to section 5 I was saying, before the Minister went out to do his duty &mdash; I know from the smile on his face that they won in the other House with a comfortable majority &mdash; that I have considerable problems with the section.  It is nothing to do with the actual intention behind section 5 but the actual drafting of it that gives rise to difficulty.  In a number of places the Minister lays down that certain things are to be in the statement or prospectus, and that is fair enough.  He does it, for example, in subsection (4) (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e).  However, when he comes to (f) there is a statement which is one which is not drafted in the Bill but is a statement which the Minister is satisfied is appropriate regarding the risk involved in investing in an unquoted company.  The Minister will be making a value judgment there.  He will be saying, &ldquo;Is this an adequate warning or not?&rdquo;  It is possible for the Minister to make a mistake.  It is possible for somebody to say, &ldquo;The Minister did not warn me adequately with regard to this.&rdquo;  If the Minister makes a mistake it is possible that somebody would have a cause of action against him in negligence.  I will come later to what the Minister's answer to that might be.  If you look at (vi) you get the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospectus must also contain a statement which the Minister considers sufficient regarding the voting rights, duties and disposals arriving by reason of the shares issued to a fund being held by such a nominee, and certain other matters.  That is a value judgment again that the Minister is making.  He is going to decide what kind of statement is adequate.  If somebody loses his money afterwards he might be able to say the Minister, &ldquo;Well, you did not do your job properly.  I did not realise that they were the kind of voting rights that I was getting and I do not think you explained it adequately.&rdquo;  In VII it says a statement which the Minister considers to be <Col N="1714" /> adequate regarding any agreement or arrangement made or proposed to be made by or on behalf of the trustee of or the person managing the scheme for the transfer of shares, and various other things like that which we will not go into, is again a value judgment by the Minister. In (ix) a statement which the Minister considers adequate regarding the nature of the investments it is intended to make through such fund together with any amount which is specified in the relevant scheme as being the maximum or minimum which may be invested through the fund in any individual investment.  Again, there is a value judgment element involved in that.  Number (x), which I will not go into, does exactly the same thing. Subsection (5) again has an opinion of the Minister as being a focal point of its core and centre.</P>
    <P>Naturally one would expect the Minister to protect himself in some way against such an eventuality.  I do not see where the Minister has adequately protected himself against the eventuality.  First, I do not think he can protect himself fully against it.  I do not see where he has even attempted to do so in the Bill.  He is proposing that a statement should go in saying that no liability should attach to the Minister.  But the Act does not provide that.  That is just a statement that could go in.  The very fact that a statement goes in to that effect does not mean that statement has effect.  There is a further statement to be published in the papers that no right of release is given alone by reason of the Minister having given approval under the section.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill which says that the Minister will not be responsible for any wrong decisions which he makes as a result of these opinions.  In my opinion it is hardly even possible to draft such a section.  I think if the Minister is negligent, no matter what the law says, the common law will override the statute law and the Minister will be held responsible. Leaving that aside for the moment, I do not see where the legislation adequately deals with that problem at all. I would be anxious for the Minister to indicate where it does.</P>

      <P>I suppose you find yourself sometimes having to pick your lawyer depending on the advice you want.  In this particular instance, we sought advice on this very issue in the drafting of the legislation.  We were advised by the advisers of the Government that the provision here contained is adequate in that the person acting under this representation will be doing so in the clear knowledge that the Minister is not liable and is stated not to be liable and that no cause of action would arise on the part of the person investing because of the fact that he would have accepted the option to make the investment under a prospectus which clearly indicated to him that he could not pursue the rest.  I see Senator O'Leary shaking his head.  I cannot enter into a legal argument with the Senator on the matter beyond saying that this is the advice we obtained.  It was originally considered that we should put in an explicit disclaimer of liability as distinct from a requirement to include this in the prospectus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Minister has his own advice.  No doubt it is very good advice.  It appears to me that it is inadequate for this reason: nowhere does the legislation set out to relieve the Minister of any of his legal responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Small print in a prospectus is really a very poor defence against negligence.  If one buys a car one knows that there are warranties and restrictions on the warranties. Nobody takes the slightest notice of them when they come to court.  They are just irrelevant.  The man sitting on the bench takes a very practical viewpoint. Here we have a situation where you bought the car and you expected it to function correctly; it did not work and therefore you are entitled to be compensated. In a similar situation there is a very real risk that the Judiciary will take that very practical viewpoint.  They will say: &ldquo;Here is a man, irrespective of the disclaimer, who depended on a representation which was made to him by a Minister. That representation was made inaccurately or inadequately.  As a result the Minister must pay.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister has taken onto himself certain duties.  One of the duties he has taken onto himself is to delimit the advice which the shareholder is going to get with regard to, for example, the risk he is taking.  That is contained in section 5 (f) (i).  That is probably the most serious one.  The Minister is actually going to tell him what risk he is taking.  The Minister will also &mdash; which is more serious &mdash; indicate to him what he considers to be adequate concerning the nature of the investment he is intending to make.  In other words, if he wishes to invest in the manufacture of building materials, you will say to him that this is a very risky business or this is not a risky business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Senator listen to me for a moment?  The meaning of that &mdash; it is at the very bottom of page 4 of the Bill to which the Senator is referring &mdash; is not that the Minister would be required to say he is satisfied that the prospectus gives an adequate statement of the risks involved in investing in the type of activity in which it is proposed to invest, but simply that there are certain risks inherent in investing in an unquoted company and in the marketability of shares in an unquoted company, by virtue of the fact that it is an unquoted company but not by virtue of the activity or the nature of the objectives of the investment or anything of that kind.  The Minister simply has to satisfy himself that a statement is included to say that if you invest in an unquoted company it is not as easy to sell the shares as if you invested in a quoted company.  That is all.  Once that is said in reasonably clear English, it does not matter what it is proposed to invest in.  The Minister will have satisfied his obligations under that section.</P>

      <P>If the Minister looks at Roman numeral IX at the bottom of page 5 he will see that he goes even further than that.  The Minister will also have to approve a statement as to what is adequate regarding the nature of the investments it is intended to make through such fund together with any amount which is specified in the relevant scheme as being the maximum or minimum. There is no problem with that.  In other words, if your fund is to invest in building materials you have to give an assessment as to whether that is a high risk or a low risk venture.  If, on the other hand, you are going to invest in textiles, you will give a different assessment.  I understand that is what it means.  I am suggesting to the Minister a statement which the Minister considers adequate regarding the nature of the investment it is intended to make such as: &ldquo;This fund intends to invest in manufacturing companies in the textile area.  Fifty four per cent of them go out of business every year.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think that the combination of (i) and (ix) together will impose a very serious obligation on the Minister. What I am getting around to is that the Minister is taking on to himself considerable power and that is grand.  But you cannot buy power without accepting <Col N="1718" /> responsibility.  That is it.  If you accept power you have responsibility.</P>

      <P>Would Senator Killilea please be quiet until the matter on the Adjournment is raised &mdash; for the second day in succession now?  What I am trying to emphasise is that I think the Minister is going to be at some risk.  I may be wrong.  There may be no risk, but in my assessment of the position, reading it from beginning to end, my first reaction when I read it was alarm bells: the Minister could be at risk here and I do not care who the Minister is.  The Minister is inherently at risk because of the way the Bill is drafted.  I have also made the point about liability.</P>
      <P>The statement is to be included in the prospectus that the Minister has no liability. As far as the person who is reading that prospectus is concerned, there will be a statement that says the Minister has no liability.  He does not know why the Minister should have liability.  He does not realise that the Minister has approved the individual subsections of this statement. You might as well put in that the Ayatollah Khomeini has no liability.  He will not understand that the Minister will have, if not drafted the prospectus, at least approved the prospectus and approved individual portions of the prospectus. It is dangerous from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no other point to make about it.  I just worry whether the Minister is the right person to be getting involved in this regulatory operation.  That is what I am concerned about.  Why not put it off to somebody else?  Get the other fellows to do it.  Why should the Minister be getting involved in it?  That is important because what is happening here is that you have a non-specialist if you like, who is the Minister, getting involved in what will become a highly specialist area.  I am concerned about it because if there is any risk whatsoever the prospectus will have to be drafted in such a way as to protect the Minister and nobody will ever invest in anything.  If an official in the Department feels that he is under pressure <Col N="1719" /> to make sure that no Minister is ever caught, he will have such a negative prospectus that nobody would ever invest in the company.  It is to try to avoid that that I am trying to help the Minister.  No doubt the Minister is appreciative of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's solicitude in wishing to divest me of any needless work in this area and, being lazy by nature, I would be delighted that this chalice might pass to other lips. The situation here is that somebody authorised under statue has got to accept this responsibility.  If that person is not the Minister it has to be some other body established under statute.  If risks arise of the Minister being sued, so also will risks arise in respect of any other body that the statute might establish for the purpose.  Ultimately the Minister will have to indemnify that body anyway against any such risks.  So, the financial liability, if such is to be, would end up back here or in the Dáil, by one route or the other, either direct through the Minister or indirectly through the Minister having come through some other body that the Minister had to indemnify.</P>
      <P>I can only say to the Senator &mdash; and I know that this is not a very convincing case to make &mdash; that the intention of the use of the word &ldquo;nature&rdquo; on top of page six, is that it should relate to the type of investments that are being made, that is investments in footwear, investments in textiles, but not any evaluative statement as to whether it is invested in good, viable footwear projects or bad, unviable footwear projects.  The Minister is not, as is intended here, to make a value judgment as to whether the nature is good or the nature is bad.  It is simply a descriptive statement rather than an evaluative one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would have to concede to the Senator that the word &ldquo;nature&rdquo; is open to many interpretations and I am sure there are many theologians who have written numerous books on that subject as well as lawyers.  I have to revert to what I said originally, namely, that we have used the words we have used on the <Col N="1720" /> best drafting advice, that they are the right way of achieving what we want to achieve.  If I were doing it myself I would have used other words.  Unfortunately, the time is not available for us to check back on the matter between now and Report Stage, because we want to get the Bill through.  I certainly would like to thank the Senator for giving us due warning about this matter and we will obviously be on our guard to take any steps that we can to protect ourselves against any positive action that might arise.  It may well be that the Senator's fears are groundless.  I am sure that is his hope as it is mine.</P>

      <P>I can understand Senator O'Leary's worry about the Minister and I feel that it is justified, but I wonder is the Minister aware of what happens in other countries where this type of fund is proposed?  My information is that the brokerage firm who do this type of dealing become responsible rather than the Minister for that.  If they mislead the public they are &ldquo;hammered&rdquo; to use the stock exchange phrase.  Would it not be more beneficial to us and to the Minister if the lead institution were to become responsible rather than the Minister in this case.  I can see Senator O'Leary's position.  &ldquo;The nature,&rdquo; as the Minister says, leaves very wide scope and I feel that the investors should be told the specific companies in which the moneys are to be invested and they should also be given notice prior to any further investment being made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the investments being made the specific companies will not be known and it would not be possible for them to be known.  Otherwise, the whole thing would be much more rigid. People would put their money directly into those companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Minister's information, what I mean is that before the fund would make any investment, the shareholders should be told the specific company in which it is being invested.  We all understand that the money goes into the <Col N="1721" /> fund and stays in the fund, but I believe that before any investment is made from that fund the shareholders should be informed that it is going into company X, Y or Z.  I am talking about after the money has already been invested in the original company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you would have all the decisions being made by the investment managers being second-guessed by the shareholders.  You would never get to make the investments at all.  Would you have to have unanimity or would a simple majority vote of the shareholders suffice?  That would not be conducive to getting the money invested reasonably quickly because you would have to go through a whole consultative procedure possibly involving public discussion of some description.  I am not so sure that is desirable.  People are giving their money on the basis of a prospectus and on the basis, obviously, of a measure of trust in the judgment of the people to whom they are giving the money to invest it wisely.  To introduce a sort of an elaborate procedure would &ldquo;gum up&rdquo; the works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about an elaborate procedure but about a procedure where they would be given seven days to reply to a written query from the management team saying they proposed to invest £X of the fund in company Y. At that stage a notice would be sent out to the investors with a seven day period to reply.  If they did not reply it would be taken that they were in agreement with whatever the management team did.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not think that there should be a meeting.  There should be <Col N="1722" /> replies from the investors to the management team either for or against it.  Those who do not reply would be taken as being for the investment being made by the management company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If each individual is going to have a view on each company in which the fund is to be invested, they will invest perhaps directly in the company in the first place.  The whole notion of the fund is that money is put in the hands of an expert who invests.  If you are to have a system of second-guessing on these investments, there is no point entrusting it to a fund management; you might as well do it yourself individually.  This is the way the fund system works in the United Kingdom, although their guidelines are not specified in law.  They are specified in the guidelines issued by the Revenue Commissioners or the Inland Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>If you follow on what the Minister said you will see that the guidelines in other countries are much different from what they are here.  They are not governed by law, as the Minister has said, but by guidelines of the Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom.  I think it is the same in the United States where tax write-offs for losses are allowed and a number of other incentives.  In allowing people to reinvest other people's money, at least the original investors should know where their money is being reinvested and they should at least be notified that it is being reinvested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision for subsequent information to be given to them on a regular basis as to where money is going.  Any system where people could stop the lights, so to speak, would mean that fund managers would feel they could not operate effectively, that they were being second-guessed.  I do not think that would work and if you were to institute a fund of that kind, it would be intrinsically a different fund from the one which this Bill is designed to establish and which the Irish investment community is expecting.</P>

      <P>One of the things which we should bear in mind in considering these investment funds is that, of their nature, they are going to be investing in relatively small companies.  What will happen is, for example, that 100 people will put £25,000 each into a fund and make up £2.5 million.  This is going to be divided over quite a number of small companies.  My experience is that it would not be practicable to have the details of that company prior to the investment circulated on a wide basis. Nobody would allow the details of their company to be circulated on a wide basis unless there was a chance that there would be an investment.  It is different afterwards.  For that reason it is important that there would be power given to the manager of a designated fund to actually make the investment.  Therefore, I support the concept of the Bill.</P>

I understand from the Minister that if I give an approval under section 5 for the publishing of a prospectus or a brochure and it is published and people invest and subsequently I find there is a mistake, what happens to the people who in the meantime have invested their money?

      <P>I wonder if the withdrawal of approval would, in fact, mean that the fund was no longer properly in possession of the funds.

      <P>All I can say is that the Minister has ability because any man who could think of that at short notice is bound to have ability.  There is logic in what the Minister says.  It is also quite sensible that if there is withdrawal of an approval then in so far, as it is possible to do so, you restore everybody to the <Col N="1725" /> same position they were in before the situation ever happened.

      <P>No, but that is the beauty of the common law system as distinct from the civil law system, as I am sure the Senator is well aware, that you do not have to put everything into an Act under our system.  There is a certain <i>corpus</i> of law and custom which applies in the absence of the specific statutory provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to Senator O'Leary's query, what about any profits or any interest that might have been gained by the moneys while they were invested?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I know the answer.  My advice is that there would have to be a provision in the prospectus to govern what would be done with any interest that was earned in the period between the money being received and being invested in the normal way.  Those provisions as to what would be done with the interest would apply in the case of the withdrawal of approval in the same way as they would apply in the normal business situation, namely, that they are merely retained for a time and subsequently invested as distinct from refunded and that the practice to be adopted in this situation would be specified in the prospectus and would apply in both situations.  That is my advice.</P>

While moneys would be in the process of being taken in under the legislation there is nothing to state where they must be invested.

      <P>We are now back to the problems of normal Irish living and we are talking about people who have not even money to invest in new schools for the locality.  I want to thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Although rather unusual, to me this is a very important problem.  I want to thank the Minister for being present.  I am sure it is not easy to drop everything and attend here.  I know the Minister will give me the attention he always has given me in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the townland of Corrandulla we have a problem, a problem in a community where over the last couple of years the overcrowding in the girls school has created a situation where the local parish hall, which is not in great condition, has been used as a classroom.  The community have put up with that for some time. I will suggest a compromise which may be the manner in which this problem can be overcome.  First the situation concerning the classroom adaption of the Corrandulla school in Corrandulla hall will not be acceptable to the community.  The view of the parents is that the children will not be allowed go to school at all. Secondly, there is an application without the consent of a great number of the parents for a prefab to be sent down to act as an addition to the present facilities. The children will not be allowed to go to <Col N="1729" /> the prefab either.  It is the desire and wish of the community to have a new school built and I hope that the Minister will solve the problem.  I want to show my appreciation and to congratulate the Minister on the way in which he acted in regard to Tuam technical school.</P>
    <P>One solution to this problem would be that the monastery college which is in the vicinity of Corrandulla have part of their property for sale.  Some time ago it was suggested that part of the college could be used as a school but it was condemned then on the basis of being a two-storey building.  I do not know what criteria are necessary for the Office of Public Works but I do know what criteria are necessary for a happy community.  It is recommended &mdash; by people in the Department of Education whom I do not want to name &mdash; that the purchase of this property by the Department would resolve the problem.  It is up to the Office of Public Works to make the decision.</P>
    <P>There may be a problem with the title of the property but I believe that the monastery proprietors, the Christian Brothers, have assured the community that, until the problem of the title is resolved, they can go on a lease basis provided, of course, a deposit for the purchase of the school could be made. That is a very reasonable and honourable thing to do and it facilitates the problem. I do not know what the OPW &mdash; that wonderful organisation who take care of all our national buildings &mdash; are going to say about this.  The problem has to be resolved quickly.  I do not want to cause any trouble or division of any description between anybody in the community concerning the education of their children.</P>
    <P>A number of the parents in the area have an arrangement with the monastery whereby the community would lease the school for a year as an alternative to the proposed prefab.  I am not sure how positive that is, and I am awaiting information on it.  The trouble about having a motion on the Adjournment is that we cannot comment on the views of the Minister.  The community will not be satisfied <Col N="1730" /> with a prefab and, if that is what happens, then I will come back here again and ask the Minister to do something about it.  Alternative arrangements have been made about a classroom in the school which could be used for one or two years, and that should be acceptable to all.  After all, if you can put children into a two-storey community hall full of draughts, you can be sure that a classroom which was used up to quite recently will meet their requirements.  If the Office of Public Works fail to come up with a solution, then the only thing to do is to build a new school and the parents would be prepared to make a contribution towards that building.</P>
    <P>There is another point which is not very relevant to the present situation but it must be taken into account, that is, the co-education situation in the parish of Corrandulla.  The first priority is to get a school for the children and until that happens we cannot look at other priorities. I look forward to the Minister's response and thank him for coming in.</P>

      <P>I wish to give the House the history of Corrandulla national school and then I will deal in as detailed a way as possible with the Senator's queries.  Corrandulla has two primary schools, one for girls and one for boys.  They are about 100 yards from each other, being separated only by a cemetery and by a building owned by the Franciscan Brothers.  The schools have developed to the point where new teaching posts were sanctioned in both of them in recent years and there are now four teachers in each.  Enrolments in the schools are expected to increase gradually in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Corrandulla boys' school was built in 1947.  It is a three classroom building and a general purpose room was added in 1978 which presumably is now used as a classroom to house the four teachers. There are 102 pupils on the roll and the site is too small to allow for any further extensions to the school.  Corrandulla girls' school was built in 1930 and there are 103 pupils on the roll.  There are only <Col N="1731" /> three classrooms in it.  When the fourth teacher was appointed in 1983, temporary accommodation was arranged for the class on the stage of the parish hall.  The question of amalgamating these schools has arisen for consideration from time to time but, for one reason or another, it has not proved possible to implement it. It became necessary recently to pursue the question again in the light of further developments and shortage of accommodation and especially in the light of the philosophy expressed in our Programme for Action in Education 1984-87.  The education of children of both sexes together is more in keeping with the concept of equality between the sexes and the undertaking contained in the programme to facilitate the reorganisation of existing schools on such a basis. Initially my Department's proposals to amalgamate the two schools met with a certain resistance on the part of the boards of management and parents but, in April of this year, the chairman of the board informed us that all parties concerned were now by a large majority in favour of amalgamation.  My Department are at present in correspondence with the board on some of the practicalities of the amalgamation proposals, but I am not aware of any reason why there should not be a single coeducational school housed in the two existing buildings in Corrandulla on 1 September 1985 on reopening after the summer holidays.</P>
    <P>The building that Senator Killilea suggests is I presume the former novitiate belonging to the Franciscan Brothers.  My Department have long been aware of this building and of its proximity to the schools.  It was I understand erected as a novitiate around 1956 and ceased to be used as much around 1968.  Some years ago the acquisition of this building by purchase or leasing for use as an amalgamated school was suggested.  While no formal proposal to that effect was pressed with the boards of management, we had the building inspected by the Office of Public Works who are our technical advisers on architectural matters.  They <Col N="1732" /> reported that it would not be suitable for educational purposes.  There are four rooms in the building each measuring 800 sq. ft.  Remedial repairs to a number of features would be needed as would major alterations and additions which would appear to render uneconomical the adaptation of the building for use as a school.</P>
    <P>In recent times the emphasis has focussed on matters of immediate concern to the schools which would culminate in their combination into a single unit at the start of the coming school year.  After that we shall have to address the long term development of primary school facilities in Currandulla.  Ideally there should be a new building with modern furniture and equipment but the practicalities of the situation, such as the acquisition of a suitable site and the time necessary for the preparation of plans and contract documents, would not allow the immediate achievement of that objective. I have, however, taken note of Senator Killilea's views on the matter, but in the light of the reservations of the Office of Public Works which I have adverted to I would not be disposed to making any commitment towards the use of the novitiate for school purposes in the long term, assuming its availability, without a further assessment of the building by our architectural advisers subject to the present owner's agreement.</P>
    <P>I have stated that the fourth class group in the girl's school has been housed temporarily in the parish hall since 1983. The board of management is no longer satisfied with this arrangement and has requested the provision of a prefabricated room during the summer holidays. I accept that the classroom that is housed in the stage of a hall is not suitable and I understand the objections from parents and all concerned.  The prefabricated building has been sanctioned and arrangements to provide it are in hand. If, however, the board were to favour using in the short term a room or rooms in the monastery building, I would be prepared to have the implications of such a request examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" /> I should like to deal briefly with the points raised in relation to a new school. A new school would be the ideal solution to what is a serious problem in Corrandulla; and, while I do not want to go into the details of the problem, I should like to state that the delays and the difficulties are not all created by my Department.  If we are to go ahead with a new school it is a necessary and essential part of the procedures that the board of management would provide a site.  If a suitable site is provided and is recommended to me as being suitable, I will certainly give it all the support possible to speed up the building of a new school.  With all the goodwill in the world and with a site available tomorrow, there is an interim problem.  What has not been proved to me and what has not been shown to me to be clear is the use of the building suggested by the Senator.  I am not in a position to recommend the spending of large sums of money on a building to temporarily accommodate children, a building which perhaps next year we would not have any right to.  I would be grateful if the Senator, the public representatives or the board of management, would communicate to me what the position is in relation to the building which they suggest is available.  I would then have the matter examined in great detail.  If it is what the board of management is looking for I cannot see why they object to prefabricated buildings, because after all it is only a temporary measure.  If this is something to which they object I will consider the proposals, but I will have to be satisfied before approving large sums of money to be spent on a building when we are not too sure whether it would be available for one year, six months, two years or whether it would be available at all.  We have no clear indication at this stage about what the position is in relation to the building.</P>
    <P>Very rarely does my Department &mdash;<Col N="1734" /> and I agree totally &mdash; interfere with the day to day running of schools.  This is a matter for the board of management and interference from the Department should only occur when it is deemed to be necessary. If the board of management put concrete proposals forward in relation to the acquisition, indicating whether the building is available and for how long it would be available, then I would be prepared to examine them, even though a prefabricated building was applied for, was agreed and was sanctioned.  If there were strong objections I would have the matter examined and between us we could provide a workable solution to what I regard as an interim problem which would be in the interests of the children, the teachers and the board of management.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the problem.  It is a difficult one and the solution to it is not as easy as the Senator leads us to believe. There are problems in Corrandulla and I will give them my attention.  If proposals are submitted in this regard I will have them examined.  I am not an architect or an expert in this area, but I will take into account the advice which will be given to me by the people who are qualified to do this.</P>
