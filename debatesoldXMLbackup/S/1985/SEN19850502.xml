      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Smith that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter.:</P>
      <P>Due to the inadequate and intolerable facilities at Newport Vocational School, the urgent need for the Minister for Education to grant sanction for the immediate commencement of the long awaited extension to the school.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Patrick Durcan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The serious hardship and disruption caused to tourism and commercial life in west Mayo by the closure of the bus office in the Mall, Westport, by CIE.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Smith as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 4.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  I regret that I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Patrick Durcan as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, on the point which I raised &mdash; which I might say I raised because of considerable <Col N="102" /> public concern being expressed at present in Mayo west and in Westport in particular &mdash; I find it very difficult to understand the Chair's decision in relation to this matter, bearing in mind the fact that the Minister for Communications has overall responsibility for CIE and for the public services which they, as a monopoly body, provide.  Furthermore, I want to express in relation to this matter extreme disappointment at the arbitrary manner in which CIE made this decision without consultation with any interested bodies in the town of Westport.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister has total responsibility for CIE.  I have written to you giving my reasons for disallowing the discussion.  If I can be of any help to the Senator during the day I will do anything I can.  As regards my ruling, there are long standing procedures in this House.</P>

      <P>I am accepting the ruling of the Chair but I would like to feel that the matter is open-ended.  I make that point bearing in mind the fact that this House adjourned at an early hour yesterday due to lack of business.  It is very difficult to explain to people how democracy works when this House does not discuss anything and when there are vital issues which affect people and affect commerce and tourism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before I call on the Leader of the House, Senator Dooge, I wish to say there is a misprint on the Order Paper &mdash; 1, 2, 3, 1.  We are not going backwards, it should read 1, 2, 3, 4.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4.  We have a matter in regard to the amendment of our Standing Orders in No. 1, and then move on to the resumption of the debate on the disadvantaged areas.  The proposal is to adjourn from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and that No. 3 should be taken up if No. 2 concludes before lunch, or very shortly after lunch. It is proposed, in the event of No. 2 finishing before lunch, that No. 3 would be taken at 2 p.m. and No. 4 will also be ordered for 2 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are discussing the Order of Business I would like to draw the attention of the Leader of the House to No. 25 on the Order Paper, which is a motion in the names of Senator Robinson and myself.  This is a motion to annul statutory regulations made by the Minister for Social Welfare under the Social Welfare Consolidation <Col N="105" /> Act, 1981, by which regulations it seems to us that the Minister is purporting to introduce a discrimintory free fuel scheme replacing one which had already been struck down by the High Court.  The point of my intervention today is that this matter must be dealt with within 21 sitting days from the date when the matter was laid on the table of the House.  As I understand it, it was put on the table of the House on the seventh sitting day, on 28 February, and we are now at the 16th sitting day, so that we have approximately ten sitting days to deal with this matter.  If it is not debated in the House before the expiry of the 21 days then the section of the Act &mdash; which is section 3 (5) of the Social Welfare Act which covers the annulling of these regulations &mdash; will be of no effect and the House will have no power to annul the regulations unless it is brought in within 21 days.  I ask the Leader of the House to give us an assurance that the matter will be taken within the statutory period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator McGuinness for calling my attention to the fact that there is a question of a lapse of time here.  I am not in a position to check her arithmetic but if she is correct in saying that we still have ten sitting days it will be possible to take this in Private Members' time when next it is the turn of the Independent group to use that time.  However, I will undertake to Senator McGuinness that if time runs out more quickly than that, Government time will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that this is a motion which is brought forward in a statutory situation where the House is given power to do this kind of thing.  I do not think it is correct that it should be taken in Private Members' time.  If a motion is brought under statute in this way it should be taken in Government time.  It is not fair to my colleagues on the Independent benches to ask them to give up their Private Members' time to discuss a motion which was brought in under statute in this way.  However, we will have time to have some negotiations <Col N="106" /> with the Leader of the House about this. I do not want to prolong the matter today. I want to make the point that whenever a motion is brought under statute, Government time should be made available for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator McGuinness.  This is a very important amendment.  Basically what happened was that a High Court ruling was made which meant that certain people were entitled to free fuel vouchers, or that certain people could not be discriminated against in the issuing of free fuel vouchers. It is deplorable that the amendment should have to come in here under Private Members' time.  If there has to be an amendment made, it should come in in Government time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say in supplement, that the position is that this is a Government order.  Apparently, it is the Government's opinion that it should stand in this particular form.  It is inappropriate to say that anyone has anything approaching a right to move an amendment such as this in Government time. Senators are aware that as Leader and Deputy Leader of the House both myself and Senator Ferris have always been flexible on these matters.  We are prepared to be flexible on them.  A Leas-Chathaoirligh, like yourself, who prefers to be approached outside the House rather than across the floor of the House on matters, I too prefer to be approached outside the House rather than across the floor of the House.  I am certainly concerned, but I can give no guarantee on my feet because this matter is being raised without notice.  All I can say is that I will give consideration today to the question of whether the matter cannot be disposed of next week.  If I find that there is no objection to it being disposed of next week it can be ordered on Wednesday next.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Leader of the House if it would be possible to bring forward item No. 19 on the Order Paper?  This is an item raised by Senators of the Labour <Col N="107" /> Party and Independent Members but it concerns the Nicaraguan people.  It is a motion that, in view of what has happened in the United States over the past few days, should be debated in this House.  We had a very good debate on the situation in Nicaragua relating to the elections that took place there.  We have an excellent report from the people who went to Nicaragua to see the manner in which the elections took place.  In the last few days President Reagan has been rebuked by both Houses in the United States for his efforts to give aid to the anti-Government forces in Nicaragua. After being beaten on that he suggests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>All you are doing is asking that it will be allowed to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to give the reasons why I think it should be discussed. President Reagan has now suggested, having been beaten in both Houses in the United States, that there should be a trade ban and that Nicaragua should not get aid, food, or any of the aid which would be necessary for that country to succeed as a democratic country.  I ask the Leader of the House that this matter be brought forward as a matter of urgency in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that this motion has been on the Order Paper for some time.  It is a Private Members' motion.  My memory is that it was down before we debated Nicaragua on the last occasion and that when we did debate Nicaragua on the head of a report from a parliamentary delegation the debate was so wide that a great deal of the substance of this motion was subsumed within it.  There is not a very strong case for Government time to be given in this regard.  I repeat that in the Seanad the amount of time given to Private Members has exceeded that given previously certainly within my memory of the Seanad, <Col N="108" /> which is quite a long one.  I can give no guarantee whatsoever for allowing Government time in view of the matters we have discused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the amendment to Standing Order 69 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business recommended in the Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges (T. 270) dated 1st May, 1985 be adopted.</P>
      <P>This report recommends a technical amendment to Standing Order 69 which would allow the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to engage the services of consultants to assist it on particular matters.  It arises directly from the report on new technology for Leinster House. One of the recommendations of the interim report of the working group of the Dáil and Seanad Committees on Procedure and Privileges on new technology was that in order to provide committees with a detailed assessment of the most suitable type of equipment, costs and staffing needs, a consultant should be engaged from whose report final decisions could be made.  That report was adopted by the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges and in adopting the report the committee authorised the engagement of such a consultant.</P>
      <P>However, it is not beyond doubt that the committee is empowered to engage consultants and, accordingly, the recommendation is made that it should be put completely beyond doubt that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has such a power.  In doing so, it was thought proper that this should not be confined to the engagement of a consultant for this particular case but, in fact, there should be a clear affirmation of the power of the committee.  Accordingly, the amendment is proposed to Standing Order 69.  I will now quote the recommended new Standing Order:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> Subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, the Committee shall have power to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it in considering particular matters.</P>
    <P>This is not likely to be used very frequently but there are instances, like the one in regard to new technology, where it is necessary to have specialist opinion in order to come to a correct decision on matters of this kind.  I recommend the amendment of the Standing Order to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Fianna <Col N="110" /> Fáil Party for allowing me to go in first because I have another meeting and I did want to say something on this particular report.  I want to commend the people who prepared this report No. 12 on the disadvantaged areas which in its introduction deals with the efficacy of Community legislative measures in relation to disadvantaged areas and with the case for the extension and reclassification of severely handicapped areas.</P>
      <P>The joint committee examined the operation of the Community measures and they discussed the various Community directives of April 1975 and of June 1980.  In doing so, they specifically gave consideration to existing Community measures regrding Directive 75/268/EC, Less Favoured Areas.  The disadvantaged areas scheme as implemented in Ireland is based on this directive on mountain and hill farming, and farming in certain less favoured areas.  The directive provides for the following types of areas, mountain areas designated under article 33 of the directive; hill and lowland designated under article 34 of the directive, namely areas in danger of depopulation and where the conservation of the countryside is necessary.</P>
      <P>They go on to outline the presence of land of limited potential, economic results which are appreciably low and low or dwindling population.  Why I specify those particular considerations of existing Community measures is that it was in the light of that that various submissions were made by farming organisations, county committees of ACOT and those of us with a responsibility in agriculture, or an interest in it.  The eastern region, which is the only one that I want to mention in my contribution, incorporates the mountain sheep-grazing areas of Carlow, Cork, Dublin, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Offaly, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow.  They are of particular interest to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate that I should outline to the Minister, arising out of this report which since its publication has been superseded by the announcement from the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, of the areas that were agreed at <Col N="111" /> Community level for inclusion both in the more severely handicapped and the less severely handicapped areas.  First of all, I must acknowledge that the progress that has been made by the Government in their latest submission to the European Community has had beneficial results in many areas.  There is an additional 407,000 acres less severely handicapped in the country classified as disadvantaged. There is an additional 869,000 acres classified as more severely handicapped.  I realise that that is a major breakthrough. This is in line with the brief outline in this report and the guidelines were used by those people who made submissions based on the presence of limited potential on the land, and taking account of people trying to maintain a livelihood and to ensure that the population does not dwindle.  We were absolutely amazed in south Tipperary when key areas which to our common knowledge are within the criteria set down in this report of the joint committee for some reason were not classified as severely handicapped.  They are still allowed to remain in the less severely handicapped areas classification. That is a pity.</P>
    <P>For the Minister's information, as chairman of the County Committee of Agriculture for south Tipperary I want to put on the record of this House the views of my committee in this regard.  At our last meeting we had a notice of motion from representatives, from many who expressed amazement that they were not included.  They asked the pertinent question which it is my bounden responsibility to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, who is present with us, to confirm.  They asked whether in fact these areas were submitted by the Government in their reclassification to the Community or were they not included and, if so, why?  If they were included I accept that the Government carried out their responsibility.  I advised the members of the Cabinet, those available to me in my own Parliamentary Party and, indeed, the Minister for Agriculture and his two Ministers of State, that this was possibly the last opportunity <Col N="112" /> that Ireland would ever get to extend its boundaries in these areas with the accession of Spain and Portugal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>If Spain and Portugal come in and if Senator Smith knows anything about the terrain there it is quite obvious that it would be quite some time before we will ever get a proper grasp of this particular nettle again.  It is important that an opportunity was grasped on this occasion.  I am quite sure that the Government left no stone unturned to ensure that the greatest possible acreage was included.  The people living in the following areas want to ask the question, and I am responsible to them.  They are asking me if the Minister for Agriculture and the Government included the area of Slieveardagh in the disadvantaged areas and if the following townlands in the Slievenamon mountain areas were included, Glenaskough, Toor North, Toor South, Breanormore and Killusty.  They should have been certainly included in the severely handicapped area designation.  I am asking the Minister also if the following areas are included in that category, I speak about Carrow, Carrowkeal, Lackenacombe, Bonarea, Scarrough &mdash; in case Senator Smith does not know the area, it is very close to Dundrum &mdash; Ballybrack, Ballysheeda, Moanvaun, Knockavar, Shanaclone, Toragh, Weston's Lot, Gortacoolrush, Drumwood and Brockagh, and the areas of Clonoulty east and Clonoulty west. There have been public meetings there over a number of years.  They have produced submissions to the Minister and the Department assisted by our Chief Agricultural Officer, Mr. Michael English. I want to pay him a special tribute here today for the amount of work and effort that he has put into these submissions. There is no doubt that the strongest possible case was made to ensure that these areas were properly designated.  I want to ask the Minister of State were these areas included in the application to change them from less disadvantaged to <Col N="113" /> severely disadvantaged or were they not processed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>You had a Commissioner in your constituency as well.  We brought the people over from Europe so that they would not sit in ivory towers and look at a map and decide that people can survive around Glenaskough or around the areas of Slievenamon.  On a nice day like today people sitting in the Department of Agriculture in Dublin would not realise that there is snow down there and that people are unable to farm well into the month of June, that there is no question of saving hay at the same time as it is saved in any other area.  There is the gravest hardship involved in surviving those conditions.  If some assistance is not given to them those areas will be depopulated.  People will leave because they will not be able to survive.  This kind of package is their life blood.  I would hate to think that somebody in the Department or somebody in Europe does not wish to see the area when it is the appropriate time to see it, when the weather is bad, when there is rain or snow.</P>
      <P>I commend the Oireachtas Joint Committee on this report.  A lot of work has been put into it.  Now that the Minister has made a statement perhaps he might reassure me of the active role they have played.  He might let us know also if there is any hope, despite this published list, that in respect of any area not included or not excluded by the Community we will continue the battle to ensure that the people concerned can remain where they are happy to remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the <Col N="114" /> opportunity of discussing this report.  It is a fairly sizeable document.  I should like to see most of the schemes and measures in the document being implemented but it is only when one starts to look for them that one is confronted with all kinds of regulations that ensure one does not qualify.</P>
      <P>The popularity of any scheme is its availability on the ground and its practical usage.  People are debarred now under the farm modernisation scheme regulations, under the dry land reclamation scheme and because of various regulations relating to income limits and so on. Perhaps that is the climate that needs to be projected at this point.  We have to subsidise each of the schemes that is in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be realistic about this. Regarding the headage schemes the greatest deterrent in so far as people in the west of Ireland are concerned is the income level.  Many years ago that was at £5,500.  A Coalition Government reduced that to £3,500.  That prevented more than 60 per cent of the people from being eligible for the scheme.  The same applied in the case of other schemes also. It was an unrealistic figure.  Though the figure has now gone up to £6,400, it is less than a county council worker is getting on the road today.  How can the farmers from the severely disadvantaged areas be asked to avail of these schemes when the limit is so low?  I maintain that the limit should be from £8,000 to £10,000 in order to allow the people in the disadvantaged areas qualify for the scheme.  ACOT advisors are becoming more difficult to find.  The main difficulty is that there are too many regulations attached to qualifying for any grant under the farm modernisation scheme.  The number of applications coming in is becoming fewer while the grants being sanctioned are even fewer.  There is a general stalemate. I do not know for how long that will continue.  According to <i>Building on Reality</i> everything is to improve in 1986 and 1987.  All of the western package schemes, drainage and so on, are to be introduced again.  Who will be re-introducing them?  If they are not introduced <Col N="115" /> before 1987 a Coalition Government will not be introducing them.  We will be introducing them.  As Senator Smith said, <i>Building on Reality</i> is built on shifting sands.</P>
    <P>The main objection to the farm modernisation scheme and to the headage grants is the income limit.  One does not know whether to put in one's cattle for inspection this year in case one may not qualify next year.  There is a new regulation every year.  I have advised the people in my area to be very careful, to keep a photostat of all documentation and ensure that what they say is within the small print because the situation is worse than an insurance policy every year.  However, we have intelligent people in the west who are able to read and see through the lines.  They have been well advised to ensure that when they are making their applications they have enough forage and that they fulfil all the requirements.</P>
    <P>There are too many regulations and deterrents.  It is quite natural in stringent times for the Government to be adopting this attitude.  Their instruction to their staff must be to give as little as possible to as few as possible.  The attitude seems to be to disqualify where possible on some technical point.  After people qualify, the payment is delayed often until the following year.  In that way there is a little cushioning in the finances.  In addition the Minister for Agriculture may think that the Minister for Finance will be pleased that such tactics were used. However, the people, in a few weeks time will register their protest against such policies.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak about the mountain status areas.  I am more than disappointed in this regard.  I had been awaiting a long submission from the Minister on this subject. Instead, during his speech some time ago on the disadvantaged areas, he devoted only a short sharp statement. This was about a major item that people in the severely handicapped areas throughout the west of Ireland as well as such organisations as Donegal Co-Op had made submissions to the Minister for <Col N="116" /> Agriculture and to Europe.  They had gone abroad and explored the whole Central region.  All the Minister had to say was that with regard to the question of extending the status of mountain areas to certain disadvantaged areas in the west of Ireland under the EC Directive 75/268, the matter had been the subject of separate and specific representation to the EC Commission and that he was continuing to press the issue.  The Minister went on to say that the matter had been raised separately in the context of discussions which were taking place in Brussels on the Commission's new proposals on agricultural structure.</P>
    <P>That is a very poor comment from a Minister who comes from the west and who knows the problem.  If an east of Ireland or a Munster man made a short little submission like that I would tear him asunder.  So far as I can ascertain, there is nobody making the case for us in Brussels and neither is anyone concerned as to whether we achieve mountain status for the severely handicapped areas.  That is sad, because a lot of work has been put into the submissions.  We definitely qualify.  My own county alone has been singled out as a county that is identical to Cantal in all shapes and forms &mdash; altitude, climatic conditions, windscale, variations in soil and accessibility.  There is difficulty, for instance, in bringing machinery to the higher areas.  For various other reasons too, we should qualify for mountain status.</P>
    <P>I do not know how sincere the Minister is in pursuing this matter, but I trust he is pursuing it at the speed at which people in the area concerned believe him to be pursuing it.  If I were Minister I would not allow myself to be curtailed in my ideas or stymied in any way by any Minister for Finance or anyone else in regard to an issue of such importance to the whole west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Private afforestation is not feasible in the west because the people could wait for 50 years to recoup their investment. Rarely will one find afforestation land adjoining good land.  If there were large farmers who had some money to invest longterm at the tailend of good land that <Col N="117" /> would be all right but most of the afforestation land for private planting runs off bad land and would not make any impact.</P>
    <P>I regret very much the reduction in the levels of agricultural staff.  The number of holdings per agricultural office is about 11,000 in the west as against 3,300 elsewhere. Additional offices should be built as fast as possible and rather than starting to dismantle the whole system that has been built up over the years by many committees of agriculture, the advisory service should be improved.  Reduction of from 35 to 26 agricultural advisors in Mayo is a very sizeable reduction.  I may be blaming the Minister in the wrong but I am sure that if I criticise him sufficiently here, he will be able to blame somebody else.  I am convinced that he is sincere in what he is setting out to do but he is curtailed by some Ministers.  Too great a proportion of the moneys available is being spent on headage and sheep subsidies and in that field of activity and that is not the popular thing for any west of Ireland Minister to do at this time even if we are getting 50 per cent of the money by way of the FEOGA grant.  I urge the Minister to continue to press for mountain status for the entire western area. The people there are of the opinion that the Minister is not doing enough in this regard and is sending out people who do not know the problem on the ground.  I know plenty of people who if they were in the position that the Department officials are in, would have a mountain status area for the severely handicapped areas inside six months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Twelfth Report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EC dealing with disadvantaged areas.  The report serves to prove the value of joint committees in the way they have examined an area of much contention among farmers in the western region and indeed farmers in other areas that were designated as disadvantaged ever since the first directive on less favoured areas was issued in 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we had members of all the parties in the Oireachtas, together with experts <Col N="118" /> from the Departments, people from the interested co-ops and representatives from the major farming organisations, sitting down for the first time, examining and teasing out the directives in detail. Problems have been shown up and there are various ideas and submissions on how improvements can be brought about.</P>
    <P>Much of the report deals with Directive 268/75 which is popularly called the cattle headage directive and extensions to it. Since the publication of this report we are discussing here today the Minister has made announcements on extensions mostly in the west and indeed in areas throughout all the provinces.  Nationwide, 407,000 acres have been deemed as less severely handicapped while 869,000 extra acres have been deemed as being more severely handicapped.  These are the increases the Minister has announced since the publication of this report.</P>
    <P>In County Roscommon and north east Galway the areas with which I am naturally most familiar, I welcome the major extensions.  In County Roscommon we got close on an extra 90,000 acres included.  In County Galway there was an extra inclusion of almost 100,000 acres.  I particularly welcome the inclusion of the Ballymoe district, the Creggs district, and the Ballinakill and Tobberoe districts which are broadly speaking the Glinsk area in north-east County Galway.  In the central area of County Roscommon, the inclusion of the greater parts of the district electoral divisions of Tulsk, Strokestown, Elphin, Clooneyquin and Ballintubber and a greater portion of what is generally referred to as the Four-Mile-House area is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In the region surrounding Roscommon town and south Roscommon the areas taken in are absolutely welcome.  In the former areas, that is surrounding Roscommon town, areas like Rosmoylen, large portions surrounding Dunamon and Athleague and Fuerty were lucky.  In the latter area &mdash; the south of County Roscommon &mdash; large portions of Dysart, Taugmaconnell, Moore, Kiltoom, Cornafulla, Bealough, Thomas-town and Castlesampson were lucky also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> While one appreciates the major financial constraints the EC and the national Government operate under and while we fully appreciate this extension and see it for what it actually is, which is a major advance &mdash; in Roscommon giving us an extra 29,000 hectares and an extra 39,000 hectares in County Galway &mdash; and when we compare it with the the last enlargement which was by Fianna Fáil in 1981 when only a few hundred extra hectares were added in County Roscommon and a couple of hundred extra hectares were added in County Galway, there is natural disappointment in the areas that are still left outside.  The criterion laid down under article 3.4 of the Severely Handicapped Directive 268/75 to qualify for cattle headage is (i) that land must be of limited potential, (ii) the economic returns accruing must be appreciably below the mean, and (iii) the area must have a low, dwindling or static population. The areas excluded meet all those criteria.</P>
    <P>Let me give some examples.  The area of Castleplunkett and Killmurray in County Roscommon lost 5.7 per cent of its population between 1979 and 1981. Yet only three townlands in that area were included.  The Castleteehan district electoral division which is adjacant to Castleplunkett lost 1 per cent of its population in the intercensal period 1971 and 1979 and 6.7 per cent between 1979 and 1981, yet no part of it was included.</P>
    <P>The Carrowduff district electoral division lost 10.4 per cent of its population in the ten year period, 1971 to 1981 and yet no part of it was included.  Another example is Cloonycormican which is basically called the Ballinaheglish/Oran area in County Roscommon.  The figures for that area are that in the years 1971 to 1979 it lost 9.9 per cent of its population and in the intercensal period of just three years between 1979 and 1981 it lost a further 8.1 per cent of its population and yet those areas were not included.</P>
    <P>In south Roscommon, where the land is generally poorer with the added handicaps of flooding from the river Shannon on the one side and the river Suck on the <Col N="120" /> other, the anomalies are even greater. Drumlosh, a district close to Athlone, lost 6.3 per cent of its population between 1971 and 1979 and a further 2.6 per cent between 1979 and 1981 and it had only one townland included.  Kilcar, a district close to Curraghboy lost 4.7 per cent between 1971 and 1981, a ten year period, yet none of it was included.  Turrock, a district electoral division which is close to Dysart, lost 8 per cent between 1971 and 1979.  Its population stabilised between 1979 and 1981 yet no portion of it was included.  Dysart itself lost 6 per cent between 1979 and 1981 and not all of that district is included.  The Rockhill or Curraghboy district lost 8.8 per cent between 1971 and 1979 and 3 per cent between 1979 and 1981 and none of it was lucky enough to be included.  Lismaher, which the Minister knows himself is the Four Roads or Mount Talbot area lost a staggering 11.9 per cent of its population between 1971 and 1979 and a further 3.8 per cent between 1979 and 1981, yet only one townland in that area was included.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the coin we have Taugmaconnell gaining 16.5 per cent between 1971 and 1979 and a further gain of 1.7 per cent between 1979 and 1981 and the larger part of this district is included while Carrowreagh district which is also in the Taugmaconnell area gained 11.1 per cent between 1971 and 1979 and 4.1 per cent between 1979 and 1981.  It, too, was lucky enough to have most of its townlands included.</P>
    <P>Naturally we do not wish to take from any of those areas which have been lucky enough to be included and which have growing populations.  Good luck to them, but we make the point only to draw attention to the anomalies and to show that while we are told that the three basic criteria are used to apply the directive, it does not always seem to be the case.  Of course all of the land west of the River Shannon meets the criteria, and justice will never be done fully until the supports of this directive are extended to all of Connacht, much of the west Munster, all of Monaghan and Cavan and indeed to the higher altitude lands in places like Carlow, Tipperary, Waterford and Cork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> Nowadays about 34 per cent of all the land of County Roscommon and 47 per cent of the land of County Galway does not qualify for the bovine headage payments, and they are the only areas in Connacht now not benefiting.  The degree of natural handicap in those areas excluded is just as great as in the areas included.  The Agricultural Institute, the farmers' organisations and of course the farmers involved would all agree with me.  There is no use explaining to excluded farmers who see their production and livelihoods retarded by flooding of the rivers Shannon and Suck in the Counties of Galway and Roscommon that they do not have the level of natural handicap to qualify while they see the farmers in the Finn Valley in east County Donegal qualifying and they have some of the best land in the country.  Again I am not taking anything from the farmers in east Donegal, good luck to them.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would appeal to the Minister to formulate a proposal for submission to the farm commissioner requesting that all areas excluded, in Connacht at least, be included in an extension in 1986.</P>
    <P>On the committee's report we must put on the record our appreciation that the Minister has decided to increase the income limit from off-farm activities to allow participation in the disadvantaged areas scheme from £3,500 to £6,400 per annum.  This is a very sensible move, and it brings the spirit and the aim of the disadvantaged areas directive of aiding farmers who are marginalised in terms of income and resources towards greater reality.</P>
    <P>I will take just a few aspects of the committee's deliberations on directive 1800 of 1980, commonly called the western package.  Firstly I will deal with aids under the package for county roads and I will quote from paragraph 1 on local roads, country, on page 19 of the report. This states that the Department of the Environment's block grant allocations to county councils include a sum specifically to finance a programme of works on country roads used mainly for agriculture and forestry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="122" /> The amount of money allocated to county councils under this concession amounts to about 10 per cent or 12 per cent at best of their total expenditure under local by-road network.  It should be looked at as to how greater resources from the western package funds could be got into this area, since the Department have apparently turned their backs on appeals coming nationwide that hundreds of miles of the country's minor road network are becoming impassable because of the starvation of funds.  Always forgotten, it seems, is that this minor but public network is a fundamental economic lifeline to countless rural regions throughout the country and that millions of pounds worth of agricultural merchandise is transported over them every day.</P>
    <P>Could the finance that will be released by the discontinuation of aids to the food processing industry, which is to cease this year, make extra funds available for minor road development and improvement?</P>
    <P>With regard to the relative lack of success in relation to the orientation of agricultural production, detailed in paragraph 12 of the report, I agree that there would be a far greater uptake for the calf to beef scheme had the aid been in the form of a direct grant rather than in the form of an interest subsidy.  Also a calf to store scheme would have been of much better value in the conditions of the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Minister's decision to get the western drainage scheme going again.  This has been the most widely availed of aid scheme among all the schemes designed to rehabilitate the land economy in the western region.  The most fundamental initial step any non-profitable landowner must take, if he or she is to come on the right side of the economic margin, is to remove the debilities in the land which operate against economic production. The major debility in the west is land wetness because of high rainfall and the impermeable condition of the soil.  It is probably not realised the amount of land taken back from the wilderness between 1978 and 1983 as a result of this scheme, and its re-introduction now is <Col N="123" /> most welcome.  I live in a county that is lucky enough to have major arterial drainage works carried out under the western drainage scheme.  I refer to the Boyle-Bonnet drainage scheme which is in Ballaghaderreen, others being the Robe and the Mask schemes which are now nearing completion.  They are in County Mayo and County Galway.  This year this project will benefit by an expenditure of in excess of £3 million.  That is double last year's expenditure, and I wish to put on the record of the House our gratitude for this from the point of view of its land improvement value and the employment which it gives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Senators for a very wide ranging discussion on a very important subject.  I want to put on the record exactly what has happened in the recent past in regard to the extension of the revision of the severely handicapped areas.  I am glad to have this opportunity to put on the record of the House the sizeable benefits the boundary adjustments of the disadvantaged areas will bring to farmers in 21 counties.  These adjustments follow upon the most comprehensive review of the disadvantaged areas ever undertaken in this country. The EC Commission have now completed examination of the submissions made by this Government in August 1984 and has put forward a proposal to the Council for its approval.  Before this proposal was finally completed there were substantial negotiations with the Commission and these resulted in the criteria laid down for designation of disadvantaged areas in Ireland being made considerably more flexible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are now proposed are, first of all, extensions to those areas which are designated as disadvantaged and the reclassification of certain parts of the existing designated areas.  In all, the boundaries of some 406 district electoral divisions will be adjusted, and this has involved over 3,000 townlands.  The adjustments to the boundaries will <Col N="124" /> increase the proportion of the agricultural area of the State in the designated regions from 62.5 per cent to 68 per cent. This sizeable increase can be appreciated when one considers that the 1976 to 1981 reviews, combined together, extended the agricultural area by a little over 1 per cent.  As a consequence of the proposed adjustments an additional 407,000 acres of land is being proposed for designation as less severely handicapped while the area classified as more severely handicapped is being increased by some 869,000 acres.  When they are added together we get the figure that is most quoted of 1,250,000 acres, which is a very, very sizeable increase by any standard.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to all that the sizeable adjustments to the disadvantaged areas, the extension of the western region with its other benefits, the increase in the off-farm income limit to £6,400 and the proposed doubling of the beef cow payments to £70 will benefit a large number of farmers throughout each and every county of this State.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer for a few moments to changes in the different areas.  It is worth while to outline the impact these adjustments will have at county and area level.  In the western region over 321,000 acres of land will be re-classified to the more severely handicapped category. Seven counties are involved where farmers will now benefit from the cattle headage payment.  Over 14,000 acres will be re-classified in Counties Clare and Monaghan and some 74,000 acres in Counties Cavan and Roscommon.  About 98,000 acres will be re-classified in county Galway, 49,000 acres in County Kerry and nearly 5,000 in County Cork.  We have also enlarged the western region itself by adding some nine new areas to the boundary including bringing in the existing Sliabh Felim area, one in fact that was a hot potato for many years.  An area of 345,000 acres has now been added to the west.  In west Cork an additional 61,000 acres has been included while in Counties Meath and Westmeath 29,000 acres and 32,000 acres have been added. Many people would find it difficult to <Col N="125" /> understand how there could be that type of land in places like Meath and Westmeath. There is bad land everywhere.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as Minister of State I have toured nearly all the areas involved over the last two years.  There are counties in which you would not expect to find any bad land, but this is not the case, of course.  In Counties Offaly and Tipperary 32,000 acres and 81,000 acres have now being included while in County Limerick 39,000 acres now joins the west, for this particular purpose.</P>
    <P>In the eastern region cattle headage and beef cow payments will now be made payable in designated areas for the first time in the history of the disadvantaged areas scheme in this country.  They would include some 98,000 acres of land in the Castlecomer, Sliabh Margy area and, in fact, that is one of the areas that has been a bone of contention for many years. They include 34,000 acres in the County Kilkenny area, 81,000 acres in County Waterford, 19,000 acres in the Sliabh na mBan area, the sheep area of Tipperary. It includes 69,000 acres in the Limerick-Tipperary Galtee area, 49,000 in the Sliabh Blooms, 17,000 in the Cooley Peninsula, 37,000 acres in the Blackstairs Mountains and 247,000 acres in Counties Wicklow, Dublin and Wexford.  We have also included new mountain sheep grazing land in County Kildare.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have queried the criteria laid down by Brussels, and I would just like to point out that we cannot, in a blanket matter, decide to include every area in the country, whether it is in the west or outside the west, for the very simple reason that there are very strict criteria.  After the announcement of any extension to these areas there are people who are deeply disappointed, and on this occasion it is no different.  Most of the criticisms that have been levelled at the Department on this occasion would appear to centre around the criterion concerning the population basis.  It would appear to me that in any future negotiations this is something that will have to be taken up by the Commission to get more flexibility because I have met many groups in the <Col N="126" /> last fortnight or three weeks who would meet all the other criteria except where, for one reason or another, a number of people not connected with agriculture at all have built houses, or county council estates or this kind of thing have been built out in the country.  It is certainly against our best interest from here on to allow that particular criterion to be there, but of course there are very good reasons why that should be there.</P>
    <P>This would be an appropriate occasion for me to say that when we first joined the EC the basic principle of this was that the areas that would not be able to generate any type of reasonable farm income obviously had to be helped.  Now there is a big difference between parts of the country that have gained access and, say, parts of County Leitrim where, for obvious reasons, the agricultural potential is so low.  It was generally believed at the time, when the powers-that-be created this type of severely handicapped areas basis for calculation, that it would be held to areas of that type.  As the whole business developed and more pressure came on from all the other countries in the EC, as well as ours, obviously more areas were included.  We have now arrived at a stage where we will have to renegotiate the criteria.  We surveyed four million acres and 1¼ million acres were successful.</P>
    <P>Other criteria have been mentioned here and I do not intend to delay the House going through them but I would just like to refer to a point made by Senator O'Toole, a man who can make a point very well.  I could not help thinking he was getting his vocal cords flexed for the next couple of weeks.  I want to say a few words about the designation of parts of the west as mountain areas. There is no doubt that I put an awful lot of work into this in the last few years and indeed it is fair to say that people before me, in all Governments, did likewise. There is no point in point scoring on this issue because no matter which Government are in power if we can get the mountain area status for the west it will be good for the west.  There are obviously huge impediments to our getting this <Col N="127" /> because I know all about the problems of the west <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Cantal area of France and, indeed, many other areas on which we have got in-depth detailed information.</P>
    <P>The problem is that many of the other countries have areas that should, in their view, be designated as mountain areas as well.  Obviously it comes back to the budget at Commission level.  I hope that in the not too distant future we will get that mountain area status.  There are counties in Connacht and indeed outside that province that should be entitled to this but, as all Governments in the last five or six years have found out, it is not an easy matter.  Everything will be done and the pressure will be kept on Brussels. Indeed, I compliment NCF and Donegal Creameries on the magnificent submission they have made.  I was with hill sheep farmers at Maam Cross, in Connemara, last week and they presented me with a similiar type of submission which, in fact, one could not quibble with.  I gave them my entire backing on it and I will do everything I can to ensure that we get that status as soon as is possible.</P>
    <P>There are two other things I would like to refer to.  The Government have decided that the off-farm income limit will be raised from £3,500 to £6,400.  This is something on which everybody has pressured me in the last two years.  I believe the right decision has been made. I do not think it is sufficient for Senator O'Toole to say that it cuts out many people who are working in forestry and the county council.  My information is that many of them who would be working the ordinary five day week with no overtime would be involved.  It is a huge jump from £3,500 to £6,400.  As Senator O'Toole said, we would like to have it higher if the budget permitted.  So it is a big step in the right direction and there will be many thousands of farmers who heretofore were not involved who will now be entitled to get their cattle and sheep headage payments.</P>
    <P>Might I refer to another item that Senator O'Toole mentioned?  A very practical man like Senator O'Toole may argue that <Col N="128" /> some of the application forms we have are quite detailed.  There is a reason for that.  We hope that, at the end of the day it will not be the cause of doing anybody out of a grant but we have to try to rationalise all those schemes.  Everybody here would like to think that I would be giving value for money and that whatever money is around will go to the farmers and is not spent on administration.  On one hand, people say to me: &ldquo;You have not enough offices and you have not enough officers,&rdquo; but on the other hand the farming organisations quite rightly say, &ldquo;Make sure that the greater part of whatever amount of money is earmarked for farmers gets back to them.&rdquo;  I can certainly say that in the last few years the Department have rationalised their procedures to the degree that for the calf scheme, the sheep scheme and the cattle scheme we had a composite form, that you made one application and, more important, the local AO want out and did the whole inspection on the one farm the one day.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to get over the problem that Senator O'Toole has talked about.  A number of older people, in particular, could not make head nor tail of the application form but you will always have some of that.  We have a great degree of cost-benefit analysis on the numbers of staff we have <i>vis-a-vis</i> the number of herd owners we deal with and every year that is getting somewhat better.</P>
    <P>One other matter was mentioned by Senator Ferris.  I would not have a clue where all the townlands that he and Senator Connor spoke about are except the ones I would know locally.  The areas mentioned were, in fact, surveyed as such and in this instance were found not to meet the criteria for one of three or four different reasons.  I would also like before I finish to refer to another point that was made by Senator O'Toole.  That is the question of the multiplicity of schemes that we have.  I would have to agree with him.  There is no doubt we have a scheme for everything and some people would be very confused about the numbers of schemes that we have.  Now that I am in <Col N="129" /> the process of renegotiating the western package, I can say with a certain amount of confidence that I will get over that problem to some degree.  There are certain types of grants that are running parallel to each other and in my view they should be lumped together to one degree or another.  While it is a very difficult task I think the outcome will be acceptable to most people as being a reasonable attempt to rationalise that problem.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Senator O'Toole say that one would have to pay for the agricultural advice when one got it.  While it is not relevant to this debate, I would not like the news to go out, from an ACOT point of view, that one has to pay for agricultural advice.  One does not have to pay for it.  If any farmer, in the west or anywhere else, wants advice from his ACOT office, it is available.  There are changes in the way they actually give that information, which I will not go into today, but I want to put it on the record of the House that our farmers do not have to pay for agricultural advice.</P>

      <P>Senator Connor referred to some aspects of the western package which was mentioned in this document.  I am in the process of renegotiating it.  We have had that for four years as a very important plank in western development and in western farming. There were certain aspects of that scheme that were of the utmost importance.  We think immediately of the group water scheme.  Obviously we must continue that because a farm or a house without running water is not a farm or a house at all. In this day and age the least people could expect is to have access to running water. <Col N="130" /> We still have many houses in rural Ireland that have not got running water.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor mentioned the calf-to-beef scheme.  It did not work, of course. I am of the opinion that no matter what you do with a calf-to-beef scheme in the west it will not work either.  Traditionally in the western region we do not keep our cattle until they are beef.  Perhaps we should, but we do not.  Indeed, in the last few years, even with new technology, it appears that we tend to sell the store cattle.  I believe that that scheme, well intentioned though it might have been, no matter what I do with it, will still not be used.  There are many other aspects of that for discussion on another day.  It is an important chance that we have got, that we can go back and renegotiate it. It is to run for another six years.  I hope we will get the act together a bit better on this occasion and that all the aspects Senator O'Toole mentioned, such as the mountain areas, the reclamation grants, the fencing grants, and so on, will bring a certain amount of <i>rationale</i> into it so that at least when a farmer decides to improve his lot he will know it is there, it is easily understood and, most of all, that it is possible for him to be eligible for it.  That is the important part of it.  I hope that in a few months time I will be announcing those various details and that they will be to the benefit of the people for whom they are intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the joint committee on this timely and important report dealing with the disadvantaged areas.  It is as concise as could be expected, taking up 43 pages including a very helpful coloured map which shows the then designated severely handicapped and other disadvantaged areas.  The report concludes by stating that in view of the importance the joint committee attached to this matter of disadvantaged areas it specifically requested a debate in the Dáil and Seanad at the earliest opportunity.  I am glad that this House has responded to that very reasonable request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important parts of the report come <Col N="131" /> under the headings of Existing Community Measures, Case for Reclassification of the Severely Handicapped Areas, Views of Joint Committee and, finally, Conclusion. The disadvantaged areas scheme as implemented in this country is based on the EC directive dealing with less favoured areas.  This directive provides for two types of areas &mdash; mountain areas and hill and lowland areas.  The directive requires properly, I believe, that the level of aid be varied in accordance with the degree of permanent natural handicap.  It is understandable for this reason that the poorer areas of the west are scheduled as severely handicapped.</P>
    <P>The areas of Ireland designated by the Council in 1975 were the western region, which included all of Counties Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo as well as parts of west Cork, the eastern region, incorporating mountain sheep grazing areas in counties Carlow, Cork, Dublin, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Offaly, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford and Wicklow.  The report deals with grant aid and explains that the directive has two main provisions (i) an increase in investment aid available to development farmers in less favoured areas and (ii) a system of payments to compensate for permanent natural handicaps. It states that the most important aid, having regard to both its cost and the number of benefiting farmers, is the system of headage payments.  The Irish Government introduced three schemes in the disadvantaged areas to implement the system of headage payments.  These are set out in the report, together with the list of other benefits which apply.  In their submission to the joint committee, the Irish Farmers' Association stated that in the past Ireland has not paid the maximum amount of compensatory allowances permissable under Directive 268. They pointed out that the off-farm income limit has been reduced to a very low level, at £3,500 gross income.  The Irish Farmers' Association proposed that the off-farm income clause should be increased to £6,500.  I am glad that since <Col N="132" /> 18 December the Minister has raised the off-farm income restriction to £6,400. Why the Minister did not go all the way to respond to their proposal &mdash; it would only have meant £100 &mdash; I do not know. He did not refer to this in his speech.</P>
    <P>The third review of the disadvantaged areas in Ireland was initiated in 1981 based on parts of district electoral divisions, presumably not smaller than townlands and culminated in a submission to the EC Commission on 2 August 1984. The report states that the volume of submissions and representations considered ensure that the situation in every county of Ireland was examined, comprising 600 district electoral divisions and 10,000 townlands covering nearly 4 million acres.  Not everyone has the greatest confidence in the Department of Agriculture where furnishing of statistical data to the EC is concerned, but I trust that they are correct in stating that no area which had any prospect of qualifying as disadvantaged was excluded.</P>
    <P>Regarding the submission made on 2 August 1984 to have the existing disadvantaged areas in Ireland extended and in certain cases reclassified, the Minister set out at considerable length the procedure involved because, as he said himself, he did not want the people to have the impression that extending the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas was only a matter of sending in a list to the Commission and that this ended the story. Nobody would expect it to be a simple matter.  But what I do not understand is why the Minister could not disclose all the information in relation to the submissions. If this could cause problems with regard to prejudice on the final outcome as the Minister stated, I cannot understand it.  I believe it to be a serious mistake to be so secretive about this important matter.  Of course, as the Minister has pointed out, the decisions have been made.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to County Meath, which the Minister covered in his speech.  Only a small area has been included in the less severely handicapped areas.  The district electoral divisions of <Col N="133" /> Ardagh, Moybologue, Trohanny in Kells Rural District, part of the district electoral divisions of Carrickleck, Kilmainham, Newcastle, Nobber and Posseckstown in Kells Rural District and Drumcondra in Ardee No. 2 Rural District.  There are many people in Meath who are very disappointed that the county did not benefit more under the scheme.  The Minister has gone into the details and more or less confirmed what I have stated on previous occasions, that the fertile plains of that area do not start on the county boundary. I think the Minister would agree that many areas are excluded which could not be compared with the remainder of the fertile land.  The soil surveys and the income from those areas would bear that out.  In general, while some progress has been made, there is still considerable dissatisfaction, and I hope this will be reversed in the future.</P>
    <P>Regarding the programme for western development known as the western package which was approved by the EC Commission in April 1981 the report points out that this consists of a wide range of measures designed to deal with the special problems of agriculture in the west, and it provides over a ten-year period for the injection into the western region of about £300 million, of which about half will come from the EC and half from the Exchequer.  The package includes considerable financial aid for the provision of essential services to farms including electricity supplies, water supplies, roads and land improvement.  It also includes orientation of agricultural production, afforestation, agricultural training and grants for agricultural marketing and processing.  It is satisfying to note from the report &mdash; although not everybody would agree &mdash; that in general terms under the western package infrastructural elements including water, roads and electricity are regarded as satisfactory and work is well on target.  Apparently, land improvement work under the regulation is satisfactory also.  Unfortunately, however, while work on illegal division of commonages is also satisfactory the amount of follow-up work being undertaken by owners of the divided <Col N="134" /> commonage, such as fencing and rehabilitation, is below expectations.  This is very difficult to understand, particularly since grants are available to farmers involved in commonage division to provide fencing, reclamation, surface treatment and access roads.  Also, I recall that the Minister was very enthusiastic about this particular operation when we dealt with the Bill on land leasing last year.  He was very optimistic too.  I would like to ask the Minister what has gone so seriously wrong since then.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture feel that the most disappointing aspect is the rate of progress under the orientation of production element, including the calf-to-beef scheme under which grants were available for on-farm investment.  Some of the reasons given for the poor uptake are the facts that there are restrictions on investment in dairying, that farmers over 55 years of age are excluded &mdash; except where management arrangements operate &mdash; that the scheme operates by way of a farm improvement plan which entails keeping of accounts and &mdash; regarding the calf-to-beef scheme &mdash; that aid is available only where there are borrowings.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he feels this is a particularly suitable time to have discussions on the package because the first review of the programme is due to take place this year in conjunction with the EC Commission.  While the Minister welcomed this opportunity to have that subject discussed more widely in the House and he stated that this year's review is very important since it would be the only chance to make meaningful changes in the programme which will run for ten years from 1981, I think the Minister might have taken us into his confidence and given us some idea of how he intends to deal with these problems.  The Department of Agriculture, realising the reasons behind the poor uptake, must at this stage have a fair idea of how they intend to deal with them.  I might also add in this respect that I feel the report itself could be more forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Regarding private afforestation, the report deals with forestry development as it is defined in the regulations.  It is <Col N="135" /> very difficult to understand why the rates of uptake of grant aid for private afforestation has been so extremely disappointing. Areas considered marginal for agricultural production are highly suitable for afforestation, and these include the north central region covering County Leitrim, east Sligo, south Donegal and west Cavan.  Other very suitable areas are County Clare and parts of north Tipperary. There is a suggestion that the poor progress with the forestry measure may be because there is no tradition of tree planting among Irish farmers.  Considering, however, that there are about one million acres of most suitable soil in the two regions which I mentioned, it is difficult to understand poor progress.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I have a copy of the leaflet &ldquo;Grants for Private Planting&rdquo; issued by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, Forest and Wildlife Service. It sets out the grants available, and I note the leaflet was published in February 1980.  The value of money has decreased since then, and perhaps all these grants need to be updated.  This would be necessary if the incentives were to have the same value now as they had then.  I feel the Minister would agree with this.  I also notice on this leaflet that it is stated that the planting of trees for shelter is not covered by the scheme.  On page 36 of the report it is stated that grants up to 80 per cent are available for shelter belts. Perhaps the Minister would like to clarify this apparent contradiction.  I would also like to say briefly that with regard to afforestation one of the big problems for investment would be forest fires.  The <i>Irish Press</i> of Monday, 18 February 1985 reported that we had two major forest fires involving over 500 acres in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>The publications of the Forest and Wildlife Service are well worth studying, and also the European Community green Europe newsletter on the Common Agricultural Policy.  &ldquo;Europe's Green Mantle: Heritage and Future of our Forests&rdquo; is well worth studying because I feel much more could be done in this area.  The problem of fires is something that should <Col N="136" /> get priority.  I suppose there are different ways of having suitable divisions between areas of the plantation.</P>
    <P>There is much more I would like to go into regarding the report but my time has run out.  In conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the joint committee, and I think it is only proper to thank also all those groups who had discussions with them for the benefit of the report, including representatives from the North Connaught Farmers CoOperative Society Limited, the Irish CoOperative Organisation Society and the Irish Farmers Association, also Mr. Eddie McSuibhne and Mr. Jerry Haigh from the Department of Agriculture</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at the outset to express gratitude to the Minister for the statement he made here a short time ago in which he gave a summary of what had been achieved and the difficulties we have when we seek to have extensions made under these schemes and have to make the case in Brussels.  We should express our satisfaction with what has been achieved in the latest extension.  It was no mean achievement to have an extra 800,000 acres included in the severely handicapped areas and to have about 407,000 included in the disadvantaged areas, as the Minister said, taking us to a total of over one million-and-a-half acres.  That is an achievement that we should be highly satisfied with.  It does not mean, of course, that we are 100 per cent satisfied: people are never satisfied, but at the same time it is wrong not to acknowledge success when it has been achieved.  I would like to compliment the Minister and his officials and everybody involved in the presentation of this case in Brussels and to express satisfaction with the favourable results achieved so far and the hope that they will continue to press the case.  I was very interested to hear that the case presented by the Government in Brussels was for four million acres, because there is a view that only the areas that are now included were listed and a case made to Brussels for them.  I would have been very much surprised if that had been so because I know <Col N="137" /> areas in my own part of the country where people cannot understand why they are not included.  There must have been a number of very borderline cases between exclusion and inclusion.  I hope the Minister and the Department will continue to press the claim for these areas that should be included.</P>
      <P>I was very interested to hear the Minister make one particular point in relation to the criterion of population because in parts of the country, where the area holds a certain scenic attraction but is certainly not fertile and certainly not a highly productive area, people who might otherwise be living in towns move out to live in these areas and the population is increased.</P>
      <P>In the assessment of the population it should be borne in mind that it is the population of the area which derives its income solely from agriculture that is concerned because I could list a number of areas convenient to different towns in Cavan where people have moved out to live, perhaps for peace and quiet or for the scenic attraction.  It is true that the development of group water schemes and rural electrification have encouraged a tendency to move out of towns and live in an area near a town and that gives an artificial figure of population in these districts.  If that kind of growth in an area that is being considered for inclusion in the severely handicapped or disadvantaged areas is not examined in depth such an area would never have a hope of being included unless the population criterion becomes much more flexible, as the Minister hopes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Cavan about 74,000 extra acres have been added on to the severely handicapped areas and that has given a good deal of satisfaction.  However, it has not given 100 per cent satisfaction all over the county but it has generated a good deal of satisfaction and a great deal of appreciation for the work that was done. A great breakthrough was the taking of a townland as a unit instead of the district electoral division.  Anyone who knows rural Ireland at all knows perfectly well that in a great number of district electoral divisions you have a wide variety of land, <Col N="138" /> ranging from very poor, non-productive, or productive at a very low rate, to reasonably good land and in some cases in a district electoral division you will have land of top quality or near it.  The early insistence on taking the district electoral division as the unit worked to the disadvantage of counties like Cavan and Monaghan and other counties in that part of the country.  It was a great breakthrough when it was conceded that a townland be taken as a unit.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of altitude which has come up, I was on a number of deputations with people from Cavan and Monaghan to different Ministers under this Government and the previous Government.  One of the criteria put forward at that time was altitude.  I was told by a Fianna Fáil Minister that when the case was presented to Europe what we consider mountain areas in this country are looked on as hills in Europe where the altitude of mountains is greatly in excess of mountains in Ireland.  I understand the point.  I was interested when the Minister here today said he would continue to press for the inclusion of what we regard as mountainous areas even though in comparison to the high mountain ranges in Europe ours would seem to be only hills or hillocks.  The productivity of these regions is very low and it is necessary that people get support of some kind in order to be able to live there in any sort of comfort.</P>
    <P>One guiding principle that should be borne in mind when these assessments are being prepared is the amount of capital that it is claimed is justifiable in setting up a new job in industry and compare that with the relatively low amount of capital or support that will help a man and his family to continue to live in a state of reasonable comfort on a farm and be productive at the same time.</P>
    <P>I would like also to draw attention to the fact that headage payments encourage increased productivity.  They should be examined from that point of view and contrasted with the unemployment assistance which is calculated now on the wealth generated in an area or by an applicant.  It is an incentive to produce <Col N="139" /> less, whereas the headage payment is an incentive to produce more.  The overall advantage of extending these headage payments to areas where farmers need assistance is, in the long run, calculated to produce more wealth in the country and for that reason it should be welcomed sincerely.  That is part of the reason why I compliment the Minister and his staff on what they have done in including well over three-quarters of a million acres in the severely handicapped areas.  That will result in increased productivity in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of encouraging the Minister to pursue the efforts to include Border areas I would like to draw attention to the fact that there are areas I know in County Cavan &mdash; the Minister knows some of them himself &mdash; where nobody can understand why they were omitted. They are quite close to areas that were included.  They meet the criterion of declining population and the other criteria also.  Part of the district electoral division of Moynehall, Cavan town, has been included; a very small part of the parish of Lavey; none of the parish of Laragh, very little of Denn and very little of Castletara.  These are parishes I know and which the Minister knows also.  I do not know why all of those areas were not included.  It must certainly have been a hairline decision as to whether they were to be included or to be omitted.  Comparing the land and the decline in population in some of these parishes with areas that are included, it is beyond me why they were not included and ACOT and agricultural advisers in Cavan are of the same opinion.</P>
    <P>The biggest surprise of all is that none of the Bailieborough electoral area is included and only part of the Ballyjames-duff electoral area is now classified as severely handicapped.  This is a disappointment to me.  May I draw the Minister's attention again to the area that he knows well, Upper Laragh, Carrigallan, and the parish of Knockbride and the Shercock area where the land is very hilly and much of it of very poor quality with a big decline in population.  That is a <Col N="140" /> genuine rural population of farming people, if you exclude people who have moved to live in the area from towns, tradesmen and professional people.</P>
    <P>I would be failing in my duty as a representative of the area if I did not do what I could to impress on the Minister our hope that whenever another review takes place these cases will be pushed through with all the muscle he can command. I am very happy to say, in common with other Senators, that a reasonable off-farm income of over £6,000 does not debar one from participating in these schemes because it cannot be denied that some people who are anxious to succeed in the world and provide for themselves and their families, in addition to holding a job, run small farms.  That is meant to supplement the income from whatever job they hold and it is meant to give them an opportunity to give the members of the family a fair start in life.  It is wrong to say that just because they hold jobs, their desire to get on in the world, produce more wealth and improve the conditions of themselves and their families, they should be taxed to such a degree that there is no incentive for them to do it.  Increasing the off-farm income was a great step forward.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the Minister and his staff and all concerned in this work must be congratulated on the success they achieved. The very fact that they are congratulated for what they did will encourage them to do more in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking on this motion. Our committee looked in depth at all the directives and at the proposals of both the Commission and Government.  We had the advantage that our members came from practically all parts of the country.  It is fair to say that the document before the House today is the result of much thought and consideration and a considerable amount of work from the members of the committee and the subcommittee who assessed the situation. We ought to compliment the Minister and the Government on their work and <Col N="141" /> their provision which has enabled the significant extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme, as the Minister said, in 21 counties in the Republic this year.</P>
      <P>This move will clearly demonstrate to thousands of farmers, and especially small farmers, the determination of not just the Government but the Commission of the European Community to try to bring about a more equitable distribution. It is though this scheme in particular, and the regional policy scheme, that the real force of the aspirations of the people who founded the European Community shines out.  I hope that their efforts will be successful.</P>
      <P>I am particularly happy that the Minister has in this rearrangement of the disadvantaged areas included an additional 98,000 acres of the Sliabh Margy area which is in Laois and down to the Kilkenny border area and that is included, only unfortunately, as less severely handicapped.  Nevertheless it does confer considerable benefits on the many hundreds of farmers there.  The farmers in those areas can benefit from the beef cow headage payments scheme which at present is £32 for the first ten cows and then £28 for the next 18 livestock units. This brings in a maximum of £824 per farm on that scheme alone.  I read where it is the intention of the Government to increase that figure of £32 per cow to £70 in the coming financial year.  That should give a significant basic flow of income to many small farmers in that rather difficult area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that this area was not included originally in the 1975-76 scheme.  Some two or three years ago An Foras Talúntais did a marvellous job in our county in their soil survey which clearly indicated that the structure of the soil in that area and in other areas of the County of Laois met the criteria laid down by the Commission.  The farmers in the areas designated less severely handicapped have the benefit of the calf scheme and the sheep headage payments scheme and this will be of considerable benefit to them.  I hope the Chair will bear with me while I mention the townlands benefiting from that.  In the DED of <Col N="142" /> Blandsfort there is Garrintaggart and Graiguenasmuttan.  In Rossmore, there is Rossmore, and part of Clogrenan, all of the DED of Newtown.  In Ballinakill there is Boleybawn.</P>
    <P>I want to say and to repeat to the Minister, my disappointment and disbelief that Boleybeg in the DED of Ballinakill was not included.  From my point of view, as a farmer, looking at the particular areas and at the problems of the farmers there &mdash; I am not an expert such as the Minister would have in his Department &mdash; it is difficult to understand how a small townland like Boleybeg should be excluded.  I think the Minister should look very closely at what would appear to be discrimination in these situations. The Minister has not said what criteria his officers used.  I think it is because farmers in some of these areas have put more muscle into their farms and they look better.  I do not think they should be penalised by virtue of their thrift and industry.  All of the DED of Farnans is in and all of the DED of Doonane.  In the DED of Turra there is Ballynakill, Drumagh, Rushes, Towlerton and Turra, and all of the townlands of Ardough.</P>
    <P>In the DED of Rathspick we have Aghamafir, Boley, Crissard, Kellystown, Kilfeacle, Kylenabehy, Mullaghmore, Shanragh and Wolfhill.  We have Ballylehane Upper.  In the DED of Ballickmoyler we have Keeloge.  In Luggacurren we have Brennanshill, Coolglass, Fallowbeg Upper, Fernyhill, Gooreelagh, Luggacurren, Manger, Monamanry, Scotland. In the highest point in Luggacurren between 700 and 800 hundred feet up, we have the townland of Coolrusk which comprises fewer than 200 acres and which for some extraordinary reason &mdash; perhaps because the road was too bad for the Department officials to go down; they probably could not get through it during the winter because it was cut off during the snow for at least a fortnight &mdash; was forgotten about.</P>
    <P>There is a blatant omission there.  I want the Minister to look very seriously at that omission.  The fact that they left out Coolrusk which has a few farmers there who are being grossly and unfairly <Col N="143" /> treated is something which I cannot understand.  I cannot understand the officials' motivation.  Perhaps they came in a snowstorm and then forgot about it, or there was a crease in the map and they did not see it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to request the officials to look again at the townland of Coolrusk in the Luggacurren DED and perhaps he might let me know why it was left out and why it cannot be included.  I do not think it is too late to rectify the obvious mistakes that appear in the entire list.  In, also, are the DED of Timahoe, Aghoney, Ballinaclogh Upper and Garryglass. In the DED of Fossy there is Aghadreen, Baunogemeely, Fossy Upper, Knockacrin, Knocklead and Orchard Upper.  In the DED of Dysartgallen there is Aghnacross, Clenagh, Graiguenahown, Keelagh, Knockardagur, Knockbaun and Moyadd.</P>
    <P>The land is those disadvantaged areas is all very difficult land.  It is suitable for tillage.  The problem is that it will give at least some income to some people.  They suffer the worst disadvantages of the climate. They get a much higher rainfall.  If it snows they are cut off for several days, or more.</P>
    <P>In Laois the people in the Slieve Bloom area are much more fortunate.  Their area has been deemed to be more severely disadvantaged.  The Government have included 49,000 acres in this category on Slieve Bloom.  The Minister's official forgot a couple of townlands as well. There is the townland of Cartown.  This is something I want to have redressed. There is absolutely no obvious or credible excuse why the Department should exclude a couple of hundred acres in small townlands.  From the point of view of the man in the street they look all the same and have all the disadvantages that their neighbours endure.</P>
    <P>The more severely disadvantaged areas have considerable benefits and I wish them well.  They have the cattle headage payments.  It applies to all types of cattle, which is an advantage.  On each of the first eight livestock units there is £32 payment while on each livestock unit <Col N="144" /> in excess of eight and up to a maximum of 30 there is £28 per year.  That comes to £872 per year.  The Minister said that this will be increased next year.  They have the high rate of beef cow grants, the calf scheme and the sheep headage payments scheme which afford the maximum of £1,550 per farm.  This will be a considerable boost.  When one is talking about £1,600 or £800 to people who are in the Department who may have £20,000 or £25,000 a year, it is not a big sum.  If one looks at the farm survey and takes the average figure of farm income it does not look too bad.</P>
    <P>When we move into the hills to the areas that are disadvantaged, where the average yield for gallons from dairy stock and the yield per acre in beef falls to perhaps a third of the national average, a grant from the Government of £800 or £1,500 is of considerable advantage. However, when we talk of the sheep headage scheme as far as County Laois is concerned whether it is in the Slieve Margy, Slieve Bloom or other areas we have not got a tradition of sheep farming there for the simple reason that the land is so wet.  It is not suitable for sheep.  The people in the Department of Agriculture are conferring a tremendous advantage. One has to drive for an hour in that area before seeing a flock of sheep.  This is a problem that possibly has been overlooked. Perhaps the Department may think that farmers should move into sheep production but the tradition has not been there.  There is no great move to improve that.  I am not saying that there are no sheep, but comparing it with Wicklow and Galway we do not have the same sheep population.</P>
    <P>Some areas have suffered, especially the Rossmore area.  In the high plateau overlooking the town and the fertile plains of Carlow and south Kildare a number of people moved out to provide themselves with new homes on the hill overlooking that plain which affords them a view of Wales on a fine day.  The fact that people have bought sites and built houses in that rather beautiful area has done an injustice to the landowners because the population increased there <Col N="145" /> even though they have absolutely nothing to do with the agricultural industry.  They just happen to be living there and working in Carlow town or county.</P>
    <P>When the Minister and the Government are looking at this problem again they should look at the population which is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.  They should not include people who just find it convenient and very pleasant to live in that area.  There is a very clear distinction between a person, whether he or she is a civil servant or someone other than a person engaged in agriculture, who is building himself or herself a £30,000 or £40,000 bungalow or house in a scenic place, and a small cottier farmer trying to eke out an existence on 35 or 50 acres, where land is inhospitable and where the slope on the side of a hill is 60 degrees.  If the Department officials with their expertise cannot see the difference then we should take a very hard look at the officials and the people who are advising the Government on these situations.</P>
    <P>The joint committee have made a very worthwhile contribution in examining the Commission's proposals and in considering the benefit that the extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme has for the three categories, the more severely handicapped, the less severely handicapped and the sheep grazing scheme.  It is certainly a step in the right direction. It gives the people who are under the greatest pressure in the agricultural sector some hope that the Commission, which we put so much hope in over the last ten years, is at least taking its responsibilities seriously.  I wish all the people throughout the country who are now in these new categorised areas success and a better measure of prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank my colleagues on the joint committee for their efforts in compiling what has been recognised during the course of this debate as a very excellent report.  It is always vital that we should avail ourselves of every opportunity to assess and monitor the variety of schemes which operate from Brussels in order that we not only <Col N="146" /> maximise the amount of payments that can be won in negotiations in Brussels but also that we have a coherent and positive policy approach here in our own country in order that these schemes will have the maximum benefit possible.</P>
      <P>I would, secondly, like to thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate. I know that perhaps some as they drove down quite a number of cul de sacs on their way towards the 20 June found it impossible to find unqualifying applicants left and right of the roadway and that does present a lot of difficulty for any Minister at a time like this.  Overall, I would like to compliment the Minister and his staff for the fairly exhaustive examination that was carried out over all of the country for the purpose of extending the disadvantaged areas scheme. There will never be a time when we will not quibble about areas that may be left in or left out.  There will never be a time when one will find a solution to all these problems.  It is important that at every opportunity we should try to extend and expand these schemes.  No opportunity should be lost to explore these possibilities. At the same time no conclusion to any negotiations should ever be accepted to be the final answer.  Therefore, we look to every other opportunity that will be available to us in future years to improve on this scheme and to undo some of the defects which are obviously in this scheme as were in the earlier schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the Minister's contribution he highlighted a fact which is not well known in the country and may be emphasised again.  This was brought out very clearly in the second soil survey categorising soils in 27 categories.  That survey indicated that in every county there was the poorest of poor land.  Most people associate poor marginal agricultural land with the 12 western counties, and from that point of view a lot of the eastern, southern and other parts of the country were partially neglected.  On this occasion, and hopefully, in future negotiations more cognisance will be taken of that fact.  We hope that all areas wherever they are will get equitable treatment because, as we know, more than half the <Col N="147" /> farmers live, work and farm on marginal agricultural land.  It is not possible for them to extract any more than about half the potential of what is possible on better land.  Therefore, they have a huge income problem.</P>
    <P>As we look at the development in the country generally we see how much we have centralised all our services and how our towns and some of our cities have grown out of all bounds.  We see suburbia and the topical traffic and other ancillary problems that go with that.  The aim of trying to ensure that the maximum number of people had a reasonable standard of living on the land persisted in the earlier part of this century.  It is even more necessary today as there are no suitable employment opportunities available to those people if they have to leave the land.  Therefore, farm income supplements by whatever means in this or other schemes have to form an integral part of agricultural policy as far as we can see into the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for taking up my suggestion of extending the western package to the Sliabh Phelim area.  I have naturally been telling the people down in that region that the Minister is inclined to listen to suggestions of that nature.  In that western package which is now up for review &mdash; and which has some disappointing features in relation to how the general shake-up was &mdash; I would like to ask the Minister to make a special effort on the question of afforestation.  The soil survey indicated that something like 3,500,000 hectares of land in this country is unsuitable or marginally suitable for the main line of agricultural production.  Quite a lot of it is very suitable for afforestation.  We, unfortunately, at the moment are cutting back on State plantations and I think that needs to be arrested.  In the area of private afforestation it is time for a major initiative, with a huge deficit in timber imports into the country, the UK and into Europe generally.  With the climatic and other advantages that we have, the statistics show that the capacity to produce timber per cubic metre per hectare <Col N="148" /> here in this country on most of our lands is the very best in Europe.  We must take into account that the imports into the European Communities, particularly from Scandinavian countries, are produced on land with a cubic capacity of about a fifth of what is possible in this country.  We have to break down barriers and many of the traditional attitudes that exist.  We have not to go back very far in our history to find the times when we had huge woodlands and plantations in the country.  The unknown poet &mdash; or at least from my point of view at the moment &mdash; if somebody can help me I would be glad &mdash; who wrote Cill Cais said &mdash;&ldquo;Cad a dhéanfaimíd feasta gan adhmad?  Tá deireadh na gcoillte ar lár.&rdquo;  Looking at the woodlands and the changed agricultural scene at that time with colonisation and the British war necessity stripping these woodlands and seeing the countryside being stripped of them he wrote that poem.  In a lot of ways when one considers that our good land and improved marginal land can produce sufficient agricultural products, and when one takes into account the quota system on milk we have got to find some other answers to the problems on the marginal land.  I would appeal to the Minister in these negotiations to find some way of coping with the initial financial situation which a farmer who wants to get involved in private afforestation or, indeed, leasing of land for that purpose can encounter on the income side.  Such a farmer is used to a yearly income on whatever production he is in at the moment.  To release this land for afforestation, however suitable it might be, creates an immediate income problem for him.  It is very difficult to explain to people that the main benefit for this is going to come in 30 years time when he expects to be pushing up the daisies, if one considers the age structure of a lot of farmers in the Connacht and other regions.  I am not denying them the full right to live to be the oldest in the country, if possible, but that is looking at it realistically.  We need to look at that situation seriously.  Is there any way where the headage schemes or payments <Col N="149" /> of that kind could be made on a year-on-year-off basis to try to encourage people? My view of it is that if we do not make a breakthrough on the structural side at present with the limitations and the quotas on milk production and the problems with cereals and with beef, and if we do not make a change and take initiatives now we will lose the opportunity.  The Minister will accept that there is a greater openness in the Commission at present for structural aids and for developments of that kind than was there previously. That is all the more important with the limitations in so many other areas.</P>
    <P>I condemned a few other Senators for being somewhat parochial in their contributions. I have a map which was presented to me last Saturday showing a white region here in Drumban, near Thurles, and I must say the group of people who came, of all political persuasions, to me did not come with any clear sense of grievance, but asking that something positive should be done for them.  I accept what Senator McDonald has said in relation to having a change in relation to population.  The deputation named out 25 families and their homes that have disappeared from that area in the past 25 years.  They have a huge haemorrhage from that area, and it is in the middle of a belt that has qualified and it is inexplicable as to how it has been excluded.</P>
    <P>I recognise, as I said at the outset, that these things will always happen, but we have to remain open to further suggestion and improvement on these schemes at the very first opportunity presented to us.  I ask the Minister to take a special interest in these situations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the committe's report and the extension to these areas announced by the Minister.  There is no doubt but that all of these contribute towards helping people to remain on the land and to improve the very poor income situations of a lot of our farmers.  The structural aids and the improvement of the western package and the general use of facilities in order to maintain more of our people in the rural areas is the road that we have to travel down, especially at present. With the pressures on other main line <Col N="150" /> agricultural production every avenue has to be explored to maximise and improve what has been won over the years.  Hopefully, we can report at a later time some further progress in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to respond to the motion on this report which has been put down by Senators Dooge and Ferris.  This is the second report which has been produced by this committee and I must again commend the group for the speed with which they have reached their conclusions.  The report is quite extensive, containing in all more than 80 recommendations and relates to areas which are the responsibility of a number of Ministers, including the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and particularly, the Minister for Finance who is responsible for taxation matters <Col N="151" /> generally.  Indeed I notice that the question of taxation takes up a full chapter in the report and I would hope that the Minister for Finance might find it possible, at a later stage, to respond to the committee's report on this point.</P>
      <P>For the moment, however, I will confine myself to dealing with the areas which are my responsibility and on which the committee have made specific recommendations. Before doing so I should perhaps say that in establishing this committee and in drawing up their terms of reference, the intention was to get a comprehensive and accurate idea of the concerns and interests of small businesses in the country at this time.  I think this has been achieved in the two reports we have seen to date and the recommendations which are set out in those reports reflect very closely the views of the small businesses which the committee have consulted. However, Senators will appreciate that in the formulation of policy in this, as indeed in other areas, the Government must have regard to the broader question of the overall national good and must take into account the views and interests of other groups and organisations which may not always coincide with the views set out in these reports.  This does not necessarily detract from the findings of a report such as this but I must emphasise that these may only be one element of the input which goes into the decision making process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me deal now with some of the specific points raised in this report.  The committee have devoted a full chapter of the report to the subject of multiple grocery stores and this reflects the concern which has been expressed in recent years both to the Minister and to his predecessors by representatives of the independent retail and distribution grocery trade.  The questions that arise in this area fall mainly into the realm of competition policy and, with the indulgence of the House, I should like to outline briefly the history of developments in this area in order to paint the background against which these demands arise and <Col N="152" /> the broader policy considerations which must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>In the early fifties it was recognised that there was a need for a policy framework within which the various economic sectors could develop in accordance with the interests of the common good.  One reflection of this policy was the enactment in 1953 of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act which facilitated the tackling of various undesirable practices which then existed.  Under that Act, the Fair Trade Commission were established and given the powers to carry out inquiries into the supply and distribution of goods and to make recommendations to the Minister for action to deal with any abuses identified.  Shortly after their establishment, the commission noted that there was creeping paralysis of price competition in large areas of distributive trading and a tendency towards the freezing of distributive arrangements without allowance for economic change.  Among the practices which were recognised as being widespread were limitation or regulation of entry into trade, retail price maintenance by manufacturers, price fixing and margins fixing by trade associations, punitive action against traders who had not observed such fixed prices of margins and various other devices which were seen as restraining or suppressing competition unfairly or to the disadvantage of the public.</P>
    <P>One of the first areas which received attention by the commission was the grocery sector and since then a number of public inquiries into various aspects of the grocery trade have been carried out by both the Fair Trade Commission, and their 1972 successor, the Restrictive Practices Commission.  Since that first inquiry in 1956, a total of seven Restrictive Practice (Grocery) Orders have been made by successive Ministers.</P>
    <P>The most recent such order was made in 1981 and followed on a public inquiry by the commission into the retail sale of grocery goods below cost.  This brings me to the first of the joint committee's recommendations, that of a ban on low cost sales of grocery goods.  The inquiry I have referred to was carried out by <Col N="153" /> the commission under section 5 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, and received submissions from all the major organisations having an interest in this area, ranging from trade interests such as manufacturers, distributors-wholesalers, independent retailers and multiple groups on the one hand to organisations representing housewives, consumers and workers in the trade.</P>
    <P>The public sittings of the inquiry extended over 11 days and evidence on oath was taken from 25 witnesses.  I mention this in order to underline the scope and breadth of the inquiry which was undertaken and the seriousness with which the commission viewed their task. Perhaps I might mention also that in undertaking public inquiries under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, the commission are statutorily obliged to have regard to a list of unfair practices which are set out in the Third Schedule to that Act.  These include any measures, agreements or acts which are likely unreasonably to limit or restrain free and fair competition, unjustly eliminate a competitor, enhance prices of goods or charges for services, secure unfairly a substantial or complete control of the market, give preference in regard to the supply of goods or the provision of services or in any other respect operate against the common good or not in accordance with the principles of social justice.  I am sure that Senators will agree that this gives the commission quite a broad and extensive remit and the commission did, in fact, produce a thorough and comprehensive report on the matter running to more than 80 pages.</P>
    <P>In their report the commission considered the question of below cost selling in detail from the points of view of suppliers, distributors and consumers.  The commission concluded that the prohibition of below cost selling apart from giving rise to mumerous practical points of difficulty would constitute a form of official retail price maintenance which would represent a reversal of a State policy which had brought rapid progress into trade and benefits to the consumer <Col N="154" /> since the fifties.  They considered furthermore that it would limit the scope for the deployment and development of the retailers' skills in meeting competition &mdash; most particularly in relation to prices &mdash; which must be regarded as vital to trade in any sector.  They did not consider that the prohibition of below cost selling would be to the advantage of the manufacturer or distributor to an extent which would justify so serious an interference with freedom to trade, particularly having regard to the legal constraints which already existed in this area.  These constraints, which now include a prohibition on the advertising of goods for sale below cost &mdash; and let us remember that below cost selling is used mainly as an advertising tactic and is generally of limited duration and effect &mdash; are consolidated in the Restrictive Practices, (Groceries), 1981 Order already referred to which regulates generally the relationship between suppliers, wholesalers and retailers in respect of grocery goods.  I might add that in many respects, the 1981 order is not too dissimilar to the US Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, which is referred to in the committee's report.</P>
    <P>I have examined this chapter of the committee's report particularly closely but I am afraid that I cannot find anything in the views put forward which would cause me to rethink the Restrictive Practices Commission's conclusions on the subject of below cost selling.  I think the committee may have exaggerated slightly in claiming that the degree of concentration in the Irish grocery industry is much higher than that of the same industry in any other country.  The position in the other member states of the EC was, in fact, recently examined by the Commerce and Distribution Division of the Directorate General for Industrial and Technological Affairs of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The report produced by this working group, on which my Department were represented, found that the growth in market share of the multiple supermarket groups and the decline in the numbers of small retail grocery shops had been common to all member states with the <Col N="155" /> possible exceptions of Italy and Greece. In Denmark, for example, which has a population roughly similar to our own, it was estimated that the share of the market held by the multiple groups was more than 50 per cent which is broadly the same as the figure for the national market here.  I understand that the most recent figures for the UK show a market share for the multiples of more than 60 per cent.  The EC group found that the trend towards greater concentration represented a shift to a more balanced relationship between industry and commerce and was a logical outcome of general social and economic development. These developments included the growth in the population and workforce, continuing technological progress and rationalisation of production, the introduction of self-service systems, the emergence of new types of store and forms of cooperation within the commercial sector.</P>
    <P>One aspect I did find of interest in the committee's report was the section dealing with the views of the multiple groups themselves on the issue of below cost selling.  The impression is clearly given in the report that the multiples would now be prepared to accept a ban on below cost selling.  I am not sure if this is so but even if it were the case, it would not represent, in my view, a good reason for imposing such a ban by means of legislation.  On the contrary, it could well be argued that if there is agreement on all sides that the practice should be stopped, then there is clearly no need for legislation and I would like to say, here and now, that if all sides of the trade are convinced that the practice is an undesirable one, I would have no objection whatever to a voluntary cessation of such activities.  I would suggest, however, that the reality is that businesses which are as competitive as the major multiple groups at present are, will always seek to be &ldquo;one up&rdquo; on their competitors, and a legislative ban on below cost selling might well succeed only in encouraging competition in other&mdash;non-price &mdash; areas which might not have the same immediate &mdash; albeit <Col N="156" /> temporary &mdash; benefit for a relatively large number of consumers.</P>
    <P>It was suggested, for example, during the Restrictive Practices Commission inquiry that a ban on below cost selling would probably mean that multiples would turn more to prize promotions such as free cars, holidays, etc., which would be of much less overall benefit to the economy.  I am concerned also about the possible effect of a ban on below cost selling on the food import situation.  I know that this is an area of concern to the committee and they have referred to it in the report.  The committee seem to be of the opinion that a ban on below cost selling could, in some way, cut down on the amount of food imports.  I would suggest to them that it might well have the opposite effect.  This view was expressed during the course of the Restrictive Practices Commission inquiry when it was pointed out that a ban on below cost selling could well lead to an increase in the number of imported grocery lines as the retailers sought to find a competing line with which to match or beat their rivals' prices.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind also that some of the major multiple groups have large UK parents which might well be capable of supplying produce to the Irish market at a price below that which could be matched reasonably by Irish manufacturers. I would suggest further that because of the economies of scale which inevitably exist in any trade the &ldquo;cost&rdquo;, however defined, to a small retailer will almost always be higher than that of a group which has greater buying power, and thus a statutory ban on below cost selling would render it illegal for the smaller retailer to try to match the price of the larger retailer, which could be significantly lower.</P>
    <P>The second of the committee's recommendations in the grocery area was that no one retail group or multiple should control in excess of 25 per cent of the Irish retail market.  This is a recommendation about which I would have grave reservations. On this point I would draw the attention of Senators to the existence of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies <Col N="157" /> (Control) Act, 1978 which, as its title implies, deals with the control of acquisitions and of existing monopolies in business generally.  I would draw attention particularly to the definition of monopoly contained in that Act.</P>
    <P>A monopoly, for the purposes of the Act, is defined as being an enterprise, or two or more enterprises under common control, which supply or provide, or to which is supplied or provided, not less than one-half of goods or services of a particular kind supplied or provided in the State in a particular year.  It is abundantly clear therefore that the wish of the Oireachtas, as reflected in that Act, is that the point at which concern should arise as to the market share of an individual company, or commonly controlled group of companies, is when at least 50 per cent of the goods or services in question is controlled centrally by a common control agency.  I hardly need to point out to the House the implications of introducing a different threshold of concern in respect of a particular sector, in terms of the legislation as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if such a figure were to be introduced it would immediately lead to calls for similar special provisions in other sectors and, once the general competition control legislation had been departed from and the principle of intervention conceded, it would be extremely difficult to resist and restrain such demands.  This is equally true of a ban on below cost selling.  In such a situation we could eventually end up with a plethora of <i>ad hoc</i> and fragmentary legislation which would be both costly and extremely difficult to enforce.</P>
    <P>In any case I am not at all convinced that such a proposal is either necessary or desirable.  I am extremely loath to introduce legislative restrictions in the conduct of trade, particularly in an area which is as competitive as this one.  Such restrictions tend to introduce undesirable structural rigidities in the market place and would be likely to inhibit the incentive for multiples to engage in efficiency and cost improving methods and systems which, after all, are generally aimed at increasing individual market share.  The <Col N="158" /> figure of 25 per cent chosen by the committee is a purely arbitrary one and I can see no justification for it in this context.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, so far as I am aware, no other country has found it necessary to introduce such an individual market share limit in this area.  It is clear, even from the international comparisions contained in the committee's own report &mdash; which, incidentally, are quite detailed &mdash; that while the regime differs from country to country, it is evident that in all cases the question of supermarket, or a large store development is seen as one to be regulated primarily by means of the planning system of the country in question.</P>
    <P>This, then, takes me to the third of the committee's recommendations namely an amendment of the Local Government (Planning and General Policy) Directive, 1982.  I should, perhaps, point out here that this directive superseded an earlier and less extensive 1981 directive issued by the Minister for the Environment and was introduced as a result of strong representations by a group representing wholesaler and independent retailer interests.</P>
    <P>Any question, therefore, of an amendment of the 1982 directive would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment but I should like just to draw the attention of Senators to the actual provisions of the 1982 directive, since they may not be aware of them.  The directive specifies that policy in relation to planning and development requires that the establishment of retail shopping development which will represent a large scale addition to the existing retail shopping capacity in a locality, should be guided by certain specified considerations.  These include the adequacy of existing retail shopping outlets, the size and location of existing retail shopping outlets, the quality and convenience of existing retail shopping outlets, the effect on existing communities including, in particular, the effect on established retail shopping outlets and on employment and the needs of the elderly, infirm or disabled or other persons who may be dependent on the availability of local retail shopping outlets.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators will agree that this <Col N="159" /> lays down fairly clear ground rules for planning authorities in relation to any new developments and I would point out that the grocery sector is the only sector to date which has been singled out for such special treatment.</P>
    <P>Lest the members of the committee think that I am being unduly harsh in relation to their conclusions I should say that I am in agreement with some of their findings in relation to the trade.  In particular, I would echo their assertion that many difficulties of the independent retailers can be resolved only by their own actions in the areas particularly of quality control, presentation, hygiene, use of space and so on.  Indeed I would go so far as to say that there will always be a place in the market for the good, professional small retailer who can identify his market correctly and service it using skills which the larger trader, because of his very size, cannot match, that is, personal service, specialisation, flexible hours, and so on.  This point was also mentioned in the RPC inquiry report where they said, &ldquo;it is clear that even at its fullest development the multiple sector needs to be supplemented by independents&rdquo;. They went on to point out that as supermarkets have broadened their range to include goods which the grocery trade of a generation ago left to specialist shops, such as butchers and greengrocers, some independents have successfully moved in the opposite direction and, while still carrying a range of foods, have specialised in wines, delicatessen foods and so on.  This trend seems likely to continue and to offer opportunities for development to many independent grocers.  One of the features of the trade, characterised as it is by a large number of autonomous entrepreneurs, is its ability to see and exploit local opportunities as they occur, and this is an advantage which the independent sector will continue to enjoy.</P>
    <P>I would stress also to independent retailers the benefits, from a buying point of view, of co-operating with each other. It is a truism that &ldquo;unity is strength&rdquo; but <Col N="160" /> it is particularly valid when it comes to an area where, as the committee themselves recognise, the multiple groups will usually have a competitive advantage by virtue of their purchasing power and economics of scale.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the subject of casual trading, which is dealt with in the committee's report in the chapter on the black economy.  I would point out, first, that the summary of the scope of the Casual Trading Act is not strictly accurate.  In particular I would point out that except for certain circumstances specified in section 2(2), the Act does apply to what the report describes &mdash; on page 23 &mdash; as &ldquo;brown goods&rdquo;, and it also applies to the selling of fish, horticulture and agricultural produce unless these are sold by the person who caught the fish, or a member of the crew of his boat, or the producer of the horticultural and agricultural product or his servant or agent.</P>
    <P>As the report indicates, there are local authorities who have not so far designated casual trading areas.  It is not strictly accurate to say that it was intended that local authorities should designate trading areas.  The Act was designed to give these, who had problems associated with casual trading, such powers as they might reasonably ask for to relocate street trading areas and &mdash; or regulate casual trading by means of by-laws &mdash; the authorities are empowered to make these by-laws and conditions attached to casual trading permits.  Essentially, the Act empowers local authorities to fit casual trading into local development plans to make it a service to the community rather than the nuisance it can otherwise be.</P>
    <P>As in all planning matters, conflicts of interest arise, and provision had to be made for appeals against a local authority's proposals to the Act.  It is open to street traders, shopkeepers, tenants' associations or any other interests or, indeed, individuals, to appeal to the Circuit Court which, on hearing the appeal may oppose the local authority's proposals with or without conditions or reject them.  The Planning Acts provide for <Col N="161" /> appeals against other planning proposals, and it is excessive to say that the Casual Trading Act is unworkable if people exercise their right to object to what a local authority propose.  I would point out that the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism has no powers or functions in relation to the designation of casual trading areas.</P>
    <P>I would point out also that persons holding casual trading licences, whether or not they also need casual trading permits, may employ servants or agents to sell for them; they have the same rights as shopkeepers to employ people.</P>
    <P>Neither would I accept that my Department's letter of 27 August, 1984 to local authorities is ambiguous or contrary to that of the Act.  The letter in question simply reminds people of Government policy in relation to travelling people and that the circumstances of those travelling people should be considered when administering the Act.  Travelling people are members of the community who have percisely the same rights and obligations under the law as all others.  It would not be possible to distinguish in trading laws between what the report describes as &ldquo;genuine travelling people&rdquo; and &ldquo;well-funded travelling&rdquo; traders of fixed abode.</P>
    <P>There are other recommendations contained in the report in relation to casual trading which are not my responsibility, for example, prosecutions, and I would not, obviously, be in a position to comment on these at this point.</P>
    <P>There are also, however, some matters in Chapter 6 of the report dealing with the legal and administrative environment, which call for comment by me.  The first of these is the recommendation for the establishment of a malicious damage fund to be operated by the insurance companies; fund deficits to be met from court funds and State subvention.  I find this recommendation rather vague and ambiguous and feel that it does not spell out how the proposed scheme would be funded.  Furthermore it is not clear what the committee mean when they refer to any deficits in operating this scheme being financed from court funds.  They have suggested also State subvention to <Col N="162" /> finance the scheme.  I would point out, however, that the decision to amend the Malicious Injuries Act, 1981 was taken by the Government in an effort to cut back on expenditure.  Therefore, the committee's recommendation of State subvention in this report is not a practical undertaking at this time.</P>
    <P>This is true also in relation to the recommendation that my Department should be involved with trade associations in developing support services to members in areas such as accountancy service, insurance cover and so on.  It is not the function of my Department to initiate the setting up of such group schemes.  Rather this is proper to the various trade associations to set up themselves in conjunction with the industries concerned.</P>
    <P>The committee also make a number of recommendations in relation to prices and consumer regulations.</P>
    <P>As regards the committee's recommendation that a major pilot programme of price decontrol should be initiated on individual products, I am happy to say that in the past year the number of products which have been controlled at retail level by means of maximum prices orders have been reduced from 17 to six.  The products decontrolled at retail level were frozen foods, processed peas and beans, cornflakes, turf briquettes, sugar, margarine, flake oatmeal and cigarettes.  In these cases I was generally satisfied that the normal competitive forces in the market were sufficient to keep prices down without the need for maximum prices orders.  In fact in many cases competition has been sufficiently intense to keep the generality of prices charged well below those fixed by order.  As regards the remaining products (petroleum products, prepackaged coal, bottled gas, intoxicating liquor, chickens, butter, milk, flour and babyfoods) I will continue my policy of removing retail price controls on a case by case basis once I am satisfied that competition is sufficiently evident to remove the need for such controls.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the committee's recommendation that prices inspectors <Col N="163" /> should be empowered to impose on the spot fines, in the case of a first offence, rather than initiate prosecutions through the courts.  Under the existing system of inspection, legal proceedings are not instituted automatically upon the detection of a breach of a prices order.  Regard is had to the circumstances in particular cases before deciding whether to proceed with prosecution.  In general, it is now the practice, where a breach of an order is detected, that the matter is brought to the retailer's attention and he is asked to rectify it.  The inspector also takes the opportunity to ensure that the retailer is fully aware of the legislation in relation to price control together with the more recent consumer protection legislation such as the EC (Indication of Prices of Foodstuffs) Regulations, 1963.  I think the present system is therefore more equitable than the system recommended by the committee.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that I could not accept the committee's recommendation that the implementation period for prices orders should be extended from immediate effect to a fortnight.  In the case of petrol, for example, the price falls to be reviewed on a monthly basis and the time lag envisaged in the proposal would defeat the whole objective of the new price control system.  In this respect I would draw Senators' attention to the recent announcement in relation to the 4p per gallon drop in the price of petrol at the pumps.  I think the present system which allows a gap of 2/3 days between the implementation of price increases at wholesale and retail levels is equitable, particularly in the light of the continuing reduction in the number of items subject to retail price control.</P>
    <P>I agree with the committee's recommendation that in the context of price control halfpennies should be abolished and that the lowest coinage should be one penny.  Indeed, for many years this practice has been adopted for some products which are subject to price control, e.g. alcoholic drink.  However, this practice was not uniform, and I have asked the NPC to consider adopting this practice for all products from now on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> As regards the committee's recommendation that a major pilot programme of price decontrols should be initiated on individual products, I wish to say that with the reduction in inflation and increasing competition it has already been possible over this period to reduce considerably the number of products which are not now subject to price control.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the committee have been able to produce a second report so promptly.  I think they are doing excellent work.  The committee allows participation by Members of the Oireachtas in examining the needs of small businesses. The members on the committee are performing an important and responsible public duty, and I hope they will continue to do so in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses I would like, in the first instance, to describe very briefly the work of this committee to date.</P>
      <P>On 12 September last this House debated our first report, which dealt with manufacturing industry.  We had a good debate, and I was encouraged by the Government's response as given by the Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. There was a subsequent Dáil debate and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism met the committee at the end of January to discuss in detail our recommendations on manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>Our first report was published last May.  Our second report, which deals with retail and distribution and which is the subject of this debate, was published last October.  The committee have just completed their third report, which deals with tourism, catering and leisure.  Our fourth report will deal with the construction industry.</P>
      <P>The subject of this debate is our report on retail and distribution.  This sector represents a significant portion of our national economy.  It takes in some 36,000 firms and 166,000 employees.  This is 15 per cent of our entire workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> The sector spans wholesaling, haulage and retailing.  It includes the grocery trade, butchers, bakers, fruit and vegetable outlets, newsagents, footwear and drapery, motor sales, chemists, hardwear, electrical goods, furniture and many other types of retail business.  The selection of chapters in the report reflects the priority areas as perceived by the committee.  There are separate chapters on the business environment, distribution and transport, the black economy, multiple stores, taxation, legal and administrative environment, services to the retail and distribution sector.  My own remarks during this debate will be on a chapter by chapter basis.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal first with the business environment.  The first and second paragraphs of the business environment chapter accurately reflect the sense of demoralisation among small retail and distribution businesses today, and I have no hesitation in quoting these paragraphs in full for the benefit of Members of the House who will be participating in this debate.  I quote:</P>
    <P>A deep sense of depression coupled with a very low level of business confidence is widespread among those operating within this sector, reflecting the difficult trading conditions prevailing. The traditional wholesaler and retailer are being decimated by the pincer effect of large multiple stores on one side and on the other by casual traders and those operating in the black economy. These changes are dramatically aggravated by an acute economic recession and high taxation rates.  The combination of these factors has severely demoralised many such businesses resulting in closures, job losses and a feeling of helplessness among politicians.</P>
    <P>It may be worthy of note that something in the region of 770 small businesses were struck by that in 1984.  That is an alarming figure and it reflects the concern of our committee with regard to the whole area of retail and distribution.  Many of the firms referred to in <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> were not in the retail and distribution sector, <Col N="166" /> but nevertheless a large number of them were and it reflects the committee's concern for this particular sector.</P>
    <P>Unlike industry, agriculture or tourism this sector is not a direct generator of wealth and, probably for that reason, has never been the subject of any official policy for its overall development.  If anything, this sector has been seen merely as a revenue gatherer for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The results were clearly visible to us in compiling this report and included the burden of taxation, State imposed paperwork, casual trading, legitimate cross-border trading, smuggling and the black economy in general.</P>
    <P>While this sector is in the front line in having to cope with the effects of the decline in disposable income the problems I have just outlined could be mitigated if the recommendations outlined in this report were implemented.  The committee were strongly of the view that the sector needs to be reviewed by Government and its contribution to employment recognised.  We recommended: (1) a Government White Paper on this sector should be published defining the key role of the sector in the national economy; (2) a sectoral committee of the National Economic and Social Council should be established for retail and distribution to monitor ongoing developments.  I look forward to the Minister's views on the question of a White Paper on this particular sector.</P>
    <P>The NESC are the responsibility of the Department of the Taoiseach.  In a comprehensive reply to the chairman of our committee the Taoiseach stated that he did not think the establishment of a sectoral committee of the NESC to monitor ongoing developments in the retail and distribution sector would be consistent with the remit of the NESC. However, the NESC is currently undertaking a study in the area of private sector services which will cover <i>inter alia</i> the range of existing Government policies which impact on the private services sector.  This study will cover retail and distribution.  I am glad to know that the NESC will take this committee's recommendations into account.  I stress that <Col N="167" /> we are not recommending major State intervention or financial investment in the sector.  What we are trying to achieve is the removal of many of the unnecessary existing obstacles to rational business development.</P>
    <P>We are also mindful of the role and the responsibility of the sector in promoting Irish made goods.  The committee welcomes the ongoing discussion between the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the grocery trade with a view to getting home produced goods on the shelves.  The committee have made specific recommendations in this regard particularly for a &ldquo;trade linkages council&rdquo; involving all interested parties &ldquo;to provide a two way flow of commercial information to ensure the maximum market share for Irish consumer products&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to distribution and transport, the second chapter deals with private haulage.  Although the licensing system for private road haulage has been made much more level in recent years we still have a system which has its origin in a 50 year old policy of restricting competition by road hauliers against the railways. This policy may have been valid 50 years ago but I can assure the Minister and Senators that it is a long time since we had carriage of goods by rail in County Meath where I come from.</P>
    <P>The committee welcome the Government's intention to overhaul the existing licensing system in line with modern requirements.  However, we found that there is a major problem with regard to law enforcement.  I will quote from our report.</P>
    <P>There is also a justified feeling among reputable hauliers that existing legislation and EC regulations governing vehicle maintenance, vehicle testing and maximum loading are more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  This is obviously unfair to those law abiding hauliers who involve themselves in considerable expense to meet their legal obligations.</P>
    <P>Indeed our principal recommendations in this area relate to law enforcement and <Col N="168" /> the curbing of hauliers who are consistently in breach of regulations.  We recommend the formation of a special traffic corps for commercial vehicles, trained in national and EC laws, and an open licensing system based on qualifications.</P>
    <P>The following extract from a recent <i>Irish Times</i> editorial puts very well the case for a traffic corps for commercial vehicles.  I quote from the editorial:</P>
    <P>The suggestion by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Small Businesses, for the establishment of a special traffic corps has a good deal of merit.  The aim would be for the corps to oversee the enforcement of regulations for commercial vehicles.</P>
    <P>Road traffic is an essential and growing element of the country's commerce. Its planning and development is complex.  With its expansion, legal requirements, safety precautions and proper loading and carrying procedures are of prime importance and must be rigidly enforced in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The police, customs and other official agencies are responsible at present for seeing that requirements are observed.  With the growth of traffic, the complexity of international needs, particularly in the context of an enlarged European Community, there is a sound argument for the creation of a special unit of trained people.  They would be schooled in domestic and European laws and regulations and would act on the highways and on urban thoroughfares.  Other countries have operated this method of traffic supervision for some years and it has worked to the advantage of all road users, including the owners and operators of the heavy vehicles themselves.</P>
    <P>Our concern in this whole area was supported by newspaper reports late last year that the British Department of Transport had complained to the authorities here about the large number of defective and overloaded trucks arriving from Ireland. This statement should either be refuted by the Department of the Environment or corrective steps should be taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> Irish road haulage vehicles now carry goods to and from several European countries, and a reputation for low standards in enforcement of EC road haulage regulations cannot be good for our image. I hope we will hear positive proposals to deal with these problems in the context of the promised reform of legislation on road haulage.</P>
    <P>The black economy in many ways was the most difficult issue we had to face as a committee.  What is the black economy?  How big is it?  Is it growing? To what extent is it damaging legitimate business?  What information is available on the black economy?  Whatever about the answers to these questions the committee are in no doubt as to its effects on Ireland.</P>
    <P>A number of terms have been employed to describe the sum total of the black economy: cash, hidden, unofficial, informal, shadow, dual, unrecorded, moonlight and underground. Whatever terminology is used to describe what is, in essence, income (earned and unearned) which is not reported to the tax authorities, there is no doubt that it represents an enormous loss of revenue to the State, undermines tax morals, weakens the social welfare system, makes a mockery of the economic planning and interferes with both employees and legitimate employers.</P>
    <P>Most of us would agree that the present burden of taxation, a burden which has grown rapidly in recent years, is an incentive to many to operate outside the official economy.  I quote from the report:</P>
    <P>Tax evasion and/or operating within the Black Economy carries little sense of disapproval in Ireland today. Deceiving the authorities is seen less and less as an offence and more and more as a sign of skill and enterprising spirit.  We would all be at it if we could amply sums up the prevailing attitude.</P>
    <P>While we may deplore these attitudes, we cannot ignore their existence and the consequences arising from them.</P>
    <P>Evidence to the committee suggested <Col N="170" /> that as many as 100,000 people could be operating within the black economy and it may even account for between 3 per cent and 8 per cent of gross national product.  Indeed some people have suggested that even these estimates could be on the low side.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to express a welcome to the Taoiseach's written response to our recommendation that the Central Statistics Office should provide statistical data on black economy income, on the lines carried out by the UK Central Statistics Office.  I quote his response as follows:</P>
    <P>From the inquiries which I have I am satisfied that the Central Statistics Office is, within the resources available to it, taking steps to monitor the development of the Black Economy here. In this regard the office has undertaken a study of the practices adopted by other countries in estimating for the &ldquo;black economy&rdquo; in their national accounts.  The topic is also under active consideration by the national accounts working group at the Statistical Office of the European Communities.  The CSO is keeping in close touch with these developments and is also studying the methodology adopted by the United Kingdom Central Statistics Office on the matter.  I have asked the CSO to keep the Joint Committee on Small Businesses informed of further developments.</P>
    <P>In looking at the range of the black economy we identified (i), smuggling, (ii) unrecorded earned income, commonly described as &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; and (iii) casual trading and occasional trading.  Before going any further, I should say that since completing our Report on Retail and Distribution we have found the black economy to be a recurring problem.  For example, unregistered accommodation is a major problem for the tourism industry. We have just started work on our report on the construction industry and we can see already that the black economy is rampant in this particular sector also.</P>
    <P>With regard to smuggling, I live near enough to the Border to know what has <Col N="171" /> been going on and the effects on traders in the border counties of the Republic who have seen their businesses decimated because of smuggling from Northern Ireland and, indeed, from legitimate purchases in shops across the Border.  During the Christmas shopping season last year we saw coaches and cars bring thousands of shoppers from the Republic to Belfast, Newry and other Northern towns.  It was not just videos and toys that people were bringing back, but such ordinary basic household items as washing powder which carried a VAT rate of 35 per cent in the Republic.</P>
    <P>With regard to smuggling I do not think any member of the committee seriously doubts that the television sales and rental business has been crippled by smuggling. Evidence from the Electrical Industries Federation to the Commission on Taxation showed that expenditure per head on colour televisions for 1983 was:</P>
    <P>Eleven times greater in Bandon than in Clones which is only one mile from the Border.  Three times greater in Killarney than in Monaghan town which is only four miles from the Border.  Six times greater in Tralee than in Dundalk which is only five miles from the Border.</P>
    <P>The reason is simple.  Due to a combination of excise duties and high VAT rates a colour television costs £200 more in the Republic than in Northern Ireland.  The temptation for people living in our Border counties is too great.</P>
    <P>I must acknowledge that the decision of the Minister for Finance to cut the exercise duty on televisions by 50 per cent and to eliminate the 35 per cent VAT rate has had a substantial beneficial effect reducing cross-Border shopping in this particular area.</P>
    <P>However, as long as considerable tax differentials remain between Northern Ireland and the Republic the problem will continue.  For example, petrol, beer and soft drinks are still considerably cheaper in Northern Ireland.  We could see some recurrence of this problem next Christmas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> I now turn to the question of unrecorded cash transactions or &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; as they are commonly known.  &ldquo;Nixers&rdquo; can involve services such as having a roof repaired, a house rewired, an extension built or central heating installed.  They are carried out on an unrecorded cash basis, and the whole &ldquo;nixer&rdquo; phenomenon hits particularly hard at legitimate traders who cannot avoid VAT and who are compelled to send in their VAT returns.</P>
    <P>The committee were of the view that a low services rate of VAT, to be compensated for, if necessary, by VAT increases on parts and components would go a long way towards coping with this particular problem.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a special plea to the Minister for Finance.  VAT on car repairs is now charged at 10 per cent.  For the repair, reconditioning and restoration of musical instruments it is still 23 per cent.  I play a number of musical instruments. I know most reputable firms in Dublin and in the country and they have asked me to make a special plea to the Minister to have a look at this particular area with a view to rectifying it.  The skills I am referring to include tuning, french polishing, cabinet making and other highly developed skills.  More and more instruments are being sent to England for repair due to this penal rate of tax on labour which is threatening the survival of the business here.  A concession in this area would have a minute effect on the State finances.  The lacquering of brass band instruments is a special skill. When I inquired if I could get my saxophone lacquered I was told I would have to send it to England.  Some years ago I got my saxophone gold lacquered in Dublin for £100.  It was a very good job. It is a very special type of skill and a skill that may die out in this country if some action is not taken.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would have a special look at this area.</P>
    <P>The Casual Trading Act, 1981 has not proved effective.  The committee are distinctly of the opinion that there is buck passing between the gardaí and local <Col N="173" /> authorities when it comes to the enforcement of the provisions of this particular Act.  It is unfair that legitimate rate-paying and VAT paying businesses should have to compete with goods available from vans parked often outside their front doors on peak selling days.  The shopkeeper these days has to comply with a whole range of regulations, and it is adding insult to injury to expect him to suffer the consequences of uncontrolled casual trading from people who do not appear subject to either regulations or taxes.  Pressure should be applied on all local authorities to provide designated casual trading areas as required by the Act, and the gardaí should ensure that casual trading does not take place outside these designated areas.  We found occasional trading, that is selling goods from a premises for a continuous period of three months or less, to be less of a problem.  However, we feel it should be brought within the Casual Trading Act. We will all have to live with the black economy but there are things we can do to reduce its effect, and I commend our recommendations to the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding the multiple stores, I doubt if any business has changed so dramatically in recent years as that of the retail grocery trade. From thousands of independent grocers 20 years ago we now have a situation where 58 per cent of the market is held by seven large multiple groups.  In Dublin alone the multiples hold 81 per cent of the business.  I acknowledge that this is a problem.  Compared with the remainder of Europe our figures prove that we have the largest area controlled by multiples in the grocery trade of any country in Europe.  Two of the multiples are foreign-owned and account for about 25 per cent of the total trade.  The concentration of so much of the grocery trade in a small number of groups only gives these groups enormous purchasing power and scope to rearrange prices.  This situation is not always in the best interest of the Irish food processing industry or of the consumers.</P>
    <P>The number of family retailers has <Col N="174" /> declined from 9,000 in 1977 to 7,700 now. This is due mainly to competition from the multiples.  The independent wholesalers see their business declining at an accelerated rate for the very same reason. As one who lives in a small town in a rural area I see the adverse affects on local trade of multiple stores in large towns taking cash from other smaller towns and villages.  We acknowledge that the solution to the problem for independent retailers lies to a large extent in their own hands.  We have in mind here the highest standards of quality control, presentation, competitive pricing, selection, hygiene and efficient allocation of shelf space.  However, price manipulation in the form of below-cost selling, as practised by the multiples, is not in the public interest.  The use of loss leaders will not ultimately affect the overall profit margin of the multiples.  That will be made on the other goods.  However, the practice is causing major upsets in the food industry and in the independent trade.  The housewife, attracted to a multiple store by the very low cost of one or two items, does not always realise that what is being given on one hand by the multiple is being taken away on the other.  She has not really gained anything in the long run.</P>
    <P>We looked at the situation in various other countries and found that with the exception of the UK all countries, whether they have socialist governments as in France or governments totally committed to free enterprise as in the US, operate controls on the development of the grocery trade in the public interest. The committee believe that some control should be brought in here to restore fair competition between the multiples and the independent wholesale and retail trade.  In this regard our recommendation is modest enough compared with other countries but would be sufficient for our purpose.  Our principal recommendation is that a ban should be imposed on below-cost selling.  I know from the Minister's speech that he is not fully in line with the committee on this issue.  We believe that such a ban is sought by the <Col N="175" /> food processing industry and the independent retail trade and should be implemented. We took evidence from each of the four multiple groups and they said they would not object to such a ban at this stage.  I want to reiterate the strong and unanimous views of the committee that below-cost selling is a pattern that benefits no one, does real damage and should be banned.</P>
    <P>We also ask that no one retail group or multiple should control more than 25 per cent of the market and that teeth should be given to the Irish Local Government (Planning and General Policy Directive 1982) through the provision indices and ratio of square footage per head of population for the planning and development of any future supermarket or multiple store.  In making these recommendations we accept fully that the multiples under any restrictions retain a competitive advantage by virtue of their purchasing power and economies of scale.  However, this competitive advantage should be exercised in a fair manner.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this subject of the multiples I would ask our food processors and the Confederation of Irish Industry why advertising by our food processors and indeed by our mineral water manufacturers and other Irish manufacturers consistently advise consumers of the various products available at the local supermarket &mdash;&ldquo;go to your local supermarket.&rdquo; There is an independent retail trade.  Surely, it would be more equitable if advertising had a more neutral wording such as &ldquo;Now available at your local food store.&rdquo;  At Christmas time we all hear on the radio of special offers of well-established products; it is always &ldquo;Go to your nearest supermarket.&rdquo;  The nearest local food store is never mentioned.  I am making that special appeal to the Confederation of Irish Industries to have this discrimination against the retail trade ended.</P>
    <P>Every submission the committee received referred to taxation.  Taxation now represents 41 per cent of our gross domestic product compared with only 26 <Col N="176" /> per cent in 1965.  We point out in our report, and I quote:</P>
    <P>the reduction in disposable income through high tax consumption has directly affected the level of sales, turnover and profitability.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of taxation that we overlook too easily.  That is the role of the small business man as a tax collector. We say in our report:</P>
    <P>The role of small businesses in tax collection had never been considered in the context of the extremely unfair burden it imposes in itself.  The level and complexity of tax paper work represents a time-consuming diversion for the small business man from running his enterprise.  This leads to frustration, bad relations and a gap in understanding between the retailer and the tax officials.</P>
    <P>In compiling our report the committee were very much aware of the anger and frustration felt by small traders at the immense amount of paperwork involved with PAYE, PRSI and VAT.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Finance has taken a significant step in rationalising the VAT system by reducing the number of VAT rates from five to three.  This rationalisation is causing problems in some sectors such as the construction sector.  With regard to VAT we also ask that a full investigation be carried out into a major reform of the VAT system to alleviate the paper work and administrative burden on the retail sector.  This would be done by making VAT payable only at supplier and wholesale level, the net effect of which would make retailers' margin not liable to VAT.  This loss of revenue could be offset by a proportionate increase in VAT rates.  A system such as this would greatly reduce the cost of collection and I believe would be acceptable to almost every retailer in this country.</P>
    <P>I realise that there could be difficulties at EC level with this proposal, but it should be pursued as its implementation would greatly ease the burden of paper <Col N="177" /> work on the independent trader who would have to live with the high burden of taxation for some time.  There are some measures that can be taken now to reduce the frustration for business caused by our present system.</P>
    <P>With regard to the legal and administrative environment, in this chapter the committee considered issues such as crime and vandalism, malicious damage and the burden of rules and regulations that a small businessman has to comply with today.  The figures for recorded crime in the areas of robbery and aggravated burglary and arson and malicious damage doubled during the five years to 1983.  The detection rate in solving these crimes is a low 31 per cent.  Apart from the financial losses due to stolen goods, a shopkeeper has to suffer the annoyance of damaged premises, disrupted trade, increased insurance premiums and, as our report says, the final ignominy for the legitimate trader is when he has to compete with recycled stolen goods.</P>
    <P>On the question of malicious damages we feel that there will have to be a continuing State involvement in this matter in view of the scale of the damage involved, notwithstanding the Government's decision to repeal the Malicious Damages Act, 1861.  We recommend specifically that a malicious damages fund should be established from which claims for damages exceeding the level covered by agreed maxima would be met.  The fund would be operated by the insurance companies, which would be obliged to give malicious damages cover.  Claims from the fund would be confined to damage to premises, equipment and merchandise. Fund deficits could be met from court funds and State subvention.  Negotiations should take place between the Department of Justice, the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, retailers and insurance companies to devise a suitable scheme.  Local authorities should be flexible in their development plans to facilitate security precautions of retailers.</P>
    <P>While we fear that crime will continue at a high level we also make a number of recommendations involving the garda <Col N="178" /> rostering system and court rules and the regulation of private security services to increase the level of security offered to business premises.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of prices and consumer regulations.  Nobody seriously argues against the need for effective consumer legislation, but I would question the need for all the inspectors who deal with the retail trade today.  With regard to the prices inspectorate, it is difficult to see much justification in these days for price inspectors running around the country checking the prices of items such as cans of beans, baby food and soda bread mixes.  Competition in the grocery trade is now very intense; indeed I would say it is cut-throat.  Against this background, it is reasonable to ask if the inspectorate really have any role to play.  I understand that there are 40 price inspectors attached to the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  I would like to ask the Minister if he could give us an estimate of the cost of the prices inspectorate, to include the salary of the inspectorate, their supervisors, travelling expenses, office overheads and the expenses of legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>With regard to prosecutions the courts have enough to be occupied with these days without having to deal with trivial matters of this sort.</P>
    <P>It is not uncommon to read in the local newspaper where some family grocer who had not time to recheck his prices had been hauled to the courts because he overcharged a half-penny on soda bread mix or a can of baby food.  I think the day has come when that type of thing should stop.  Contrary to what the Minister did mention in his speech I know for a fact that first time offenders have been prosecuted. It has caused grave annoyance to people who had too many items at cut sale price, as they say, to be caught out on some little defect.  There are special little lines that these inspectors check on where there are price changes at regular intervals. Many a retailer has not time to keep up with or does not know of these price changes.  It might only be a couple of pence &mdash; it was in one case a half-penny <Col N="179" />&mdash; and prosecutions did take place and it was very humiliating for the conscientious businessman to be hauled before the courts just because he made a mistake.</P>
    <P>The abolition of price inspectors would represent a useful saving in the cost of the public sector.  I fully accept that there is a role for the National Prices Commission to deal with monopolies like CIE and the ESB, but that is an entirely different matter.  With regard to all the regulations and form filling there is a recommendation in the report that I like, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Small businessmen should be provided with a single publication which outlines in simple terms all of the regulations with which he must comply in this particular trade.  While there presently exist many good explanatory documents on individual pieces of legislation, there is no all embracing manual available.</P>
    <P>If that recommendation could be implemented many retailers would be much happier people.</P>
    <P>Earlier, when discussing multiples versus the independent trader, I mentioned that there was a responsibility on independent retailers to improve their own management performance.  I also mentioned towards the beginning of my contribution that we are not recommending major State intervention or financial investments in the retail and distribution sector.  This is very much the attitude within the sector.  It neither seeks nor receives State services but only wishes not to be unduly penalised.  We are, however, satisfied that there is a need for management training in this whole area. To quote from the report once again:</P>
    <P>Managers and proprietors in retailing need to have a heightened awareness of basic standards of performance in the areas of courtesy, hygiene, basic merchandise presentation, stock control, staff training and development and operating costs.  The availability of management training programmes needs to be considerably widened to attract rural managers and proprietors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> Adaptation, modernisation and training have been carried out in an unplanned and unco-ordinated way with no overall policy or standards. The Industrial Training Authority has provided a limited Training and Advisory Service, but has allocated disproportionately little funds and manpower into this important section of the economy. For example, there are no more than 12 training advisers for the 32,000 businesses in this sector.</P>
    <P>Too many managers are unable to control stock losses, staff wastage and operating costs.  They do not know how to make the best and most efficient use of space, to determine optimum stock level and mix or to anticipate demand and regular supply.  Management generally has rarely been trained in modern training techniques or taught how to deal effectively with staff resources.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we recommend a retail and distributive training committee within the AnCO structure and with EC involvement to co-ordinate and implement a comprehensive training programme for the retail trade.  The programme should operate on a local basis and respond to the time pressures on individual owner-managers. Funding of this proposed programme could be on the basis of charges for services and European Social Fund finance.</P>
    <P>We also looked at the financial problems of the sector and apart from retained profits the main source of funds for expansion is from the banking system. Our feeling here is that the traditional term loan of from three to five years is excessively restrictive and a poor response to funding the acquisition of fixed assets that have a working life considerably in excess of five years.  We ask that the banks extend the term of these loans, particularly to firms with up to 50 employees.</P>
    <P>We would like the banks to review their handling charges and their method of dealing with bad and void cheques. The present system is excessively harsh on the retailer.  If I put in a cheque with <Col N="181" /> my lodgment as a businessman and that cheque bounces, as well as being out the price of the cheque I am charged a handling fee of £3 because the bank returns that cheque.  This is a very unfair system. It is bad enough to have to handle a bad cheque without being charged by the bank for handling it.</P>
    <P>Banking hours are a major irritant to the retailer.  I will quote from the section of our report which deals extensively with this matter:</P>
    <P>The average opening hours of the associated banks are 22 hours per week.  This is less than half the weekly opening hours for retailers.  The restrictive opening times are aggravated by their unsuitability &mdash; for example, banks are closed at lunch hours, Friday evenings etc.  No arrangements are made during holiday periods or weekends to facilitate this sector.  The night safe system is also most unsatisfactory. The combination of these factors forces the small businessman to attend to banking needs when he could profitably be attending to the business of retailing.</P>
    <P>I hope that there will be an early move by the banks on this issue of opening hours.</P>
    <P>Finally, Senators will agree that this is a very comprehensive report; however, it is not a complex report.  Its recommendations are simple and capable of implementation and based firmly on commonsense.  It is my own conviction that if our recommendations can be put into effect the morale of the sector will improve greatly and retailers and wholesalers will cease to feel that they are up against a wall of official indifference.  It is worth noting that since this report was published members of the committee have received an unprecedented level of correspondence from wholesalers and retailers urging a response to the recommendations of the committee.  I have a letter from one retailer which states very simply:</P>
    <P>Unless a degree of stability is brought into the food trade more jobs are at risk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> God knows we have lost enough jobs in this sector.  We have lost too many of our retail and wholesale outlets and, with due respect to the Minister, the Government's response, if I am to go by the Minister's speech, is very lukewarm, to say the least.  We are very concerned about the whole sector of retail and distribution in this country.  Our committee worked very, very hard under a very good Chairman, Deputy Ivan Yates, and a very good secretary, Mr. Shane McAuley with a very effective sub-committee working until 11.00 some nights.  The committee itself is a good committee and take their job very seriously.  We are very concerned at the end of six months hard work on this sector to find that here was a sector that has mainly been a tax gatherer for the State.  Its only source for finance is the banking system, and they are not happy with it, their businesses have decimated over the years.</P>
    <P>It will cost the State, irrespective of what the Minister says, almost nothing to implement our report.  Changes have been made since our report was published but they were in the interest of the national economy, for example, the reduction in VAT.  Too much money was being lost in cross-Border trading.  The traditional family business will be wiped out completely.  In today's papers we see that another big tycoon is returning to establish himself in Ireland again to make a quick fortune and probably sell out again as he did previously and go off with his millions of profit.  That is at the expense of the retail trade here and ultimately &mdash; I warn the Minister &mdash; at the expense of the Irish consumer.  Factories are working around the clock in England supplying these multiples and we are importing £700 million or £800 million worth of food every year.  It is a national scandal.  If we have a situation where the housewife has no option but to buy imported food, it is a sad day for Ireland. I would ask the Minister to take very seriously the views expressed by Senators on this report.  Many Members of the Seanad are on this committee and I look forward with interest to hearing their speeches on this subject.</P>
    <Col N="183" />
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Lynch in endorsing the tribute to the Chairman and Clerk of our committee and also to all the other parties in that committee because, as Senator Lynch has said, we have worked long hours; we have had a very good attendance from both Deputies and Senators and we have had complete harmony.  It was a very good example of how people with different views can sit down and work together and talk over the same table.</P>
      <P>I would hope that this was one of the things that resulted in at least influencing the Government in the reduction of the duties on televisions, radios, spirits and items of the cross-Border traffic.  While that reduction was very good it does not go far enough, because there is still a big gap, but perhaps experience will show over a period when this scheme is monitored if it is costing the State too much money or is there any benefit to the State, apart from the traders.  There has to be benefit, because if the articles are not attractive to the consumer they will not go across the Border to purchase them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, rightly or wrongly, that all this trouble was mainly caused in the North of Ireland by virtue of the price differential in petrol.  When the price differential was there in petrol people were tempted, particularly if they were within 50 miles of the Border, to use any excuse to go to the North to fill their cars with petrol and when they saw the price of other articles they began to purchase them also.  Under EC regulations a person is entitled to bring across the Border any item costing not more than £55, or items totalling £202.  With the price of the liquor as it was, when each person crossing a land frontier was entitled to bring in two bottles of whiskey, if there were five adults in the car they could have brought in ten bottles of whiskey.  To give an example of the petrol position in the North, I requested one company &mdash; and it was followed by other companies &mdash; to carry out research into the petrol position in the North and how it affected the Border stations.  This letter is from BP (Ireland) Ltd.  It is a letter I got today <Col N="184" /> and it says that having examined stations located between a line drawn through the following towns and the Border including outlets located in the towns named, that is, Malin, Buncrana, Letterkenny, Donegal, Ballyshannon, Bundoran, Sligo, Cavan, Carrickmacross and Dundalk, the following statistics emerged: In 1981 they sold 14,576,000 litres; in 1982 they sold 12,576,000 litres, that was a drop of 13.7 per cent.  In 1983 there was a drop to 7,961,000 litres which showed a drop of 7.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>For the four years, the total drop was 49.3 per cent.  In round figures the sale of petrol was halved.  In the same Border area in 1981 four stations were closed.  They sold 115,000 litres.  These are small stations but nevertheless they were making their contribution.  In 1982 two were sold, representing 59,500 litres. In 1983 &mdash; with 805,500 litres involved &mdash; eight stations were closed and a further six stations in 1984, with 567,500 litres. That was a total of 20 stations in all with 1,547,000 litres.  Taking petrol at 45p per litre you are talking about £750,000 in round figures lost.  That is only one company. That is not a survey of the whole of Northern Ireland.  It was a survey of the Border counties because I was requested to get that for some Border Deputies who were interested in it.  The petrol situation will have to be examined. If it is not, the benefits we were receiving from the reduction in the duties on spirits, radios, televisions and the other products to which the budget saw fit to give relief will be minimised.</P>
    <P>While I am on the subject of the Border and smuggling, the greatest smugglers in this country &mdash; and it is a well known fact &mdash; are the itinerants, better known to some people as the tinkers.  They can come down with a car and they can have ten items.  They can pay the duty on them and as there are no longer serial numbers on televisions or radios they cannot be identified anymore.  There was a time when they had serial numbers attached to the chassis, but there is no chassis in them any more and there is no way of identifying them.  What they do is pay the duty on ten sets and they bring in 1,000 <Col N="185" /> sets.  They go around the country then and sell them.  The amount of revenue that is lost to the State is important.  We should all be concerned about it because it will affect our taxes eventually.</P>
    <P>The people about whom I am more concerned are the traders who are being deprived of their living and who are being driven out of business by this kind of trade.  These itinerants receive great sympathy in certain quarters but you see them driving around in Granadas and all the &ldquo;litre&rdquo; cars, some of the better known German cars that are not now known by their brand name any more but are called German &ldquo;take-aways&rdquo;.  These cars are being driven around the country.  The itinerants have beautiful caravans and television sets in their caravans.  They can pull up on the side of the road and start up their portable generators.  They have all these facilities.  Then they cover literally the whole countryside.  They will come in to the town the following day and set up their stalls in the town.  They will go into competition with people who are paying rates and who have overheads, staff, tax and everything else.  These people are in direct competition with them.  Something will have to be done about those people.</P>
    <P>I have no evidence of what they do about the dole, but I believe they can draw the dole in the North of Ireland one day in the week and draw from the South of Ireland on another day of the week. They are doing all right, even if they never sold any smuggled articles. Another thing I would like to say &mdash; and I cannot let this occasion pass without mentioning it &mdash; relates to the strike of the customs officers.  That was the most appalling thing that ever happened in the history of this country.  These people are in a very responsible position and when the days on which they would not be on duty were advertised they left the country wide open to the smuggling of drugs. This was apart altogether from the loss of normal revenue on goods, and the damage done to traders, which was considerable.</P>
    <P>The State has spent a lot of money on, and have a small force engaged in, drug <Col N="186" /> detection and the country was thrown wide open to this danger.  That was terrible and I hope that it will never happen again.  That is enough about that.  I already spoke about it before.</P>
    <P>We have in the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism at the moment 40 inspectors going around the country.  On my figures they are costing about £1 million per year at a time when we are told by other Departments when we look for certain services that they have a shortage of staff.  There is no recruitment of staff and we are told they cannot give you any staff.  We had that experience yesterday when we were trying to set up a compulsory motor testing station.  Yet we have 40 of these people driving around the country calling on small shopkeepers.  I would just say they are talking to people who might have been in business for 50 or 60 years through two or three generations and through an error or a mistake they could have overcharged a halfpenny or a penny on a price, and the next thing is that they are prosecuted.  If that is all that these people can do then it is time that was stopped.</P>
    <P>That may have been relevant during the war years when there was a shortage of supplies and it may have been relevant after the war before we had the supermarkets, but now we have the supermarkets and the prices they are selling their articles at is low.  We had representatives of the supermarkets before our committee. There is below cost advertising. It is an offence to advertise below cost but it is not an offence to sell below cost. In other words, the supermarkets need not advertise it but they can put the articles on the shelf.  That might not be too bad but then you listen to the radio and once a week you hear Gay Byrne with his &ldquo;shopping basket&rdquo; and he will give the prices of items in all the different supermarkets.  The cost of yellow packs, green packs and blue packs are given and they are getting free advertising at the State's expense.  They are in competition with people who have been in business all their lives.  The supermarkets can sell their articles at below cost price.  Some <Col N="187" /> people might be naive to ask &ldquo;How can you sell below cost and stay in business?&rdquo; It is a well known fact that their average pay-out to their suppliers is anything from three to six months.  Then they come along with a pious attitude saying that they would buy Irish if they could get Irish.  They say the Irish are not competing and they are not prepared to supply them.  How could people in small business wait six months for their money?  These people with their big turnover for a completely cash trade can invest the money and the interest they get on the investment would allow them to sell the products at cost and in some cases below cost.  They did say, when we put the question to them at the Small Business Committee, whether they were prepared to recommend a ban on below cost selling that they would be prepared to do so.  So at least we made that much progress.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch has gone over much of the ground that I could go over so there is no point in going over it again.  There is one other thing that I would like to speak about and that is our banks and their charges.  Now we have a situation in this country where particularly the social welfare recipients are paid by cheque. People around this country in jobs where they take away £60, £70 or £80 a week bring their cheques to business people. We get them in our own business which is only a small business, but we get them because we are beside the factory and we know them.  We change the cheques and we are very glad to change them.  Number one, it brings a certain amount of business, but number two, it creates greater safety for us instead of carrying cash, particularly over weekends.  We hold these cheques and if there was a raid the cheques would be no good to anybody. The trader can get back his money, so there is that advantage in it.</P>
    <P>Under the new system introduced by the banks they charge for cashing cheques and therefore these people are being helped and obliged by traders around the country.  This comes to a great deal of money.  In some cases it could be as high as £100 a week.  We are doing the <Col N="188" /> banks' work, cashing cheques and creating a certain amount of safety by not leaving money around.  What is the banks' attitude?  They charge for it.  That is a disgrace and it is something that should not be allowed.  I do not know if the Minister's Department, through the prices section, would have control over that, but I would like to see the 40 inspectors taken off their trips to the traders around the country and sent to the banks for a week to see what is going on in the banks.  They might have a different story to tell and there might be more return to the State for it.</P>
    <P>Having said that about the banks, I will not go into the matter of the ICI.  That has been covered before, but I will say that the banks are very unfair.  They have no regard for the safety of money.  If you go into any store in America with dollars they do not want to know about them but they ask &ldquo;Have you any credit cards?&rdquo; They look for credit cards, personal cheques and Euro-cheques.  They would be glad to take all those.  If we had a bit more of that in this country there would be fewer people from whom the raiders and the robbers could take money.  I will conclude on that and I thank you very much for your attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few brief comments to make on this very excellent report.  I would like to compliment all the Members of the Oireachtas who are members of this committee for the very detailed analysis of this whole sector.  I think it is fair to say that the employment content in the services area is quite substantial and has been operating in quite a haphazard fashion without any real State involvement.  A number of contributors already have highlighted the fact that particularly in the grocery area the multiples have been gaining very considerable ground in the outright control of this sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed in the Minister's contribution where he stated that the committee exaggerated slightly in claiming that the degree of concentration in the Irish grocery industry by the multiples was higher than in most other countries in <Col N="189" /> Europe.  The committee went to some pains to elicit some statistics in relation to this matter and in their report they say that the multiples stores in Ireland have 58 per cent control of the grocery sales area, in the UK they have 70 per cent, in Belgium 23 per cent, Germany 8 per cent, Netherlands 28 per cent, France 69 per cent and Italy 24 per cent.  The Minister picked out Denmark as one country where the position would appear to be similar to Ireland.  Now the main concentration of what I want to say in the course of a few brief remarks is that comparing Ireland with Denmark in the context of groceries, is a very false premise on which to go.  One has only to go to the Green Week in Berlin and see the range of food products, the specialisation, the amount of money that is spent on research and the overall capacity of that country to promote, sell, export and provide top-class food goods, to acknowledge how far we have to come in this country in an area where we have special advantages but at the same time have not been able to develop those in the way that we need to.</P>
    <P>I want to support, in the strongest possible way, what Senator Daly said in relation to the morning programmes where people like Gay Byrne &mdash; I would say unwittingly &mdash; promote situations which lead to low cost selling, but more fundamentally lead very positively and progressively to an acceleration of food imports into this country.  Over the past ten years they have grown from a little over £100 million to over £800 million.  It is widely accepted that the variety varies and that as regards tea, bananas and other products there are areas where we cannot compete.  There is possibly £200 million to £300 million worth of those which we are unable to produce.  But there are £400 million to £500 million worth of products in the food area alone, not to talk of over £1,000 million of butter products, which we could produce ourselves, which are being imported onto the shelves of the multiples.</P>
    <P>The point was made earlier that a huge concentration of the grocery trade falls into the lap of a very small percentage of <Col N="190" /> these shops.  Two of the major components in this area are internationally owned, and therefore are involved directly in selling food items from their parent countries.  It is probably a condition of their involvement.  This automatically forces the Irish-owned companies to try to compete in dumping of food produce on the market and in below-cost selling.</P>
    <P>I just want to address Gay Byrne and other people who are involved.  Gay Byrne would say that he has many letters from all over the country from people who are delighted to be able to buy these products at the level at which they are purchasing them.  I would merely say to him that the cost in terms of job loss to this country is astronomical.  The cost in terms of social welfare payments which have to be met by these very same people, through their taxes, to these thousands of people who are unemployed is running into billions of pounds.  Some 10,000 jobs which could be found in that area are costing a cool £52 million in the year in social welfare, not to mention ancillary benefits which have to go to people who are unemployed.  We should be able to develop the food sector in much more technological and scientific ways.  Massive investment must be made in the next few years if we are to try to stem the tide which is running very much against us in regard to these imports.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed in that the Minister's statement seems to be haphazard, let things develop as they are going; he appears to argue against every practical proposition that has been made in this report.</P>
    <P>I know there is a climate of opinion which says that the State should not be involved, that it is already too much involved in so many areas and that perhaps there have been a number of failures. It is fairly clear that when the control of any sector begins to reach a stage when not only is it concentrated in too few hands but regardless of where these people come from, whether they are Irish people or not, it actually begins to move out of the country on a progressive scale.  The rise in food imports is <Col N="191" /> commensurate with the progression or control by the multinationals in that whole area.  That is a very serious position. Anybody who can afford to look haphazardly at that is continuing to accept that we are going to have exceptionally high unemployment in this country and exceptional tax levels to try to keep paying those people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>In another part of the report we deal with criminality and burglaries and the rise in the graph each year in those areas. There have been break-ins in my own area in recent times.  There is no way you can quantify the cost of all this.  It is going to keep on increasing while thousands of people with all their energies have nothing to do and have no job opportunities. We would say to the Minister that we have to exercise more control in this whole area.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the statistics which are produced in the report &mdash; I do not have them &mdash; that both the legal and the planning outlooks in other European countries have been used to try to ensure that excessive control will not pass into too few hands.  I do not care whether it is control of land or whatever.  When control moves into too few hands &mdash; it could be in the promotion of beef &mdash; it makes for a very dangerous situation in a country.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, I am disappointed with the Minister's comments. Obviously there may be constraints on him.  Perhaps there has been a long period during which successive Governments have not been able to hold back the momentum in all this development, but underneath it all there is a core, and the public may not fully accept the degree to which the control of our assets &mdash; or what should be our assets &mdash; is moving out of the country.  That is substantially the point that I want to make to the Minister in my contribution.</P>
    <P>In relation to the black economy, we have, by a plethora of different tax regimes, a complexity of bureaucracy which has developed in the over-centralisation of our services.  As Senator Lynch said, <Col N="192" /> the attitude which prevails in society that not disclosing full incomes or using the system to be on the dole and still working, or whatever systems that are used by people to manipulate systems, certainly seems to be a thriving area of abuse.  It is producing a lot of cynicism.  The genuine worker, whether he is in the PAYE sector or whether he is self-employed is becoming more cynical towards the authority of Government and individual politicians. They see situations developing among people in our society which are basically inequitable and go on uncorrected by the powers that be.  It seems extraordinary that we do not have a notion about the extent of the black economy.  Varying figures of gross domestic product of between 3 per cent and 8 per cent are given.  One thing is certain, the way we have built up our tax code and the way we manage our business has encouraged the black economy in practically every area.</P>
    <P>We have representations from builders who quote for the erection of a local school.  That contract can be given to somebody on subcontract.  It can be given to people who are obviously not playing the game as far as taxation is concerned. We need to try to produce a more simple, understandable, fairer, equitable system as far as this is concerned.  We must root out vigorously people in any walk of business who are hiding under the umbrella of the black economy and reducing the opportunity that should be there for legitimate business.</P>
    <P>I want to say one or two words in favour of the smaller wholesaler and retailer.  We have had a number of representations from groups in that area with regard to the fact that they are used in many ways by the Government as tax gatherers.  They have seen their incomes being depleted in recent times.  They are now the only section of the community who are paying rates on their business premises.  They are entitled to look to the Government, not for shelter, protection or anything of that nature, but for a system which would be fair to them.  They should have an opportunity to make some kind of a reasonable and <Col N="193" /> decent living in their own home areas. With these few comments I welcome this report very much.  However, I am a little disappointed at the replies which we have received from the Minister.  I hope his officials will take a serious look at the road they are travelling in relation to this whole question of food imports and the extent to which the multiplies and internationally owned stores are aggravating this situation and losing us a very considerable number of jobs.  I fear for the future if the control of this industry is to fall more progressively into those international hands.</P>

Normally he does not come in a second time on this type of committee report that we are dealing with.</P>

      <P>I do not know if it is too late for me to exercise my right to reply as the mover of the motion but I should like to say a few words, including making a response to Senator Lynch.  We have had a most useful debate on this report.  We are still in the early stages of developing our way of handling these reports.  There always has been a difficulty in regard to the question of when the main intervention of the Minister should take place.  Sometimes the Minister intervenes early in order to give an immediate Government reaction to the proposals in the report.  In the case of these reports from joint committees this has been done largely.  On the other hand, there may be instances in which the Minister, or the members of the committee who are interested, would prefer that the Minister would delay his speech and would make a reply at the end of the debate.  On other occasions it has been taken that this is handled rather like a Bill and that the Minister speaks at the beginning and again at the end, but there has been no real determination on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to any particular motion dealing with the report of a joint committee if the view was expressed by Members interested in regard to the point of the Minister's intervention I would pass this on.  Indeed, I have endeavoured in a number of cases to arrange that the Minister would speak in the debate at a time which would be most useful to the House from the point of view of the debate itself, and I think we can continue to do that.  I am quite sure the Minister will not only read with care what has been said in the debate but will also, with regard to specific questions that have been raised, communicate in writing with <Col N="195" /> the individual Senators.  I know this is not as satisfactory as is giving the answer <i>in fora populo</i> but at least the questions will not go unanswered.  Normally Ministers expect to speak only once during a debate of this type.  If there is a special request for a Minister to speak I do not know whether he has a right to intervene more than once, but certainly if the House wishes to do so Ministers would be willing to do so.</P>
    <P>We have had a good debate here.  The points that have been raised are good, but I must express a regret that more Senators did not take part in the debate. We had good contributions from those who spoke, but it is a matter of very sincere regret that more Senators did not speak.  We have the unfortunate position that not even all those Senators who are members of the joint committee thought it worth their while to take part in the debate.</P>
    <P>I must give it as my opinion that this experiment of having joint committees and bringing their reports to the House for discussion will not succeed unless Senators are prepared to do more in regard to the debate on them.  I certainly do not consider the work as completed when a joint committee have reported and that report has been circulated to Senators.  It is only after that report has come before the House and has been thoroughly debated and the Government's response fully probed, as Senator Lynch has indicated, that the process is complete.  I do not want to be misunderstood.  I believe that the committee system is working well but I also believe it could work better. What I am saying now really applies not to those who are here but to those who are not here.  We should endeavour individually and within our groups to try to ensure that there is a greater participation in these debates in future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader of the House for his explanation.  I join with him in expressing my regret that more Senators did not take part in this debate, because at this stage our work in the <Col N="196" /> committee should not end with the production of a report.  That has happened to too many reports down through the years.  Our work at legislative level should commence with this debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank you for giving me the time to raise this matter on the adjournment and to thank also the Minister of State who has come in at fairly short notice to answer my queries.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long except to say that my motion asks the Minister for Education to sanction immediately the extension to Newport Vocational School.  As this House will know I rarely introduce motions on the Adjournment in this House and particularly not on what one might call a matter of a parochial nature.  Newport, however, is a rapidly growing community nestling on the slopes of Slieve Felim and near Limerick city.  The population has been growing consistently there and apart from having a special political interest in that development Newport was an area which I chose to travel in my young days also.  It is the area from which my wife, Mary, comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main building in this school is old. It was built to accommodate only 100 students.  In the past 20 years about eight prefabricated buildings have been added to it to try to accommodate the growing number of students, which has now reached 226.  Many of these prefabricated buildings have outlived their usefulness, and it was never intended that they would have to actually serve for as long as they have served.  The school authorities in the North Tipperary Vocational Education Committee have expanded the curricula <Col N="197" /> to cover a vast range of subjects, and it is acknowledged that the school is exceptionally good.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise enough to the Minister the degree of frustration that has begun to develop among the school authorities &mdash; the teachers, students, the parents' council and the vocational education committee &mdash; with regard to the long delay in bringing this project to the commencement stage.  It appears that at each stage, despite previous experience in submissions on other schools, despite the availability of top class consultants in quantity surveying and design and everything else which was unmatched and unchecked in previous submissions for other schools in the area, that on this occasion query after query emerged and there is a genuine feeling that these are exercises that are being introduced to slow up this project.</P>
    <P>Because of the prefabricated nature of so many of the buildings in the school many of them will have to be moved for the new building to commence.  In order not to interrupt the school session, it is fairly crucial that that work will be done during the summer holidays, to open up the possibility of starting in October, not with a total new extension, but with reasonable facilities at that time.  Therefore, it is absolutely crucial that sanction be given in order that that preparatory work could be concluded during the summer holidays.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make a special effort to ensure that this work can commence during the summer holidays.  In order for that to happen the project must be given the go-ahead.  I am not saying that all the funds will have to be available this year but it should be allowed to start and that would end the frustration that is growing in the area arising from the prolonged nature of negotiations with the Department on this whole project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problems of prefabricated buildings in post-primary schools and I am very well aware of the problem in Newport, <Col N="198" /> because I have had numerous representations over some time in relation to the replacement of this extension.</P>
      <P>My Department have approved the development of this vocational school to provide 300 student places overall.  The planning of an extension to the existing school to bring about this development has reached a very advanced stage.  The present position is that the bill of quantities, which is the stage prior to the seeking of tenders, has been submitted to my Department and is at present under examination.  It has been found necessary to return the bill of quantities to the County Tipperary (North Riding) Vocational Education Committee for revision in order to ensure that all the tender documentation will be correct when tenders for the project are being sought.  If this documentation were to be incorrect, alterations could be required at the postcontract stage which could add to costly extras on the contract.  Furthermore, the revisions have sought to ensure the elimination of trade names in respect of various materials, the inclusion of which might be taken as being an endorsement by my Department of particular manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department are fully aware of the existing accommodation facilities, and their condition, at the school.  The question of the provision of permanent accommodation at the Newport School has been under consideration for some time in the context of the organisation of second level educational needs in the Newport area as a whole.  When it was finally decided, early in 1980, to approve in principle the development of the vocational school to cater for 275 student places overall, the decision had to be reviewed in relation to the extent of the Department's other commitments.  At all times, in estimating the provision to be made each year for capital school building, a variety of factors must be taken into consideration, such as the number of projects already under construction and the number of projects in planning, particularly those nearing the stage when contracts may be placed.  It was found in the case of Newport that it was not possible <Col N="199" /> to initiate immediately the architectural planning of the proposed extension.</P>
    <P>Though we may be aware of the accommodation needs of individual schools, capital restraints as well as personnel restraints, do inhibit the initiation of planning.  However, the case was kept under review and Newport was finally taken into the building programme in April 1981 with the holding of the usual meetings between the Department and the school authorities and their design team.</P>
    <P>The existing traditional school building in Newport Vocational School, measuring 530 square metres, is regarded as being in very good condition and can be adapted to meet some of the new requirements in the proposed development.</P>
    <P>The proposed extension, which will replace existing temporary prefabricated structures dating from 1964 and later, will measure 1,424 square metres and will provide six general classrooms, a general purpose-physical education area, a science laboratory and other special rooms for the teaching of building construction, arts and crafts, metalwork and domestic science.  There will also be ancillary accommodation.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve effective monitoring and control in the planning of school building projects and so contain our building programme within our available resources, and also meet school building needs at the most economic level possible, it is the experience of the Department that it can take a minimum of 18 months to guide a school authority through the comprehensive system of cost planning and control from project inception to the completion of planning.</P>
    <P>Well-defined procedures have been developed in response to the demands of the provision of suitable buildings in accordance with carefully worked out space requirements and cost-planning, with the purpose of having school buildings provided as speedily as proper planning allows.  Standards of school design, <Col N="200" /> cost control and effective administration have been set, adherence to which will ensure that the programme of educational building required will be put through to provide buildings which will serve their purpose well, and will achieve this economically.</P>
    <P>Non adherence to the Department's requirements or difficulties arising in the course of planning can lead to a longer planning period.</P>
    <P>However, as I have already said, planning has advanced to the stage where the bill of quantities is under examination in my Department.  Every effort will be made to complete the examination as soon as possible with a view to leaving the way clear for the seeking of tenders. This latter does not follow automatically. We must examine our commitments.  At the moment, we have 50 vocational and secondary school cases under construction, the cost of which eats into our capital allocation for 1985 and 1986.  In the first four months of this year we released 32 cases for the seeking of tenders.  The placing of contracts for these cases further erodes our resources.  When we consider that there are a further 160 cases, where architectural planning is in progress, some of which are approaching the bill of quantities stage, it will be appreciated that we must exercise care to ensure, that our expenditure in 1985 and 1986, and indeed in 1987, is kept within the allocation of money available to us for these years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I repeat that the Department are fully aware of the accommodation conditions at the school referred to by the Senator.  When the examination of the bill of quantities has been completed and the documentation found to be in order, every effort will be made, within our existing constraints, to expedite the placing of a contract and the commencement of work to the extension to Newport Vocational School.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 8 May 1985.</P>
