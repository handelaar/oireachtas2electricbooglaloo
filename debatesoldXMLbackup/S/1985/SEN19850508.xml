      <P>I have notice from Senator Donie Cassidy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The immediate need for the Minister for Education to sanction the building of a new vocational school at Castle-pollard, County Westmeath, to replace the existing school which is totally inadequate and seriously impeding the educational progress of the students in attendance there.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael D. Higgins of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The serious implications in the closure of Scoil Ard Mhuire, an open residential reformatory school for young offenders at Lusk, County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard both matters as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Cassidy's motion for <Col N="202" /> today's Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senator Higgins may give notice for another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Because of the urgency of the matter involved, I have already informed the staff of the Seanad that it is my intention to seek to raise this matter tomorrow or at such other time as is appropriate.  The withdrawal of educational facilities from young offenders at this time is a matter of the gravest urgency and that is the reason for my decision.</P>

      <P>I wish to say that last week the question of the taking of item No. 3 was raised.  I said on that occasion that there could not be the slightest suggestion that there was any right for a private Member to ask for discussion on the annulment of a statutory instrument to be held during Government time.  I said last week that I would, if it were convenient, allow some Government <Col N="203" /> time this week.  Having already promised two hours for the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill today that two hours will not be available.  Item No. 2 is concerned with the ordering of the business of a joint committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas and must take precedence over an annulment which will not be spent until another ten sitting days have elapsed.  Accordingly, I have done all that could reasonably be asked by ordering it as No. 3 on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <P>As the Chair will recall, the Second Stage of this Homeless Persons Bill was last discussed in this House on 12 December when I made a contribution which I had not completed. It is worth putting this on the record at the beginning of my contribution today. In the interim, we have had the publication of the report of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee on the homeless which was primarily convened by the Department of Health because they felt health boards had an increasing housing element in the problems coming before them, especially those dealing with homeless people.  That report has not been widely circulated.  It was with some difficulty that I managed to get a copy.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment may not be in a position to release it generally. The report went into considerable detail. It contains many serious comments on the position of the homeless and it is a document which would be of great interest to Members of this House and Members of the other House.  Now, many months after it has been published, the Department of Health might take the trouble to make it available generally to Members of these Houses.  That has not been done so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> I said in the course of my contribution on the last occasion that a part of the problem with this Bill is the extent of the demand on existing housing accommodation available in the State and on the extent of accommodation being built at present.  The present house building programme of the local authorities amounts to some 6,000 dwellings annually. There are about 30,000 family applicants. The elderly are creating an increasing demand on the services, given the longevity of people.  Medical science has developed so much that people are living longer.  I came across a statistic recently showing that some 30,000 people under the care of the Eastern Health Board are over the age of 75 years.  This is an illustration of the extent of the demand on housing, not just from those who are family applicants but from those in the elderly category.</P>
    <P>In the course of my contribution the last day I mentioned that within the housing category there are a considerable number of homeless people who either have applied or would like to apply if they knew how to deal with the method of applying for housing accommodation.  It is fair to say that a very large number of the people whom we are speaking about have spent a considerable part of their early life at work of some kind.  I described in some detail the fact that there is a high percentage of them men, that 46 per cent of them have been treated for an alcohol-related problem and very many of them have psychotic problems of other descriptions.  In the main, they are people who find it hard to cope with making an application, pursuing the various ways in which one can bring about a situation where the points might be improved and where the system is used to its full to ensure that they have a real chance of being housed.</P>
    <P>I mentioned also that Dublin Corporation, of which I am a member, and indeed my former colleague, the Minister of State, was a member until recently, decided this year to allocate 50 dwellings annually to the homeless.  They are in the course of doing that at the moment in the flat schemes throughout the city.  It is <Col N="205" /> intended to pursue it and have another 50 in the following period.  At least an attempt has been made to start in that direction.  The problem is, of course, that you are dealing with an unknown number of applicants.  It is very hard to say precisely, if there was a move, such as that intended in this Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983, whereby there was a statutory duty on the housing authority to provide accommodation for the homeless, how many you would have.</P>
    <P>It is not just a matter of handling the 30,000 families who are applicants; there are some 1,400 elderly who are looking for accommodation from Dublin Corporation at the moment.  They have a building programme, I understand, providing 300 maisonettes with warden and community rooms at the present time.  If you open the gates, if there is a statutory duty to look after the homeless, you are not just talking of hostel dwellers, of which there are 1,000 in this city at present.</P>
    <P>The record in Glasgow city is that 85 per cent of those people housed from the hostels have, in fact, been able to cope well in running their own homes.  They have been given that opportunity.  The pride they take in this is something that is very reassuring and should be considered very seriously in advancing the position of the homeless, in giving them a real position of strength in our housing allocation system in the forseeable future.  The fact that they have been so very well able to cope in outside hostel and institutional environments is an encouragement to all of us here who are interested in finding a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>We are not just dealing with hostel dwellers but with people in private rented accommodation.  It is fair to say that much of the private rented accommodation we are speaking about, throughout the city and elsewhere, in many cases is much worse accommodation than exists in any part of a public housing estate. The degree to which we have been able to provide decent standards of accommodation and insist on those standards being improved in our legislative arrangements to date is a very serious reflection on the manner in which the Department <Col N="206" /> of the Environment and the local authorities have operated to try to ensure beyond the area of public housing that the housing that is provided elsewhere is up to a proper standard.</P>
    <P>The last reform of the Public Health Act in this area relating to the standard of sanitary accommodation and other matters dates back to the last century. We did something about private rented accommodation when we were dealing with rent control two years ago, although we took that on in two swipes.  We tried a Bill and found that it did not suit the needs of the category we are speaking about, mainly the elderly living in private rented accommodation, and we came in with another Bill.  Both followed on a constitutional action won in the courts, and really should have been faced up to by the Department of the Environment long before that.  Outside the area of protection in the private rented sector we do not seem to be bothered as a State, as a Department of the Environment, as a Government &mdash; I say that irrespective of which Government are in office &mdash; about the standards of private rented accommodation in this city and elsewhere.  I hope this will be looked at by the Department in framing the new legislation which I understand is at an advanced stage at this time.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the House announced on last week's Order of Business that there would be a two hour debate on the Homeless Persons Bill today.  In dealing with that, the Leader of the House announced that the Government had given approval for the heads of a comprehensive Bill on housing matters and not purely on the way in which the Government would deal with the Homeless Persons Bill, but in other areas of need in relation to housing and in reforming the housing code.  He told us there would be a comprehensive Bill before these Houses shortly and in fact the matter is now with the parliamentary draftsman to prepare the Bill.  Presumably the Minister will be making a commentary during today's debate in relation to that matter.  That would reassure Senators on <Col N="207" /> all sides of the House that the Government are treating this measure seriously and that it is being advanced in an orderly way.</P>
    <P>I hope the Chair will understand that I have to repeat some of my contribution of the last occasion.  When one spoke approximately six months ago and one was building up to a certain point and then was asked to adjourn the debate, one has to lead in by repeating some of the points one made then.  I said then that I think the history of public housing and the way in which the local authorities regarded their role, I suppose up to about a decade ago, was one of housing families. The old approach to things was if a mother or a wife went into the local housing authority &mdash; it was certainly the case in Dublin Corporation &mdash; and asked if she could get a house or a flat, whether she could move from her single room or from her mother's floor, as it is locally called here in the centre of Dublin, she was told &ldquo;Well, Pauline, &mdash; or Mary &mdash; you better go home and get a few children&rdquo;. The housing code at that time certainly put great emphasis on the number of children you had.  That emphasis was, up to recently, a very significant part of being housed at all.  The emphasis has changed with the introduction of the points scheme.  I am glad to say that the through-put of that has been seen in dealing with the housing of applicants.  The number of young married couples with one child who no longer have to survive on their mother's floor, or in their mother's flat, or house, but who are housed separately as a new family institution has increased over the years.</P>
    <P>One of the sources of a great amount of family disharmony and of family problems has been the fact that for so long we have done nothing about the position of doubling and trebling of families in a house or a flat.  The Department of the Environment and the housing authorities have been responsible for that move. Indeed, members of local authorities make no mean contributions to these changes.  We have moved ahead from that and are in a position now where in <Col N="208" /> the city of Dublin the small family get a real chance of housing and of setting themselves up with a home in the early stages.</P>
    <P>The record of the past was of families getting all the attention and those families being allocated accommodation on the basis of the number of children in the homestead and with direct encouragement given to increase the family size. In the last decade we have had changes relating to the arrival of the points scheme which is widely used by local authorities throughout the country, a scheme which deals with the sharing of accommodation, sanitary conditions and so on, of housing applicants.  We have a much more humanitarian approach to the applicant.  Applicants know in detail where they stand, what the chances of being housed are, what is being built and how that might fall into their overall possibility of being housed in a suitable way.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, we moved into building a significant amount of dwellings for the elderly.  The maisonette developments that are going on throughout the country now for the elderly, those particularly who are in sheltered accommodation of one form or another, are a very important contribution to the housing needs of the people.  Although I do not believe for a moment that we are matching the demand for these services, we certainly have made great steps forward in this area.</P>
    <P>As I say, remaining outside the scope of the housing authorities are the homeless. That is not to say that there is not an occasional homeless person housed or that an occasional homeless person has not been housed over the last decade. The numbers are remarkably few, largely because there has been no real attempt to assist those homeless people who, as I said earlier, are in very many cases those who have had a psychiatric, alcoholic or psychotic difficulty in their lives.  If you live in a private rented house with sizeable rooms but have very little sanitary accommodation, very little opportunity to treat yourself as you should be treated by others, where the rent is high, where the arrangement is not permanent and <Col N="209" /> where very often there is squalor, there is not much opportunity to get out of such places.  You can get a closing order and there can be steps taken to house people elsewhere but these are of an emergency nature.  There are people living in buildings where the arm of the State has not budged for far too long in ensuring a decent standard of accommodation, in improving bathroom accommodation, improving services within the house and ensuring that those services are provided for a due rent.</P>
    <P>The area of rent restrictions, which we spoke of earlier, is quite a separate category.  I am speaking of those who live in private rented accommodation, but whose standard of accommodation is not affected in the main by the State, by the Department of the Environment and, worse still, the housing stock is badly affected by the lack of attention, by the lack of involvement by the Department of the Environment in the upkeep of standards. It is because of the encouragement of housing grants into these situations that there is an improvement in standards and an improvement which in the long run will take some of the pressure off the public housing list.</P>
    <P>It is very encouraging to hear that the <i>ad hoc</i> committee of the Department of Health not alone had their report published but within the report there are a number of things that are significant and there are important messages from those who took part in the debate, those who were responsible for preparing this document. The committee had representatives from a variety of health boards throughout the country &mdash; the Eastern Health Board, the Western Health Board, the Midland Health Board as well as representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of the Environment, the Kilkenny County Council, the Westmeath County Council and Dublin Corporation.  Mr. Des Flanagan, who up to recently was an assistant city manager in the corporation, was on that committee and indeed served after he retired.  He is a man with considerable experience in housing in the city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> This group got together and the document was made available, as I said earlier, in a manner that is not normal in the sense that you had to work hard to get a copy of it.  I can only give the Minister my experience, which I will go into in detail with him later if he likes.  Senator Brendan Ryan lent me his copy and after I got it I wrote to the Department of Health looking for a copy.  Some two months later I was conveniently looked after by the Department of Health.  That comes from a Department who were to some extent involved in the matter we are talking about, who had set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee.</P>
    <P>It would seem to me, given the significance of this document and the fact that it says a number of things of quite considerable importance relating to the category of homelessness, that it might have been appropriate for the Minister for Health, or the Minister for the Environment, to have let the press know, to let the country know that this document is now available and can be purchased.  It would be a welcome kind of approach to a document that is of considerable length.</P>
    <P>It contains appendices covering about 50 or 60 pages.  I will not set all the matters contained in this report on the record but there are a few matters about which I feel I should certainly alert the House.  They say in paragraph 4.7:</P>
    <P>The distinction between the needs of a homeless person for temporary or permanent accommodation in towns by which agency that need should be met is not clearly drawn and practised. While primary responsibility for the provision of housing to those not able to house themselves rests with local authorities it is inevitable, given the limitations and resources, that there will be single homeless persons whose needs and capabilities may suit them for permanent housing but who will not be able to obtain such accommodation because of the relatively low priority accorded to them on housing authority waiting lists.  These persons may then be forced to fall back for accommodation, often for a protracted period, on <Col N="211" /> those institutions either operated or financially supported by health boards, who should only have a minimal responsibility for the provision of housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>That is a very important statement.  We have been hearing for a long time about the history of the institutions run by the health boards and the county homes in which, traditionally, many of the people we are speaking about ended up.  That statement seems to give the view of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee that the health board will from now on have a minimal responsibility relating to homelessness.  It is important that we put that on the record and that we look at it from a number of aspects because it means that this is another area of less demand on the county homes and psychiatric hospitals. It should help in the switch of those who are in these institutions who could be cared for in the community.  There is one very clear way in which we could be assisting that service in moving people into the community by discharging our responsibilities for the homeless.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say in paragraph 4.8:</P>
    <P>In discharging their responsibility to house persons in need housing authorities direct their efforts primarily to families and individuals.</P>
    <P>Those individuals are the individuals I was speaking about earlier, the elderly, those in need of permanent housing rather than temporary accommodation or capable of holding an independent tenancy. Over the years the authorities catered for many families rendered homeless for one reason or another.  Any homeless family comprising of parent or parents with one child or more is normally quickly accommodated by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I shall mention two more things relating to the <i>ad hoc</i> committee's report.  The report also emphasises what I said earlier about the experience in Glasgow where 85 per cent of homeless persons were, after a period of years, found to be able <Col N="212" /> to live outside the environment of an institution, outside the hostel, were able to build their own homes and get considerable pride from the new accommodation they were in and survive there with the dignity that each human being in our community should at least be given if at all possible.  Many homeless persons make the transition quite successfully from a state of being homeless to settling in permanent accommodation given adequate preparation and minimal support. There are those among the homeless whose problems cannot be solved by the provision of permanent housing, some do not want to settle in permanent accommodation and others would not be able to hold down an independent tenancy. Many require special medical and other care.  The problems of these persons are not answered solely by the provision of housing.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the tremendous work being done for the homeless in Dublin; it is a European example of how this matter should be looked after.  That is the work of Dr. Joe Fernandez who runs a very important assessment centre at St. Brendan's Hospital.  It is both an inpatient and an out-patient facility.  I would like to compliment Dr. Joe Fernandez, as I did before on this arrangement. What he does there is well known. He has a large number of homeless people visiting his assessment centre and in many cases being treated there, either on a day basis in the day care centre or for a period in the institutional or the inpatient facility.  Many homeless people here as in Glasgow would be able to live outside the institution where many of them live almost permanently or have lived almost permanently.  The Salvation Army hostel in York Street is a very well run establishment, as the Minister of State and I know from visits there at times of elections and otherwise.  I recently discovered that some 50 per cent of the people who live in the Salvation Army hostel live there permanently; it is their home.  There is rarely a night when there is a vacancy within that hostel.  The 50 per cent stay on there forever.  There are other cases where there are big voids, <Col N="213" /> where people do not want to live.  There is some very good accommodation but the charges for staying there for the night are high and the administration run things differently; people are expected to be in by a certain hour at night and be out by a certain hour in the morning.  Perhaps the breakfast is better in the Salvation Army hostel.  I had it there one morning not long ago.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board are involved in considerable subsidisation of these hostels.  This is another aspect of the need to find a solution to this problem.  It must be possible for us, instead of putting money by subsidisation into these hostels, to move forward into recognising that the individual client in many instances is quite young, has had a problem &mdash; possibly a marital problem &mdash; problems within the family and so on.  Many of these young people are well educated and, if facilitated in the right way, could be back to work after a short period.</P>
    <P>With the availability of the centre in St. Brendan's Hospital, with the considerable experience that Dr. Joe Fernandez has in this area, I believe that the support services are there to assist those who are housed in a much more generous way by the local authorities, to assist them to cope with life outside institutional care and to get over the temporary problems they may have in surviving outside care of that kind.  It is possible for us, with the advantages we have in St. Brendan's Hospital, to assist people in that transition in the housing situation.</P>
    <P>The report also deals with the question of homelessness in another respect.  It says that the committee recommend that housing authorities should seek to improve the information available to them on the level of needs in their area, having particular regard to the needs of groups such as the homeless who may be under-represented on the waiting list for housing.  Information on the nature and extent of homelessness in the authority's area should be compiled on a regular basis, drawing on sources such as the authority's own social workers and housing staff and voluntary bodies operating in the area and so on.  The authority <Col N="214" /> should also have regard to homelessness in their assessment of housing needs carried out under section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966.  The committee note that the Department of the Environment have, since 1983, obtained information on the number of homeless persons on the housing authority waiting list and the numbers housed by housing authorities.</P>
    <P>What is fundamental to this whole issue in the foreseeable future is for the local authorities to compile lists of those who would be treated as homeless, those who have not been treated as homeless up to now.  Public representatives dealing with an urban area in Ireland, and certainly in Dublin, would regard homelessness as an issue affecting those who, by way of eviction or otherwise, find themselves on the street.  We are speaking of people who might have been housed but were not housed and given the dignity of their own dwelling, people housed in institutional care, in a psychiatric hospital or elsewhere, with the assistance of Dr. Fernandez unit in St. Brendan's Hospital. I am speaking of those who were very inadequately housed in private rented accommodation where the standards date back to the last century, to the 1898 Public Health Act.</P>
    <P>There is a need to advance and take from this <i>ad hoc</i> committee's report the encouragement, which presumably would be a statutory encouragement, to housing authorities that in the foreseeable future a Bill, which is at present with the parliamentary draftsman will be before the House.  There are many worthy reasons for having this Bill published. I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the initiative of Senator Brendan Ryan in bringing this matter before the House, a matter which concerns an area that is not spoken of; people do not talk about it; it is not a big electoral issue.  It could be, but so far these people are sufficiently well scattered not to affect anybody too much.</P>
    <P>Homelessness is a humanitarian issue which deserves recognition.  It has been recognised in other countries and other democracies.  It is essential that we assign <Col N="215" /> the statutory duty to the housing authorities and ensure that it is a duty which they take on as a special one, that it is not just included under the great arm of the housing authorities of cities like Dublin; that they manage to deal with it in a very special way; that they respond to it in a humanitarian way; that they expect from the applicants something different from what is expected from the normal applicant and that they give special points for the form of homelessness that we are speaking of.  We should go to some trouble to ensure that they are on the list, are encouraged and looked after, and that we have a building programme under way to suit people of this category.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of the housing situation generally is that in the period from December 1983 to the end of the year, a total of 1,500 units were built by Dublin Corporation, only 72 of which had fewer than three bedrooms.  There is now a recognition of this problem.  There is an attempt to put in 5 or 10 per cent of dwellings with less than three bedrooms in new housing developments in the city and county of Dublin.  It is a very welcome development.  The two-bedroomed cottage or bungalow or house was the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing some years ago but went out of business in the course of the sixties, seventies and indeed half of the eighties. We did not build them.  We did not build them because we thought the thing to do was to answer the problem with three-and four-bedroomed houses; indeed, that was answering a problem but it was not answering the whole problem.  There was a demand for accommodation coming from couples who had an adult member of the family living with them.  Any Member of this House who has to deal with them knows the trouble you have in getting suitable accommodation for them; the limited extent to which dwellings are available for that category is an enormous difficulty.  It is much easier &mdash; believe it or not &mdash; to house the elderly person.  It is very much more difficult when you have two elderly persons with an adult daughter or son living with them who need to be housed; in the housing <Col N="216" /> jargon they call them a non-expanding family.  That kind of family does not seem to fit into the way in which the resources have been spent over the last 15 years.  It is high time we recognised that and did something about it.  There has been an element of change but there is need for much more change.</P>
    <P>Coupled with this, there should be a move, in the foreseeable future, to not just house the elderly &mdash; that is the over-sixties &mdash; but to start dealing with the homeless people under 60 and over 40 who perhaps require to be housed, who need to be given some space within the capital provision of each housing authority. It is not just a simple matter of housing them within the already built housing estates, in the low priority flats complexes where when a flat comes up occasionally one is offered to these people and you mix them in.  I do not suggest either that you have a building filled with the homeless people who lived in the Salvation Army hostel or the Iveagh hostel.  Within each new housing area it must be possible to introduce some units for this category, in the same way as we introduced some units for the small, non-expanding family.  We should begin to give a mix to our housing development and we should ensure that this category, as well as other categories, is given the benefit of resources and that the resources are spent to provide for them.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the fact that I hear the Government Bill is now with the parliamentary draftsman and we may have a Bill of substantive nature shortly and that Bill will give a statutory duty to the housing authorities.  I hope that as a follow-up to that, the Government of the day, the Department of the Environment, will see to it that the mix of new developments will include facilities for the small, non-expanding family and for the homeless, which is the principal motivation of this Bill, and that we will advance to a stage where we will not need to be spending to the extent which we now are in supporting the hostels and in supporting psychiatric hospitals where people are detained much longer in institutional conditions than necessary, <Col N="217" /> because we have not recognised them and we have done very little about solving their problems.  I hope we will move forward to a stage where we will direct the money in a much more positive direction and assist the housing of these people, give them a roof over their heads, give them a chance of dignity and pride as a result of the warmth and understanding of the community.</P>
    <P>I believe that in a decade from now, if we take these steps and if the Government ensure that part of the capital housing allocation is earmarked for these categories we will end up with a much better balanced and healthier community instead of the situation in which we now are.  A lady who lives in the Coombe in a new five-bedroomed house visited me the other day.  She has one child living with her.  Things happened whereby she was housed there; she had other members of her family with her at the time but now she has only one child there.  Quite a number of people are living in very large new houses, built by the corporation and by other local authorities within the last five years.  This is accommodation above their needs.  We need a system which includes everybody, especially the small family and the homeless person.  I believe we will get a more satisfactory housing code and response from the people in this direction.</P>

      <P>When we are talking about homelessness we are talking about an offence against human rights.  Human rights, as understood internationally today, and especially inside the whole European system, means that we have to avoid the charge of offending human rights, we must provide shelter, education, gainful employment and all the things that a civilised society should provide to satisfy human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As long as homelessness, a high degree of unemployment and a shunning of the disadvantaged remain in our society, these factors are an indictment of our failure to cope.  Having said that, I must also say, from the point of view of balance, that housing legislation of this nature is to be commended.  It means that <Col N="218" /> we are a caring society.  When legislation setting up the Combat Poverty Agency is implemented it will mean we are a caring and compassionate society.  When we proceed to implement the National Development Corporation to provide gainful employment it will mean that we are a compassionate and caring society. These three things must be seen to be corelated. If we are talking about homelessness &mdash; and I might say that we are now talking almost half way through the last quarter of this century &mdash; we still remain, in the lifetime of our country, a democratic society trying to do our best.  This must be said about the legislation I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Homelessness in Ireland is not the same as homelessness in North Africa or southern Spain.  It is a very harsh life when you are without shelter.  You cannot sleep on our beaches with a blanket pulled over you.  Homelessness and its cure by providing shelter is only one aspect of the problem associated with it. I believe it is related to poverty.  I also believe it is related to other aspects of one's own behaviour.  I am not going to criticise the homeless; I am simply suggesting that the Combat Poverty Agency will find fruitful work in eliciting the causes of homelessness.  I believe it is an aspect of poverty.  The Government are to be applauded for proposing to bring in this legislation to provide shelter for the homeless.</P>
    <P>I can claim to speak with some little authority in the whole housing field. When the troubles began in 1968-69, the two local authorities, the rural authority and the city of Derry authority, were suspended and eliminated by the then Unionist Government.  A nine-man commission was then set up to run the two areas in those dreadful times.  The earlier years were worse even than today.  I was vice-chairman of that commission.  The housing situation was not so much one of homelessness in Derry, even though I had experience of a housing area in Derry; it was one of homelessness in Belfast. There was overcrowding plus some homelessness in Derry.  I chaired the housing sub-committee and the situation <Col N="219" /> was so bad &mdash; the local authority in Derry had been building eight houses a year &mdash; that I had to build 1,000 houses a year. It took three years to make a dent in the housing problem.</P>
    <P>The question of allocation brings me to ask: how do you award shelter to a homeless person?  I had a model village inside the commission area some miles from Derry and the Unionists before they went out of office had allocated them before the plans were dry.  That was unique in a so-called democratic society. On examination, I reversed the allocations and allocated them on a points system which took me nearly 24 hours without sleep to draw up.  That became the precursor of the points system now operating under the Housing Executive in Northern Ireland.  In emergency cases &mdash; which homelessness is &mdash; you cannot apply a points system.  You cannot even apply a residential factor: it is not right. I was very perturbed to see on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> some time ago a young woman with her chattels and her baby on the street in Dún Laoghaire because she did not have the residential qualifications.  That is wrong.  Homelessness is an emergency situation and should have first preference without points. There is one condition: provided that they have not deliberately worsened their conditions in order to gain a house.</P>
    <P>In Derry, I used caravans and any dwellings I could requisition &mdash; broken down houses, houses not occupied, hotels not used etc.  Any space I got I used as transition material until our building programme got going.  That comes into the technicalities of providing shelter for people which is satisfying a human right albeit a bit late, but we are doing it.  That is the point.</P>
    <P>The second experience I had was when I was called to Belfast as vice-chairman of the commission when the troubles had got out of hand.  There was a very big meeting in the Stormont Cabinet Office. Sir Chichester-Clark was in the chair. After five minutes I was put in the chair. He was Prime Minister.  The housing problem was brought to the forefront. <Col N="220" /> The army, police, politicians, trade unions, universities, business and commerce were all represented there and I pointed out that the first priority was housing the homeless, especially the people who had fled in fear, the people who had been burned out and the people who were without shelter.  Those meetings were attended by the Northern Ireland civil service and they did a very good job, including the settling of income levels to maintain homes.  They did a very good job and I pay them tribute here today.  That operation lasted three months but the meetings gave me experience which I carried into the Derry Commission</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to say something about the points system.  I did not make my point to evoke some loose statement about it.  I want the Minister to reply to that, and say whether homeless people will be treated as emergency cases.  I could not conceive any other mechanism, remembering always that there is a condition attached that the persons seeking shelter, having categorised themselves as homeless and specified they have no shelter, must not have made their condition worse deliberately.  That has to be watched very carefully.</P>
    <P>It is a mark of a civilised society to do this exercise because it satisfies human rights.  We claim to be a democratic society and I think we are.  The degree of democracy runs very high in the Republic but democracy does not end with the use of the ballot box.  Democracy, if it means anything, means fair play, social justice and the satisfying of it and not just voting for a candidate to go in on a mandate. Basically, it is to satisfy social justice. That is what society is about. Governments exist because people say, &ldquo;You will be our Government for a period of time; you are our servants&rdquo;.  It is not the other way around.  People must always hold the position that they, as individuals, are more important than the State and the homeless person becomes very, very important in the context of a civilised, democratic society which does not end at the ballot box.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to delay the House long on this Bill because in a sense we are speaking in a vacuum. People are expressing views on a Bill which has been brought in by a Private Member when every Member of the House knows that this Bill will not be passed by this House.  It will be superseded by a Bill which will be brought in by the Government at some stage.  The only benefit in discussing this Bill is that it may give the Minister some ideas on which he can base the legislation which is supposed to come before us in a short time.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that this debate did not take place six or eight months ago. That would have given the Minister an opportunity to listen to the debate and he could then have drawn up the heads of his own Bill and brought in a Bill which could be based not totally on what has been said in this House by the very concerned Members who are here but at least he would have had a good indication as to what he might put in the Bill.  Every time Senator Ryan asked when the Government Bill was going to be brought in he was told that the legislation was with the draftsman or it was with the Government.  It was always with somebody for a long time.  I hope it will come in here very shortly.</P>
      <P>There is no point in pretending that Senator Ryan's Bill has any hope of becoming law.  This House could be better used than by addressing ourselves to something that cannot become law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems of the homeless in this country are enormous.  Homeless people create problems which are unrelated to housing problems.  The fact that people are homeless sometimes causes them to get involved in civil disobedience in the sense that they break into deserted houses, caravans or sheds to get shelter for the night.  Under the Vagrancy Act, if they are found there they are brought before the courts the next day and they may go to jail for a few weeks.  Generally that is what happens to people who are considered to be vagrants.  It is hard to deal with people who are transient in their lifestyle and move from place to <Col N="222" /> place.  There is no legislation we can bring in here which would provide for these people on an ongoing basis.  If we were to provide that type of accommodation we would have to over-provide in every area.  We would have to provide for everybody who is transient or homeless.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will be able to address himself to the financing and the organisation of such a massive job.  There are the emergency homeless who today are being used by landlords to fill their own pockets.  Landlords charge for very bad accommodation and they can continue to over-charge because local authorities are not being given the funds wherewith to provide for people in very bad accommodation.  The landlords can continue to charge because they know the local authorities cannot close down very bad accommodation, they cannot make an order against a landlord because the local authorities have not got the funds to provide for all the people who are looking for accommodation as a right.</P>
    <P>Homeless single persons are a major problem.  No local authority is providing accommodation for this type of person.  Senator FitzGerald mentioned a few of the hostels in Dublin where these people can be accommodated either on a semi-permanent or casual basis.  In rural areas there are no local authority single persons' complexes.  Local authorities are doing a better job than private building concerns in providing smaller type dwellings for elderly people, for couples who have no children.  They are called OPDs but in many areas throughout the country they have been used to house elderly sisters or perhaps married couples who have no children and who would not normally, on a points system, obtain a house.</P>
    <P>There is grave need throughout the country to provide some type of flat accommodation.  It is necessary for local authorities to have funds to provide flat accommodation.  Possibly this could be done under the aegis of the schemes which we have in certain areas where the health boards and the local authorities have become involved and complexes for handicapped persons have been built.  If <Col N="223" /> a person is mentally or physically handicapped, there is an excellent chance that he or she will get accommodation which is suitable for single people.  In country areas if people are elderly there is a reasonable chance that through the health boards and voluntary contributions they will get accommodation.  But for the younger, homeless person there is no hope of getting accommodation either on a semi-permanent or even a casual basis.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat hypocritical of us to be discussing this Bill at all because we all know that it will not be passed by this or the other House and that it will be overtaken at some stage by the Minister's Homeless Persons Bill.  For that reason we should not spend too much time on it.  The sooner the humbug of this exercise is over and we see the Government's Bill, the better.</P>
    <P>If we allowed this Bill to go through in its present form, there is absolutely no way that local authorities could provide for what is contained in it.  There is no way I could see the Minister providing the funds necessary to establish what this Bill proposes to establish.  The sooner we see the Government legislation in this House the better because there is a grave need for it, particularly in the bigger cities.</P>
    <P>Because of the way the social welfare system is geared against young people who are unemployed, they tend to leave rural areas and head for the big cities and this exacerbates the position in the big cities.  Not alone are they moving to the bigger cities but they are going across the water looking for jobs in London and the other bigger cities of England, Scotland and Wales.  From the articles in <i>The Irish Press</i> this week, it would appear that a growing number of younger people are going to the United States illegally and that if one were to go into bars and places of entertainment in San Francisco and New York one would find there large numbers of young people from Ireland.</P>
    <P>Young people are discriminated against under the Social Welfare Acts because if they live at home their unemployment <Col N="224" /> assistance is cut.  It is suggested that if they live at home they must be getting sustenance from their parents.  I would suggest that in the majority of cases their parents are on unemployment assistance or benefit and they have to feed these young people.  A young person who is in any way vigorous feels he deserves a little more from life than £12 per week.  Is it any wonder we see young people going around vandalising cars, breaking into houses and creating problems of every kind?  I cannot see why a young person who reaches the age of 18 years of age should not get the full rate of unemployment assistance and not have this farce of having it cut back because he lives with his parents.  He is a burden on his parents and in too many cases the burden is not just a financial one.  Because he has no work, because he cannot get what he was educated to get, he causes disruption in the household.  If the father is unemployed and is at home he is constantly harping at the young person to go out and get a job and the young person cannot get a job.  It is no wonder we see a rebellious youth growing up.</P>
    <P>There is a need to look after these young people who leave home or who are thrown out and who have to be dealt with on an emergency basis but since at present we cannot get enough money to deal with the ordinary housing list it would be virtually impossible for the local authorities with the funding they have, to deal with the very grave problem of homelessness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to thank the House for giving me the opportunity of making a short intervention in the debate on the Bill introduced by Senator Ryan.  I do so mainly to keep the House informed on the progress being made with the legislation the Government have promised on housing. Last week the Government approved of proposals made by me for new housing legislation which have now gone for formal drafting and which I am confident <Col N="225" /> can be published later in the present parliamentary session.</P>
      <P>The specific details of the new measures must necessarily await publication of the Bill.  I am, however, in a position to give a broad outline of the direction the legislation will take.  The Bill will be an extensive measure embracing different important facets of housing.  First of all, and most importantly in the context of this debate, local authorities will be made primarily responsible for the accommodation needs of the homeless and will be given the necessary powers to meet and properly discharge their new responsibilities in the area.  In this respect, the proposals will reflect the recommendations of the <i>ad hoc</i> group on homelessness whose report was published in December last and will meet the objectives of Senator Ryan's Bill. Therefore, the Government's Bill will seek to ensure effective access to housing accommodation by the homeless while avoiding serious disruption of the prospects of those on local authority waiting lists whose housing needs are acute by any standards.  Apart from the homeless, the Bill will cover other major areas of housing policy.  It will include provisions arising from the Government's statement of 20 July last on policy in relation to travellers.  It will embrace such other major initiatives of the Government in the housing area as the £5,000 grant, the scheme of assistance for voluntary housing, the scheme of structural works to &ldquo;low cost&rdquo; and other rented houses etc.  The Bill will, therefore, be the most significant piece of housing legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas in the last 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the Government are facing up squarely to their undertakings to tackle the problems of the homeless.  We do not take issue with those supporting Senator Ryan's Bill on the need for legislation.  Where I find myself differing from Senator Ryan is on the effectiveness and suitability of his approach.  I am compelled to conclude that his Bill, as it stands, does not offer a workable solution.  It seeks to graft on to an existing legislative framework new <Col N="226" /> provisions which are at variance with the existing provisions of the housing code and which would only undermine the existing powers of the local authorities to provide and allocate housing to persons unable to provide adequate housing from their own resources.  To achieve its objective, legislation to cater for the homeless must be properly integrated into, and be compatible with, the wider housing code. It cannot stand in isolation if an effective framework is to be provided within which the needs of different groups for housing can be met.</P>
    <P>The present Bill, if enacted, would do little to improve the position of the homeless persons now residing in night shelters or sleeping rough and on whose behalf it is mainly claimed the Bill is necessary. The housing needs of these persons would, in fact, be overtaken by more knowledgeable and assertive persons exploiting to their own advantage the loopholes in the Bill.  The intention behind the Bill is entirely acceptable but its terms are so vague and widely drawn that its practical effects are wholly unpredictable. The statutory duty which the Bill would impose on local authorities to house homeless persons would mean effectively that homeless persons would have to be housed before all other categories of persons in need.  This priority would be absolute and would be an incentive to families and individuals dissatisfied with their housing conditions to become homeless as a sure way of obtaining a local authority house.  It is not, therefore, a harsh judgment of Senator Ryan's Bill to say that it is a charter for &ldquo;queue-jumping&rdquo; by those seeking local authority housing no matter how well intentioned and socially concerned a measure it is.</P>
    <P>An example of the shortcomings of the Bill is that it does not recognise that some homeless persons are incapable for medical reasons of living independently in a dwelling and that housing accommodation is not the remedy for their problems. Furthermore, the Bill provides no safeguards whatever against abuses such as intentional or deliberate homelessness. However, the definition of the homeless <Col N="227" /> person is not of itself particularly the problem, but rather the combination of the broad and unqualified definition and an extremely specific binding duty on local authorities to house all persons coming within this broad definition.  I emphasise that I am not taking issue with the approach of imposing on local authorities a specific statutory duty towards homeless persons.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned some of the difficulties presented by Senator Ryan's Bill.  I do not intend to repeat in full the drawbacks of the Bill since these have been dealt with in some detail in previous contributions to this debate.  The Government are, as has been made clear throughout this debate, determined to seek a solution to the problem of homelessness. Homelessness in our society is as distasteful to me and to the Government as it is to the sponsors of this Bill.  However, the problems of homeless persons would not be overcome by the passage of the Bill; on the contrary, it would do little to improve the position of the homeless as one of the most disadvantaged groups in our society and would cause confusion and uncertainty in a most sensitive and important area of housing policy, that is, access to and eligibility for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>I am confident, on the other hand, that the proposals for which I have obtained the approval of the Government will offer a real prospect of finally coming to grips with this distressing problem.  I hope that Senators will accept my own and the Government's good faith in regard to the forthcoming legislation which I look forward to having published as early as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this Private Members' Bill we have to be very careful to distinguish between the problem of homelessness and the nature of the Bill that is being proposed.  We cannot make a judgment on the Bill unless we can give a clear answer to two questions; what is the nature of the problem of homelessness and would this Bill solve <Col N="228" /> the problem?  Senator Ryan in introducing his Bill a considerable time ago said, at columns 436-7, Volume 102, No. 4 of the Official Report, that his Bill could be summarised as having three objectives, firstly, an objective of defining &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo;, secondly, an objective of placing a clear responsibility on the local authority and thirdly, the imposition of a statutory obligation to house the homeless who have been thus defined.  As the Minister has just said, what really is at issue in this debate is the question of determining whether the Bill in the form put forward to us will achieve the objective that it has, whether it will tend to resolve this problem.  It is a difficult problem to discuss and a complex one but I must say, in all frankness, in the presence of the Minister, that I do not think it is all that complex that the Seanad should have had to wait as long as it had since the Private Members' Bill was introduced in order to get a firm Government response.  We must be grateful that that response is now on the way but this does not lessen our regret that it was so long coming.</P>
      <P>If we take up the first of the objectives of Senator Brendan Ryan's Bill, the question of the definition of &ldquo;homelessness' and it is defined here in section 4 of his Bill, there is an immediate difficulty here in the manner of this definition because the definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; has been taken so wide here that it creates a very real difficulty and, as the Minister has indicated, raises the question of whether there might not be an aggravation of the situation rather than an amelioration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition in section 4 of the Bill which Senator Brendan Ryan has given us is related in some respects to the definition of the United Kingdom 1977 Act but is much broader even than that definition. One of the problems that arises in regard to this definition is the inclusion of what could be called &ldquo;threatened homelessness&rdquo; and once that is included in the definition and linked with the statutory obligation on the part of the local authority to house, the way is open to abuse <Col N="229" /> as the Minister has indicated in his contribution just now.</P>
    <P>Quite recently there was a discussion in Northern Ireland in regard to this problem. Incidentally, it is of interest to note that the UK Act of 1977 was not applied to Northern Ireland.  In this particular respect the situation in Northern Ireland is pretty much the same as it is here in this State.  During a public meeting there was a discussion of this problem in Northern Ireland and it was indicated that in drawing up legislation for Northern Ireland it was hoped that the mistakes of the UK legislation would not be repeated. There was nothing to indicate what were the shortcomings of the UK legislation. Indeed, if we could get on to the Statute Book in this country legislation dealing with the homeless which would be as broad in scope as the legislation under the UK 1977 Act, as extended by judicial interpretation to cover people in hostels, then we would be on the way to dealing with this problem.  If we attempt to go beyond the definition of the UK Act and if we attempt to reinforce this extended definition by a statutory obligation to house then we are introducing what may well be an unworkable Act.</P>
    <P>We would all welcome the fact that the Minister is introducing a Bill, a Bill which as he has indicated will not only deal with the question of housing the homeless but will be a general housing Bill amending the housing code.  We have been operating under the Housing Act, 1966 for almost 20 years and it certainly was time for a general review.</P>
    <P>When dealing with this Private Members' Bill in regard to the housing of homeless persons we must consider how it would graft on to Part III of the 1966 Act.  Section 53 of the Housing Act, 1966 lays down what are the duties of local authorities in regard to housing.  It lays down that they must survey the situation in their local authority area every five years, that they must then draw up a building programme and that they are empowered to provide accommodation under that programme.  Under the 1966 Act the local authority are required to have a scheme of letting priorities.  In this <Col N="230" /> scheme they must take account of certain statutory objectives which include the very relevant cases of unfit housing and overcrowding but our housing code does not preclude other special cases and in particular we have the provision which has been operated by our local authorities for many years now whereby there is the provision of some 10 per cent of housing accommodation for the elderly and the disabled.</P>
    <P>What we require in regard to the housing of homeless persons is a further movement in this direction.  It is true to say that some homeless persons are being housed under our housing code and schemes and under the housing operations of our local authorities at the moment.  The number is certainly not as high as the 10 per cent allowance for the elderly and the disabled and is somewhere between 1 and 2 per cent of all our housing applicants.  What we have to see is a very considerable shift in that percentage.</P>
    <P>If we take the key provisions which are in Senator Ryan's Bill, a key definition in section 4 and the statutory duty under section 6, there is a very real danger of distorting the whole housing code and of establishing a position whereby the very deserving persons who he hopes to benefit under this Bill will be displacing from housing those who are at present living in unfit housing and those who are subject to serious overcrowding.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, we have to distinguish clearly in this discussion between the nature of the Bill we have before us and the nature of the problem it attempts to solve.  Nobody is satisfied with the present position.  That is clear from the debate we have had in this House.  One of the most unsatisfactory things has been the degree of confusion in regard to the position of the homeless. There is the provision under section 54 of the Health Act, 1953 whereby the health authority have an obligation to provide shelter and temporary accommodation for the homeless.  This particular provision has given rise to quite a degree of confusion and diversity in practice, something which was most undesirable. <Col N="231" /> It is all to the good that we did have the <i>ad hoc</i> committee dealing with this particular problem which reported in December last and which certainly gave in its guidelines a basis for the removal of this confusion.</P>
    <P>I would like to say in regard to this report it is perhaps a pity that the report was not publicised to a greater extent than it was.  People like Senator Brendan Ryan and Senator FitzGerald who were interested in this question were aware of the existence of this report but I think most Members of this House were probably unaware that this particular work had been completed and that this report had been published.  I understand it was available on application to the Department of Health but I think most Members of the House are hard put to get through the things that come across their desks and sift through them to see what is useful and they are not inclined to go seeking out material which is available in Government Departments and of which they have not heard.  If this report had been circulated to Members of the House they would immediately have spotted it as something important, something, indeed, highly relevant to the work of the House in regard to the discussion of this Private Members' Bill and in regard to the discussion of the Minister's Bill which we hope to have before us very shortly. I would say that while Members of the House like myself may well have been remiss in our duty in that we did not go searching out this report which would be helpful to us in discharging our work as Senators, I do feel also that the Department of Health, perhaps, should have been aware of the fact that we had a Bill before us and that this was something which should have been automatically circulated to Members of the Seanad and in that way brought clearly to their notice.</P>
    <P>The real difficulty I have in regard to Senator Brendan Ryan's Bill is in regard to the obligation to house this particular group which, apparently, is an essential part of his Bill.  If it were not an essential <Col N="232" /> part of his Bill, if it were something that could be removed on Committee Stage, then my mind certainly would be far more open to the Bill as it stands.  Imposing an obligation to house one particular group in a statutory fashion above and beyond the duties in regard to other groups who have solid claims to be considered for housing is undesirable.  I do not think that this can be considered in isolation.  I think in fact that the Minister was right in considering that the matter should be dealt with in the context of a general revision of the housing code but, as I said earlier, I think it was a pity that the Department were not able to come forward earlier. Having said that, I am quite conscious that the Minister and his legal staff, which is not large, have been involved in urgent legislation in other areas and I am glad that, indeed, they are now dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>One of the features in Senator Ryan's Bill which is entirely commendable, is in section 5 in dealing with inquiries.  I should like to say that I think it is terribly important that all of our local authorities should be fully informed in regard to the extent of the problem of homelessness in their areas.  There has been a tendency in the past for the health authority on one hand, the housing authority on the other hand, not to consider this as being completely their problem and not to be making themselves fully aware.  These statutory authorities must make themselves fully aware and, having made themselves aware, they should make the public aware of the exact position in regard to groups such as the homeless in their statutory areas.  If we can get information here it will help movement forward but, once again, there should not be any delay in regard to movement while we are waiting for further information. The Bill is useful in that it has concentrated our minds on this problem.  The <i>ad hoc</i> report has been extremely useful in so far as it has laid down guidelines, as it has, for local authorities and for health boards in regard to the responsibility for the accommodation of homeless persons and for the manner in which these duties may be carried out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> Finally, I would say that I trust that it will only be a matter of weeks before the Minister's Bill is circulated.  This House, then being fully informed of the alternative proposals of Senator Ryan and of the Government, will be able to discuss this matter and come to a conclusion so that further time is not lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I should like to say that I always find it very difficult to argue with the reasoning of Professor Dooge. However, I might say since he was speaking in the context of what exists and what has happened in the lifetime of various Governments with regard to housing advancement and the difficulties that confront us because of previous decisions and so on, that it is not possible to go into the broader concept.  It has to go on the record of this House that it is a ringing condemnation of the society we live in in this day and age that we actually have to be talking about the question of homeless people.  Senator Lanigan spoke about emigration and so on.  I did not see the relevance of that because emigration is not a new thing.  It existed in my time.  I could not understand the relevance in that sense.  What was more puzzling was that he seemed to suggest that in preparing any legislation we must have accommodation to suit people who may be squatting in London.  I could not follow the reasoning in that.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment Senator Ryan on bringing this Bill before the House.  Senator Lanigan felt we were going through an exercise, that the Bill would not be voted through and that the debate was a sham.  I do not think that is the case at all, to be quite frank.  From the very beginning all Labour Senators were very enthusiastic about this Bill. That is the factual situation and coupled with that is the fact that the Minister said today that the total debate on the legislation is not complete.  More discussion will take place later and, therefore, the contributions today are very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned it is the duty of the State to protect the rights of all of us, but it is essential that the most <Col N="234" /> deprived must be seen to be protected in the first instance from the effects of any difficulties they are confronted with.  In the case of the homeless there is no category in the country more vulnerable.  We can in fact argue that the term, &ldquo;the most deprived&rdquo; covers many people but the ultimate in being deprived is to be homeless. The extraordinary thing about all this is that it is not new.  It is, and has been, a feature of our society for as long as most of us can remember.  I should just like to give my experience of it.  In my time living in the Dublin tenements, the homeless were helped by a more charitable society in the sense that other deprived people living in the tenements actually provided what were called lobbies for them.  Lobbies were the landings in the houses.  The tenants provided the people who were very badly off with some sort of covering at night.  There might be four landings in a tenement house and one person was facilitated on each landing. Somebody would stitch together a number of flour bags, and that was used as a cover.  In the morning the homeless got a cup of tea, bread and margarine.</P>
    <P>That was the charity of the day.  It is nothing new to talk about the homeless in this society, but nothing strong enough has been done over the years to help them, irrespective of the differences that may arise with regard to whether a person wants to be housed.  There may be people who do not want to be housed and want the freedom to be out all day.  The very principle of homelessness is something that has been with society for a long time. We cannot make the excuse that we did not have the time.  We had plenty of time.  Some of us may have run into more difficult circumstances than others when trying to deal with the problem but we had plenty of time.</P>
    <P>The position now is that the tenements are gone.  Many years ago some homeless people slept in stables where there were a lot of horses.  The owner of the stable provided the straw, and that helped the homeless.  That type of help has gone. Even in the old days nothing drastic was done to bring about a solution to the problem.  In relatively good times, when <Col N="235" /> the cost involved would have been small and the numbers less having regard to the population and the extent of emigration, nothing was done.  There was a good opportunity to deal with the problem in general housing programmes in relatively good times but that did not happen.  I never suggested at any time that the tenements were adequate but they were a help.  They were a means for the poor to help the poor.  Certainly, it was not the case of the rich helping the poor.</P>
    <P>I am also critical of the fact that the Church &mdash; in recent times they may have been much more helpful &mdash; who had all the necessary means to secure a proper end to the problem of the homeless people did not do much.  The Church seeks proper ends in a lot of other things but one wonders where the homeless fit in their proper ends.  My criticism would be unfair if I did not recognise the fact that the religious societies in general have been providing meals and some shelters for the homeless.  That charity is very noble and welcome.  I am concerned about the natural right of the homeless. I do not remember, ever in my lifetime, except the odd reference in an encyclical, any passionate pleas from the pulpit that the homeless be housed or that it was immoral not to house them.  In my own simple logic I could not understand that, and I still cannot understand it.</P>
    <P>The State must have regard to a moral situation and the fact that the moral law is being broken when we do not provide in a society of plenty homeless people with good accommodation.  To deprive people of a home is a breach of a natural right.  I hope that the Minister's Bill, despite the difficulties that exist, will tackle the problem.  When the Government consider the issue the debate that is taking place in the House should help Ministers deal with the question.  The problem should be tackled despite the difficulties with regard to local government reform and so on.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party were very enthusiastic about the Bill.  Even if we do not welcome it as an end in itself, we certainly have to go with it as a means to an end. <Col N="236" /> We may feel that it is not possible to get everything set out in the Bill or meet all demands but, nevertheless, we are enthusiastic about it.  We are very enthusiastic about it for the reason that it embodies the principle of what a caring society should do for the most deprived.</P>
    <P>I see an urgent need for temporary measures although that may not please Senator Ryan.  If we do not get much further with the Bill we will still have by highlighting the need for some sort of contingency arrangements to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the Minister's difficulty with the number of people on the housing waiting lists and the prospect of accusations of queue jumping, but that does not, and never did, in the minds of Labour Senators prevent a Labour Minister having a look at how the best possible results for the homeless can be achieved. We are delighted Senator Ryan brought the Bill forward.  I do not believe all the problems can be solved.  I do not think legislation remedies a problem to the full extent although it makes the problem less acute.  On the other hand if the Bill had not been brought into the House for a full debate we might not have got very far because of the difficulties we are having with finance.  There is also the fact that the problem has become a little aggravated by the great demand for houses.  There are something like 36,000 people waiting to be housed.  We can understand the problem and the dilemma of the Minister.  It might have been easier for the Minister to introduce a Bill first proposing to accommodate the homeless rather than housing the homeless.  However, even then he would probably have had to go to outside organisations to see if they would build some sort of sheltered accommodation.  Obviously, the proposer of the Bill wants the homeless to be housed.  That is consistent with Labour Party policy.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses itself in section 4 to accommodating the homeless but section 2 means, in effect, providing accommodation as distinct from shelters.  It refers to people who are in common lodging houses, night shelters or hostels.  If one <Col N="237" /> includes children of from eight years to early teens the problem becomes more difficult for the Minister.  The real problem for the Minister is that he has to look at the situation as it is.  That should not take away from the fact that we should go on record as condemning the society we live in because it is only now that we are talking about doing something adequate to house the homeless.  There are special problems associated with this.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health will be looking at the problem with regard to young children fairly shortly.  We will have to deal urgently with housing the homeless but we must bear in mind that we cannot put teenage children who do not have parents into homes.  There is an urgency about getting homeless children off the streets and this has to be done with the aid of the appropriate caring organisations throughout the country.  We must also consider the question of the adults who sleep rough.  I do not know how long it will take before the Minister circulates his proposals, but the matter is urgent and I would stress to the Minister that it is important that the matter is not allowed drag on too long.  In fact, in the not too distant future we should be speaking again of the problem of the homeless people.  I am talking about homeless people who are in hostels and common lodging houses.  I am sure the house is unanimous about this.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in accommodating children and taking them off the streets, will have to ascertain if they are on the run from home, if they belong to families and, if so, do the families want to give them up, or were they put out by their parents who were unable to cope with them.  It must be ascertained if the parents want their children housed away from home.  I am referring to this in the social context rather than in the context of suggesting that children of the type I have described should be put into houses. We cannot talk about housing the homeless unless we take in the broader aspect of the whole question of homelessness.</P>
    <P>The question of queue jumping will have to be taken into account when housing the homeless.  For example we must <Col N="238" /> consider the case of people who declare themselves homeless because of an angry mother.  There may be a family dispute because a person was not employed. Those people may be inclined to throw themselves out on the streets and seek help from the local authorities.  That is another form of queue jumping.  It is queue jumping in an indirect way because a person could not tolerate the conditions under which he or she was living any longer.  I am aware of cases where people who could not get assistance were expected by their mothers to hand up money no matter where it came from.  In such situations people may find themselves on the streets.  If they are over 21 years of age they will be looking for rights whether they are married or single.</P>
    <P>The sentiments and compassion expressed in the Bill must be greatly appreciated.  There must be an understanding of the problems facing the Minister on this matter, as it is not easy to find a solution to this tragic situation. It may sound contradictory to say that society should listen to the ringing condemnation of itself and at the same time say that I appreciate the difficulties of the Minister.  I do not see any contradiction there.  The Minister is presented with difficulties and he has to live with the situation he finds himself in.  Therefore, I have the greatest of sympathy for him. At the same time we cannot make excuses for not introducing the right type of legislation to alleviate this problem to the maximum extent.  No authority, or politician, can ignore the fact that people have to sleep on the Custom House steps with a newspaper under and over them or sleep on the Mardyke covered by newspapers.  Nobody can take pride in the fact that in 1985 we have homeless people.  If it were not for the parapets of the Custom House and some slight sheltered areas of the Mardyke walk, we would be in a lot more trouble.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, there are people who want to be free from living in a house and we cannot legislate for people to go into a house if they do not want to do so.  However, we can give them the opportunity to get on to the <Col N="239" /> housing list.  We can encourage as many people as possible to come off the streets. It may be that some of these people abhor the whole concept of sleeping rough, but, gradually, tolerate it.  In the final analysis we cannot force such people to live in a house.  We can only introduce the provisions for them to apply for a house.  If the housing situation improves priority should be given to housing those with a serious sickness.</P>

      <P>That paragraph 1 of the Orders of Reference of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, constituted pursuant to the Order of Dáil Éireann of 21st June, 1983, and the Order of Seanad Éireann of 29th June, 1983, be amended by the deletion of all words after `Bodies)' where it first occurs and the substitution therefor of the following:&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> I should like to explain to the House that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, had hoped to be present in order to speak on this motion.  As Senators are aware, it was his initiative in Government that led to the setting up of the various committees. Unfortunately something arose at the last moment and he is unable to be present. I would like the indulgence of the House, in moving this motion, to read the speech which Minister Bruton had prepared. What I have to say will be said not merely on my authority as Leader of the House but also on the authority of members of the Government.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State, the State bodies have been a major source of commercial and entrepreneurial innovation in our economic and industrial development. They have, however, been subject to growing criticism in recent years for a variety of reasons, principally because of the overall deterioration in their financial performance.  In addition, in recent times some costly investment errors have been made by State bodies and in certain cases charges are excessive for the services which they provide.  As announced in the White Paper on Industrial Policy published last year, the Government are concerned at these developments and are anxious that the State bodies should re-establish themselves as a source of strength to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>In view of the diversity of their activities and the varying reasons for their incorporation into the State sector, not enough serious attention has been devoted to developing a properly structured relationship between the State bodies and central Government.  <i>Ad hoc</i> arrangements have continued for too long and there has been insufficient attention to developing the optimum procedures to facilitate the successful development of these bodies.  The difficulty has been to devise means of achieving a balance between the legitimate freedom of the bodies to pursue their operations within a commercial framework and the control necessary to safeguard the interests of the public to whom they are ultimately responsible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> No one would deny that the present financial position of the commercial State bodies collectively is very bad.  As in the rest of the economy, the recession and adverse cost movements have had a serious effect.  However, other factors, some of them unique to State enterprise, have contributed to the present situation.</P>
    <P>These factors include:</P>
    <P>(1)  lack of clarity in objectives, and confusion between commercial, social or strategic roles, particularly where questions of closures or cessation of operations arise;</P>
    <P>(2)  imposition of non-commercial obligations or arbitrary tax and price adjustments on products or services provided by State bodies;</P>
    <P>(3)  inadequate surveillance and control in relation to matters such as major capital projects and refinancing;</P>
    <P>(4)  an expectation by boards, management and employees that Government would be obliged in practice to bail out various enterprises, and honour their debts, and that market disciplines would not apply;</P>
    <P>(5)  undercapitalisation, and excessive reliance on guaranteed borrowing; and</P>
    <P>(6)  lack of capacity to adapt quickly enough away from wrong product or market situations.</P>
    <P>Whatever the causes of the problems that have arisen, the Government are determined to bring about a major improvement in the performance of the commercial State bodies and a continuing reassessment of their operations in the national interest.</P>
    <P>As detailed in the White Paper on Industrial Policy, a number of measures have already been introduced to ensure immediate improvements in the commercial performance of the State bodies. These measures include:</P>
    <P>(i)  The introduction of Corporate Planning: To ensure that the bodies become more commercially orientated, they have been directed to draw <Col N="242" /> up five year &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; corporate plans in respect of their activities.  These plans are designed to provide an outline of corporate objectives, the strategies which are being adopted and the detailed programmes to achieve those objectives.  In addition, projected production targets and cost reduction programmes will be required on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Improved monitoring of the State bodies by central Government: The Government have also decided that the arrangements for reporting on the performance by each commercial State body should be reviewed by the relevant Minister with a view to increasing their effectiveness.  The new arrangements will include the submission of regular reports dealing with financial and trading particulars, production levels and actual performance against targets.</P>
    <P>(iii)  New measures to improve the procedures for appointments to the boards of the State bodies: The recent history of our commercial State bodies suggests that, in many cases, boards have been less than successful in their policy and supervisory roles.  The reasons for this are many.  They can include such factors as lack of appropriate expertise and insufficient in-depth attention by directors to their duties. There may be in some instances an attitude of mind that board appointments are essentially honorary, or there may be lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise on behalf of the Minister that these criticisms must not be taken as referring to all directors.  He readily acknowledges the dedicated service which has been given by many eminent individuals from the business world who have been prepared to act as directors of State bodies in the national interest, notwithstanding the modest remuneration involved.</P>
    <P>The Government have been very anxious to do something practical to bring a greater degree of professionalism into <Col N="243" /> the appointments procedure and general practice governing the boards of State bodies.  In the White Paper on Industrial Policy, a number of decisions were announced to strengthen the boards of commercial State bodies.  Board members will in future be selected to more properly reflect the type of skills and expertise required by each body and will also have their role and responsibilities more clearly defined.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Monitoring and control of investments: New measures are also being introduced to prevent a repeat of the cost overruns of recent years. A more systematic approach is being adopted in appraising capital projects and improved project management techniques are being applied.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation will also have an important role in co-ordinating and harnessing the entrepreneurial initiative and expertise that lies within the commercial State bodies with a view to developing new employment &mdash; creating projects and product ideas.  The State bodies will be encouraged through the NDC to explore new viable commercial business opportunities, either under their own ownership or in joint ventures with other publicly or privately owned companies.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant developments in recent years as far as increased control and review of the commercial State-sponsored bodies in concerned was the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies in 1976.  The Oireachtas has a legislative role relating to the formal establishment of nearly all the commercial State bodies and the Ministers responsible are answerable to it for the overall policies and operations of the bodies.  Furthermore, the Oireachtas has the right to debate the policies of the State bodies but, in practice, this has usually been limited to debates on Bills relating to the bodies in question.  The establishment of the joint committee, however, heralded an increasing awareness on the part of the <Col N="244" /> Houses of the Oireachtas of the activities of the State bodies.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that the original committee, which produced 18 reports on individual bodies before it lapsed in 1981, played a very useful role in provoking both public and parliamentary interest and debate on the State-sponsored sector.  However, the terms of reference of that committee, as in the case of the new Committee on Commercial State Bodies established in 1983, restricted its role to an examination of the past performance of State bodies.  Moreover, the committee concentrated on specific bodies and, in these cases, essentially on their activities and financial results.  Very little attention was given to broader areas affecting the role of these bodies.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that a general review of the commercial State bodies is necessary and have, therefore, decided that the committee's mandate should be extended to enable them to use their experience in a more constructive manner.  The extended terms of reference, as proposed by this motion, will empower the committee to examine the common issues relating to board responsibility, the structure and organisation, accountability and financing, and relationship with central Government and the Oireachtas of the State bodies covered by the committee's existing remit.  The committee will of course, also be empowered to report and, where appropriate, make recommendations on these issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister would like to take this opportunity to commend the committee for their work which, he believes, will be even more valuable and constructive with their extended terms of reference.  The Minister is confident that given the right framework and the right people the commercial State-sponsored bodies can have a major beneficial influence on the future performance and direction of the economy.</P>
    <P>May I, having given Senators the views of the Minister, say that I entirely support these views, that I think this committee and the other committees have got off to a very good start and I think that the <Col N="245" /> amendment of the terms of reference that are being proposed now will in fact improve that performance.  Accordingly, I commend the change in the terms of reference to the House.</P>

      <P>Before making my comments could I seek some clarification about the intentions of the Minister today?  I am glad to see that in the last paragraph of his speech, which Senator Dooge has read on the Minister's behalf, he commends the work of the committee. I, as a member of the committee, in common with members from both Houses, have invested a considerable amount of time in the work of this committee. The very minimum we would be entitled to is a ministerial presence.  If the Minister himself cannot be present why is his Minister of State not here?</P>

      <P>Is it implied in what Senator Dooge said that whatever has prevented the Minister from being present is actually more important than taking a debate in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas?  I pose that by way of a question.  I sympathise with Senator Dooge because he has always exercised considerable care in trying to uphold the status of the House by ensuring a ministerial presence.  I find it inexplicable that there is no Minister here today, especially given the fact that the Minister concerned, Deputy Bruton, initiated these committees, for which Senator Dooge has rightly commended him.  Now we have a very important procedural change in the terms of reference of the committee which I might say follows the comprehensive case put to the Minister to expand our terms of reference.  Why is he not here to take the debate?  To whom am I making the point?</P>

      <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies I welcome the extension of the terms of reference to common issues relating to a number of areas of concern to these bodies.  The commercial State-sponsored bodies which are the subject of examination by the committee are owned by the State, controlled by the Government and, should they incur losses, the taxpayer carries the can. Therefore it is only right and proper that an Oireachtas Committee should examine these bodies to try to ensure that they are run efficiently and in the best interest of the State and, of course, the taxpayer. I would stress at this stage that our work is not a witch hunt.  It is an objective assessment of these bodies in order to ensure that they do a better job where improvement is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooge, on behalf of the Minister, made a comprehensive speech and covered a considerable amount of ground, including board responsibility. There was reference in his speech to the question of the objectives of these bodies. It is vital that the objectives of State-sponsored bodies be clarified and reviewed at regular intervals.  In our report on Irish Shipping Ltd. we recommended that the objectives of State-sponsored bodies be reviewed every three years and that such reviews be included in the annual reports.  It is of key importance obviously to clarify what business these bodies are in.  In the case of Irish <Col N="249" /> Shipping it was founded to meet the strategic tonnage required in war time conditions. But it drifted a long way from that. On the question of objectives, I would raise the question as to whether Irish Shipping should have been in long term charters at all.  A State-owned body founded with the central objective of meeting the strategic tonnage required in war time conditions was latterly heavily engaged in transporting goods between foreign ports.  The original objective we were told in evidence, was not reviewed for 21 years.  Yet when Irish Shipping were liquidated the Irish taxpayer picked up the tab.  The review of objectives is vital.  We have recommended it in the Irish Shipping report for general application. I am pleased to see it in the Minister's opening speech.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to the question of the appointment of directors to the boards of these bodies.  They are political appointments.  In most instances the appointees have given sterling service.  I want to make a plea to all political parties that only the best qualified people should be appointed to these boards in terms of their skills and their expertise.  If we are going to attract the best people to these boards we have to do two things.  We have to appeal to their sense of public service and we have to pay them.  The Minister refers to the modest remuneration. Something should be done about that.  Many are serving on these boards for a net sum of £300 a year.  Obviously that is entirely inadequate and in no way matches the demands placed on them by these boards.</P>
    <P>On the question of control of State-sponsored bodies, I worked for seven years in two of these bodies before I joined the staff of UCD.  I would be the first to defend their right of control over day to day matters.  But when substantial policy changes are made, or substantial capital expenditure is incurred, then there is an obvious obligation on these State-sponsored bodies to inform the relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>There have been over-runs on capital expenditure which have been referred to <Col N="250" /> in the Minister's speech.  The joint committee have reported on OIE and Irish Shipping Ltd.  In the case of OIE, there was a sixfold overrun in what turned out to be a disastrous investment decision &mdash; the hotel in Belfast.  Six times the sum approved by the relevant Department was actually spent on that.  Obviously there is a need for tightening up on capital expenditure.  The board of OIE should have been on the alert and reported to the Department.  But equally the Department should have been on the alert to ensure that they were getting relevant information quickly.  There are then two sides to the control problem.</P>
    <P>Again, in the case of Irish Shipping Ltd. there was a substantial increase in long term charters at the wrong time. The board did not inform the relevant Department of these particular decisions which proved disastrous &mdash; I use the term used by the Minister for Communications last year in connection with these charters.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the question of balance between, one the one hand, bureaucratic interference, which may stifle the operation of these bodies and, on the other hand, accountability to the shareholders and ultimately to the public and the taxpayer.  This is a difficult balance to achieve.  If the measures in the Minister's speech are implemented, then there should be progress in achieving that particular balance.  Let me return to the question of expertise.  The Minister has highlighted the importance of appointing people with appropriate expertise to State bodies.  My concern is that if these well qualified boards put forward proposals to the relevant Department is the staffing and expertise present in the Civil Service to evaluate these proposals?  Perhaps the Minister will pick up that question in reply.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to appoint better qualified people to the boards of State-sponsored bodies who in turn are expected to report to the relevant Departments so that their proposals and performance can be evaluated.  But it is absolutely essential that the relevant expertise be available in the Government <Col N="251" /> Departments properly to appraise and evaluate the proposals and results put to them.  Civil servants, for the most part, are highly competent people.  Some of the proposals put forward by these State bodies are highly technical and highly complicated.  Unless something is done either by training civil servants or employing consultants to evaluate the proposals, it is too much to expect, given the Civil Service pattern of experience that we have had in the past, to cope with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, perhaps the Minister will indicate whether he is satisfied that there is adequate expertise available to evaluate the various proposals from the wide range of State-sponsored bodies, in the course of his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want now to refer to the question of guaranteed borrowings.  This is an appropriate time to look at several aspects of State-sponsored bodies.  The Minister in his speech has gone quite a distance in looking at various facets of their operation and what might be done for improvement. Many of these State companies are starved for equity capital.  It has been an easier option for successive Governments to guarantee borrowings to these bodies rather than face the more difficult decision of providing the necessary equity capital.  One consequence that flows from this is that financially these bodies are in a weaker position because they do not have the necessary capital base.  Furthermore, financial institutions in the past have had no difficulty lending money to State bodies because they have got a State guarantee.  In other words they do not feel obliged to adopt the same rigorous criteria in evaluating requests for loans from these organisations as they would in the case of ordinary commercial institutions.  After all, a loss-making company cannot service borrowings, so it is a question of adequate equity capital which <Col N="252" /> needs to be addressed.  Again, I would like to hear the Minister's view on that. I view guaranteed borrowings as a short-term device to get State-sponsored bodies over financial difficulties in a limited period.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the remuneration of chief executives.  The Devlin controls are inadequate for the recruitment and the retention of these chief executives.  Many of them obviously are highly competent people but since they do not get anything like salaries comparable to their opposite numbers in the private sector there is the obvious temptation for them to leave. There is some movement in relation to the Devlin controls in regard to remunerating chief executives.  Something positive needs to be done quickly in that direction.  Furthermore, chief executives should have bonus schemes or a range of incentives to encourage them to improve their performance.

      <P>I just went on the Minister's earlier view that he was here as Leader of the Dáil.  I have read the Minister's speech carefully, but quite frankly I find it difficult to have confidence in the proposals put forward in his speech because of the experience we have had on the joint committee in recent months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will elaborate, Minister, in a moment.  The joint committee have had two recent body blows to their work.  The first one relates to Irish Shipping.  We had put many months of work into that report.  It was nearing completion before the Government's decision <Col N="253" /> to liquidate took place.  The joint committee were not even asked to make available the fruits of their deliberations before the Government decided to liquidate the company.  We view our work as a valuable input into Government policy-making. We felt that the contents of our draft report would have been a very valuable contribution to the policy decision whether to liquidate or not.</P>
      <P>We took this matter up subsequently with the Minister for Communications and the word we got back was that there was no insult intended: it was just an oversight.  There was no calculated intention to by-pass the committee's work.  We accepted that at the time.  A matter of weeks later, however we had the RTE affair.  I was on an earlier joint committee that reported on RTE comprehensively in 1981.  The logic to our appointment of consultants to RTE in the recent past was to update the report that we produced in 1981.  The reply of the Minister for Communications at the time was that the consultants were engaged in mere desk research and it was not as comprehensive as what he envisaged. That is plainly not so.  The committee decided to get an update on the comprehensive report on RTE that was produced in 1981.  I was a member of the earlier committee, and that is why I have first-hand knowledge of it.  I found the Minister for Communication's explanation at the time a spurious one and his appointment of consultants was merely, a mechanism to delay the appointment of the new director general until such time as he could appoint a new Authority. We are taking our work on the joint committee very seriously, all 11 of us, and invest many hours on it.  We found that our work in relation to Irish Shipping, and RTE was very adversely affected by ministerial action.  We felt rather badly about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has referred extensively to the White Paper on Industrial Policy in his speech.  That White Paper says that the chairman of a State-sponsored body will be consulted about appointments and reappointments to the board.  How do we reconcile that with the statement by the <Col N="254" /> former chairman of B &amp; I that he was not consulted about the appointment of a new chairman?  Why was the White Paper, which is referred to extensively in the Minister's speech today not actually implemented in the case of B &amp; I?  I want to add that I happen to know Mr. Alex Spain, the new executive chairman and I wish him well.  He is a man of exceptional competence and I am sure he will do a very good job.  That, however, is a little beside the point that I am making.  I am concerned about how seriously are we to take the ideas in the Minister's speech and how seriously are we to take the points relevant to our work as a joint committee which are contained in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to Bord na Móna, another that is on our designated list for examination.  There are two vacancies on that board and they have had no chairman for several months.  I suggest that the absence of these board members, and in particular of a chairman, cannot help the decision-making process of the board.  I am not expecting the Minister to be able to answer me here on the spot but I would like him to get an answer from his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Energy, who has not filled these board vacancies.  We can talk all we like about board members and their expertise and about the behaviour of boards and of civil servants, but the Minister for Energy has direct responsibility for these board appointments. I look forward to the Minister's reply.  Thank you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to welcome this presentation by the Minister. I would agree with it for the most part.  I welcome the statement that the Government are determined to bring about a major improvement in the performance of semi-State bodies and a continuing reassessment of their operations in the national interest.  That statement is very valid and a very important statement to make.  As I am a member of the State-sponsored bodies committee I would agree with quite a number of points that Professor Hillery made.  I <Col N="255" /> would possibly disagree with his interpretation of the Telefís Éireann situation. I would welcome the Government's position in that regard, that they are putting in a top management consultancy team to examine the work of Radio Telefís Éireann.  The cost of that consultancy proposition alone would probably run into many hundreds of thousands.  We in the State-sponsored bodies committee would not have that money available to us.  I welcome the fact that the Government are going to do it.  We are setting about having a certain investigation but not to the extent that the Government contemplate.</P>
      <P>I would agree totally with Senator Hillery in the case of Irish Shipping.  In that case we spent many days and months investigating Irish Shipping.  We were a knowledgeable body as far as Irish Shipping was concerned.  We had interviewed the board and had interviewed many of the unions attached to Irish Shipping so that we were in a very strong position to advise the Minister as to what course of action should be taken in that case.  We were disappointed naturally that we were not involved and the Minister subsequently indicated that possibly one of the reasons that he could not involve us was because of the situation of Irish Shipping going into liquidation.  Possibly we would have accepted that but we had done an immense amount of work in Irish Shipping and that work should have been acknowledged.  As far as Irish Shipping are concerned we had much to say.  The Minister made a mistake by not involving the committee before making that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree totally with the Minister when he talks about the clarity of the objects clause.  There is massive confusion as far as the objects clause is concerned. Take, for example, Irish Shipping; it should be involved in shipping. It was involved in property, shipping, insurance and it had involvement in many other areas which were totally alien to shipping.  The same could be said about CIE.  They were involved in hotels and transport.  I would agree totally with <Col N="256" /> the statement on capital projects that the matter should be controlled properly.  We asked the Chairman of CIE, Liam St. John Devlin, to account for the loss of £10 million in the hotels and why CIE got involved in leasing massive areas instead of getting involved in capital projects and why the Minister had not been consulted. His explanation was that his terms of reference did not cover leasing: that he could lease what he liked and did not have to ask for permission.  When talking about capital projects one should also talk about leasing, because it is an area in which people in semi-State bodies seem to be able to get around the law.</P>
    <P>The other case which we investigated was Údarás na Gaeltachta.  We find that they were involved in carpets, computers, farming, engineering and financing. What expertise did they have that they could cover such a variety of subjects? This I cannot understand.  In the same way we have argued that Allied Irish Banks were involved in banking and we wondered why they should get involved in an insurance company, seeing they knew nothing at all about it.  We see the massive implications for this Government from the fact that they did get involved in insurance.  They even admitted themselves that they were not capable of assessing the company.  If so, why did they get into it in the first place?</P>
    <P>The object of semi-State bodies is that there is an expertise available there.  It should be related to specific areas where the terms of reference apply.  For example, CIE should not have got involved in hotels but in transport and Irish Shipping should deal with shipping and not something else.  The commercial State-sponsored bodies committee were told by a senior director that he had met seven Ministers in the last four years and that we were just a passing phase and would go away and did not really matter.  He was probably right, because it did not really matter what we had said to him: he would just continue on his merry way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he say that on the record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="257" />
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he said it.  It was on the CIE hotels; it was the first statement I heard, that we did not really matter. What we need is some kind of permanent body to monitor semi-State bodies so that there would be a continuation irrespective of elections, of people to monitor their activity and they would know that.</P>
      <P>I think this proposal does not go far enough.  We had a major problem with Irish Shipping when we asked for certain directors to come before the committee on State-sponsored bodies and they refused.  We should have had the law on our side and been able to <i>subpoena</i> people to come before us and they should be accountable.  These people had put a very good company into liquidation. They were free outside there and we had no power to bring them before us.  We asked for that permission and we asked them in many ways to come before us and they refused.  One man said he was on holidays and when asked again he said he would be in England for the next week.  We could not get him to be accountable to the people for the affairs of that company.</P>
      <P>I would agree with the Minister when he states that accounts should be produced, and I believe these should be presented at regular intervals.  I cannot see any reason why the Minister cannot get a statement every month of the sales, profit, current assets and current liability situation, the amount of money spent on capital expenditure, their projections and any anticipated problems.  This can be produced on one page.  It does not need a massive amount of statistics to obtain this type of information.  I believe the year for all semi-State bodies ends on 31 December.  All audited accounts should be done by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There is no reason why this cannot be done.  For example, in Údarás we had the Comptroller and Auditor General auditing the accounts and we had individual accountants auditing all their individual companies, but also at different times in the year.  This is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the Comptroller and Auditor <Col N="258" /> General a team of accountants and management consultants should be available to him so that he can perform these audits.  The relationship between the Minister and the committee should be strengthened.  We were all agreed on that, including the Minister, I think. There was talk earlier that the chairman of the State-sponsored bodies committee would get the status of a junior Minister and be upgraded.  This seems to have subsided.  This would be a boost for the committee.  It would be a recognition of what the committee does.  It would be a very important step in the right direction, to give it that status.  I would agree with the situation regarding the appointment of boards, that board members should be appointed on the basis of the proper qualifications.</P>
    <P>When boards make a bad decision they should be made accountable and the Minister should ask for their total resignation. The boards seem to do what they wish and the terms of reference are wide open so that they can do what they wish. The time for that is gone.  Management of semi-State bodies is crucial.  We have seen what happened in Irish Shipping where a manager could bind a company and the State into massive contracts.  This is totally out of order and should be rectified.</P>
    <P>We have carried out, as Senator Hillery has rightly said, various investigations. Our investigations should be shorter.  Previously there was a policy whereby one would investigate Radio Telefís Éireann or CIE and so on over a year or a year and a half and produce a long document which nobody ever read or cared about.  Once it is finished, the semi-State bodies themselves say: &ldquo;That is the end of that: We will not see these people for another ten years.&rdquo;  What we should be doing as a semi-State body committee is examining, on a frequent basis, aspects of a company.  We have the expertise on that committee.  I am proud to serve on that committee.  We have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I believe it results from inexperience, because the longer we live the more we begin to realise that nothing should surprise.  If I were in the business of being surprised the absolute brilliance of this Government in convincing the people of what they want them to believe would register very high on whatever barometer was used to measure my condition.  I am amazed and astounded, which are much stronger terms than &ldquo;surprised.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Some of my very erudite friends tell me that theorems which we accepted some time back are now being questioned. One of them is that of the straight line.  I was taught and I think we were all taught, that a straight line is the shortest distance between any two points.  Apparently that is being questioned now, although is it very difficult to accept that it could be otherwise.  It is no more difficult than to accept the reasoning behind the actions and the decisions of this Government in many areas, for example in Irish Shipping, the Director-General for the RTE authority, the health cuts, the unemployment situation, B &amp; I, the roads and the national debt.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a very spirited defence when he spoke in the House on the last occasion but I must confess that I did not hear him too well. I must admit that that may be more my problem than the Minister's fault, but I did say that to one of my colleagues and <Col N="261" /> he said: &ldquo;If you were Minister for the Environment would you not be inaudible if you were trying to defend the indefensible, the situation in the construction industry?&rdquo;  No matter from which side we speak, I think we must admit the Minister has nothing to crow about.</P>
      <P>This Government have no answer to the charge with regard to the situation in the construction industry, and people who accept what is thrown out would believe black is white.  I, in my time, never saw the situation as bad, and those who are much longer involved than I am tell me that they never saw things as bad in their lifetime.  Big firms have gone to the wall all over and in addition small firms, the backbone of the industry, have broken up, many of them small family units where the leader of the group worked hard and had gathered around him a nucleus of craftsmen, skilled people.  Many of these are broken up. The appalling thing about it is that the Government apparently have no intention of trying to improve the situation. All the indications are that they have no intention.  People were looking to this year 1985 as the turning point, but the increased VAT has prevented all that.  It reduces the value of provisions in the public capital programme, for example for every £1 million to build roads, there is included £100,000 VAT or £50,000 more than last year.  The Government did not adjust the public capital programme, so the actual amount is 5 per cent less.</P>
      <P>On page 166 of the programme there is an amount of £1,227 million set aside for the building industry, but 5 per cent VAT takes about £27.6 million out of the industry and out of this figure, and this is taken out of the housing and building loans and grants making up about 45 per cent of the amount that would be affected, and I think this is being generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now because of the increased 5 per cent VAT the Government increased the grant from £1,000 first to £1,750 and finally to £2,000.  This £1,000 grant was introduced on 26 May, 1977.  At that time the national house building cost index <Col N="262" /> stood at 147.4 and now the index is 387.8. That was the position on 1 April.  On those figures alone, to take into consideration the increase in costs, the grant, to retain the same value, would have to be increased to £2,630.  Increasing the grant to £2,000 leaves it away behind what it should be.</P>
    <P>First time buyers, as has already been pointed out, are the only ones who benefit from this increased grant, and they make up only 60 per cent of the new house market, so that 40 per cent will have to pay the full increase.  In 1984 house completions dropped by 1,194.  In 1980 the total number of houses completed was 27,785; in 1981 it was 28,917; in 1982 it was 26,798; in 1983 it was 26,138; in 1984 it was 24,944 and falling all the time.  I admit, as has been pointed out already that local authority houses showed an increase to 7,000.</P>
    <P>The national plan, on page 113, paragraph 5.85 states that the target would be 6,000 local authority houses per year, which will be a further drop of 1,000 houses.  This 5 per cent extra VAT will average about £1,000 per local authority house.  The extra VAT must have a dramatic effect on the private sector.  We must be talking about a total of 23,000 houses for this year.  That is below the 1973 level of 24,660.  The only other comparable year was 1976 when the number of houses completed was 24,000.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out already that concrete blocks were brought down to a VAT rate of 10 per cent and anything at 35 per cent was taken down to 23 per cent.  This is welcome but it must have an impact in boosting the black economy because the legal builder is less competitive now than before the budget.  Many builders were caught in the situation where the money was outstanding at 1 May.  They will have to bear the extra 5 per cent themselves.  There is an encouragement too, to have houses completed by direct labour which I do not question, but there is a problem in relation to getting loans for houses built by direct labour where there must be professional supervision and in some cases membership of the structural guarantee scheme which is <Col N="263" /> out of the question where direct labour is employed.</P>
    <P>With regard to concrete blocks, the VAT was reduced from 23 per cent to 10 per cent.  For ready mixed concrete the VAT was increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  There is a problem in the Border areas &mdash; this problem has been there for the last six or seven years &mdash; where blocks are taken into the Republic.  At present building blocks cost in the region of £265 per 1,000 delivered.  Northern Ireland blocks delivered cost £190 per 1,000, a difference of £75 per 1,000, which is very considerable.  In some cases those blocks are taken in by unapproved roads.  One load might be delivered properly and the remainder brought into the Republic illegally.  One of the big disadvantages in this is that certified Irish cement is not being used.  This is very important.  It is a condition about which the Department of the Environment are very strict.  This situation had been brought to the attention of the Department of the Environment. We must remember that in Northern Ireland in the last ten years there was a 66 per cent grant aid for machinery.  This has now been withdrawn.  In that situation there was no way that blocks could be produced in the Republic at the same price as in the North of Ireland.  Some time ago in this House I raised the question of the dumping of plaster board by Spain in this country and the Minister at that time did not accept that there was dumping.  Since then the matter has been brought to the EC and a decision has been given that dumping took place.</P>

I welcome the £5,000 grant.  The people who are making use of that £5,000 grant are mostly on low incomes.  The Housing Finance Agency loan is the most attractive. <Col N="264" /> Certainly this grant will do well in the first year.  In the Dublin area there are serious problems already in that the allocation has been expended.</P>
      <P>I would like to develop that further but as my time is running short I will just refer briefly to the situation about roads which has already been discussed.  In County Meath 56 workers were let go in January, the first time in living memory that such a situation occurred.  The permanent staff employed by Meath County Council is at its lowest limit.  It cannot go any lower without serious consequences.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the rent of local authority houses.  On page 113, paragraph 5.86 of <i>Building on Reality</i> it is stated:</P>
      <P>The average weekly rent paid by all local authority tenants in 1983 was about £7; for new lettings made that year the average rent was some £10 weekly.  Many tenants are unemployed or otherwise dependent on social welfare, but many are paying rents that are too low in relation to their incomes. The Government are satisfied that rents should be raised progressively to a level more in line with the actual costs of local authority housing.  Changes in rent levels will be made within the framework of the differential rents scheme which ensures that rents are reasonable in relation to family incomes.</P>
      <P>It seems clear from that that the rents will be increased.  I believe this has been deferred until after the forthcoming local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lastly, I would like to refer to reconstruction grants and to state that with regard to the absolute condition that houses must be inspected before work is started, this is a bureaucratic method of preventing many people from availing of the grant.  The primary function of grants should be to improve the housing stock. I know of many cases where people have been frustrated because they started work before they got approval from the Department.  I feel that a fine or a reduction in the grant should be sufficient but I think it more important to change that <Col N="265" /> condition so that an inspection would be carried out before the works are completed. If the intention of the Government is to improve the housing stock and to help people I would ask the Minister to consider making that change.</P>

      <P>I hope Senator Fitzsimons will not have trouble in hearing me.  He made some reference earlier on about something else.  I am not here to defend, I am here to inform and to try to educate the Opposition as to what the Government are doing in the whole construction area.  In his address to the House last week the Minister explained the difficult nature of the fundamental problems affecting the construction industry in recent years and the strategy being pursued by this Government to tackle the problems and to reverse the decline in output and employment and to ensure an early resumption of orderly and sustainable growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when the Government's policy in relation to the industry is being criticised, and has been deliberately misrepresented by certain sectional interests, the three broad planks of our policy for recovery in the industry bear repeating. First, we aim to create the general economic condition and favourable climate for business and enterprise that will lead to increased private sector demand for the output of the industry and therefore increased private sector investment. Second, public expenditure affecting the industry has been raised to the highest sustainable level and has been concentrated on those areas that will yield the highest return in terms of building output and employment.  Finally, a range of special measures have been introduced to boost the construction industry as a whole and the private housing sector in particular.  This is a sound strategy of a responsible Government who are determined to deal with the fundamental problem of the industry, namely, the lack of private demand, while alleviating the <Col N="266" /> effects of the decline in demand by maintaining public investment at the highest level.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt also in some detail with the far-reaching reforms of the VAT system introduced in the recent budget which will undoubtedly encourage enterprise and efficiency and in time stimulate private demand for the output of the construction industry.  Finally, the Minister outlined the various special measures that have been taken to restore the fortunes of the industry by the Government, particularly in the area of new private housing and the important areas of house maintenance and improvement work.</P>
    <P>In speaking on the motion and the amendment tonight I will concentrate on the various measures taken in relation to the major programmes of our Department &mdash; roads, local authority house construction and sanitary services &mdash; to increase output and employment in the industry.  Nowhere has the Government's commitment to the industry been more evident than in the funding of the construction programmes of the Department of the Environment.  The figures and the money are quite clearly there to see. Expenditure programmes of this nature must be planned well into the future, given their technical and economic implications. The publication last year of the national economic plan by Government, which included details of projected public capital expenditure on various programmes, represented a major advance for this country.  The plan will enable the private sector, for the first time in many years, to plan ahead in the knowledge that a coherent set of Government policies are in place to tackle the fundamental problems of our economy.  It will thus create a climate that will encourage private investment in general including investment in the construction industry. The plan provides a blueprint for overall economic recovery.  To complement it, detailed planning on a sectoral basis must also be carried out.</P>
    <P>One particular area of my Department's programme &mdash; I refer to the roads programme &mdash; is an excellent example of <Col N="267" /> this.  This Government are acutely conscious of the need to view roads construction as a priority in our whole infrastructural development.  The road development plan for the eighties has been subjected to a detailed examination, its shortcomings identified and it has been replaced by a new road plan policy and Planning Framework for Roads, published last January.</P>
    <P>The conclusions drawn from the review of the earlier road development plan were that while the needs and objectives highlighted in the seventies remained valid inadequate financing had effectively undermined the chances of achieving these objectives.  A new plan would need to set realistic targets and to make realistic and firm financial arrangements to ensure that these targets could be met. All these conditions are being met in relation to the current road development policy.  The policy and planning framework document provides a clear and definitive statement of the road development policy and thereby provides a framework for the activities of local authorities, private investors, civil engineering contractors, the professions and the material suppliers, all of whom have a vital interest in the future of road development. By adopting a planned approach to infrastructural investment in roads we will ensure that scarce capital and labour resources will be utilised efficiently and will yield the highest return to the economy.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Government's commitment to the building industry and nowhere is this commitment more highlighted than in the significant increases in the provisions for roads improvements and new road construction made in the plan.  In 1985 the provision will be £125 million, an increase of 20 per cent on the allocation for 1984, and it is planned to allocate £140 million for improvements in 1986 and £155 million in 1987.  The allocation in 1987 will, in fact, exceed the 1984 allocation by 53 per cent.  This level of financial commitment will ensure that work can start immediately on the various schemes and projects detailed in <Col N="268" /> the new plan Policy and Planning Framework for Roads.  It is unlike a document that was produced entitled: <i>The Way Forward</i>, which had very positive plans and costings for roads and we all felt that for the first time we were going to see some real infrastructural improvements in our whole road network which were long overdue.  It was hailed as a great document and it was thought it would encourage industry.  It had a whole range of things, particularly in regard to road works.  The only thing they forgot to do, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, was to fund it.  They made it look good on paper and it did read well but there were no sums provided for it and the road plan collapsed.</P>

It will make a tremendous difference in our road network throughout the country.  I believe it is the right way to plan an economy because if right throughout the country we want to develop and regionalise industry surely we must have proper communication.  This is what we are providing in our plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely telling the Senator that under this scheme jobs will be created, a good road network, which is important, will be created and the economy will benefit substantially. The proper maintenance of existing and new road systems is of crucial importance to the economy and social development and the Government have shown their awareness of this by ensuring that £84 million will be allocated for maintenance over each year of the plan.  This level of expenditure has important implications for employment.  It is estimated that an additional 1,100 direct jobs will arise on the road works over a period as well as an estimated 400 jobs in spin-off employment. Investment in the roads programme by this Government will be greater than that provided by any previous Government.  We are aware, however, that additional finances can always be utilised and therefore we are taking a positive attitude towards any investment by the private sector in particular projects.</P>
      <P>As well as central Government playing a role in regard to roads, we are also encouraging private investment. One such project, the toll bridge in Ringsend, was completed recently.  There are other proposals such as the western parkway.  The Government have submitted to industries a list of possible developments which can be carried out by private developers. We are pumping in additional finance which will generate a lot of employment activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to the sanitary services programme, another area of real achievement. The Government's plan has also <Col N="270" /> recognised the importance of the sanitary services development programme in the provision of an adequate water and sewerage system to meet social and industrial demands.  Since the Government took office our efforts have been concentrated on clearing the backlog of schemes that were technically in order and awaiting release from my Department.  In 1983 and 1984, the first two years of the Government's tenure, just £200 million worth of schemes were approved.  In 1984 alone, 102 separate schemes were approved, with a value of £101 million.  This is a record for any one year.  The release of these approvals allow local authorities to complete some schemes and to advance other schemes which are still at the planning stage.</P>
    <P>Altogether, the Government have increased capital investment in the sanitary services programme by £28.65 million over the last two years, with total investment for the two years standing at £193.2 million.  The projected total capital investment in the programme over the years of the plan is £280 million and this level of investment will enable us to go a long way towards meeting our objectives in this area of activity.</P>
    <P>The third major programme of my Department is local authority housing construction.  The Minister has already spoken on this but I think, given the success of the programme since the Government took office, that the figures are worth repeating.  In 1984 7,000 houses were completed, the highest since 1976, when the Coalition Government were in power.  Employment on the programme has been very good with an average monthly employment of 6,800 approximately, or 400 more than the corresponding figure in 1983.  The success of the programme can be related directly to the high level of capital investment by the Government and the operation of carefully designed cost control procedures which were to ensure the best value for money and producing the highest quality of houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>But the number of houses built fell rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="271" />
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Senator the figures and he cannot contradict them.  While it is too early at this stage to quantify the full effects of the cost control procedures since the bulk of schemes to which they have been applied are still under construction, nevertheless they have provided my Department with a framework within which we can ensure that the best value for money is being obtained.  That is what we all want.  We want to get value pound for pound for the people we are taking the money from.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that the cost control procedures now being operated do not involve any recourse to low cost methods.  I do not think there can be a public representative who is not too well aware of these so called low cost methods introduced in the bad old days of the late sixties and early seventies which, in the end, turned out to be not so low cost. They resulted in very expensive housing for which we are still paying.  Indeed, they are now absorbing some of the very scarce capital which would otherwise be spent on new construction.  We are spending a lot of money trying to rehabilitate this low cost housing in which a number of people have been condemned to live because of some smart Aleck thought he could build a whole array of houses for little or nothing.  Unfortunately, we are paying for it now and we have to make the best of it.  We have made the best of it to ensure that something is done.  We have allowed local authorities to use money from the capital programmes to rehabilitate them because we realised that on a normal maintenance basis they would have to be repaired or they would literally collapse in a matter of a few years.  If that occurred they would cost astronomical sums to build.  It is no harm to point that out and put it on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures now in operation are geared to achieve more efficient financial management of the programme both at local and central levels.  They are, as I said, aimed at getting the best value for money and in this way in the long term can benefit not only the finances of the State but also the builders who participate in the housing construction <Col N="272" /> programme.  The continued high level of financial support by the State and the operation of the cost control procedures will ensure a high level of completions and output in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The arrangement announced in the national plan whereby local authorities may purchase houses on the private market for renting to waiting list applicants will provide a boost to the private house building sector, while also helping in the achievement of a more balanced social mix.  I should like to see this procedure adopted by local authorities where possible.  It is necessary to get a better framework and a better social mix.  That is one of the ways it can be done.  It has the effect also of encouraging builders to build privately.  There is a ready market through local authorities who wish to purchase in particular areas.  That illustrates that where the private area is slack, the Government are prepared to come in and make a contribution there also.</P>
    <P>Private housing generally will continue to attract the grants and subsidies payable in the past.  The new house grant for first time buyers has been doubled with effect from 1 May and, as has been pointed out, will offset the effects of the increase in VAT rates adopted as part of the reform of the taxation system.  In addition, the renovation and refurbishment of older multiple properties will receive a considerable stimulus through the extension of the tax incentives associated with work of this kind.  Provision for the extension of the relevant tax incentives is made in the Finance Bill which is at present before the Dáil.  I hope this scheme will help in some way.  Many large houses were converted to offices but, because of the surfeit of modern office development they have been left idle.  I hope the incentive will encourage developers to refurbish older houses, particularly the larger ones in the inner city areas, and get people to return to living in the inner city.  It will have the effect of stimulating the building industry and the social fabric.  I am very happy with this provision. I hope it is availed of.  It is being introduced at the right time when there is some slackness in the office renting <Col N="273" /> business.  With people wanting more modern office conditions to work in more such houses will come on the market.</P>
    <P>The new £5,000 grant for the local authority tenants and tenant purchasers who surrender their dwellings and re-house themselves in the private sector promises to be a great success and is moving in that direction.  It is estimated that the number of applications received by local authorities under the scheme is already in excess of 1,800 and there is every indication that the interest in the scheme will continue at a high level. These people are making houses available for people on local authority housing lists and they are also going into the private house market and purchasing secondhand houses.  There will be a spin-off in the new private housing programme because they are not all going to buy and many people moving from old local authority houses will buy new houses. This will have a significant impact in the private house sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The HFA loans from Dublin are all right.  People who apply will be given approval.  That is the up to date position, and the Senator need not have any doubt about that.  I was inquiring from the Dublin local authority last week to see what the position was and I was told that they are accepting applications and granting loan approvals.  That is the situation as of last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We can only talk about the present position which is that loan approvals are being granted.  One cannot go beyond that.  I do not know what the demand is.  In one breath people are telling me that the private house sector is in decline and the next minute they are telling me there is not enough money available.  Those arguments are not consistent.  I hope there is a demand <Col N="274" /> for money, because that means there is a demand for housing and if there is a demand for housing the private sector is on the way up.</P>
      <P>Before concluding I should like to deal with the suggestion that the solution to the problems of the construction industry lies in a further massive injection of public investment.  People seek £200 million here and £400 million there, without any suggestion as to where the money will come from.  Even if additional funds were available, and we all know they are not, such a policy would have disastrous consequences in the medium and longer term.  In particular, the implications for the overall level of public expenditure, for borrowing requirements and for taxation, would, in the longer term, be damaging to all sections of the economy, including the building industry itself. Surely we should have learned the lesson, that we cannot just go on borrowing, the money has got to be paid back.  Borrowing means that we are taking massive sums of money out of the economy instead of pumping it in again.  We cannot have things both ways.  We have to face up to this, get the economy right, get our finances right and generate real activity. That is what my Department have concentrated on.  The figures are there and nobody can deny them.  I have said that the private sector is slack but the new £5,000 grant for people giving up local authority houses should encourage the buying of private houses.  The matters outlined are a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Not on the public side. As I have indicated to Senator Fitzsimons the Government have put extra money in by way of the additional £1,000 housing grant, despite the fact that the people who were advising the planning board and the Government in <i>Building on Reality</i> said that all subsidies and mortgage reliefs should be abolished.  That was a strong recommendation.  We took <Col N="275" /> the decision that that should not be.  We have sustained all of these aids although the best economic advice was to the contrary. We said, &ldquo;no, we will not do that, it is not in the best interests of the economy.&rdquo; We have increased the grant for first time buyers by an additional £1,000.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy of selective expansion of the Public Capital Programme in those areas that yield the highest return in terms of construction output and employment, of promoting general economic growth and thereby encouraging increased private investment and of selective incentives to stimulate output and employment particularly in the area of private housing, is the right policy.  That is the way we are doing it, and I believe that policy will prove successful. I have no doubt about that.</P>

That was badly needed to boost our economy.</P>

      <P>I will not detain the House much longer since the Senators across the House are getting rather upset. I will conclude very shortly.  The national plan also contained several other measures designed to boost the private housing sector of the industry.  Joint venture housing, an arrangement under which a local authority provides sites under licence to private contractors for the construction of modestly priced houses for sale to selected purchasers, is being extended and promoted.  Indeed, a number of local authorities have taken up this and it is going well.  A site subsidy of up to £1,000 or one third of the site cost is being extended to participants in joint venture housing schemes who are approved applicants for local authority housing or who are tenants of local authority houses.  We have listed a large number of them.  I am sorry some Members across the House are unable to take what I have said on board.  If they do not have a copy of my script I apologise.  I will ensure that Senators will get a copy of it and I hope that when they read it they will agree that the positive programme adopted in the national plan will boost the construction industry.  We are on course. We are taking it on board and I have no doubt that over the three year programme we will see a significant increase in activity in the building construction industry.</P>

      <P>It is no wonder that Members on this side of the House are getting aggressive and worried about what is happening here.  Last week the Minister came into the House but did not <Col N="278" /> have a copy of his script.  When we read what he said we see it is an exact copy of what has been said by the Minister of State today.</P>

      <P>Earlier today one Minister was late coming to the House and another Minister could not be found.  On a three hour debate not alone do the two Government Ministers not address themselves to the motion but they quote from the booklet <i>Building on Reality</i> and referred to figures which might be of use to students of economics in UCD, TCD or UCG but are of no use to us.  It is a magnificent booklet for study by economics students but of no use in reality.  On our motion the Government decided to use one hour of the three hours permitted. They tabled an amendment to the motion and cut down our time to less than one hour.  If that continues we will go to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to get some order into the system.  It is a misuse of the time allocated to the Opposition.  I am sure Senator Dooge does not go along with what is happening in this instance and what happened in many other instances.  The Opposition should be allowed the time allotted to them by the House to discuss their motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, at the beginning of business tonight we offered nobody and allowed two successive speakers from the other side.  We are prepared to do the same again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="279" />
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to look for two successive speakers, because in the limited debate the Minister and the Minister of State were half an hour each and we are only allowed a quarter of an hour each on this side.  That is getting away from what the Minister said.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the Minister lives in cloud cuckooland.  Anybody who supports the amendment lives in cloud cuckooland.  If one comes around the country with me one will see the number of former workers in the building and construction industry who are queueing up outside employment exchanges.  One will see how vibrant the construction industry is.  The Government are creating economic conditions which are not favourable to the building and construction industry but are more favourable to driving thousands of workers out of jobs. Thousands more building workers are out of work this year compared to last year. We have spent many billions of pounds training excellent craftsmen but when they are trained they cannot get a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter where one goes, from the smallest town to the biggest city, one will see that small and large building contractors are going out of business.  They are being liquidated.  The small companies will never again surface.  Some of the big companies have used company law to switch around and appear under different names but there are very few of them. Firms that have been in business for up to 30 years are being closed down.  If the Minister cannot see from the statistics how many building contractors are going out of business every day he is living in cloud cuckooland.  The only thing the Minister can keep harping on is the major programme of road expansion.  There is a major programme of road expansion in the national primary system.  Driving in from Dublin airport one can see the beginning of an eight lane monstrosity that is doing away with good agricultural land. A four lane road would have been adequate for the area.  While that work is in progress country roads are collapsing to the stage where they have to be closed. The amount of money being spent on such eight lane monstrosities would be <Col N="280" /> better spent in improving the country and county roads and laneways.  Very few people are working on such huge projects. Huge machinery costing a lot of money is used.  The number of people who use the national primary roads is not as great as the number of people who use national secondary and country roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister repeated that the plan was there but, as Senator Fitzsimons said, there are fewer houses being built now than in the past.  If the Minister thinks that the £5,000 grant is going to be the panacea for all the ills in the building trade he is very much mistaken.  The Minister mentioned that 1,800 people had applied for the grant.  We are nearly half way into the year and I have no doubt that when these applications are processed many people will have opted out because they think they are eligible for a £2,000 grant as well as the £5,000.  When they went to their local tax office they discussed that because they were purchasing a local authority house and had claimed tax on the interest on their loan but they were not eligible for the £2,000 grant.  In most cases the £2,000 was the difference between being able to transfer from a local authority house and not being able to do so.  For a tenant on a high income and low rent the scheme is a good one. It is also a good scheme for somebody who is in the first year of the purchase of a local authority house.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that private building will be enhanced by this £5,000 grant.  That is not so.  The cheapest house in Kilkenny at present costs about £24,000.  People cannot afford to get money from the banks to bridge the gap. They are afraid to invest in housing to the same extent as in the past.  People are afraid to get involved in long term borrowing because of the job situation. This is not fiction like <i>Building on Reality.</i> They are facts.  The Minister said that some smart-Aleck built low cost houses in the sixties.  I would remind him that there were low cost houses built in the past and a lot of them were of admirable standard.  There were a small number of low cost houses which were not able to stand up to the rigours of time.  We can <Col N="281" /> call the next Minister who comes in here a smart Aleck or we can call the people in the Department of the Environment smart-Alecks because a small number of houses were not up to the standards required for long term usage.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an extraordinary statement when he said that we have to get the maximum use of scarce capital and labour resources.  There is any amount of labour in Kilkenny.  I am sure that there is not one Senator in the House who would not be able to bring the Minister to any area where he will find that there is no scarcity of labour but there will be huge scarcity of capital.  In the private sector there are people who are prepared to go into the building industry but cannot because this industry cannot sustain the costs it has to incur with the 12.6 per cent tax on the employment content and with the various other taxes that have been put on employers in the recent past.  We have a huge increase in employers' liability insurance.  All this is ensuring that people will not be employed.</P>
    <P>We have the ludicrous situation where the Minister is congratulating himself, his Department and the Government for reducing VAT rates from 35 per cent to 23 per cent.  Who put up the VAT rate from 15 per cent to 35 per cent?  It was the last Coalition Government.  This Coalition Government put the rate up to 35 per cent from 23 per cent.  Are we supposed to give credit to the Government for bringing it back to 23 per cent? The Government have done nothing to give building industry workers here, or the potential entrepreneur, hope for the future because the increased capital programme is not able to maintain the number of workers employed in local authorities at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that county roads are not his responsibility but that of the local authorities.  Local authorities will take on any responsibility if funding is made available by the Department of the Environment or the Department of Finance.  We have a situation where people are taxed out of existence and still they are asked to pay increased taxation <Col N="282" /> to local authorities for services which they should be getting from their payment of income tax.  Apparently local charges will be done away with and we will have a property tax on business premises, building land and every type of building.  The business community are paying rates at a rate which they cannot afford to pay and now they are to be asked to pay higher charges by having a levy put on them because they own these properties.  This is the thinking of somebody who has no idea of what it means to run a business.  If he thinks that by doing this he will get enough money to fund local authorities, I can tell him that he will drive more and more ratepayers out of business, thereby cutting down the amount of money that will be available to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that the range of special measures and the Government's strategy will create further private demand.  Any building contractors to whom I have spoken have told me that they are not continuing in business because they are not able to sell the number of houses they have on hands and will not get into speculative building in the future, that it would be preferable to get out of the industry than to stay in it.  This means that more and more people will turn to the public sector for housing. Where will the public sector get the money to build these houses when they cannot cope with the demands that are already there?  As regards County Kilkenny, there is not one solitary local authority house being started there.  One can mention the number of finished houses, but for the first time in my recollection there is no single start of local authority housing and there will not be for another four or five months, and the plans have been with the Department for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>I was not being personal with the Minister at the outset of my contribution, but it is a fact that the Government have not given adequate time to this side of the House.  They have not treated it as it should be treated.  It is the third time today that Government Ministers came <Col N="283" /> into this House and they could not care less about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason I shall be as brief as possible and allow my colleague to speak also.  I cannot understand the confidence that the Minister of State has expressed in the building industry here this evening or, indeed, the Minister last week.  It is well known that, traditionally, the building industry has been the barometer for the whole national economy. The building industry is at an all time low, as is the economy generally. Nationally, it is a story of doom and gloom, large and small businesses are going out of business weekly.  For whatever reason it is a secret ambition of Coalition Governments to deliberately rock confidence in the building industry. Whenever Fianna Fáil are in office the building industry thrives, as has been seen over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that the biggest kick in the teeth for the building industry was that VAT on readymix increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  This came at the worst possible time for industry.  VAT because of the small profit margins, is being put straight on to the price of houses for consumers.  It is well known <Col N="284" /> that the prices of houses and house supplies have increased dramatically.  The Government have deliberately introduced the planning and services charges at the wrong time, which is not of any help to the building industry.  In a sizeable contract of £200,000, roughly 25 per cent of this must be found for all kinds of charges relative to planning, levies, service charges, ESB connections, and so on.  Those charges alone are enough to frighten off potential entrepreneurs in getting involved in any kind of building. If one checks the application lists of the local authorities it can be seen that over the last two years they have dramatically reduced.  Only a trickle of applications are going through in comparison to the good days three to five years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the Minister's belief regarding the confidence he expressed, because that is not the case as I know it.  Having gone into some detail on the figures for Athlone, which is where I reside &mdash; I imagine Athlone would be a typical town &mdash; the story is not as happy as the Minister would like us to believe. Certainly in the Athlone area &mdash; I am talking about a radius of 12 to 15 miles from the town &mdash; the last three years has shown a general decline in building activity and direct employment in the area.  The indirect employment &mdash; material suppliers, builders' suppliers and casual labourers &mdash; has all, naturally, ceased.</P>
    <P>In the Athlone area we have approximately nine or ten general builders and practically all of them report a nil activity. This is as recent as this week.  Three have gone into liquidation.  There are perhaps four or five firms who are dealing exclusively in housebuilding only.  A number of small ones doing extensions tell me that there is no movement whatsoever in extensions, bathrooms, back kitchens and so on.</P>
    <P>I went to the trouble of finding proof for the Minister from five housebuilders. I will give him the names and addresses of these people and he can check them. Builder A gave me the following figures: In 1982 he had six direct employees, in 1983 he had eight direct employees, 1984 <Col N="285" /> six direct employees, 1985 he has four direct employees.  He now finds &mdash; this is unheard of at this time of the year in the building industry &mdash; that he has to lay off two of his employees.  Regarding house sales and apartment sales for that particular firm in 1983 he had 28 sales, in 1984 he had 28 sales, in 1985 three to date and no chance of anything coming.  Judging by the amount of inquiries to date the prospects certainly look very bleak for that firm.</P>
    <P>Firm B in 1981, 12 employed, sold 14 houses; in 1982, 12 employed, sold 12 houses; 1983, ten employed, sold eight houses; in 1984, seven employed, sold six: in 1985, to date, four employed, and two houses sold and no inquiries.  Firm C a firm who sold in 1982-83 in the region of 120 to 130 houses have had ten inquiries for 1985.  Moving on to architect firms in the town, one firm which in 1982 employed 15, have five employees and nothing on the drawing board.  It is a similar story with civil engineering firms. The story is of letting off the best of personnel, engineers, draftsmen.  That is the scene right across the country.  For the Minister to come in here and say that all looks well is an absolute total lie.  The scene was never so bad.</P>

I am saying that the overall picture &mdash; I have given details of my local scene and what would probably be regarded as a similar scene nationally &mdash; is that the industry is surely struggling with a host of adverse factors.</P>

First of all, for the benefit of Senator Lanigan, the £2,000 grant will be available from 1 May to new house purchasers or people building new houses.  On the question of employment, there are more people employed in building local authority houses this year than for the past three years.  There were 7,002 houses built in 1984.  I want to put those two points, from the point of view of accuracy, on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us are suffering from amnesia.  I do not think that anybody who remembers the debate on the plan ever heard the Government claiming that the employment rate would shoot up by the introduction of the plan.  The whole idea of the plan is to save the country from deteriorating and that the job level would be maintained.  It is there in the plan and nobody can take away from it.  There will be the same number of people employed in 1987 as there are now.  There is no use in being hypocritical about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to private builders, in my <Col N="287" /> view one of the problems is that they do not take risks.  They are not like industrialists. They get in, make a killing and then they do not throw enough money back into it, they either redirect their money or go slow on what they are doing. There may have been an argument before that they were not getting the incentives, but now the National Plan recognises that private housing will continue to meet the needs of most households and the Government are committed to providing appropriate assistance and incentives to achieve this.  Government aid to house purchasers takes a number of forms, including provision of mortgage finance, non repayable grants, tax incentives.  The table then goes on to show that in 1982 £16.8 million was put in, increasing to £44.3 million in 1985.</P>
    <P>Building societies have also been a major source of mortgage finance for most private house purchasers.  They financed almost 40 per cent of new private houses in 1984.  Twenty five million pounds was provided this year to finance the mortgage subsidy scheme. The position now is that the annual sums, paying a subsidy of £3,000, over five years, are £1,000, £800, £600, £400 and £200.  This means that applicants for local authority houses and tenant purchase will qualify for the mortgage subsidy in respect of secondhand houses.  We ought to stop codding ourselves about the question of full employment.  It is a joke. From 1960 to 1970 wages and profits were higher than ever but there was not one extra person employed.  It is the system which keeps it like that.  There is no way that you will have full employment under the system.  We have only to look to Europe with 14 million unemployed at present and no sign of that figure decreasing. If you want to live in the system that is how you live.  I am sorry that I only had five minutes and have not had a chance to develop my point.  I want to thank the Senators for letting me in for that five minutes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that the building and construction industry has been in <Col N="288" /> decline since the Government took office two and a half years ago.  As a result of the recent budget proposal, which came into effect last week, to double the rate of VAT on building, morale in the industry has reached a new low.  People who are associated with building and construction for many years will tell you that they have never seen so much gloom and so much depression in every sector of the industry.  Many small and large building firms have closed down and have gone out of business.  This has been happening over the last two years with disastrous consequences for the thousands of employees involved.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that up to 50,000 building workers are now unemployed.  Make no mistake about it, there is a crisis in the building industry and its effects are being felt right throughout the economy. The effects are being felt in particular by builders' providers and by other businesses associated with the industry.  In my own part of the country alone six old established firms in the industry have collapsed.  Throughout the country some of the oldest established builders' suppliers have closed down.  Many firms involved in the manufacture of joinery and other items for the industry are in serious difficulties.</P>
      <P>People are being driven out of the industry daily by the policies that have been pursued by the Government since they came into office.  Tax incentives which attracted private investment have been dismantled.  Public capital investment has been cut.  Planning charges and development charges have been increased.  New service charges have been introduced.  Direct and indirect taxation have added to the burden on the industry.  PRSI contributions have been increased.  All the time costs are soaring. At the same time output is decreasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only the black economy has benefited from the difficulties of the legitimate sector within the building and construction industry.  As many small contracting firms go out of business the number in the black economy increases.  There has been a significant fall off in the level of private house building in rural and urban <Col N="289" /> areas over the past two and a half years. As a public representative in a rural area I find this noticeable.  A few years ago there was a flow of people inquiring about grants and loans.  The situation today is that such inquiries are practically nonexistent. Today a public representative is much more likely to be approached by someone who is in difficulty with his loan repayments than he is by someone seeking a loan to build a new house.</P>
    <P>The numbers of applications for planning permission for new houses are declining all the time in most areas.  Private house completions in the Dublin area in 1984 were at their lowest level since 1971.  It is inevitable that since confidence in the private house market is declining there will be further reductions in the number of private house completions. There is a total loss of confidence in the private house market on the part of both builders and potential purchasers.</P>
    <P>The gap between the housing loans which are available and house prices is too great for most potential purchasers. It has put a new home outside the reach of many young people.  It is becoming increasingly difficult for prospective house purchasers to bridge the gap between the price of a new house and the maximum loan available.  Some years ago a new house was an investment and it was almost guaranteed to appreciate in value. Today a new house is a millstone around the necks of many young people who are struggling to meet loan repayments on a property, the value of which is decreasing now instead of increasing.</P>
    <P>In the present climate of gloom and depression the future for private house building is bleak.  Because of poor demands and increasing cost it is inevitable that this sector of the industry will decline further unless the Government take positive steps to tackle the situation before it is too late.  In this motion, we are asking the Government to take special measures to arrest the decline in output and employment in the building and construction industry.  I hope that the Government will do that before it is too late.</P>
    <P>The recent increase in the new house <Col N="290" /> grant which has been referred to goes nowhere near compensating for the increase as a result of the doubling of the VAT rate on building in this year's budget.  The average price of a new house at £36,000 will increase far more than the value of the increase in the grant.  It will increase by almost twice the increase in the grant.  Then only first time purchasers qualify for the grant, so all other purchasers of new houses will have to bear the full brunt of the increase which will result from the doubling of VAT.</P>
    <P>As private house building declines there will be an increased demand for local authority houses.  The construction and the provision of local authority houses is limited by the funds that are allocated to the local authorities.  They can only build a certain number of houses each year but the waiting list for these houses will increase at a faster rate.  In the future we can look forward to longer waiting lists for local authority houses. People will have to live for longer periods in poor accommodation before being rehoused.</P>
    <P>The fact that more local authority houses are being provided at the moment than was the case some years ago has been referred to, but I do not think that this can be taken as an indication that the builders and the contractors who are engaged in the construction of local authority houses are doing well.  Competition for contracts for local authority houses is so keen at the moment that there is considerable price cutting.  Contractors, in order to stay in business and keep their crews together, have to cut costs, and many of them are making no profit whatever on the building of local authority houses.  They are trying to survive and keep their employees rather than see them leave on the emigrant ship until a Fianna Fáil Government return to office. Then, of course, these contractors know that there will be a restoration of confidence in the building industry and that positive incentives will be provided by that Government to ensure that the <Col N="291" /> building industry will once again begin to thrive and to prosper.</P>

      <P>Several of the other measures introduced by the Government in their recent budget will also have detrimental effects on the building industry. For instance, the increase in the composite rate of tax on building society deposits will mean that interest rates on loans from building societies will remain high. At present, loan repayments for many young people, especially young couples with families are an intolerable burden. The result is that building societies are repossessing more houses now than ever in their history.  It is true to say that building societies today are in the property market in so far as they are trying to dispose of the many houses that have been repossessed from people who are unable to meet loan repayments.  The same applies in the case of local authorities. Arrears in SDA loan repayments are at an unprecedented level.  People are at their wits end to know how they are going to survive after many of them have <Col N="292" /> lost their jobs and their circumstances have changed from the time when the loans were taken out.</P>
      <P>The blame for the unemployment situation that exists at the moment can be placed fairly and squarely at the door of the Government in office.  The Minister referred to the far-reaching reforms of the VAT system which were introduced in the recent budget.  The Minister is claiming credit for reforms of a system that came into existence as a result of measures that were introduced by the present Government in the 1983 and 1984 budgets.  He also referred to the roads programme.  He said that the Government are acutely conscious of the need for road development, and he places great importance on it.  But when the Minister and the Government talk of such development, they only speak of national roads.  Many members of the present Government are not aware of the existence of the many thousands of miles of county roads which are crumbling throughout the country at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you for allowing me, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, to raise this matter this evening and also to <Col N="295" /> thank the Minister for agreeing to come into the House here to make a reply on this very serious situation that has arisen in north Westmeath.  I would like to plead the cause of the people and students of north Westmeath to have a new vocational school erected in Castlepollard. The present vocational school in Castlepollard was built in the thirties and was intended to accommodate at that time about 60 students.  The original building was made of mass concrete with a flat roof and consisted of a kitchen cum science room with one classroom.</P>
      <P>From nearly the very beginning dampness and major problems with this flat roof have been cropping up year after year.  This building has had to be added to on many occasions as the numbers grew and now consists of three classrooms and six prefabs.  In 1983, it was necessary to convert the nissen hut in order to provide two other small rooms. One of these is in use as a classroom and the other as a staff room.  In 1984 three extra second-hand prefabs were acquired, also to provide more accommodation. The state of the school at the moment in May 1985 is that there are 11 rooms, six of which are prefabs.  I think it is a scandal, a shame and a disgrace that this exists in Ireland today.  We have three rooms which were built in 1937, each 55 metres.  The fourth room is a woodwork room which is 72 metres, built in 1978.  The fifth room, a metalwork room, is 100 metres and was built in 1965. The sixth is a secretarial room of 43 metres, a prefab provided in 1973.  The seventh is a computer room, which is 21 metres, a prefab supplied in 1973.  The eighth is a classroom which was an original room, 32 metres which was renovated in 1983.  The ninth, tenth and eleventh rooms are prefabs.  We all know the life of prefabs is very short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To present this school, which was upgraded from intermediate certificate to leaving certificate last year with three second-hand prefabs is, I think, a scandal, to say the least.  Be that as it may, bearing in mind that this is the only secondary school in the entire north <Col N="296" /> Westmeath from Mullingar to Cavan, over to Oldcastle, up to Kells and down to Granard, it is a very important school as far as we are concerned.  In all, we have six prefab classrooms.</P>
    <P>On 5 February 1985 the Westmeath VEC wrote to the Department and later a deputation, of which I was one, met officials of the Minister's Department and informed them of the serious overcrowding conditions that existed at the school.  Since then space is at a premium as numbers are steadily increasing.  At present we have 177 students in the school and with the enrolments for next year it is envisaged that we are going to have 200 pupils.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Westmeath VEC and we have made an application to the Minister's Department to provide one more prefab, which is an urgent necessity, for the school for the coming year. Unfortunately, the Minister and his Department did not see fit that we should have this extra prefab for the students in that school.  I would call on the Minister &mdash; we have appealed this to the Minister's Department &mdash; to have a serious look at the situation.  On the present site there is very little room for further development, apart from the school buildings not being adequate at all.</P>
    <P>Another very important matter is the lack of playground facilities.  The school has been upgraded from intermediate to leaving certificate which increased the school attendance by at least 20 per cent, and there are no playing facilities there whatsoever.  The nearest playground is three-quarters of a mile away and it belongs to Castlepollard hurling club.  I want to place on record tonight the great credit due to the teachers and the pupils for producing a team this year to win a Leinster hurling championship with no playing field.  It should be put in the Guinness Book of Records.  In north Westmeath we have a wealth of hurling talent. All the hurling of the entire county comes from north Westmeath, and that is where this school is situated.</P>
    <P>I want on the Minister to buy a new site and to make an announcement to the House that while we will have a <Col N="297" /> problem in the short term it will not go on indefinitely.  Castlepollard is a developing area, and it can be developed, but not without the necessary facilities, one of these being a school which can cater for a minimum of 250 students up to leaving certificate standard.  Within the present constraints north Westmeath cannot develop to its full potential.  There has been an educational study and an architectural study done in this area in the last few months and they are in agreement that there is a serious problem and that the present school does not meet the requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Cassidy's plea to the Minister to provide a new educational facility in Castlepollard.  He is quite right when he says that this is the only second level school in the entire north Westmeath area.  I come from Oldcastle, which is only 9½ miles from Castlepollard, and we have a good vocational school there but the Norbatine College in Kilnacrot, which is close to both Castlepollard and Oldcastle closed some years ago and Oldcastle had to take in that entire catchment area.  There is a chock-a-block situation there.  The fact that recognition was given to Castlepollard some two years ago when the school was upgraded to leaving certificate level, as Senator Cassidy has said, surely adds to the claim that the school should be replaced.  I was a member of a vocational education committee for a number of years and when I hear of duplication of classrooms for teaching of general subjects and the addition of prefabs and especially the addition of secondhand prefabs I become very sceptical.  I know from discussions with officials from the Department that the life expectancy of a prefab is ten years.</P>

      <P>Senator Cassidy is quite right when he says that this area has become highly industrialised.  In the light of that vocational education must be expanded and must be promoted and certainly should not be curtailed.  To give proper education to our young people it is vital that the proper accommodation and facilities are provided.  The school was built in 1937 to accommodate approximately 60 pupils.  Surely the Minister will agree that it is outmoded, over-crowded and should be replaced with the greatest expeditiousness.</P>

      <P>May I first apologise to the Seanad and particularly to Senator Cassidy and Senator Lynch for having had to leave the debate without hearing the views expressed by Senator Lynch?  I have some notes taken of the points raised by Senator Cassidy and I will see what I can do about the provision of a prefabricated building.  I did not have an opportunity of looking at that today but I will do so within the next few days. I am aware that putting down a motion on the Adjournment in a situation like this is not done for fun and I want to assure the Senators that I take the statements made by them very seriously.  I am aware of the situation in Castlepollard.  I have had some difficulty in understanding the position there but the case made by the Senators is not an exaggerated one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have just recently finalised an appraisal of the long term educational needs of the vocational school at Castlepollard.  One of the factors of concern in this appraisal has been that while the school is most likely to have an enrolment of up to 200 or so within the next decade, increasing from the present enrolment of 176, subsequently there could be a very marked decline in enrolment.  It is considered that there is no possibility of this school ever achieving the level of enrolment desirable <Col N="299" /> to enable it to provide a curriculum ideal in terms of range and depth at junior and senior cycles.</P>
    <P>Two further factors must be noted. First, the school is the only second level one in the Castlepollard centre, and second, the nearest post-primary centres are a minimum of 10 miles away.  I find it difficult to understand why there are only 175 children on the rolls when the nearest postprimary school is over 10 miles away.  We have examined it in great detail in relation to what the future of Castlepollard will be.  It is in the context of these particular circumstances, and notwithstanding the limitations as regards curriculum spread that must follow from the restricted enrolment potential, that my Department have decided to proceed with the development of the school to provide 175 permanent places in due course.</P>
    <P>The next question to be asked is: How is the development to take place?  Is it to be a new school or an extension to the existing buildings?  This is not an easy decision to come to.  Experts on building in my Department reported that the existing structure is a good sound building, and the decision we have taken is to extend that school rather than provide a new school.  The existing accommodation is considered adequate to cater for 175 students in the short term.  It does include some prefabricated temporary buildings of the type which my Department are committed to replacing in all schools eventually.  They will have outlived their usefulness.  There are also four permanent type rooms.</P>
    <P>It is the easiest thing in the world to say that we should ignore the existing school buildings and go for a completely new school.  However, the overall financial situation, in which we are compelled to husband our resources and use them in the most economic manner possible, dictates that we examine the existing layout to see whether it can be used. The buildings have been inspected by my Department and it has been determined that the four permanent teaching spaces <Col N="300" /> can be retained, and upgraded where necessary, to form the nucleus of the future school.  The residual accommodation required to make up the shortfall and replace the temporary accommodation will be planned for by way of an extension.  It is regretted that a new school cannot be provided.  There are so many demands already being made on our capital allocation that the decision here is to extend the school rather than to provide a new school.  One of the factors which determined that decision was that as far as we can ascertain there will be an increase in numbers of up 200 in the next ten years but from then on there will be a fall in the numbers.  We must be concerned about the expenditure of public moneys of that sort.  We in the Department have to be careful that we do not erect very expensive buildings of that sort which will not be utilised in the immediate and distant future.</P>
    <P>The County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee will be formally advised of the position and agreement will be sought as to the range and extent of the new accommodation to be provided. Within the restraints imposed by the Department's area and cost limits, every effort will be made to facilitate the school in relation to the subjects at present being taught there.  When agreement has been reached on the accommodation, arrangements will then be made to initiate architectural planning of the extension.  There will be, in the not too distant future, discussions with the Westmeath Vocational Education Committee. This has been on the cards for some time, and I understand the frustration of teachers, pupils, parents and the public representatives.  I sincerely hope that from here on, once the decision has been taken, there will not be any further undue delay and that with the co-operation of the Westmeath Vocational Education Committee we will provide an extension to this school as quickly as possible.</P>
