      <P>I have notice from Senator Rory Kiely that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The steps being taken by the Government to protect Irish national interests in view of the fear and anxiety that has been expressed by fishermen and the fishing industry in general in relation to the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that it is too wide to be dealt with under the half-hour adjournment procedure.  In the circumstances I must rule that the matter of which Senator Kiely has given notice is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I also have notice from Senator Patrick Kennedy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The provision of natural gas in Limerick as a matter of exceptional urgency.</P>
      <P>I regard this matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>This side of the House is disappointed at the lack of legislation being introduced here.  It was suggested at one time that the setting up of joint committees would be useful.  It now appears that the reports of the joint committees are being used as substitutes because no legislation is being introduced. I would like to ask the deputy Leader of the House what legislation are we likely to get or are we just to keep on taking reports week in and week out?</P>

Secondly, when does he hope to give time for us, at long last, to finish the Second Stage of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983?  Both of these items have been on the Order Paper for so long that at this stage the printers are probably beginning to suffer from some sort of blindness from having to repeat the same print over and over again.</P>

      <P>Most of the contributors have referred to legislation.  I would remind them that for today's Order of Business there are two Bills, the Canals Bill, 1985 and the Age of Majority Bill, 1984.  It would be inappropriate, and I am sure the Opposition would not agree to this, to take the Canals Bill without having set a date for taking it.  I ordered it for today to get agreement on the date on which we should take it.  With regard to the Vagrancy (Repeal) (No. 2) Bill, 1984, mentioned by Senator B. Ryan, I will communicate his views and the views of the House to the relevant Minister to see if it can be brought forward quickly. With regard to Senator Ross, the Taoiseach has announced that it is the Government's intention to bring forward a great deal of legislation in the coming sessions of both Houses of the Oireachtas. I have no control over whether the Bills will be initiated here or in the other House.  I know that I am expressing the views of the Leader of the House when I say that as much legislation as possible should be initiated here.  There will be legislation on the National Development Corporation on which the Labour Party will have much to say, the Broadcasting Bill, the Family Planning Bill.  The Children Bill and the Local Government Reform Bill are two Bills that I understand will be ready possibly by March and be in time for the elections. We will also have legislation in connection with disabled voters and extending the vote to people from the United Kingdom.  There is also a commitment from the Government on a Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill.  If it does not arrive in time we will proceed in an orderly fashion to discuss Senator B. Ryan's Bill, on which, in fairness, we have done quite a lot in recent months. There is also the question of introducing legislation to implement the taxation of farmers.  Those are some of the Bills coming from the Government.  There will certainly be no lack of eagerness on our side of the House to bring forward as much legislation as possible in this House as soon as we have it available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> This Bill is, I believe, a welcome and desirable improvement in our law which will prove to be of considerable benefit to our young people.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to implement the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to the age of majority which are contained in their report entitled Report on the Law relating to the Age of Majority, the Age for Marriage and Some Connected Subjects. The principal recommendation of the commission was that the age of majority be reduced from 21 to 18 years or the age at which a person marries if earlier.</P>
      <P>Prior to the publication of the report the commission published a working paper on the subject and in newspaper advertisements invited the views of the public generally on the matter.  The commission also conducted a wide ranging investigation in the course of which they communicated with law reform agencies, lawyers and jurists in many countries and comprehensively reviewed the law on the age of majority here, in Britain and various other countries in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I think it is only fitting, before discussing the Bill further, that I should express my appreciation of the work done by the commission on this subject.  The thorough and painstaking research which is evident in the working paper and the final report has contributed greatly to our knowledge of the existing law on this matter and on the implications of the changes proposed.  I am sure that I am voicing the sentiments of the House when I say that we are grateful to the commission for the work they have done in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear why or when exactly the age of majority was originally fixed at 21 years.  There is evidence that at one time the age of majority was associated with physical strength and that the different <Col N="7" /> ages applied to different social classes. For example, it appears that in feudal times certain classes attained the age of majority at 15 but for a person engaged in the service of a knight the age of majority was 21.  Gradually the latter age of majority came to be applied to everyone and under the common law a person under 21 was treated as an infant, or minor, who was subject to certain legal limitations, the most important being in his capacity to enter into contracts or to own property.  The purpose of these limitations was to protect a minor from his own improvidence and inexperience without at the same time causing unnecessary hardship to any person dealing with him.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission's report clearly shows that there is a world-wide trend to reduce the age of majority.  In 1972 a resolution of the Council of Europe recommended a reduction in the age of majority.  In Britain and Northern Ireland and many other European countries it has been reduced to 18 years.  In the great majority of states in the USA the age is also 18 years.  This trend reflects the general consensus that young people are now reaching physical and mental maturity at an earlier age than in former times and that they are in general fully capable of accepting responsibility for the conduct of their daily lives.</P>
    <P>I am sure that many young people resent the implication in the present age of majority that they are improvident and irresponsible until they reach 21 years of age.  People tend quite often to think of young people in terms of the delinquent minority, forgetting that the vast majority of our young people are sensible and responsible members of society.  I think many would agree with a conclusion reached by an English committee &mdash; the Latey Committee &mdash; in recommending a reduction in the age of majority &ldquo;that to keep responsibility from those who are ready and able to take it on is much more likely to make them irresponsible than to help them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is possible to suggest, as that committee did also &ldquo;that the handicap of being unable to buy, say, a washing <Col N="8" /> machine on the HP does no good to the young and inexperienced bride; that being unable to get a mortgage hardly helps the responsible young to keep house securely and independently from the start of their marriages&rdquo;.  I think most reasonable people would agree with these views.  Moreover, the Law Reform Commission have suggested that the protection of the family guaranteed in the Constitution would indicate that impediments should not be placed in the way of young married people in acquiring and furnishing a home.</P>
    <P>The Bill also continues a trend that has already been reflected in a number of provisions in existing legislation that recognise the right of people to assume legal responsibility at 18 years or on marriage if earlier.  The Succession Act 1965 enables a person who is 18 years or married to make a valid will; the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 empowers a parent under 21 years of age to appoint a guardian of his child by will and the Family Law Act, 1981 provides that a consent given by a spouse to the sale or disposal of the family home will not be invalid by reason of the fact that the spouse was under 21.  Moreover, the voting age was reduced from 21 to 18 years by way of a constitutional amendment in 1972.  It is noteworthy that that change was supported by 85 per cent of the votes cast at the relevant referendum.</P>
    <P>The Report of the Law Reform Commission indicates that there was widespread support for the proposal to change the age of majority to 18 years among those bodies who made submissions to the commission.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation also endorsed the commission's recommendation in their Report on the Age of Majority of 11 April 1984.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the provisions of the Bill will come into operation on 1 March 1985.  On that date a person who has reached 18 or is married will acquire full legal capacity.  I understand that this will affect upwards of 200,000 people who are at present between the ages of 18 and 21, not to mention many more who are approaching the age of 18.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> The main areas of law affected are contract, property and guardianship.  A person of 18 or who is married will be free to enter into contracts and to buy or sell land and to give valid receipts for the purchase money without intervention of a trustee or other third person.  I am confident that this change will be of significant benefit to the young people concerned, especially young married couples who may at present have difficulty in securing housing finance, and others such as young farmers and business people who, because of the existing limitations on their contractual capacity are unable to obtain loans to help finance development.</P>
    <P>The central provision of the Bill is in section 2 which proposes that on the commencement date a person will attain full age if he has reached 18 or is or has been married.  The section provides that a reference to age of majority, full age, infancy and cognate expressions in any statutory provision, including statutory instruments whenever made, and in any deed, will, court order or other instrument made on or after the commencement date will be construed as a reference to the new age of majority except in the Acts specifically exempted.  The exempted provisions relate to marriage, adoption, social welfare, taxation, maintenance orders, certain pensions and legislation relating to the custody of persons.</P>
    <P>The purpose of excluding these statutory provisions from the scope of the Bill is to preserve the existing legal effect of references to 21 years in those provisions. Any changes in relation to ages mentioned in those provisions would be appropriate to separate legislation in each of the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>The exemptions in respect of maintenance orders and legislation relating to the custody of persons were inserted by way of amendments that I moved in the Dáil. I would like to explain briefly why these amendments were made.</P>
    <P>With regard to maintenance orders, the Law Reform Commission in their working paper proposed that the right to obtain a maintenance order in respect of <Col N="10" /> a child receiving full time education up to 21 years of age should be preserved. But, in the final report the commission reconsidered that view and recommended that the right to maintenance should cease on attainment of the age of majority since, in their view, a necessary implication of attaining majority is that a child is sufficiently mature and independent to be responsible for his or her own maintenance.  Having listened carefully to the arguments on both sides of this question I came to the conclusion that it would be better not to effect any change. Accordingly I moved the amendment to exempt the relevant statutory provisions from the scope of the section.</P>
    <P>As to legislation relating to the custody of persons, it was not intended that the Bill should affect the age at which a person might be committed to an adult prison.  The considerations that apply in deciding age limits in this area are unrelated to the age of majority and it was considered therefore that it would be most inappropriate to make any changes in this respect in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 implements the commission's proposal to abolish the existing common law rule for calculating a person's age. At present a person is deemed under common law to attain a particular age at the commencement of the day before his birthday.  The result is that a person whose birthday falls, for example, on a Saturday is deemed to have reached the relevant age at midnight on the preceding Thursday.  This is generally regarded as illogical and artificial.  The effect of the section will be that after the commencement date of the Act a person will attain any particular age on the date of the relevant anniversary of his or her birth, in other words, on his birthday.  This will be more in keeping with commonsense and will bring the rule into line with that in existing social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill relate largely to technical consequential matters arising as a result of the reduction in the age of majority.  There are a number of transitional provisions in the schedule.  Funds held in court under a court order will be payable to the person <Col N="11" /> concerned on attaining the new age of majority instead of 21 years as at present. Wardship and custody orders, in force before the Act commences, applicable to a person up to 21 years, will cease on attainment of 18 years or on marriage. Other transitional provisions are designed to preserve the existing legal position in relation to deeds, wills, trust instruments and causes of action made or accruing before the commencement date.</P>
    <P>A number of recommendations of the Law Reform Commission are not being implemented in this Bill as it was considered that they would be more appropriately dealt with as separate matters.</P>
    <P>The commission proposed that the free age for marriage &mdash; that is the age at which a person can marry without consent of a third party &mdash; be reduced from 21 to 18 and that the absolute minimum age for marriage should be fixed at 16 years.  Any marriages between 16 and 18 years would require the consent of a parent, guardian or of the court and failure to obtain consent would render the marriage void.  The Government consider that the question of the appropriate minimum age for marriage constitutes a separate subject from that of the age of majority and that it would be desirable to deal with it as a separate issue.  They also consider it advisable to await the report of the Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown, whose recommendations will require careful and detailed consideration, before deciding on the appropriate action to be taken in relation to this question.  Reduction of the free age for marriage could, in any event, be effected in regulations that could be made by the Minister for Health under the Marriages Act, 1972.</P>
    <P>The commission also proposed that the age up to which parents should be obliged to maintain children for the purposes of social welfare and other legislation should be raised from 16 to 18 years.  It was considered that this matter would be more appropriately dealt with in the context of the legislation concerned.  Proposals made by the commission in relation to the certain ages for the purposes <Col N="12" /> of adoption have not been included in the Bill.  The question of the appropriate ages in adoption matters has never been directly related to the age of majority.  I understand that the Minister for Health will be putting forward proposals for amendment of the adoption laws when examination of the recently published report of the Review Committee on Adoption Services has been completed and that would seem a more appropriate context in which to consider the commission's proposals.</P>
    <P>The House will note from the list of exempted statutory provisions, in section 2 of the Bill, that social welfare and taxation legislation will not be affected by the change in the age of majority.  These exemptions will have the effect of preserving any existing entitlements to benefits or allowances under such legislation in respect of children in full time education up to 21 years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me say that while this Bill is a relatively straightforward and generally a non-contentious measure it will have important consequences for a large segment of the population.  It will confer on our young people certain legal rights but it will also impose on them certain legal obligations.  Freedom to enter into contracts and to incur debts will also involve the obligation to fulfil those contracts and to pay those debts.  I am confident that we will not be disappointed in the response of our young people to the challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is certainly a very necessary and acceptable Bill as far as it goes.  The age of majority has already been lowered in most European countries. There is a very good reason for following suit in Ireland.  People mature quicker nowadays than they did 20 or 30 years ago, possibly due to more extensive education and a more sophisticated life-style. There is no doubt that young people are maturing earlier and this trend of bringing down the age of majority is the proper course to take.  It has been introduced already in a number of other areas, in the Succession Act, in regard to voting and in regard to juries.  My <Col N="13" /> criticism of the Bill is that it is extremely cautious.  It takes another step forward but a very limited step and it excludes the question of marriage.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission brought out a very interesting report on the age of majority and dealt with it in conjunction with marriage.  From reading that report one will see how relevant marriage is to the question of the age of majority.  The Law Reform Commission drafted a Bill which would deal with these two matters together.  This was a very appropriate thing to do.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not see fit to follow the recommendation that was made by the Law Reform Commission in this respect. Postponing the question of marriage and postponing a number of other things that might have been introduced in this Bill will only add to difficulties.  It will help in some ways, but it will lead to further difficulties because of the things that have been left out.</P>
      <P>From that point of view, the Bill is worthy of note more for the things that have been left out than what has been included.  This is particularly relevant in view of what has been said earlier today in regard to the scarcity of business in this House.  The Government seem to be extremely reluctant, extremely slow in introducing any Bill.  It seems a great pity, when we have a Bill before us now dealing with the age of majority, that the opportunity was not taken to include in that Bill a number of other things which are very relevant to the question of the age of majority and which will have to be done some time in the near future.  As it seems to take a great effort on the part of the Government to introduce any Bill it is a pity that this Bill was not a more comprehensive one and did not include a whole lot of other subjects that could have been very appropriately included with the question of the age of majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, this is a non-contentious Bill.  It is a very important one for many of us who are dealing with young people who are anxious to arrange a life of their own over the age of 18 but still have not reached <Col N="14" /> the age of 21.  This applies particularly in the area of house mortgages and entering into contracts with various people, whether it be hire purchase or otherwise. Many of us have come across the anomaly of people who held responsible jobs, were married but were less than 21 years of age, still having to have their parents or somebody else as guarantors particularly with local authorities for house loans or even house construction loans. Because of the anomaly which has arisen in these areas with lending agencies, it is appropriate that we should give young people the responsibility, first of all, that we would like them to have and, secondly, the responsibility which they obviously have taken upon themselves over the last ten years or so.  Many young people have the courage now to enter into major contracts, even the contract of marriage, at a younger age and that is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The future of this country depends on our young people and the fact that young people can take on to themselves certain responsibilities will be an indication to them that the older generation have trust in them and so provide the necessary legislation to lower the age of majority. The young people will respond positively to it.  The Minister said that in giving them the responsibility of entering into these contracts and incurring debts it also devolved on them the responsibility to fulfil them.  From my experience of young people, in the area of local authority representation particularly, I have no doubt but that young people will meet this challenge and meet it with the responsibility the Minister encourages them to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan mentioned the type of items which have been excluded from this Bill.  In the case of social welfare or further education particularly it is very important that those areas should be excluded because there are still many areas of responsibility for parents in respect of children, especially those who are going forward to third level education. Because these young people are still at a level of education where they would be <Col N="15" /> unable to support themselves it is important that some responsibility for maintenance would be entrusted to the parents while they are going through the education process.  Those items should have been excluded; otherwise parents could be reneging on their responsibility to their children who have reached the age of majority.  That is looking at it from a legal point of view.</P>
    <P>This is welcome legislation; it has proved to be non-contentious and people throughout the country welcome the principle of giving young people all the encouragement they need to come out of the present recession, particularly in regard to the problems they will face in employment, bettering their education and the problems they will face in the future in marriage and in bringing up their families.  We should treat them as adults at as early an age as possible and that is 18, or younger if they are married. Marriage in itself instills an element of responsibility in young people and the use of the wording &ldquo;to lower the age from 21 to 18 or earlier if a person is married&rdquo; meets all the problems that I might have had otherwise because quite a number of people get married for various reasons under the age of 18 and it is appropriate that when they make that major decision in life we should credit them with the same responsibility in other respects.  I support the Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill.  It has, I suppose, been long over-due and has been talked about for a long time.  Of course it is quite easy to talk about bringing in legislation but attitudes will also have to change.  As well as reducing the age from 21 to 18 much more effort will have to be put into the training of young people to learn to deal with responsibility. It is quite easy to bring in a Bill and say that we are giving them new responsibility but we have to do much more than that.  This is where the Government will have to be seen to give more back-up to this Bill.  In this connection the work of youth organisations and <Col N="16" /> schools must focus on helping young people and they must be supported in this work by Government policy.  I am not talking here about grey papers or white papers, or plans or committees; I am talking about positive back-up to what we are doing here today.  I welcome the Bill and I thank the Minister for bringing it in.</P>
      <P>I am not in total agreement with Senator Eoin Ryan.  It was not today or yesterday that young people were able to deal with responsibility.  Since the foundation of this State certain young people &mdash; not all &mdash; were quite able to deal with responsibility and did so.  They are reaching the age of maturity at an earlier age now but here I would emphasise that as a parent and legislator I would like to be happy in my mind that in giving them the responsibility that we are not also deciding that now that they have this responsibility they can do as they wish and we need not worry, but that we would still be there as the back-up that we should always provide as parents and legislators.  They are not on their own.</P>
      <P>This may be a more important Bill than some politicians might think.  We are giving new responsibilities to an 18 year old.  We want to be quite sure that 18 year-olds still feel, having got the responsibilities which quite clearly they are asking for, that there is some support agency prepared to back them up.  When we talk about giving them the chance and opportunity of going out to a finance agency and getting loans and taking on marriage at the age of 18 and 16, I certainly have reservations regarding the possibility that having done that they would feel that there would be no back-up. At any age today we know the shocking pressure that a loan or debt has brought even on later marriages, not to mention on 18 year olds.  There is only three years between the age of 18 and 21 but young people learn a lot in those three years.  While I am totally supportive of the Bill I want to put emphasis on the fact that they should not be on their own, having given them responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister think that we should have some safeguards in this Bill for the <Col N="17" /> young adult who may need aid or court safeguards in certain cases?  If it does not give young adults full legal rights &mdash; I am not as well versed in the legal situation as some of my colleagues here &mdash; we might need wider reforming legislation. Perhaps I am wrong in that.  I hope that the Bill will still carry with it protection for minors.  For a long time people were asking the Minister and indeed other Ministers to change.  I accept that, but do they still have the protection?</P>
    <P>In regard to section 6 (b), I would like to make a reference here to the field in which I served for a long time.  The opinion is that the Bill will not have adverse effects on the mentally handicapped just now.  We welcome the fact that paragraph (b) will alter the Guardianship Act, 1964, to ensure that in the case of a mentally handicapped child a maintenance order can be made up to any age.  It says that:</P>
    <P>Any reference to an infant in this section (except in paragraph (a) of subsection (2)) shall include a reference to a child who has attained the age of eighteen years and is suffering from mental or physical disability to such extent that it is not reasonably possible for him to maintain himself fully.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister about this just in case they are not protected and as it is so clearly included in a section of the Bill.  When I use the word &ldquo;noise&rdquo; now, what I mean is the pressure of life today.  I am glad that most of our 18 year olds are able for the pressures but with the problems that this nation has at present I wonder if the 50 year olds are able for the noise.  I again ask the Minister if he would be concerned about this.  We are now putting 18 year olds on juries. Could we arrive at a stage where we would have four 18 year olds on a jury?</P>
    <P>I have said before that there is quite a difference between an 18 year old and a 21 year old.  I accept the famous phrase which is used every day about &ldquo;our rights&rdquo;, but I must say that I do not think that anybody of 16, 17 or 18 years of age is ready for marriage.  I say that positively and nobody will change my mind on that. The pressures of life today are very great <Col N="18" /> and those of us who have most of our lives behind us would be concerned about this.  We are saying here to the 18 year olds that they can take on loans, take on all responsibilities, take on marriage and all these things at the age of 18.  Things have changed very much in Ireland in the last eight to ten years.  I am saying this because I have a child of 28 and a child of 26.  In the last ten years those children had the back-up all the time of their parents.  I worry that we are giving this tremendous responsibility to the 18 year olds this evening and they may not have the back-up of their parents.  Certainly they may not have the back-up of two parents, but I would hope that they would have the back-up of at least one parent when they need support.  Side by side with this, I would hope that when they have the pressure of loans and debts they would have somebody to fall back on.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I would like to see with it some family law reform because these things are related and they certainly relate to the question of the age of majority.  Last Saturday I had the pleasure of speaking to a group of 18 to 25 year olds and most of them are probably able to take on the responsibility we are giving them but there must be some support behind them.  This is my concern as one who, maybe, has seen that it is necessary.  I have that reservation. We see people of 30 not being able to deal with loans and debts.  I thank the Minister for bringing in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill which makes a fundamental change in our law.  This Bill removes from the citizen the protective status of infancy or minority three years earlier and confers the status of majority on the citizen on his attaining his 18th birthday.  As such, it recognises a situation existing in our society.  It recognises the fact that people are maturing earlier, at a younger age, both physically and mentally.  It recognises the fact that people at a much earlier age are taking on new responsibilities, responsibilities which people in their teens would not have dreamt of 20 years <Col N="19" /> ago.  Above all, it recognises the developing position of the family in our society. The family is no longer a unit or a nest within which a child stays until marriage. Current experience of the family shows that the child tends to leave the family at an earlier age, whether the leaving be one of moving in physical terms or otherwise, but they are certainly leaving in terms of taking on new responsibilities, developing new ideas and achieving a kind of independence which people did not achieve at such an early age in the past.  That independence is manifest by the fact that young people can generate income of a substantial nature, young people are acquiring homes of their own at an earlier age and, as other Senators have remarked, recent statutory developments in this jurisdication have given to people at 18 years rights which heretofore were reserved for the 21 year olds.</P>
      <P>Above all, the Bill recognises the independence and the individuality of our citizens and the fact that people can be independent, self-determining individuals at an earlier age.  Because people mature earlier it is only right that that recognition should exist in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned two other statutory changes.  The Minister in this House and in the Dáil also made similar references to the fact that in 1965 when we enacted the Succession Act we accepted that people had achieved testamentary capacity on attaining their 18th birthday or having married.  The fact that the people, in their wisdom, in the 1972 referendum decided that citizens should have the right to vote at 18 years of age and, indeed, the fact that that referendum was carried by such a substantial majority was a fair indication of the view of the people as distinct from that of the legislators as to how the law should move in this whole area.  There is the Juries Act of 1976 which allows people to participate, and indeed a far broader range of people to participate in the judicial process at the age of 18 years.  If anybody watches the modern jury in action, as distinct from the jury which existed in the day of the ratepayer jurors prior to the operation of <Col N="20" /> the 1976 Act, one gets a very clear idea of how seriously young people take their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the underlying principles contained in this Bill and I take this opportunity of commending the Law Reform Commission for their very excellent working paper and for their excellent report dealing with this matter.  I am sorry that the Minister decided to make certain exclusions and that the free age to marry should remain at 21 years.  I am sorry that the Minister did not take this opportunity to reduce that age to 18 years.  I do not know what the Minister's view is on this issue.  He has phrased his language very carefully in both Houses when addressing himself to this issue.  He has made reference to the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  I do not know if the Minister is saying to us that there are technical reasons why the law in relation to the free age of marriage should not be changed now or whether he was saying to us that the Government have not decided the question of principle as to whether the age should be reduced.  I would like to have his comments on that.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at the marriage age at the moment &mdash; the fact that a person cannot marry under the age of 16 years without the consent of the President of the High Court and also, if parental consent is refused, the individual has the right between the ages of 16 and 21 to seek the President's consent.  It is interesting to look at the statistics dealing with this which are contained in the Law Reform Commission Report.  These statistics prove one interesting fact in that the President of the High Court dealing, first, with applications filed by people under the age of 16 years, has accepted the bona fides of most such applications.  The figures on page 21 of the report dealing with the law relating to the age of majority, the age for marriage and some connected subjects, are of particular interest. The report, dealing with applications by persons under the age of 16, shows that in the years, 1978 to 1982, inclusive, 12 such applications were processed to conclusion. Of the 12 applications, ten were <Col N="21" /> authorised and accepted as being valid by the President of the High Court and orders under section 1 were made.  Interestingly, in relation to applications under section 7 of the Marriages Act &mdash; applications by people between the ages of 16 and 21 years of age where parental consent was refused &mdash; of 118 applications processed to conclusion the President of the High Court held that 98 applications were valid and that this consent should be given.</P>
    <P>I make this point because it shows, in a very acceptable forum, the way these applications are processed.  Within that forum a judicial personage has accepted that roughly 80 per cent to 90 per cent of such applications by very young people seeking consent to marry, probably under very trying circumstances, should be allowed.  This is a fair guidance and I think the free age of marriage should be reduced to 18 years of age.  We are accepting now that young people should have the right to enter into commercial transactions, that they are deemed to be at arm's length in buying and selling property. We should also accept that there is a similar position by virtue of their earlier maturity in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I would like to refer to.  It is something that, when we are dealing with this issue we should address ourselves to and that is the right of a citizen to become a Member of this House or the other House.  My understanding is that the right will still only become operable when somebody reaches the age of 21 years.  If I am correct in my supposition, I think this issue, at the next available opportunity, should be put to the people.  If the citizen can vote, and if we accept his tax as being equal to anyone else's, if he can be deemed employed or unemployed and have the capacity to enter into contracts then a citizen on reaching the age of 18 years should be entitled to sit in either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I fully support the principle behind the Bill.  I commend our very reforming Minister for Justice for getting this measure before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission in their report entitled &ldquo;Report on the Law relating to the Age of Majority, the Age for Marriage and Some Connected Subjects&rdquo;, LRC5/1983, made a number of very interesting recommendations. They recommended that the age of majority be reduced from 21 years to 18 years of age and that the term &ldquo;minor&rdquo; and not &ldquo;infant&rdquo; be applied to a person who has not reached that age.  They also recommended that on marriage a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; should in law become an adult and should have all the rights and be subject to all the liabilities of a person who has reached the age of majority.</P>
      <P>In regard to the age for marriage the report recommended that the free age for marriage, that is the lowest age at which a person may contract a valid marriage without the consent of a third person, such as a parent or guardian, be also reduced to 18 years in line with the reduction in the age of majority.  It was further recommended in the report that the absolute minimum age for marriage be 16 years.  At present the minimum age for marriage is 16 years but there is a provision enabling the President of the High Court to grant an exemption for a person who has not attained that age.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that a marriage between persons either of whom is under the age of 16 years would be null and void.  In the case of a marriage involving persons, one of whom is a minor, the recommendation is that consent would be mandatory in the case of the minor.  Where the necessary consent had not been obtained the marriage would be null and void also.  In a situation where both guardians refuse consent in the case of a minor, there would be no provision for appeal to the High Court in such a case.</P>
      <P>The report also made a number of recommendations in relation to matters connected with the age of majority.  Some of these were stated in the report of the Law Reform Commission on page 26 as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>that the time at which a person attains a particular age expressed in years <Col N="23" /> should be the commencement of the relevant anniversary of his birth;</P>
    <P>that the jurisdiction over the person or estate of a ward of court should cease when he or she reaches the age of majority;</P>
    <P>that the definition of a child in section 3 of the Adoption Act, 1952 should be amended so that the reference to twenty-one years becomes a reference to the new age of majority;</P>
    <P>that the minimum age requirement for certain prospective adopters should be changed from twenty-one to the age of majority;</P>
    <P>that special transitory provisions relating to such matters as funds in court, wardship and custody orders, powers of trustees during the minority of a beneficiary and limitation of action, should be included in the legislation;</P>
    <P>that new legislation should, in so far as the construction expressions such as &ldquo;full age&rdquo; and &ldquo;infancy&rdquo; is concerned, apply to all statutory enactments and instruments (no matter when passed or made) but not to deeds, wills and other private instruments made before the commencement date of the legislation;</P>
    <P>that section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 be amended so as to bring it into harmony with the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, under which an order for maintenance may be made against a parent in respect of a mentally or physically disabled child who has reached the age of majority.</P>
    <P>In addition to the recommendations to which I have referred the Law Reform Commission's report contained a draft Bill which would give effect to all the recommendations contained in the report.  The explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill is, in my view, a little misleading.  The very first sentence of the explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> The purpose of the Bill is to implement the proposal relating to the age of majority contained in the Law Reform Commission's &ldquo;Report on the Law Relating to the Age of Majority, the Age for Marriage and Some Connected Subjects&rdquo; (LRC5/1983).</P>
    <P>Anybody reading that sentence could be forgiven for thinking that the report of the Law Reform Commission was being implemented in full in the Bill before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody reading the first sentence in the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with this Bill could be forgiven for thinking that the report of the Law Reform Commission was being implemented in full in this Bill. However, on closer examination it transpires that only three of the recommendations contained in the report are being dealt with in the Bill.  On the bottom of page 1 of the explanatory memorandum there is a statement in very small print which states:</P>
      <P>The remaining recommendations in the Report (principally, those relating to the age for marriage and the requirement of parental or court consent for certain marriages and recommendations that certain ages should be changed for the purposes of adoption, income tax and social welfare laws) are being considered separately.</P>
      <P>There is no indication of how long the consideration of these matters will take or what action, if any may be taken on them.  Therefore, whereas a Bill along the lines of the draft Bill contained in the Law Reform Commission report would be quite a substantial legislative measure, there is very little by way of substance in the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2, page 2 of the Law Reform Commission report states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General requested the Commission in December 1975 to undertake an examination of and conduct research into the law relating to <Col N="26" /> majority and, if it is thought fit, to formulate proposals for its reform and submit them to him.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 states:</P>
    <P>As the research progressed it became obvious that the Commission could not limit itself to the simple question of whether or not an alteration should be made in the age of majority and that other related questions would fall to be examined.</P>
    <P>Examples were then given of some of the related matters which the commission felt should be examined in conjunction with an examination of the age of majority. However, the proposals in the Bill before the House deal with the age of majority only and do not touch upon the other matters which the Law Reform Commission considered should be taken in conjunction with any change in the age of majority.  For that reason I believe that the passing of this Bill will result in a number of anomalies in the related areas to which the Law Reform Commission report refers.  The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>The main provision of the Bill proposes a reduction of the age of majority from 21 years to 18 years or earlier on marriage.  Among the other provisions is one to replace the common law rule, under which a person attains a particular age expressed in years on the day before his birthday, with a new rule to the effect that a particular age is attained on the person's birthday.</P>
    <P>I accept that for some years there has been a demand for a reform of the law relating to the age of majority.  The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1972, proposed that the voting age be reduced from 21 to 18.  When this matter came before the people in the referendum on December 7 of that year there was an overwhelming majority in favour of the proposal.  Of the 856,353 valid votes cast, 724,836 were in favour and 131,514 were against.  I accept also that the Law Reform report puts forward a very convincing case in support of its <Col N="27" /> recommendation that on marriage a minor should in law become an adult.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 16, page 8 the commission refer to Article 41.1 of the Constitution which provides as follows:</P>
    <P>1º The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>2º The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 17 of the report states:</P>
    <P>The Commission noted that from this it could be argued that no legal impediments or obstructions should be placed in the way of young married persons solely on the ground of age and that such persons should have the legal capacity to acquire a home and to furnish it.  They should also have the right to establish a trade or business. As a consequence, they should be legally able to borrow money, to incur debts and to undertake contractual obligations.  Third persons should be able to deal with any married minor, secure in the knowledge that the minor will be bound by his transactions.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong case here that on marriage a minor should, in law, become an adult.  The fact that since 1972 young people have been eligible to vote at 18 years has been frequently used as an argument in favour of a reduction in the age of majority to 18 years also.  I believe that the strongest and most compelling argument that was advanced in support of the reduction in the voting age was that many young people between the ages of 18 and 21 were in employment and that they had to pay their taxes the same as everybody else.  Therefore, if one conceded that there was substance or merit in the age old principle of no taxation without representation then there was a <Col N="28" /> very strong case for giving these young people a vote in the election of those who have responsibility for the taxation system.  Since it would be impossible to implement an employment or tax-paying qualification for eligibility to vote, the only way in which these young people could be enfranchised was by reducing the voting age from 21 to 18 years.</P>
    <P>The same argument, however, cannot be used in support of a reduction in the age of majority.  In my view the case for a reduction in the voting age was much stronger than it is for a reduction in the age of majority.  Some of the other arguments which have been advanced for a reduction in the age of majority are not very convincing either.  We are told that Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain are now the only principal European states whose legal systems retain 21 as the age of majority.  We are also reminded that the UK as well as many provinces in the United States and Canada have long since reduced their age of majority to 18 years.  I do not believe that we should be too influenced by what has happened in other jurisdictions. After more than 60 years of independence we should take decisions in relation to such matters on the basis of what is best and most prudent for our particular situation.</P>
    <P>The fact that the age of 21 years is the age of majority has its origins in Norman or English law or the fact that the Brehon Laws do not appear to have recognised any particular age as the age at which a person could be deemed to have reached the requisite level of maturity to make his own decisions are also in my view not very relevant to a consideration of the case for a reduction in the age of majority. Of considerable more relevance is the way in which the legal position of minors in this country has been altered by various statutes especially in recent years.  In addition to the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1973, to which I have already referred, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the Succession Act, 1965, the Juries Act, 1976, and the Family Home Protection Act together with the Family Law Act of 1981 have all <Col N="29" /> extended the rights and responsibilities of minors.  The fact that this has happened indicates that in recent years there has been an ever-growing recognition that 18 years olds can be relied on to act in a mature and responsible way.</P>
    <P>However, it could be argued that while mental maturity is all that is required so that an 18 year old will act in a mature and responsible way, something more is required when one is, for example, entering into a contract or a hire purchase agreement, purchasing property, taking out an insurance policy or borrowing money.  Once the age of majority is reduced, all persons between the ages of 18 and 21 and married persons under 18 will no longer have the legal protection that they had heretofore in these situations. I believe, and in this I agree with Senator Honan, that some legal protection should be available in all these areas to persons under 21 years of age.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is as well aware as I am that there is a minority of unscrupulous individuals operating in all the areas that I have mentioned.  This is a fact of life and certainly it is in no way a reflection on the integrity of the vast majority of people engaged in these areas.  I have no doubt also that the unscrupulous few will not be slow to take advantage of a whole new potential consumer market which will be opened up for them when this Bill becomes law and comes into operation.  If it is possible to amend this Bill to provide protection against exploitation for persons under 21 in the areas I have mentioned I would ask the Minister to consider doing so on Committee Stage.  If it is not possible to provide such protection in this Bill, I feel it should be done by amending the existing legislation which regulates hire purchase, money lending, insurance and so on.</P>
    <P>In any event, I ask the Minister to delay the coming into operation of this legislation.  It is proposed that when passed this measure will come into operation on 1 March 1985, that is only a few weeks away.  I believe that certain things should be done before it comes into operation.  This legislation will change the <Col N="30" /> legal status of many thousands of young people.  The Minister in his Second Stage speech mentioned the figure of upwards of 200,000.  On the day that this legislation comes into operation all these people will be vulnerable to the dangers to which I have referred.  I believe they should be put on their guard by alerting them to the implications of this legislation and the danger of exploitation which it may involve for them.  This should be done through an extensive media campaign to publicise this legislation and the date on which it will come into operation.  I do not believe there will be sufficient time between its passing and March to mount an effective publicity campaign.  Therefore, I consider that the coming into operation of the measure should be deferred to a later date.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to say that this is very welcome, progressive and desirable legislation because it will make it possible for a person under 21 to get a county council loan or to buy a home or property. I, too, welcome the fact that it will make all these things possible but I fear very much that it will also leave the very people whom it is intended to serve vulnerable to an unnecessary degree.  If that happens then the legislation will have created as many problems as it will have solved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill lowering the age of majority from 21 to 18.  For such a young country we have been slow to enact this reform.  I note that the Minister referred to amendments which he made on Committee Stage in the other House in relation to provisions for maintenance and for custody to ensure that these provisions would continue under the Guardianship of Infants Act and under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act until the person was 21.  That is provided under the Bill.  That is a very desirable amendment and I am glad that he acceded to submissions in that regard which were made in the other House when the Bill was debated on Second Stage.  I hope that this indicates an openness of mind on his part because my purpose in seeking to <Col N="31" /> contribute on this Bill was to draw attention to an omission and to make a strong case for its inclusion but I find that a number of other Senators have also drawn attention to the omission.</P>
      <P>Senator Eoin Ryan was the first to point to the fact that this Bill, although it deals with the age of majority, does not deal with the age of marriage although the Law Reform Commission report dealt with both the age of majority and the age of marriage as being very closely and almost necessarily interlinked.  Subsequently Senator Durcan supported the inclusion of the amendment of the age of marriage and other Senators also made the same point.  I want to focus on that aspect in making my contribution because we are going to have a number of unnecessary but quite significant anomalies by proceeding to enact a measure which will lower the age of majority but which will not affect the provisions in relation to the age of marriage and the fact that under the law the position will continue to be that a person under 21 requires the consent of a guardian or else has to apply to court.  Indeed there are other reasons for seeking to amend the age of marriage.</P>
      <P>Both in the other House and this House the Minister referred to the fact that the age of marriage is not a matter which is to be dealt with in this Bill.  He said he would not include in this Bill the age of marriage because the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown had yet to report.  The reason given appeared to be that he was awaiting the report of the Joint Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no secret &mdash; it has been made public in various ways &mdash; that the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown have agreed their recommendation on the age for marriage.  There is no contention about it.  They have agreed that the free age should be 18, that that should also be the age at which a person can enter into a valid marriage.  A marriage under the age of 18 would be void unless the person has obtained the consent of guardians and of the court.  The committee were in very broad agreement and <Col N="32" /> dealt with that in the text of the final report which is not a matter of contention. What puzzles me is that I seem to recall that very recently, certainly since the New Year, the Minister referred to the fact that the Government intend to bring in legislation providing that the free age of marriage will be 18 and that they intend to make the necessary changes. Therefore, it is difficult to see what the impediment is to dealing with this issue in the legislation now before this House. There are compelling reasons why it should be dealt with in this legislation because we have here a Bill which could be amended in order to include provisions in relation to the age of marriage without any undue complications.</P>
    <P>Probably it would require an amendment to include it in the Long Title and then the necessary section to provide for that amendment.  The Bill would, of course, require to be returned to the Dáil for the Dáil to consider and, I hope, accept those amendments.  There does not seem to be any reason either for technicality or complication why this could not be done.  The compelling reasons why I would submit it should be done has to do with the whole difficulty of enacting legislative proposals.  It appears to take a very lengthy period for any measure, even an uncomplicated measure, to go through the pre-legislative stage, the stage of getting Cabinet approval, of getting the observations from the Department, of being drafted, of coming back to Cabinet for final approval and being published as a Bill.  All of that seems to take a very long time with the result that it may be that it would be a year or even several years before we could anticipate a Bill to deal with the age of marriage.  It could be, therefore, that we will have lowered the age of majority, as the Minister indicated in his speech, to take effect from 1 March 1985 but will continue a situation where full adults from a legal point of view still need the consent of their parents to marry if they seek to marry between the age of 18 and 21.</P>
    <P>Similarly, for strong social reasons I support the raising of the minimum age <Col N="33" /> for marriage.  I certainly endorse what the Leas-Chathaoirleach said on the age of marriage.  It was a very strongly supported view in the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown on all sides of the House that it was undesirable for strong social reasons that persons would marry under the age of 18, that if it was to happen it should be in very exceptional circumstances and that we should, therefore, raise the marriage age.</P>
    <P>All of this should be done now.  It should be done in this Bill.  There is really no major reason why not or if there is the Minister now has the burden of spelling out why it is not possible to make this necessary reform in the course of this legislation.  It is evident that there is all-party support for making the change.  I think we are becoming impatient with the delay in securing the enactment of social legislation.  Therefore, when there is a Bill before us under which it could be done, when the subject is being treated on the basis of a Law Reform Commission report which dealt with both the age of majority and the various aspects of the age of marriage, it seems desirable that they would be dealt with in the same measure.</P>
    <P>The only other point I want to make on this Bill, because I endorse many of the other comments that were made by Senators in relation to it, is that I agree with those Senators who emphasised the significance of the change for the young people affected, approximately 200,000, who as of 1 March 1985 will have full legal capacity but also the responsibility of that capacity.  I share some of the concerns expressed by Members of the House about the position of 18 years olds in our society.  I would just like to add to what has been said that it does place further emphasis on the need for our education to be an education for living, for our secondary education in particular to lay enormous emphasis on the rights, responsibilities, duties and even the practical realities of young people who are facing into adulthood at the age of 18, who are facing into full responsibility.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Honan that we should ensure that 18 year old do not <Col N="34" /> feel that they are being somehow isolated or alienated from their families and parents at that age.  It is a capacity that does not mean they have to distance themselves but it does mean that they need to be much more prepared in a very practical sense for the implications.  I would also agree that the full implications of this Bill should be the subject of very extensive communication, of media coverage, which should be perhaps associated with a greater attempt to ensure that young adults and not so young adults have a greater awareness of their legal position and have greater access to advice.  This is one of the great problems we have, that there is not easy access to legal advice at a very early stage which could avoid the possibility of individuals encountering very serious legal difficulties. We need a better support structure of advice bureaux, of the FLAC centres or the various ways in which young people if they have any doubts can have access, without having to incur legal costs in that regard, to reliable advice on their rights in a particular situation.</P>
    <P>Therefore I support the Bill as it stands but I share very strongly the views expressed from all sides of the House that the Bill should be expanded by amendment to include the whole issue of the age of marriage and contain the necessary reforms which have the endorsement of the Law Reform Commission and the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and, which unless my recollection is inaccurate, are matters which the Government intend to make changes on and, therefore, could make them while this legislation is still before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to implement proposals relating to the age of majority contained in the report of the Law Reform Commission, the age for marriage and other such connected subjects.  It is appropriate that we should reduce the age of majority.  I know it has been suggested that we are influenced by other European countries and by states in the US, but we can stand on our own two feet in regard to this matter.  The youth of Ireland have become far more <Col N="35" /> mature in recent years.  They are maturing earlier.  They are a better educated group of people than we have ever had in our history.  Some people are of the opinion that the youth are only interested in social problems such as divorce, contraception and areas like that.  From my own practical knowledge of the young men and women of Ireland they are now very seriously concerned with their careers.  They are concerned with bread and butter issues, with getting permanent jobs for themselves, with having careers and better lives for the future.  In the knowledge that we have a recession these are the things that are worring the young people, not the other issues suggested by some people.</P>
      <P>The age of majority has been mentioned already.  Regrettably, there is reference to only three of the items dealt with by the Law Reform Commission. There has been criticism here already today, and probably correctly, that in some way we did not deal with the question of the age of marriage as well.  It is proper that we should query the exclusion from the Bill of the Law Reform Commission's proposal relating to marriage.  They are saying that the free age should be 18 years without the consent of the parent or guardian.  The Joint Committee on Legislation studied this problem and they felt that they should not recommend or fully discuss the age of marriage for the reason that there was a committee dealing with marriage breakdown whose report is expected fairly soon.  The Joint Committee on Legislation confined their study to the matter of the age of majority as referred to in the commission's report and they gave very good reasons and one would probably have to agree with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the age of marriage to be discussed and taken in this Bill but I can see the Minister's thinking behind it.  It was suggested that this matter can be dealt with by the Minister for Health and it does not require full legislation, that it can be carried out in that way, but this is one of the weaknesses.  There are other weaknesses in the Bill.  The very fact that <Col N="36" /> only three of the items referred to by the Law Reform Commission are dealt with in the Bill indicates a weakness.  We are being too specific in this Bill and if we were producing an Age of Majority Bill then we should have gone the full way.</P>
    <P>Obviously this Bill has many benefits for the young people of Ireland.  If they can get married then any legal obstacle should be removed for those young people who might wish to receive finance to set themselves up in a home or for life. One could argue &mdash; and this is another weakness in the Bill &mdash; that if they can vote at 18 years surely they could stand for office in the Dáil, county council or Seanad elections.</P>
    <P>There is a weakness also in the whole area of social welfare.  The details are not spelled out sufficiently.  For example, people over 18 years who are living at home and who apply for unemployment benefit should be assessed on their own. They should not be assessed on the basis of the parents' incomes.</P>
    <P>Generally the Bill is quite limited.  It is quite specific.  In the area of local government many young couples have come to me over the years &mdash; married at the age of 25, responsible young couples &mdash; who wished to get an SDA loan or a loan from a building society but found that they could not do so.  With the income available they would have qualified for an appropriate loan, yet they were debarred. If couples can get married the obstacles preventing them from getting SDA loans and other housing finance agency loans should be removed.</P>
    <P>I am assuming &mdash; the Minister might reply to this &mdash; that the tenancy of local authority houses will be available to couples 18 years and over as a result of this Bill being passed.  I note that the operational date for this Bill is 1 March.  I need not remind the House of the unfortunate situation we have in Athlone, known as the Nancy O'Donnell case.  One of the principal arguments put forward by the county manager was that Nancy O'Donnell was not of the proper qualified age &mdash; she was 18 years old at the time of her father's death.  This raises an interesting point.  I now understand that the county <Col N="37" /> manager has decided to appeal the District Court case of 8 January to the Circuit Court.  I think the appeal will take place some time towards the end of February. If this Bill is operational on 1 March I wonder what effect, if any, the passing of this Bill will have on that case. It will be debated, I am sure, and will cause some interest for the future.</P>
    <P>Overall I support the Bill.  We have made the decision ourselves, the Irish people, about the age of majority and we have not been influenced by other countries.  People are maturing more quickly than previously and they are better educated.  Generally a reduction in the age of majority will be welcome. There will be criticisms on both sides of the House of the fact that other areas have not been spelled out or dealt with. Nevertheless I support the principles of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>To be against this Bill would be like an American politician being against motherhood or apple pie, it just would not be understood.  For that reason we should be grateful to Senator Mullooly for the views which he put on record regarding his concern about the Bill.  It is much too easy to overlook the fact that there are two sides to the story, that it is not a simple matter of giving recognition to people between the ages of 18 and 21, but that in giving them that recognition we are placing upon them considerable potential obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The movement towards the reduction of the age of majority &mdash; which has the overwhelming support of the Members of both Houses &mdash; is understandable and is explainable by the earlier age at which people reach physical maturity and financial independence compared with children of previous generations.  However, it surprises me that we should consider it necessary to reduce the age of majority in one jump from 21 years to 18 years.  I have no particular problem in supporting the concept of majority at 18 years, but I am surprised that the Minister has not given some consideration to the reduction of the age on a phased basis.  It would appear prudent to reduce the age to 20 <Col N="38" /> and to let a year or two pass &mdash; even if it was contained in the Bill that a further reduction could be made by a resolution of the joint Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; to see how that worked and what effect it had before taking the irrevocable step of reducing the age of majority to 18.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly must also be congratulated for pointing out a number of truths, which may not be very comfortable for people who are between the ages of 18 and 21.  Lest anyone should forget it, I was between 18 and 21 on one occasion also, as was every Member of this House. Therefore, we are not talking about anything which did not apply to ourselves during that time.  Between the ages of 18 and 21 citizens, children, adults &mdash; whatever you want to call them &mdash; have reached a very vital time in their lives where those of them who are not pursuing third level education are in some class of training course or employment or are looking for work.  A substantial but increasing minority of these people are receiving full time education.  It should be our objective to ensure that that is a growing minority.  The condition of being in receipt of full time education &mdash; when that condition follows directly from post-primary education &mdash; is not a time of one's life when the duties and responsibilities of citizenship weigh very heavily on the individual.  They are a minority anyway &mdash; I will consider them again later.</P>
    <P>Some Members have spoken about the fact that the citizens decided to extend the franchise to those of 18 years and upwards.  That is very significant because it supports the idea that there is a general welcome for measures of this kind, but we should distinguish between the privilege of voting and the kind of obligations which are going to be an opportunity which will be presented by this legislation. Voting is an occasional privilege. It is not a solitary privilege.  When we exercise our vote we do so in common with many other people of the same generation as ourselves, and any individual's view is tempered by the view of the remainder of the citizens.</P>
    <P>However, an individual who is entering into a financial contract is not entering <Col N="39" /> into a financial contract on behalf of the country.  He is not entering into a financial contract part of which will have to be borne by other people.  He is entering into a financial contract which is personal to himself.  It is a decision which will have great significance for him personally in his future life.  It is not like voting where his views are watered down as all our views are watered down by the number of people who exercise their franchise, and the will of the people is exercised and ascertained in that way.</P>
    <P>The contracts which we are permitting people between 18 and 21 to enter into will be personal to them.  They will have financial consequences for them which may extend for years to come.  Therefore they are of a much more personal and far reaching kind than the responsibilities which the occasional privilege of voting gives rise to for the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>It has been said here today that because people pay taxes the franchise should be extended to them or alternatively they should in some way be entitled to be treated as adults.  The reality is that even a child of two or three years of age who has an income will pay taxes.  Everybody who earns money will pay taxes; it does not start at 18 years of age.  A child who happens to have a gift or talent out of which he or she makes money, will be liable, directly or indirectly, for taxation.</P>
    <P>We are talking about something which has gone too far and has too wide support of the community to consider it fundamentally at this stage.  The majority of the people between 18 and 21 will be able to carry the additional responsibility which will be put on them.  However, it is important that this responsibility should be explained to them.  In that regard I support what Senator Mullooly said and its endorsement by Senator Robinson with regard to a dignified form of publicity on the effect of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister made an amendment with regard to the question of maintenance. <Col N="40" /> He has responded to pressure in the other House, obviously in an openminded way, but I do not think he has thought the matter through.  The position is described well in the Law Reform Commission report, Working Paper No. 2, 1977 at pages 56 and following, rather than the report, summarises the responsibility of parents to maintain their children. Basically it says that there is an absolute duty on parents to maintain children up to 16 years of age and beyond that there is a responsibility in two circumstances. One is the question of a child suffering mental or physical disability. The second is the question of an order made under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 where the person in respect of whom the maintenance order is made is receiving full-time education or instruction at a university, college or other educational establishment and is under 21 years of age.  There is a two tier system.  There is a responsibility to maintain one's child up to 16 years of age if the child leaves school, but if the child happens to continue at school &mdash; up to now that position would be probably a joint decision between the child and the parent but ultimately a decision for the parents &mdash; then the responsibility is extended to 21 years.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two comments about that.  First of all I do not see any good reason why the responsibility to maintain children should cease at 16 years of age and not at the age of majority. It might, however, be going outside the scope of this Bill to amend the law in that regard.  An amendment of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976 might be more appropriate. However, if one refers it to the question of imposing a duty on parents to maintain children until they reach the age of majority its relevance to this Bill will become apparent.  I do not see any reason why children should not be able to expect maintenance from their parents up to the time they reach their majority. If the majority is going to be 18 years of age now, that appears to be very reasonable. <Col N="41" /> That is not to say that in all cases the legal right of the children will be insisted on, but it is there as a safeguard to be used if necessary.  I would like to recommend that, since the Minister gave some consideration to the question of the maintenance of children he should give further consideration between this and Committee Stage in this House to whether that should be further amended to include the raising of the responsibility up to the age of majority.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the amendment which the Minister brought in which provided that the maintenance of children in receipt of full-time education should continue until 21.  I do not think that makes sense. I understand the reason for it and I understand that in reality many children will be maintained by their parents not only up to 21 but far beyond that if they are in full-time education, but we are not talking here about what the moral or social obligation of parents should be.  We are talking about the legal framework.  If we believe that people are sufficiently mature at 18 to become adults, why should we impose on another adult the obligation of maintaining them?  It is a double think.  Deep down we do not think that children between 18 and 21 are full adults, we only pretend that they are.  We feel it necessary to impose an obligation on another adult who happens to be their parent to maintain them if they happen to be in full-time education.</P>
    <P>There are three concepts in the law to which it would be useful to refer.  There is the question of maintenance, the question of custody and the question of guardianship. Maintenance is the payment of money or support in a financial way. Where there is a dispute between parents, one is said to have been awarded the custody and the other is not, or in non-disputed cases both parents would have the custody of the children.  The question of guardianship is more vague than that but it is also an important legal principle.  It can be best demonstrated by this: where there is dispute between the husband and wife with regard to the custody of a child and one or the other is awarded custody &mdash; very often that <Col N="42" /> happens to be the wife or the mother, and that is the normal decision which is arrived at &mdash; the partner who is not awarded the custody of the child retains guardianship.  In other words that partner retains the right to have a say in the future of the child, for example in deciding what college or university the child will go to, whether that child will pursue third level education and so on.</P>
    <P>On that basis, even where a parent has not custody of a child, that parent still retains a right to have a say and be consulted with regard to the future of that child.  Payment under 21 years in pursuance of a scheme which had been agreed between the parents and the children is the context in which the extension to 21 years under the 1976 Act must be seen. Now guardianship is going to be removed, and that parent will have no right to say what the 18-year-old will do.  At 17 the child may have decided to go to work and at 18 might decide of his own volition to go to university and reimpose an obligation on his parent with regard to maintenance without the parent having any right to even be consulted with regard to the future of that person who is now not a child.  This is woolly thinking.  Why should one adult who has no right to be consulted with regard to the future of a citizen be under a financial obligation to support that citizen in a decision which that citizen takes and over which that adult has no control?  I am very anxious to hear the Minister's view on that, and I will give him the opportunity of pursuing it in Committee.  This has not been properly thought out.</P>
    <P>I do not know on what basis a citizen of this country can be forced to maintain another citizen over whom he has no control whatsoever.  I doubt if that can be done.  Therefore I recommend that the Minister should change the age to which maintenance applies upwards from 16 to 18 in respect of people who are not in receipt of education and downwards from 21 to 18 in respect of people who are, so that the same legal privileges will attach to people who are in receipt of education and those who are not.</P>
    <P>On the question of marriage, it is my <Col N="43" /> honour to be a member of the Joint Committee on Legislation who were appointed by this House for the purpose of examining various matters.  Among the matters which we are asked to examine are the reports of the Law Reform Commission, which are very interesting documents. During the examination of the report on the law relating to the age of marriage and some connected subjects to which the Minister so generously referred in his introductory speech, some consideration was given to whether we should make a recommendation with regard to the question of marriage.  It was represented to the committee and decided unanimously that because the matter was being discussed by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown it would not be appropriate for us to make a recommendation. The Minister has followed that logic also, and I have considerable sympathy for him in that regard.</P>
    <P>It may be that we have been informed of some of the views of the committee, it may be that some of their views have been leaked to the press, it may be that Members who happen to be members of the committee said in the House today that their view was that 18 should be the age of majority, but there are other considerations.  If we are going to change the age at which a person has the right to marry then it should be changed from 21 to 18 because to do otherwise is to be as illogical as I suggested the new rule on maintenance would be.  To change the age from 21 to 18 has unanimous support, in so far as I am aware, of both Houses of the Oireachtas, but what may not have the unanimous support of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas is the raising of the age at which marriage will be permitted from its present level to 16 or 18 years.  As reported by some of the Senators, it appears that the recommendation would be that 18 would also be the minimum age for marriage and that that minimum age would be capable of being set aside by application to the court or by consent of the parents.  There are those of us who might not agree with that and who might feel that no marriages <Col N="44" /> should be entered into by persons under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>A further examination of that possibility might be significant and important, particularly when one takes into account the present law with regard to the indissolubility of marriage in this country.  We must make our laws, recognising what our other laws are.  We should make it quite difficult for people to get married because they are entering on a most extraordinary contract which even with the approval of both parties cannot be rescinded.  I have no objection to the Age of Majority Bill being expanded to include the question of marriage, but it is not a simple matter of reducing the age from 21 to 18.  The question of the increase of the minimum age has also to be considered and, having agreed to an increase in the minimum age to 18, there is also the possibility to be considered of any exceptions being allowed to that and, if so, in what circumstances.</P>
    <P>Having spoken about those matters and congratulated particularly Senator Mullooly on the clarity of thought with which he displayed his knowledge of the problems which may arise in this regard, and recognising that those problems are very real, nevertheless I think that the reduction of the age of majority from 21 years is a step to be welcomed and the Bill in so far as it seeks to achieve that has my support.  The other matters, particularly the one regarding maintenance, can be pursued on Committee Stage and I hope that the Minister will give some consideration to the problems that I have raised.  My interpretation of the law in that regard may be incorrect, but I think it is correct and I hope the Minister will have a further look at that matter to see what changes he might consider in the light of the representations I have made.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill.  The determination of the Minister in bringing in legislation of this kind as well as other kinds is to be commended, and I hope that we will have a very fruitful Committee Stage discussion of the Bill when the various problems which I and other Senators have raised and additional problems can be discussed at great length.</P>
    <Col N="45" />
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator O'Leary for a very clear speech.  The freedom of the back benches appears to have relieved him of some of the woollier thinking of Fine Gael.  It would be unfair for me to wish this to continue, but I wish that the clarity of his speeches would continue.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in principle and I welcome the spirit behind the Bill.  It is undoubtedly a recognition of the importance of our young people and the huge numbers of young people in this country proportionately today.  It is also a recognition of the growing maturity of our young people.  There are certain aspects of the Bill with which I suspect every Members of this House disagrees but symbolically it recognises that 50 per cent of our young people are under 25 and it recognises their significance.  It recognises the trend in other countries, in Great Britain, in the United States and in Europe where the age of majority has been progressively reduced.  This is not true everywhere but generally throughout the world this is the case.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that it is terribly important where you actually pitch the age of majority.  Indeed, it is impossible to get it right because the maturity of some 18 year olds and some 21 year olds varies enormously.  People of 12 to 15 are quite capable of taking responsibility and making what we would call mature decisions whereas some people over the age of 40 are still incapable of making what we would consider to be mature decisions. It is important that there should be consistency.  While the trend in the Bill should be welcomed, there is a problem about the consistency in the Bill which Senator O'Leary pointed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish in any way to repeat what most Senators who have contributed said already but I question what the Minister meant when he said that the Government regard the age of marriage as a separate issue from the age of majority.  I believe that, if you are going to recognise that people of a certain age have reached maturity, whether it be at 16, 18 or 21, you must also recognise that they are capable of making a mature decision <Col N="46" /> about marriage.  I cannot see why it should be different.  I cannot see why, as a rule, it should be a separate issue, nor have I ever been able to see why there should be any such thing as parental consent at all in the case of marriage.  In the case of marriage you have to recognise the right of someone to make that decision and that the whole concept of parental consent, whether it is in regard to 16 or 18, should be abolished and should not be recognised by law.</P>
    <P>I was also a little disappointed to hear the Minister say that the Government are unwilling to make any decision on the age of marriage before the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown because I am afraid to say that the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown is a very movable, a very doubtful thing.  This committee are due to report now for the third time on 19 February and this, according to the Minister, will have to be given full and careful consideration.  The Government should be able to make a decision on this and other matters independent of what the committee say because I do not believe that the decisions of the committee are guaranteed to be implemented at any stage in the life of this Parliament and the Government could make that decision now without referring it back.</P>
    <P>There is also an inconsistency in regard to maintenance.  There is an inconsistency in giving the right to maintenance orders to those over 18 in fulltime education. I can understand the reasons behind this.  I can understand why perhaps this right should be given to people well over 21, which is the limit of it.  The Minister said no further.  In the interests of consistency we cannot have this old figure of 21 remaining in our minds.  We have gone half the way.  We have to abolish the idea of two ages of majority.  When this Bill is passed we will have a two-tier system where the age of majority is 18 for some things and 21 for others.  This again is inconsistent because we are talking about when people are mature enough and responsible enough to make mature and responsible decisions.  If they can make <Col N="47" /> one responsible decision they should be able to make another.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent this Bill is creating an elite between the age of 18 to 21 for those in full time education.  It should be recognised by this Bill that 18 to 21 year olds should not only be able to have the privileges of the age of majority but they should also have the obligation of being able to maintain themselves.  Perhaps it is not so palatable but if this Bill is to mean anything it has to be balanced and, as the Minister said, those who make contracts and incur debts, which 18 year olds would be able to do, should also be able to fulfil the terms of those contracts and also have to pay those debts.  Similarly, those people should be able, as normal adults, to maintain themselves in the State and not be given any extra benefits.</P>
    <P>There are other inconsistencies in the Bill.  One which has been mentioned already is that nobody between the age of 18 and 21 can become a Member of the Oireachtas.  The practical reason for this is because it would require a referendum. I do not believe this is a good reason.  It is a practical reason but it should be said that &ldquo;No, we are not prepared to have a referendum on this particular subject at the moment&rdquo;.  There was a referendum in 1972 which reduced the age for voting from 21 to 18.  At the same time, I believe we should have reduced the age for Members of the Oireachtas from 21 to 18 because again there is an inconsistency there.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to say what effect the Bill will have, if any &mdash; I suspect he will say none because it is a separate issue &mdash; on the age of criminal responsibility. I know that there is a Children Bill on the way which is meant to deal with that, but it is only right that if you are conveying privileges and obligations on those at 18, if you are saying that people are mature and responsible at the age of 18 and they can make adult decisions, you must implicitly be saying that those under the age of 18 are incapable of making fully adult decisions.  It is a logical <Col N="48" /> conclusion from this that the age of criminal responsibility should be raised not from seven, where it stands at the moment, to 11 or 12, which is being bandied around, but that it should be raised fully to the age of 18.  That is the full logic of this Bill and I would like to have the Minister's comments on whether he feels that we should have a third tier where people are capable of making decisions, that maybe the age of criminal responsibility should be 12 or 13.  It would be inconsistent, I hope that we will be mature enough to raise the age of criminal responsibility to the age of 18 as the logic of this Bill would suggest.</P>

      <P>As a layman I see the Bill as being non-contentious.  Obviously the people who have legal training see some contention ever though in the main they welcome the Bill.  Senator O'Leary made a point about one adult carrying another adult financially.  Maybe it is not a good analogy but there is nothing new in that. The PAYE workers are carrying other individuals.  There is nothing extraordinary about that particular situation.  We are subsidising third level education and there is nothing extraordinary about that and many who are being subsidised are adults.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson made the point about bringing in the age of marriage from the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  It would be unwise of any Minister to start taking piecemeal proposals out of the committee which has got itself into a lot of argument and where at this point there is not harmony.  Even if that situation did not arise, it would be wrong to take something piecemeal out of any committee and start giving effect to it in other legislation.  This would cause all sorts of problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note something like 29 Acts are either altered or affected by the introduction of the Age of Majority Bill.  It is indicative of the fact that there were many problems in introducing some of the things that have been mentioned by the other legal people here.  It must present certain difficulties and there must be some good reason.  A layman appreciates that there <Col N="49" /> were difficulties in bringing about some of the things raised by Senators Mullooly, O'Leary and Robinson.</P>
    <P>It is not a good analogy but I can think back to when there was not much concern when we were allowing 16 year olds to go over to England, join the army, fight in the war and take on responsibility. They were not educated and they had not the benefit of modern communication.  I see the situation as being totally different now, with the educational process, raising the standard of education, communication and the general access which people have for putting pressure on.  The person of 18 years today is a different person to a person of 18 in the thirties, forties or fifties.</P>
    <P>It is only proper that they should get those rights.  I do not suggest that the 200,000 would come into a single entity and become a pressure group.  Inevitably, like every other pressure group for family law and illegitimacy they would become a pressure group.  This will circumvent that and will also open up opportunities for the people when they get these rights to look for further rights.</P>
    <P>I said that because of the educational standards it was only fitting that we gave them those rights.  We are increasing their share of responsibility to people at 18 years of age.  To leave things as they are, in present day circumstances, could lead to the point where the feeling of oppression would grow among the majority of the 200,000 we referred to.  They have earned the trust from us to be given more security.  This has been done in altering many of the Bills affecting the age of majority in order to facilitate those people to pursue their rights and in coming to grips with things which up until now they could not get their teeth into.</P>
    <P>Nowadays people at 18 years of age want control over their own affairs.  Some Senator mentioned that people are much more independent.  They want to leave home earlier, live in flats and lead their own lives.  Even if they live in the city they want to move away to another residence. They do not want to be under family control all the time.  It is an indication that they want independence and they <Col N="50" /> want to be able to agitate from a stronger point of view.  They are, in the main, people who have studied hard and learned well.  It is understandable that they would have a great desire to assert themselves more in society.</P>
    <P>It must be appreciated by legislators that in those circumstances they must be given a leg up.  This will assist them to pursue fuller enhancement.  They will show appreciation by expressing solidarity with people as a whole.  At the moment we are talking about single entities but when we will come to the question of dealing with a national youth policy, it will be quite clear that whilst we are talking about youth we will not be talking about them in the context of a single entity.  This will be appreciated and solidarity will emerge from the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are only deluding ourselves if we think people do not want this responsibility and they will not be able to handle it.  They want more say not only in their own affairs but in national affairs as well and in things that affect their day-to-day life.</P>
    <P>Some Senators spoke of maturity earlier on.  I agree that there are people who are immature up to any age.  I do not want to lose votes, but I think if one searched hard enough in both Houses, one would find a few immature people around the age of 40 years and maybe beyond.  We are talking about the greater majority of the people in the 200,000 category.  They are the people who have matured and have got a good education. They have also got to the stage where the maturing process, disciplining and learning to socialise has become different to what it was years ago.  I would have argued some time ago that a fellow was still trying to find his way up to 25 years of age and may be beyond but I do not think this is the case any more.  Generally speaking they have got over their adolescent fears such as lack of self-confidence that I witnessed in my lifetime.</P>
    <P>This maturity is evident in the way they handle shocks and disappointments in life.  Years ago, people used to take a disappointment seriously and they were <Col N="51" /> totally depressed.  Most of the young people nowadays take a disappointment as a setback.  They do not see it as a disappointment.  If one deals with many people in that particular age group who have any sort of learning at all, one realises that those shocks and disappointments are seen not as a disappointment in the sense of total collapse but rather as a temporary setback.  They know how to handle it and get on with living and trying to get themselves back into the firing line again.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with 18 year olds who are much more responsible.  Despite the crime and violence we read about, which gets very extensive headlines and vast media coverage, you find they are more dependable when you get to grips with actually dealing with them in group situations and so on.  My experience with the young people I have dealt with is that they are more ready now to carry the load than a lot of people in my time.  It would be wrong to argue that everybody in the 200,000 can distinguish between romance and reality.  We have got a lot of them around.  I will not mention which party they are in.  There are still many romantics around who cannot distinguish between romance and reality.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, as a layman, about the question of phraseology.  People who are legally trained can just pick up the Bill and go through it.  It takes me much longer to read and understand the Bill. Sometimes we say a few Hail Marys for the drafters and we wish they could be a little more explicit.  It is difficult to understand some of the matters.  When I first read it, I admit to being confused and I thought that if a fellow got married he could vote, even if he was only 16 years of age but when I re-read it I discovered that that was not the case.  We are dealing with a different sort of person than we were years ago.</P>
    <P>I support the people who were worried about many of the points raised here earlier, about guardianship, dependence, marriage age and so on.  I do not think that would hold any longer.  Even though we hear talk about many marriage breakdowns and so on we cannot lay the blame <Col N="52" /> on the age of marriage solely as the cause of marriage breakdown.  Many people get married nowadays and say that if it does not work out they will split up.  That is an attitude in life at the present time.  It is not always attributable to 18 year olds. We should not confuse ourselves into thinking that marriage breakdowns will cease as a result of the age of majority or the marriage age, whatever it is.  There are other factors in relationships that cause breakdowns.  We should not allow that to go as a reason why the Bill should not be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the Law Reform Commission on the depth of understanding they have had and the wide ranging attitude they had to exploring all avenues.  I commend the Minister on bringing in the Bill.  It will lead to other rights for people.  One point which the Minister probably appreciates is that if somebody complains about being hungry and you feed him, once he has the food, he wants other things.  Family planning will be part of those rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution on Second Stage will be very brief.  I feel I can make a more meaningful input on Committee Stage and I will ask a number of questions then.  This is a very important and necessary Bill, even though I regret that it is so limited in scope.  I was very interested in the anecdote in the Minister's introductory speech when he told us that historically the 21 years was based on the physical development of a young man who would be fit to wear the heavy armour and sword to fight for his feudal overlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The age of majority should be related to the mental development of a person. In this sense we could say that it is an implementation of the old adage that the pen is mightier than the sword.  In this day and age with our education, television and the media, young people are far more developed mentally than we were when we were their age.  In my experience, and I think the experience of every other Member of the House who would have problems in the housing area, there was a grave problem where a young <Col N="53" /> couple under 21 years of age tried to get a mortgage.  There was the disability the Minister referred to.  It is very difficult to understand this anomaly.  It is even more difficult to understand where one of the partners was over 21 years of age.  The problem still existed, once one of them was under 21 years of age.  I am glad that this Bill brings that to an end.  Although young people could vote at 18 years since 1972 they were not capable of taking out a mortgage.  There was a certain amount of cynicism for that reason.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Members of the House have paid tribute to the Law Reform Commission.  I would like to join in paying a tribute to the important and painstaking work they have done and the valuable work they have done in presenting this report.  There are 75 pages in the document and 29 are taken up with the actual report.  The balance is given over to a draft Bill.  It is a pity that that Bill could not be accepted in its entirety on account of so much work having gone into it.  The Minister said that some of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission are not being implemented in the Bill as it was considered that they would be more appropriately dealt with as separate matters.  The age of consent was one of these.  The Minister stated that the Government considers that the question of the appropriate minimum age for marriage constitutes a separate subject from that of the age of majority and that it would be desirable to deal with it as a separate issue.  If that is so, why did the Law Reform Commission include it in their report?  It is part of the same subject.  It is a grave mistake that it was not included as part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the detail about calculating the person's age, the Minister told us that section 4 of the Bill implements the commission's proposal to abolish the existing common law rule for calculating a person's age.  At present a person is deemed, under common law, to attain a particular age at the commencement of the day before his birthday.  The Minister says that this is illogical and artificial.  I cannot see anything illogical or artificial about it.  It is simply saying that the year <Col N="54" /> is calculated on the first moment of the day preceding the birthday.  The Minister stated that if a person's birthday falls on a Saturday he is deemed to have reached the relevant age at midnight on the preceding Thurdsay.  It is actually the first moment of the Friday.  I do not see anything illogical and artificial about it.  I agree that this tidies it up.  I do not see any practical benefit whatever in it.  I would like to know if it helps out in any situation beyond just tidying up this matter.  Has it any other benefit?  I will have questions to ask on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, this will apply to 200,000 new people.  From that point of view and also for the reasons I have said it is a very important and very necessary piece of legislation, but I do regret that it does not include all the matters which were considered by the Law Reform Commission and that therefore its scope is restricted in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It recognises the responsible attitudes of our youthful population which are being extended and formalised.  By constitutional amendment 18 year olds were given a vote.  So, in a way, the Oireachtas is only catching up on the wishes of the people.  We should and do realise the value of our young people to our country and our community.  They are the source of courage, change, innovation and hope for us.  Their political maturity will have an increasing voice in Ireland's affairs.</P>
      <P>With the additional freedoms allowed by this Bill we must create responsible institutions for the exercise of our youths' idealism, creativity and enthusiasm. They are entitled to and must get democratic institutions to outlet their energies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make two suggestions about this Bill.  First of all, not all 18 year olds have the maturity generally shared by that age group.  This could lead to their being in a position of being unable to cope with certain transactions.  I will give an example which I recently came across. This year there was an 18 year old who was a plaintiff in an accident and there <Col N="55" /> was a substantial sum in court for him. His parents conducted this case for him and yet, as I understand it, are not entitled to apply to a court to prevent or modify the payment out of a large sum. In this day and age investment requires experience and guidance.  A simple mechanism requiring the parent or next friend to consent to or be notified of the payment out, with liberty to explain to a judge any problem they see, would be advisable.  Another aspect that may need looking at is the total freedom of a young person to enter a substantial hire purchase or financial agreement without due consideration.  I think in England one has three months to make up one's mind after signing the initial contract.</P>
    <P>Overall, I would like to point out that legislation is increasing all the time.  A large number of qualifications exist on the freedom of under 18 year olds.  These are set out in different Acts, for example, licencing of drivers, liquor, dance Acts, gaming Acts and many more.  It is difficult for members of the public to know what freedoms exist.  I have come across this in my own experience.  The new Children Bill which is being drafted should amalgamate these age limits into a coherent whole so that people will be easily able to find them.  They should be grouped to reflect the stages of development of the child and young adult.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the Bill.  It gives extra responsibility to our young people who are demanding it at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> First of all, I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach and also all the Senators who have contributed to this debate.  The contributions fell into a number of definable areas.  First, there was a general welcome for the Bill.  I thank the Senators for that.  There was a discussion on the scope of the Bill. Eighteen year olds enjoy many privileges and responsibilities at present.  They can vote at 18.  They can serve on a jury at 18.  They can pay tax at 18.  They can join the Army at 18.  They can leave home and live an independent life and make all <Col N="56" /> decisions without the consent of their parents.</P>
      <P>There are very large numbers of young people, both at work and in college, who are leading independent lives.  They are making their own personal decisions, moral decisions and decisions that control their own lives quite independently of parents and guardians.  What they cannot do is enter into legal contracts.  They cannot get a mortgage for a house if they are married.  They cannot enter into a hire purchase agreement.  A young farmer or a young business man cannot borrow to invest in a business.  These are great disabilities which young people suffer under.  The Bill removes all those disabilities.</P>
      <P>A second very practical area where the Bill will have effect will be where young people have moneys in trust for them. Many Senators would have experienced young people involved in car accidents where money would be held in trust. They will get the benefit of that now at 18 rather than at 21.  There are in the Bill a whole series of Acts which are affected. But in the practical day-to-day lives of young people these two areas are the areas of maximum effect, particularly the area of contract and the area of getting loans and mortgages and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the first point of criticism raised by many Senators.  They said that not all 18 year olds are as mature as one would like them to be and that consequently there is a danger that they will be exploited by people who would use this new-found freedom to encourage them to borrow beyond their means and to exploit them financially.  There has been a request that we would do something about this and put in some kind of safety net under their decisions even though we are moving the age of majority from 21 down to 18.  The major difficulty with this is that if we try to put in a safety net of that sort, which would suggest that a young person at the new age of majority of 18 was less than fully liable for any debt entered into, I am afraid that we would frustrate one of the major intentions of the Bill.  I do not think either banks or building societies or insurance <Col N="57" /> companies or finance houses would actually lend the money to young people unless they were sure that the young person would have the full obligation to honour the contract.  If we do not, as well as transmitting the benefit of being able to enter into contracts, impose the responsibility on young people then I am afraid we will nullify what we are trying to do, because I do not think that lenders of money or those who offer goods on easy payment will deal with young people if there is some kind of fail mechanism which brings about a situation where young people would be freed from the contractual obligations they have entered into.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, always the danger of people being exploited.  This does not just affect people between 18 and 21: it affects people at any age.  The answer to the problem is not in amending this Bill but by moving to bring in consumer protection legislation.  That is the appropriate area for the kind of protection which Senators have requested.</P>
    <P>Many Senators raised the exclusion of the age of marriage.  In section 2(4) of the Bill the exclusions are listed and the various marriage Acts are excluded.  This was done quite deliberately by the Government for one main reason and for a number of subsidiary reasons.  First of all, we have the Committee on Marriage Breakdown who have looked at this.  We know from newspaper reports the particular line they have adopted on the age of marriage but they have not yet published their report or finalised their report in any way whatsoever.  I think if I came in here with proposals which pre-empted that report I would be subject to criticism in the Seanad.  Secondly, the age of majority and the age of marriage are not necessarily linked together.  One can make a very strong argument that if somebody is a full and mature adult at 18 and taking on the kind of contractual obligations that they will now be in a position to take on, that person should also be free to marry without consent at 18 years of age.  That is an argument that I fully accept, but we do not need legislation to bring this about.  The 1972 <Col N="58" /> Marriage Act has a section in it which empowers the Minister for Health by order to reduce the free age of marriage to any age which he thinks appropriate. It is not necessary to include it in this Bill; we do not need to put it into any Bill. If the Minister for Health recommends to the Government that the age of 18 years should be the age of marriage to line it up with the age of majority, all that is needed then is a ministerial order.</P>
    <P>This is the free age of marriage; what we need to debate and consider very carefully is what to do with the people under the free age of marriage.  Do we say that one cannot marry at all if they are under the age of 18 years?  At the present time, as everybody is aware, the free age is 21 years; from 16 years to 21 years the consent of parent or guardian is required and if the consent of parent or guardian cannot be obtained one can go to the courts.  Under 16 years of age there is still a mechanism whereby somebody can make a submission to the President of the High Court and he can allow them to marry.  There are three phases in this: the free age; the age with the consent of parents, guardian or court; and the under 16 year olds.  Is the suggestion now that if you are 18 years you are free to marry and if you are under 18 years any arrangement you make is null and void and the marriage is void?  If this is the situation, I suggest that this is not something that should be changed by amendment on the Committee Stage of a Bill, as this would require very careful consideration.  We know from the statistics that there are many people under 18 years of age who are married and a lot of these had the permission of their parents or guardians but a lot more of them had to go to the court to get permission.  We also know that there are a number of people who have got permission to marry from the President of the High Court who were under 16 years of age.  I have listened to the arguments of Senators and I will not pre-empt a decision of the Government or the Minister for Health on this.  This is something that should be looked at separately from the age of majority.  It does not necessarily follow that because <Col N="59" /> the age of 18 years is the age of majority we should say that 18 years is the free age for marriage but that below 18 years one cannot marry at all.  It requires more debate than that.</P>
    <P>There are certain groups in society that traditionally marry at a young age: this should be taken into account when we are discussing the age of marriage.  There is no difficulty in lining up the free age of marriage with the age of majority.  This can be done, as I have already stated, by order of the Minister for Health if that is the policy decision, and it does not require legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of what do we do with the people under the free age of marriage and what is the mechanism to provide if they want to get married, or do we exclude them completely, requires debate and discussion.  It would not be proper for me to move on such a serious matter without the report of the Committee of the House of the Oireachtas which was specifically set up to look into this and other matters.</P>
    <P>The other exclusions, as can be seen in section 2, subsection (4) are the Adoption Acts.  The age of adoption is not necessarily the same as the age of majority. Again, there is a report for the Minister for Health &mdash; which is ready &mdash; and he can act on it if he sees fit.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Acts are excluded. The reason for this particular exclusion is that parents are in benefit at the moment under Social Welfare Acts for their children up to 21 years of age.  If I were not to exclude the Social Welfare Acts, the parents would be excluded from any benefit they now have for any child between 18 years and 21 years of age, because these children would now be adults.  If this should happen, my argument is that it is a matter for social welfare legislation and it is certainly not something that should be dealt with in an Age of Majority Bill.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the exclusion of the Income Tax Acts.  Again, there are certain allowances available to parents for children up to 21 years of age.  It would not be appreciated by parents if, <Col N="60" /> under the Age of Majority Bill, they were going to lose their tax allowances for children between the ages of 18 and 21 years.  If it is thought appropriate that that should be the case and that people would be absolutely adult at 18 years of age and that there would not be any two-tier system whatsoever, it is a matter for a Finance Act.  Any changes in taxation would be a matter for a Finance Act and not for a Bill brought in by a Minister for Justice.  The same applies to the provisions for illegitimate children: the Affiliation Orders Act, 1930 provides support for the maintenance of children up to the ages of 21 years.</P>
    <P>Pensions are sometimes calculated, especially State pensions of teachers, gardaí, Army officers' widows, on the basis of the number of dependent children they have.  If we exclude those between the ages of 18 years and 21 years, we are reducing the pensions of widows in a situation where it would be unfair to do so, and there is no demand for this to be done; if this is to be done it is a matter for some other form of legislation and not for this one.</P>
    <P>The question of maintenance has been raised.  The working paper which was produced advised that the existing situation should be maintained.  The final report recommended that it should be changed for the reasons which some Senators referred to, that if somebody is an adult at 18 years, there is a kind of inconsistency that he should be maintained by another adult.  That is fine for the sake of consistency and neatness, but if you are 19 years of age, and you are either at home or in school and as a result of a Bill you find that the maintenance order which was granted to you in court no longer applies to you you will lose.  It is better to maintain the existing situation. There are people at present who are the beneficiaries of maintenance orders &mdash; if I can use the word &ldquo;beneficiary&rdquo; in this sense &mdash; and these will run until they are 21 years of age.  If I did not make this exclusion, which I made by amendment in the Dáil, they would run until they are 18 years of age.  The trouble about this is that people are in particular situations <Col N="61" /> where they need the maintenance at the moment: this can be highlighted by a classic case of where somebody has one year or one and a half years done in university with the expectation that they are going to be funded by the maintenance order for another year and a half and suddenly they find that this is not so because the Minister changed the age of majority under the Age of Majority Bill. This is the reason for the amendment which I moved in the Dáil</P>
    <P>Those are all reasons for the exclusions: some of them are a question of practical commonsense and others are a question of policy.  As I have stated, the one which concerns people most and is very topical is the question of the age of marriage.  If we decided the free age of marriage is to be reduced it does not require legislation &mdash; it can be done by order.  If, on the other hand, we decide that there is a minimum age for marriage below which any marriage entered into by young people would be null and void, this requires legislation.  What I have suggested to the Government is that we wait for the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown and after consideration of it legislate accordingly.</P>
    <P>I should like to move to the specific points raised by individual Senators. Senator Ryan welcomed the Bill and remarked that it was cautious, and he talked about the age of marriage and so on.  Our record on legislation is not as bleak as some Senators have suggested. I have spent a share of time in this House. I can draw your attention not alone to this Bill but to the Criminal Justice Bill of recent infamy or fame: we had another great day here when we were putting through the Funds of Suitors Bill; we had various&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): This is simply half-time.  I have another two and a half years to go.  It is only the prisoners that get half their sentences cut; Ministers have to go the full distance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also brought in the Community <Col N="62" /> Service Orders Bill and we had a couple of others so there is a certain amount of legislation going through.  I have learned one thing &mdash; and I am sure a lot of you have been my teachers &mdash; that if one wants to do something one packages it in small segments.  This might be a more effective way of doing business.  That criticism was raised with the Criminal Justice Bill; many Senators asked why it was not broken up into a number of Bills instead of going for the major blockbuster of a Bill which would give us difficulty; why not package it in smaller segments?  That is exactly my approach here.  We are dealing here with a very important piece of law reform.  It will immediately affect 200,000 young people.  Over the next 12 months it will affect all that cohort of people who are now preparing for leaving certificate in our schools, the 17 to 17½ year olds.  That is another 60,000 or 70,000 people in 1985.  We are talking of over one quarter of a million young people being immediately affected by this and we are extending certain legal benefit to them which they will welcome.  There will be some responsibility attendant on that but I think they will welcome it.  As well as being practical it is a vote of confidence in our young people also.</P>
    <P>I have outlined my view on other matters like the age of marriage.  It is not a question of ducking the issue; it is a question of doing this much now because I am sure of what I want to do, waiting for the report from the committee on the breakdown of marriage and then moving on that, although I think it will be a different Minister who will be involved in that, because the 1972 Marriage Act was sponsored by the Department of Health and the Minister for Health.  The particular provision to change the free age of marriage is at the discretion of the Minister for Health by order.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan talked about jury service. Eighteen year olds can serve on juries already.  This Bill was not needed to give them that responsibility.  Yes, it could happen that four young people could be serving on a jury together but of course the normal powers to object to membership of juries apply.  We should <Col N="63" /> also remember, if I remember my statistics from the Criminal Justice Bill, that something like one-third of all indictible offences are being committed by people under 17 years of age and if the whole basis of the jury system is that one should be tried by one's peers, there is an argument for young people adjudicating on the transgressions of other young people. Why should the old hand down the judgments on the young, why not the young also?  I do not see any particular problem in that.  Senator Honan was also worried about the maintenance of handicapped and mentally-handicapped children.  We have protected them in the Bill and we are maintaining the existing solution there.  The intention of the subsection she referred to is to provide for continuing protection for handicapped people and to bring the 1964 Act into line with the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act of 1976.  A detailed discussion of that can be gone into on Committee Stage, but the provision is there to do that.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan dealt with the age of marriage and talked about various regulations, and I think I have covered that in general.  Senator Mullooly was rather critical about the Explanatory Memorandum. I think the opening sentence of the Explanatory Memorandum is absolutely clear; it does not give any kind of false impression.  It says: &ldquo;The purpose of the Bill is to implement the proposals relating to the age of majority contained in the Law Reform Commission's Report on the Law Relating to the Age of Majority, the Age for Marriage and Some Connected Subjects&rdquo;.  It says quite clearly that the purpose of this Bill is to deal with the proposals on the age of majority and nothing else in that particular report. There is certainly no intent to give any kind of false impression that we were dealing with the whole report, which we were not, and it says so quite clearly in the first sentence.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly said the commencement date should be postponed.  I do not think that is necessary.  The Bill was published last September and it received <Col N="64" /> a reasonable amount of publicity during the passage through the Dáil.  I think it can be expected that legal practitioners and the public in general are now aware of the existence of the Bill.  Indeed, people who would be inclined to enter into contractual arrangements of a financial nature with young people would be aware of the Bill also, such as banks and finance houses, building societies and so on.  I think the commencement date will not cause hardship or inconvenience.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning here that there was a suggestion made in the other House that if there was an explanatory leaflet available which would outline the changes being made in the Bill and if this were provided through youth organisations and schools, that might be of help, and I will see how practical that is and evaluate the cost of it.  I think it will be worth doing and it would meet the point raised by Senator Mullooly.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson was deploring the exclusion of the age of marriage and so on, but I have dealt with that also.  Senator Fallon felt that unemployment assistance should not be assessed on the basis of parents' means.  We are excluding the social welfare provisions.  I think it would be appropriate, if a change is to be made where somebody between 18 years and 21 years was no longer considered a dependant for the purposes of an allowance under the Social Welfare Act, then a consequential change would have to be that somebody who was 18 years would be entitled to full adult benefit in certain circumstances.  That is certainly a topic for the Minister for Social Welfare and would have very far-reaching implications and not necessarily for the benefit of young people or not necessarily for the benefit of families.  It is something that will have to be evaluated separately.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary spoke about reducing the age of majority on a phased basis. That was one possible way of doing this. The Law Reform Commission report would have adduced the experience of other countries.  It seems that 18 years is the generally acceptable age, and I think there is a strong argument for doing it in one jump from 21 years down to 18 years. <Col N="65" /> Every young person of 18 years of age is not suddenly going to take on contractual obligations, but they will be legally entitled to do so; it will depend on the individual. Some of them will never take on any obligation of that nature between 18 years and 21 years.  Others at 19, 20 or 21 years who are working may buy a car if they can get insurance.  On the other hand, they may buy a record player at 18 years.  If you look at the individual case, this is worth doing and I think it is worth doing it in one move from 21 years to 18 years.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary raised the question of maintenance orders.  I have outlined my intent in my preliminary remarks, but I think it is something which will probably be discussed in greater detail on Committee Stage and we can leave it until then.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross spoke about raising the age of criminal responsibility to 18 years. Again, change in the age of criminal responsibility is a matter for the Children Bill; it is a matter for the Minister for Health to bring a recommendation to the Cabinet for a decision.  I am not going to pre-empt that by suggesting any age. I doubt if there would be much support for 18 years of age as the age for criminal responsibility, because what you are saying is that below a particular age you are not criminally responsible; therefore you are immune.  I do not think we can have a situation where everybody under 18 years of age is immune from criminal prosecution.  That is when the exploitation would really start.  Whatever about acting on their own initiative I am sure there would be people who would organise other people who were immune from the law.  We went over that argument previously, and I do not think there is any point in going through it again.</P>
    <P>With regard to reducing the age for membership of the Oireachtas, again it is a matter for a referendum, as Senators know quite well.  I have no objection.  I have no 18 year olds in my constituency who are trying to be candidates; I suppose everyone will have to make his own evaluation. It is a matter for a referendum and it would be brought in by the Minister <Col N="66" /> for the Environment.  It is an interesting constituency.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons said there was nothing illogical about calculating the age at the moment.  I think it is far more logical if somebody reaches 18 years or 19 or 20 on their birthday.  I cannot see why somebody should reach 18, 19 or 20 on the morning of the day before their birthday.  Apart from a desire to be neat and to tidy things up, one of the reasons for this is to line it up with social welfare legislation, because that is the way it is defined in the social welfare legislation. It should be brought into line with that. He also talked about the exclusion of the age of marriage proposals.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points raised in a general way.  I thank all the Senators who contributed.  I am sure we will have an interesting Committee Stage on the Bill.  I thank all the Senators for their contributions on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the Final Report of the National Youth Policy Committee which was laid before the House on 10 October 1984 and calls upon the Government to give full consideration to the findings of the Report which is a major contribution towards the establishment of a national youth policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an-áthas orm an rún seo a mholadh anocht mar tá a lán cainte ar siúl leis na blianta i dtaobh ógánaigh na hÉireann agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil an t-am thart anois leis an gcaint agus go mba chóir go mbeadh rud éigin sásúil déanta.  Tá sé deacair b'fhéidir réiteach a fháil ar fhadhbanna na n-ógánach ach ní dóigh liom go ndéanfaidh sé maitheas ar bith do éinne <Col N="67" /> bheith ag caint faoi na hógánaigh, daoine ag rá go bhfuil siad go han-mhaith agus daoine eile ag rá go bhfuil siad go dona agus nach bhfuil siad chomh maith ar chor ar bith leis na daoine a bhí ann fadó. Tá ré nua againn anois agus caithfimid dul ar aghaidh sa ré seo atá againn. Tugann na moltaí seo seans do gach éinne, an Rialtas agus na taoisigh ar fud na tíre, rud éigin a dhéanamh agus tá súil agam go mbeidh tairbhe as na moltaí seo i rith na bliana seo.</P>
    <P>Being International Youth Year it is very appropriate that we discuss the problems of youth and the report on youth as submitted by the Costello Committee.  I was very heartened to see that the opening chapter dealt with a philosophy of youth development.  It is way past time that we developed philosophies rather than talking about things off the top of our heads.  In general we find that speeches are made about youth being the wealth of Ireland and the greatest natural resource we have but if we do not give them opportunities we are serving no cause by telling them how important they are.  We frustrate them.  We should have something we can give them that they can follow, that they will be rewarded for their skills, intelligence and their education. A philosophy is very important. When this policy is being drawn up I am quite sure that following on the report we have before us and the contributions that will be made tonight the Minister who is very capable in this line will be able to set up the necessary structure.</P>
    <P>There is a question of drawing up a plan dealing with the rights of the young people.  We can talk about rights but if we cannot deliver on them we can cause problems for young people.  They have given us a set of principles in this report dealing with the needs of the young people and how society must help.  In society we are inclined in general to give out about youth.  Those of us who have spent a lot of time with youth will have a better understanding than those who just sit, look and criticise.  I do not believe they are any worse now than they were years ago, there is a mixture and the <Col N="68" /> mixture was there before.  There was not the same publicity on television or the same reporting in the papers.  Maybe some of the things that are done at the moment appear to be worse than what used to happen, but as a society we can be too critical of young people.  Many of them are excellent, many of them are way ahead of people who went before them and who are very critical of them at this stage.</P>
    <P>We should help them.  Perhaps we should talk less about them, even get involved in committees or give our time to help them.  It is easy enough to get money from people but it is very difficult to get people to come out to support young people.  Young people may be anxious to get involved in youth committees, they may be very anxious to have their own organisations, and I know they would be very willing to co-operate.  To get adults prepared to give their nights to look after them, to supervise them, is a problem that arises in many places as I know from experience.  If somebody does it is great and praise is lavished on him or her, but I think that adults should play a greater role in giving leadership to the younger people who are willing to be led and willing to play their part just as much as ever.</P>
    <P>The family role is outlined in this report.  The family is our basic structure and it must survive.  We could talk about the taxation system where the role of the family is not being supported as much as it should be, where allowances should be made for children.  Any help the family gets in a financial way will help the younger people to progress in life.</P>
    <P>They also deal with education.  One could talk about education for hours. Young people are very educated now. Years ago people had to go to England with only a primary education and they had to live with many difficulties in a very strange environment.  We are lucky that at least the younger people today are educated.  They should know more than the people who went before them.  Their standards are something you can question but that is part of modern youth.  They have much more facilities for hearing and <Col N="69" /> seeing things and knowing what is going on.  The older people did not have the same facilities.  We lived in a sheltered society.  With the educational facilities that are there at the moment for young people they have an opportunity to stand on their own feet and make up their own mind.  They do not have to be led into promiscuity, crime and so on.</P>
    <P>The question can be asked, what are we educating people for?  Are we still educating people for office jobs and professions when most of the work will not be in that line?  It is not easy to change the educational system.  We are inclined to follow what has been there.  There have been many attempts made even at primary level.  The introduction of PE and the provision of halls and GP rooms were valuable.</P>
    <P>Art in primary schools has advanced very much in the last few years, and also nature study.  We have gone away from the basic three Rs.  Perhaps people leaving the sixth standard ten years ago were able to write better English and Irish but they certainly had not the same all-round education of people leaving school today. Some people will question the drop in standards, but one has to know what the changes are and what other information they have that helps them to develop a proper attitude to life.</P>
    <P>The report deals with the question of work, not the easiest of topics in modern times to sort out.  It is fine to tell people they have the right to work but the difficulty is in providing work.  It is heartening to note that young people are getting more work than we thought.  A later report states that the younger people are doing reasonably well.  No matter how well they do it will not be well enough, especially if they are well educated.  They will not feel happy if they are not at work.</P>
    <P>This report will give the Government a chance of drawing up a good plan.  It may not be easy to implement all of it and it may not be easy to deal with all the aspects.  One part of it lays emphasis on the fact that young people should be given the opportunity of decision making in the running of schools.  I would not altogether fall over backwards on that <Col N="70" /> particular aspect.  At a certain age there could be maturity but I would not like to have to consult pupils in sixth class whom I teach at the moment about what we should do with the school.  I am sure they would have very good suggestions as to what we should do with it, and I would not blame them.  One can perhaps ask young people for their views but in the long run it requires years of maturity to weigh up a situation.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for young people to decide to stay on at school if they have the opportunity of getting work.  The fact that they might get £15 or £20 for working in a shop appeals to them because they have no guarantee of a job if they continue at school to do the leaving certificate. The immediate sight of money in their hands certainly lures them into making a decision and later they may regret they did not stay on in school. It is quite regular to meet people who regret they did not do their leaving certificate. They made rash decisions at the time.  I would not like to land young people into a position where they would be making major decisions about schools, but their views would be very important. Perhaps that is what was meant, and the Minister can decide what he will do on that line.</P>
    <P>The Government have been genuine in their concern and I hope they will continue to be concerned.  They provided £2.8 million for the youth services this year, and that is a big increase.  It is not enough to leave it to the Government to provide money.  There must be leaders who will help the young people, who will do more than talk, and who will help to have schemes implemented.</P>
    <P>Another section of the report deals with the disadvantaged youth.  The young people who come from good homes with a good background and certain facilities have not got the real problems of disadvantaged youth.  We can see the needs of faraway places, but there is no doubt that when one passes roadside travellers and sees young toddlers and children, sometimes half-naked, going around in the cold it makes one wonder about our philosophy as it concerns human beings.  It <Col N="71" /> would be nice if we could come up with a plan to help these young itinerants. There are suggestions to integrate them, to qualify them.  In Carlow where the younger people are being trained it does seem to give them a special standing among themselves and even among the community when they can produce goods that can be sold.  Very often we regard them as good-for-nothings and we do not consider that they got no great chance in life, that they were born into that situation and unless we help them they will not get anywhere.</P>
    <P>Obviously the section on disabled youth is very important, because they need more help than anybody else.  Perhaps our youthful Minister would consider where some of the problems of disabled people could be ironed out in the social welfare context.  I am thinking in particular of a mentally retarded child who continues to go to school after the age of 16 and who is not given the money he would get if he stayed at home.  That type of situation is indefensible in this day and age, and I hope it will be changed very shortly.  While we can draw up youth policies for the disabled and provide ramps and so on the actual provision of money for them is very important.</P>
    <P>There is a chapter in the report about young offenders which questions why people are young offenders.  Again, a lot depends on whether they were disadvantaged from birth, which is often the case.  They have never learned about standards, through no fault of their own. I do not like the idea that because people are unemployed or poor that automatically gives them more or less an excuse for committing crime.  People were always poor and people were always unemployed but there was a different standard in the years past.  While we have to sort out what causes people to commit crime there is a limit.  We have to get back to a basic genuine concern for honesty and for a standard that always existed.  We brag and feel very confident that we are a very religious nation and, I suppose we would be shocked if someone said that Ireland was not a religious nation and a <Col N="72" /> nation of believers.  We are inclined to make all kinds of excuses for the fact that obviously we do not live up to our religious practices.  Perhaps a little honest to God honesty coming back into the nation would help, and I am not talking about the youth alone on this.  It would save us analysing a lot of problems which we have.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to compliment the people who published this report.  They obviously spent a lot of time on it.  It is a very detailed document and one on which one could speak for hours because of all their recommendations and comments. The best compliment we can pay them is to ensure that in this year where youth will get so much publicity we will bring in a youth policy that can be implemented and that will be practical.  I have the utmost confidence that the Minister of State has all the skills and qualities, having heard the advice of the people in the Seanad, to do that and I look forward to having a youth policy in 1985.</P>

      <P>I have fairly full notes here and with the permission of the Chair I will circulate them. They are notes rather than a speech and I will be departing quite substantially from them but they may be of assistance to the Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very considerable pleasure, and indeed a considerable source of pride to me as Minister of State with responsibility in the area of youth affairs to be provided with this opportunity of coming in and speaking to this House on the Final Report of the National Youth Policy Committee, a report which was laid before this House on 10 October of last year.  Senators will be aware of the fact that the debate has already begun in the other House on the contents of the report and such was the level of interest that that debate stands adjourned and is shortly to be resumed.  It is highly appropriate that <Col N="73" /> Members of this House should in turn be provided with an opportunity to comment on what is generally accepted as being a most comprehensive analysis and a most important report.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I can begin by taking up Senator Browne's concluding remarks and thanking and expressing my personal appreciation and that of the Government for the commitment shown by the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Justice Declan Costello of the High Court, the rappoteur, Mr. Tadhg Ó Cearbhaill, a most distinguished public servant, and the other members of the committee who laboured long and hard in their endeavours. I think there will be agreement from all sides that an exceedingly fine job was done and an exceedingly fine report was produced in a very short period. When the committee were established the Government, rather than allow this to be long-fingered and drag on into the distance, invited the members of the committee to do their work within 12 calendar months.  They did that to the day and the report was presented, almost uniquely by a committee, in the time limit suggested by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is worth going back 12 months to consider the circumstances that motivated and prompted the Government to establish such a committee and in doing so to give them the very wide and comprehensive terms of reference they enjoyed.  First, the need for the support and development of our youth service is not an issue of contention.  Successive Governments of different political persuasions since the early seventies have contributed to the support of voluntary youth organisations and services which they provide.  Having said that, there has not been any substantial attempt to place youth services in context, both as to the established needs of young people and also as to the place of such services in the overall Government provision of services more generally.  It was against that background that the National Youth Council of Ireland and a number of other bodies called for an overall national policy <Col N="74" /> within which voluntary youth organisations would be able to find a secure and valued place.</P>
    <P>Before taking office we gave a commitment to adopt such a policy.  Prior to the election that returned us to office we set out in some detail the procedure which was to be followed.  We suggested that the first step in such an exercise would be the publication of a short discussion document which would simply ask questions that would act as a trigger for discussion. We did that when we published &ldquo;Shaping the Future&rdquo;.  We then said that we would establish a high level committee representative first of all of young people themselves and the voluntary organisations to which they give their allegiance, representative too of the Government Departments that serve young people and representative also of a number of other organisations and interest groups that were clearly concerned and had a contribution to make.</P>
    <P>By appointing a committee of the calibre that we did and by the fact that the Taoiseach lent his personal prestige to the exercise it was open to us to show just how important was the priority that the Government attach to the exercise. Senators should take reassurance from that that now that the report is available to us it will not be treated lightly and that it is not going to be consigned to some dusty shelves in some remote Government Department.</P>
    <P>Anyone who had fears in that area would have those fears eased by examining the track record of this Government since taking office.  Our first year in office, 1983, was the year of major departure for the youth service.  Members will remember the controversy that then existed with regard to the position of development officers.  Fifty four officers working with different national youth organisations faced extinction.  Contracts were due to expire and there was no indication as to their position.  Understandably, organisations such as the National Federation of Youth Clubs and so on who had taken advantage of the existence of the scheme to develop their structures to expand suddenly found their <Col N="75" /> whole existence in question.  The Government, of course, responded and made those posts permanent and, at the same time, increased the grant aid in support of each such officer from £5,000 at the installation of the scheme to £7,000.</P>
    <P>People will also recall that at that time the provision for the youth service showed an increase of only 1 per cent. That seemed to us to be something that was quite intolerable, and that was immediately redressed.  An additional allocation of some £550,000 was provided in order to ensure the development and expansion of various voluntary youth organisations.  It has not stopped there, and the subsequent years of our period in Government have continued to show the Government placing an emphasis on the voluntary youth service and honouring a commitment to regard its funding as a priority.</P>
    <P>That was very important to us as we set about this exercise, because had we not been able to make that movement, had we not been able to show voluntary organisations that their place and their role was appreciated and that it was not going to be an appreciation which stopped at lip service, then it would be inevitable that they would approach any initiative such as the Costello committee with some scepticism.  So it was important that before launching on this exercise we were determined to build on sound and secure foundations, and that is just what we did.  The figures speak for themselves. In 1982 £1,400,000 was allocated, two years later £2.2 million was allocated, an increase of just about 50 per cent.  This year the Estimates provide for a sum of £2.8 million for the youth service, an increase of 26 per cent, and that against a background of considerable financial restraint.</P>
    <P>The committee were launched in the full and certain expectation that the Government would live up to their commitments, and we now have that report. The stage has been set for an honest, substantial and considered response to the report.  It is important that we get the <Col N="76" /> timetable right on what we can reasonably expect out of the report.  I have heard some suggestions that it might have been desirable not to debate the report at this stage in this House or not to have had a debate in the other House but instead to wait until the Government had considered the report in detail and could come back and say which recommendations were being accepted and were being rejected and over which period any particular recommendation was going to be implemented.  It seems to me that would be an entirely unhappy way in which to proceed.  It is altogether more satisfactory that both Houses of the Oireachtas are now being given an opportunity to comment on the report at a time when the report is itself under consideration by Government, so that Government in responding to the report will have the benefit of Senators' views.  There are a number of issues in the report on which public representatives are in a particularly advantageous position to comment. There are, for example, sections dealing with the evolution of local structures on which public representatives from all around the country will be uniquely well positioned to draw on their background in local politics to comment on what might be the best structures to evolve.</P>
    <P>Equally, the members of the committee indicated that they accepted that the report could not and would not be implemented overnight and that any implementation would be on a phased basis.  If that is so then clearly there are some areas that have to receive priority. The views of Senators, and indeed from the other House views of Deputies, in identifying the areas of priority will be a very considerable advantage to the Government.</P>
    <P>We regard the exercise we are now engaged on as a very important part of our response to International Youth Year.  As already commented on, this year, 1985, has been designated by the United Nations as International Youth Year.  Ireland is a member of the 24 nation advisory committee which oversees and guides member states in their <Col N="77" /> celebration of the year.  Members who have copies of the report before them will see that the logo for International Youth Year and its explanation and relevance to the themes of that year have been reproduced on the cover of the report.  We were concerned that this very major exercise should be seen for what it is, a very substantial part of our preparations for International Youth Year, though obviously, that was not the sole extent of our concern or interest.</P>
    <P>In regard to International Youth Year, I simply comment in passing that a committee has been established at national level to prepare for the year and organise it.  I am very happy to say that a wideranging programme is now coming together.  We have a very worth-while programme now at national, regional and, most important of all, at local level.</P>
    <P>I made reference to the extra resources that have been made available in this year's Estimates.  Of course, the provision to that effect was made in the context of the Government's national plan, <i>Building on Reality.</i>  It was there that the Government reiterated their commitment to establish a national youth policy for International Youth Year. Such a youth policy</P>
    <P>&ldquo;will have its own distinct purposes but would interact with other policies and measures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I quote from page 109 of that document:</P>
    <P>The policy will be aimed at assisting all young people to become self-reliant, responsible and active participants in society.  It will include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a clear philosophy of youth development and a statement of principles to guide Government policies;</P>
    <P>&mdash;an objective assessment of the factual position of young people in contemporary Ireland;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a detailed plan for the provision of services to young people generally and disadvantaged young people in particular;</P>
    <P>In the context of their consideration of <Col N="78" /> the national plan, and in advance of its publication and of having an opportunity of considering the cost of the report, the Government set aside an additional sum of £1.5 million for the youth services. That allocation allows a degree of flexibility which facilitates planning on a response to the priorities outlined in the plan.  On the capital side, Senators will be aware that I have also made provision in the national plan for the reintroduction of capital facilities for youth and community organisations.  A further allocation of £3 million in capital support for community and youth facilities is there provided for.</P>
    <P>I say that to assert again and make clear that there is no question of the Government standing still until the wider debate, not just in this House, we are now engaged on is completed.  The Government in many instances have anticipated the findings of the report and in other instances are already responding to it.  That is evident for example, in the Government's decision in the last two years to make funding available to groups dealing with disadvantaged young people, it is like the HOPE organisation in Dublin dealing with the homeless.  It is evident, too, in the funds made available on the capital side anticipating a recommendation that was to emerge from the Costello Report.  The Government are already responding to the suggestion that what could be described as its &ldquo;facelift&rdquo; grants for the overhaul of dilapidated and perhaps unsafe youth facilities should be made available, and to the suggestion that support should be made available to An Óige organisation in regard to their hostels.  Therefore, it is most important that the debate should not be derailed by any belief that because we are having the debate the time for action has been postponed.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>Our very first statement in response to the report accepted the recommendation that a national youth policy should be guided by a clear statement of youth development and based on a statement of principles which would govern the detailed implementation of the policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> In chapter 3 of the report the philosophy and the principles expounded by the National Youth Policy Committee deserve all our consideration.  I echo the views of Senator Browne that this is an exercise which perhaps is long overdue. It is entirely desirable and valuable that the committee should have made explicit the philosophy that informs all of their recommendations.  Too often we have eschewed ideas which ought to be promoted and have been quite shy about the values that we say we are upholding.  The democratic philosophy and vision outlined in the report and the evidence it presents in relation to active participation in society seems to be absolutely cogent and compelling.  The report stresses the importance of participation by young people in society and the need for adequate social and political education.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that young people should have an adequate opportunity to participate in the whole process of policy review and formulation, so it was with some enthusiasm that I accepted the very final suggestion of the report, which was that a popular version of the report should be published which would be aimed at promoting understanding and discussion among young people.  This popular version was itself produced and published in record time when it emerged on 10 December 1984 under the title Looking for Action and was done with the co-operation of the National Youth Council and the Institute of Public Administration.  As a result of that, the substance of the work of the committee is now being made available to every second level school in the country and to many youth groups all around the country too.  Young people are thus being given a chance to respond to the report and to make their views known on a whole range of issues which affect them.  I would like to see the report as a landmark in the development of services to young people and as charting a way towards a national youth service and providing an analysis of the position of young people in society and the trends and prospects that face them over the next decade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> There has been, and this is quite understandable, criticism of the fact that this was just one more report, that we had other reports in the youth service and this just takes place alongside them on the shelf.  First of all, I accept that very good work has been done in this area by previous Ministers of State from both sides of the House who have addressed themselves to the needs of young people, but it is just not right to suggest that the Costello report is simply a rediscovery of old truths.  The terms of reference and remit of the Costello Committee go far beyond anything which has been attempted before.  That is not in any sense to downplay the significance of A Policy for Youth and Sport published by Deputy John Bruton, who is now Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, or Development of Youth Work Services in Ireland published by Deputy Tunney when he was Minister of State. Both of those were valuable and, indeed, seminal exercises and contributed very substantially to the evolution of the Government's attitude for young people and their needs.  Unlike previous reports, this one was not confined in its deliberations to the narrow remit of youth work, important though that area is.  Instead it addressed itself, to the wider issues relevant to young people and their needs.</P>
    <P>There are one or two aspects of the report to which I might usefully address myself at this stage.  I do not want to prolong my contribution because I am anxious to hear the views of as many Members of the House as possible.  Members will be aware that the National Youth Policy Committee commissioned an extensive and nationwide survey &mdash; a public opinion poll &mdash; on the attitudes and behaviour of young people in Ireland.  In its own right, that survey is the most important contribution to youth research.  <i>The Irish Press</i>, for example, on 13 December 1984 in an editorial referred to aspects of this survey as it was published in <i>Looking for Action</i>, the popular version of the report to which I have already referred.  The editorial concluded, and I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> This report should now be put on the top of each Minister's desk and studied with the care and consideration that our young generation deserve.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that, in keeping with the commitment we brought into Government with us to introduce a comprehensive youth survey, the report of the policy committee and the survey of the attitudes and behaviour of the young people of Ireland have been the concern of relevant Ministers in the past few months, as the Government move on towards their goal of introducing that comprehensive youth policy in International Youth Year.  However, it is not just a report addressed to Government Ministers.  It is a report which is and should be of interest to all of the social partners, to teachers, politicians and the churches, for example.  It must be a cause of concern to the churches that only reuniting Ireland by violence ranks lower than religion among young people's priorities. When young people were asked to list their priorities on the basis of a number of possible areas of concern, only the possibility of reunification by violence was identified by them as being less important than religion.  It is only right that I should say that there was a substantial gap between the lowest and the second lowest.  I do not want to make too much of that comparison, but I think it is of some note and must cause some concern.  If the churches have any reason to be concerned by that report then I must say that we all have more reason to be concerned, because there is less joy for politicians and political parties in the report than for almost anybody else.  Politicians, the House will note, rank lowest behind trade union officials and public officials as the group in society perceived by young people as being least prepared to listen and least capable of understanding their views.  That must be of concern to us.  We ignore that perception at our peril, a perception now scientifically and statistically documented, a perception that is further reinforced by the level of apathy surrounding young people's political attitudes.  Members are aware that <Col N="82" /> I have already taken some steps to attempt to turn that tide.  I indicated that I was prepared to consider applications from political parties represented in Dáil Éireann for grant assistance towards the employment of an education officer the specific remit of whom would be the area of political education, the intention being that such officers would be responsible for training programmes for young people within the youth movement's political parties and that they would be expected to demonstrate over a period tangible results in the form of increased participation at local level by young people in community affairs.  All four eligible parties have indicated that they are interested in the proposal, and I expect that formal appointments are likely to be made shortly.</P>
    <P>I do not want to overstate the benefits that are likely to accrue from that initiative. I accept that, for the most part, political and social education will have to be undertaken in the schools and that that must come through a reformed curriculum. I accept that that must be supplemented by informal education which, for the most part, will be gained through participation in youth organisations.  That said, I am quite convinced of the need to strengthen our democratic political life through preparing and educating skilled and motivated young people to be involved at all levels.</P>
    <P>A second area to which I wish to address myself is the relationship of a youth policy and disadvantaged young people.  The committee devoted section 4 of their report to this most important area of social concern.  The committee identified many forms of disadvantage and made recommendations which are challenging and which have to be seriously considered if we are to make real progress towards a comprehensive youth service for all our young people.</P>
    <P>I can only refer again to the initial Government statement which stated that, as a matter of social justice, the Government believe that the needs and rights of disadvantaged young people require special measures in order to produce equality of opportunity.  For that <Col N="83" /> reason, it is very encouraging to see the report devote a whole section to the specific needs of the disadvantaged covering topics such as school attendance, neighbourhood youth projects, youth encounter projects, the issue of homeless young people, the question of substance abuse, youth offenders and so on.  It is also only right to say that the Government have not in any sense been inactive in dealing with this area.  The House will be aware that a number of those areas have been the subject of separate Government response.  I will cite, for example, the problem of substance and drug abuse and the plight of young travellers.  At this stage we can safely say that the horrific problems of drug abuse and all the attendant evils need no elaboration in this House.  The Government established a ministerial task force which resulted in September 1983 in a comprehensive Government statement covering law enforcement, treatment facilities, community education, youth development, research and resources. Subsequently the National Youth Policy Committee met with the task force in February 1984 to convey their views on substance abuse.  Senators will be aware that the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984 amended the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 in a number of significant respects in order to aid the drive against the criminals who push drugs.  The Costello Report makes the point, which I endorse without equivocation, that properly developed youth services can play an important part in prevention.  The September 1983 Government statement has clearly recognised this.  Senators will also be aware that, in accordance with Government policy, a National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse was established on 2 January 1985.  The committee are representative of Government Departments, voluntary bodies and other agencies concerned with drug abuse and will advise the Government on general issues relating to drug abuse.</P>
    <P>In respect of policy in relation to young travellers, Senators will be aware of the Government statement issued in July <Col N="84" /> 1984 setting out a comprehensive programme to provide accommodation and other services for travellers.  The statement was issued consequent to a review body report, and a task force of Ministers considered policy in relation to travellers generally.  Obviously the concern the Costello Report has indicated for young travellers must now be considered, especially the case that is made very eloquently for access to youth and community services.</P>
    <P>There are other forms of disadvantage which have not, perhaps, received as much attention from either legislators or the media.  One most distressing area that has occupied the attention of this House in recent months and very recently occupied the attention of the national media is the problem of the homeless young people.  This problem I hope to meet head-on, and to do so in consultation and co-operation with a number of my ministerial colleagues.</P>
    <P>Central to the report are chapters 10, 11 and 12, which describe the present range of services to young people, define the new youth service proposed, assess youth service needs and outline how a possible structure for the youth service might be built.  When we speak of a comprehensive youth service, what is meant? The committee recommend that youth work service &mdash; that is out-of-school education provided in the main by voluntary organisations &mdash; together with special services to youth, such as information and advice centres, youth encounter projects, work with detached or disadvantaged young people, should both be encompassed by a new national youth service.  This new service, which would be provided by local youth service committees representative of voluntary and statutory agencies, would be comprehensive in two ways.  It would be available to all young people throughout the State, and it would comprehend a whole range of services as required by young people from time to time or place to place.</P>
    <P>It would be quite wrong of me to conclude without taking the opportunity of paying tribute to the tens of thousands of volunteers who shoulder so ably the <Col N="85" /> burden of the youth service at present. The Costello Report acknowledged their tremendous contribution to the development and welfare of our young people, and went so far as to design its recommendations for a comprehensive youth service around the very real and substantial achievements of voluntary youth organisations.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the report concludes with an acknowledgment that those recommendations which are accepted will fall to be implemented in stages.  I believe that a planned, phased, approach will also be necessary, both because resources are limited, and because we need to keep learning.  As we go we put ourselves in a position to review our progress, to identify our strengths and, having identified them build on them, and to eliminate the weaknesses that will emerge.  It follows from that logic that any rigid approach, any blanket prescription for the whole country could prove quite disastrous.  I do not expect on reflection that any Member of the Seanad or any of the groups interested would argue for such a course of action. What we all desire at this stage is steady, constructive advice based on a clear picture of where we want to go.</P>
    <P>I look forward very much to hearing the views of Senators.  I simply want to reiterate that there will be no shelving of this report, no attempt to talk away a commitment that the report is receiving the most urgent attention.  It is against that background of urgent attention that the views of Senators are now so timely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this wide-ranging and comprehensive report and feel that the best tribute that the Minister and the Government can pay to the hardworking members of the committee, the rapporteur and the secretary would be to take those recommendations which the Government find acceptable and implement them as quickly as possible.  I am glad to hear the Minister's assurance that the report will receive the most speedy consideration and implementation. I welcome also the Minister providing <Col N="86" /> the opportunity for Members of the Oireachtas to make their contributions. I do not think that that will materially affect the speed with which the recommendations can be implemented.</P>
      <P>Before action is taken on the report a short exercise is necessary.  A flow chart should be drawn up tracing the relationships between all existing voluntary organisations, and there is a very wide range of them.  Secondly, an assessment should be made in order to ascertain how effectively existing resources are being employed.  Clearly the purpose of this exercise I am suggesting would be to establish whether there is adequate co-ordination among the plethora of youth bodies that we now have, and secondly to ensure that value is received for the resources employed.  For that exercise I suggest that the youth section of the Department of Labour is well placed and could carry out the exercise quickly.  Following this exercise I would like to make the comment that the primary focus should be on strengthening voluntary organisations rather than on the establishment of new bodies.  Wherever possible the Government should promote and foster self-reliance and local initiatives rather than taking on additional responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report correctly draws attention to the role of parents and the family in any new policy.  The family is central to personality development and is vital in providing an environment in which young people can develop in a balanced way. This inevitably means that parents have a special responsibility for the development of children.  I speak as the father of five young children.  The survey conducted for the committee found that nine out of ten young people looked to their parents for attention and understanding. This points to the great influence parents have as perceived by young people.  It underlines that young people are willing and eager to experience that type of parental influence.  It also raises the question as to whether parents themselves realise that they have this degree of influence. The findings of the survey should encourage and stimulate parents to provide <Col N="87" /> more guidance and emotional support to the members of their families.  Many of them are not so doing in the mistaken belief that such guidance and support might not be welcome.</P>
    <P>The report points out that parents can be particularly helpful to their children in relation to drink and drugs.  The Minister has pointed out the various initiatives taken by the various Governments, including his own, to help in this respect. There is no shortage of interest in the drug problem on the part of parents, but parents have a duty and responsibility to become informed about drugs.  Prevention is always better than cure, as the old adage has it.  We have a drug problem of crisis proportions.  There is evidence that it is levelling off rather than increasing, but it is still of very serious proportions. The drug problem is here to stay, therefore the onus is all the greater on parents and on communities to take action to try to prevent the drug problem.  The State can and does help in a variety of ways but, well-intentioned and substantial as the State efforts are in that regard, they can only help to solve part of the problem and a minor part at that.  The best way to reduce the demand for drugs is by informing parents of the problem and by spelling out to young people the dire consequences of drug taking.  Therefore, information and education followed by appropriate preventive action constitutes by far the best means of tackling drug abuse.  Facilities for youth including clubs, opportunities for sport and so on have an important role to play in preventing drug abuse.  They provide alternative activities to young people and help to keep them out of trouble.</P>
    <P>I have stressed the importance of information and advice in connection with the drug problem.  I am glad, therefore, to pay tribute to the director of the drug awareness programme, Father Paul Lavelle, and to his voluntary associates who are doing tremendous work in the field of arousing awareness and conveying information and advice to parents and young people and other interested groups.  The drug awareness programme <Col N="88" /> was established by the Archdiocese of Dublin.  It is only the second such programme to be established after one in New York City.  Father Lavelle is director of the programme and is now working full-time in that position.  I say &ldquo;Full marks to the Archdiocese of Dublin for the investment and vision they have shown in this respect.&rdquo;  The Catholic Church also makes a considerable contribution by placing all the resources it has to tackle the drug problem, such as the availability of halls for parental meetings and so on.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is an issue that is discussed in the House at very regular intervals, and the same applies in the Dáil.  It is the top economic and social issue facing this country today.  The scale of unemployed among young people is underlined in the report.  Unemployment in the under 25 category has trebled from 20,654 in 1980 to 67,162 in 1984.  These are grim statistics.  I remain firm in the belief, and I have spelled it out here before now, that the main obstacle to job creation, including jobs for young people is the penal taxation system.  We need a change of policy in relation to taxation. We need reform urgently so that a climate will be created where investment and effort will be rewarded, not penalised. Given the sheer scale of the unemployment problem the Government must examine a range of other issues in addition to the taxation system.</P>
    <P>The concept of alternance outlined in the report under which a young person's move from school to work would be a gradual process is deserving of attention by the Government.  This concept could provide an opportunity for the late teen-ager part student, part worker, to gain valuable experience in preparation for full-time work later on.  If the Minister has an opportunity to reply later, perhaps he would indicate whether this concept of alternance will be considered by his Department.  We might also consider what other attempts at job-sharing are being considered by the Department.</P>
    <P>It is evident from the report that unfulfilled employment expectations have shocked young people.  They have <Col N="89" /> shown considerable resilience, which can be expected from youth, in coping with this setback.  We cannot expect indefinite patience from our young people.  Therefore it behoves us, particularly as politicians, to be alert to this.  Our rating, as the Minister has indicated in his opening address, is already very low.  If we are not more successful in helping to solve the unemployment problem for young people we will be in dire straits.</P>
    <P>Young people want to be assured that everything possible is being done to provide them with job opportunities, as outlined in the report.  They believe that they are entitled to such opportunities in Ireland.  This places a serious obligation on all of us, particularly as Members of the Oireachtas and on the Minister and the Government to create the conditions in which jobs for our young people will be created and maintained.</P>
    <P>Education has a role to play in youth. The perceptions of Irish youth of education, as indicated in the survey report, are certainly worthy of serious consideration. Thankfully, the majority of those surveyed agreed that the education system broadens their outlook and helps them to communicate.  However, the responses were far less favourable in respect of the education system's contribution to explaining what working life is like, or helping them to understand Government and politics, an issue in which we have a particular interest &mdash; the curriculum is deficient in this regard &mdash; and also in providing sex education.</P>
    <P>The Curriculum and Examinations Board, which is now in session, will provide a very valuable opportunity to closely examine schools curricula.  I should like to think that the Minister of State, who is also Minister of State at the Department of Education, would use his influence in this regard.  I hope that courses to aid the transition from school to work will be explored, and even more broadly, I hope that education for life will receive consideration.  A life-skill programme, perhaps starting at primary level, covering for example, health education, the clarification of values in our society, decision making, in other words, <Col N="90" /> helping young children to learn how to say no to their pals &mdash; something quite simple but very important &mdash; should be considered by the Curriculum and Examinations Board.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to raise a technical matter relating to the definition of &ldquo;youth&rdquo;.  The Youth Employment Agency defines youth as anybody under 25 years.  The Age of Majority Bill, which is just now being considered in the House, defines it as 18 years.  The report before us considers youth as being in the age range of 12 years to 21 years.  I submit that it is high time we standardised an age for youth.  I welcome the report and if the opportunity presents itself I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I welcome the Costello Report.  I agree with the Minister that it is a major and historic report.  It is one of the most progressive reports that has been produced since the setting-up of the State.  This idea and concept should be pursued.  There are many things in the Communist countries which we do not like.  I have been to the USSR, Bulgaria and Hungary and I liked what I saw in the area of youth policy.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go over the ground covered in the report.  It is clear, decisive, it has made its recommendations and we are now at a decisive stage.  The Government are now confronted with a challenge. They must be instrumental in forging the necessary mechanism to co-ordinate all youth policy influences, including the family.  I support what Senator Hillery has said in relation to participation by youth and the family.  The co-ordination of all youth influences is a vital ingredient to the success of any Government action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want the Government to have a monoply position in this exercise.  In this 1985 International Youth Year they must be able to have sufficient executive powers to parcel out all the activities through the various voluntary organisations referred to by Senator Hillery.  The decisive stage which we are at is that the Government must now produce quick <Col N="91" /> and effective action through the announcement of a youth policy at which people can look, especially youth, discuss and participate.  This youth policy will be useless without the participation of youth. We must always remember that even in the distressing times which we live in, it is to youth we must look for the continuation of the life of this society in this Irish State inside the democratic concept, otherwise some other concept might take over.  We already have evidence of misguided youth in their efforts to try to resolve what is called the Anglo-Irish problem.  This is not the way, and we all know that.  Enough has been said about this.</P>
    <P>I commend the Taoiseach when he said that the committee should not be seen as just another committee set up to talk away a commitment.  I believe he meant what he said, and I accept the assurance given by the Minister that that is exactly what the Government mean.  This is a most progressive document.  It is historic and it will navigate and plan the course for the future, as Ireland must depend on youth.  There is no other way even, as I have already stated, in the distressing circumstances in which they find themselves and we find ourselves, almost totally incapable of resolving the unemployment problem and all that goes with it.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for his forthrightness, honesty and assurances. The task is urgent.  A youth policy should command all the energies of all the people, adult and youth throughout the country.  Those who are sufficiently concerned are awaiting the announcement of a new youth policy.  As I have already stated participation by youth is a necessary ingredient.  It will not work unless youth are given the opportunity to participate fully inside the new youth policy.</P>
    <P>One of the principal recommendations in the whole series of recommendations in the report is that the Government should indicate a timetable for implementation. That is the key.  They must indicate &mdash; they can do that fairly quickly, as distinct from the youth policy &mdash; a <Col N="92" /> timetable inside the whole periphery, inside all the recommendations made by the youth policy committee.  I quote from the second of the two final recommendations in their call for an announced timetable:</P>
    <P>This would clearly give a new sense of purpose to those working for young people and it would in a practical manner at least help some young people to become self-reliant, responsible and active participants in society.</P>
    <P>At the risk of reiteration &mdash; the Minister has already said that &mdash; that must be repeated.  The timetable must be produced in the coming months in this 1985 International Youth Year.  I am pleased that the Minister has said that he has actually set up a committee to organise some kind of international functions during 1985.  He is to be commended for that also.  It is to be hoped that the challenge will be faced with the will to succeed in an area vital to intelligent, constructive action and would, to my mind, represent a needed injection to the democratic concept in our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the other speakers, would like to welcome the introduction of this discussion on the National Youth Policy Committee report.  It is appropriate that at the beginning of the International Youth Year we should be discussing youth in the first session of the Seanad.  I sincerely hope that it will not be too long before we will have an opportunity to discuss the actual policies which the Government will bring forward as a result of this final report.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made already as to what is youth.  This is something we must address ourselves to.  We must address ourselves to the fact that the youth of today, whether we consider them to be 21 years or under or 25 years or under, are living in a society which is evolving at a faster rate than society has evolved, in any century or decade up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The traditional morals of life are changing fast also.  We have to look at what is a family.  In the old days a family consisted of a mother, father and children <Col N="93" /> living together in a home.  Then there was the interaction between school and that family and then the progression to the work situation and the evolving of a new family situation which took in the mother, father and the children.</P>
    <P>Society is changing so fast that families now cannot be considered to be only the family in which the mother and father are living at home.  There is an ever-growing number of single parent families, which are not officially considered to be families according to the State, where children are living in stable relationships with their parents or with a parent and another person in the house.  There are families which have evolved because of the possible divorce of one member of that particular home, or of the separation of one or other of the parents.  Nevertheless, in a lot of cases there is a stable relationship and children are being reared but the family in that instance is not the type of family that would have been considered to be a family situation ten years ago.</P>
    <P>There is an ever growing situation, thankfully, where unmarried mothers are keeping their children and are bringing them up in a single parent situation.  We must address ourselves as to whether the needs of the youth, who come from the background of a single parent family or, indeed, from a family which is not recognised by the State, are different from those who have been brought up in the traditional style of the father and mother married situation.</P>
    <P>At present, in the family situation, there is an instability in families which is brought about because of some of the things brought out strongly by the attitudes of youth towards the Church and towards politicians or the political establishment. No longer can we say that the Church has a major influence on young people, nor can it be said that political parties or the political establishment have a great direct involvement with young people.  During the sermon at Mass last Sunday it was brought out quite specifically that within the Catholic Church in the Ossory diocese a survey showed that less than 4 per cent of the young people <Col N="94" /> in the diocese felt they were getting anything out of their religion or, indeed, were they getting anything out of attendance at Mass on Sundays.  They went because it was a social expectation.  Only 4 per cent feel from their attendance at Church that they had a feeling of being at one with a higher being.  This must mean that the Church is failing in its attempt to get to young people.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the lack of understanding that young people have towards the political establishment.  Is it any wonder that at this stage they can feel alienated from the political process when they see that what was set up for them, supposedly, by the political process, the education system is failing them and that the provision of jobs is not being helped by Government policy?  It was never meant to be that the Government should provide all the jobs.  It should be left to the private individual in some cases and State involvement in other cases.  In actual fact, there is a dreadful lack of feeling amongst young people that the Government are doing anything but hinder them in their attempt to get jobs, not alone in their seeming failure to produce the jobs but in the manner in which, when they get jobs, such a large proportion of what they earn is taken away from them, whether it be in direct taxation, indirect taxation or levies of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that young people's perception of themselves, is different from the perception that is stated in paragraph 3.16 in which it says:</P>
    <P>Given our aspiration for a more democratic and participatory society the marked apathy, disinterest and lack of involvement amongst young people, the not insignificant minority who favour a violent solution to the political problems in the island, point to an area of priority concern.</P>
    <P>I felt this was one particular statement that was not in keeping with the rest of the report.  When one goes to the perception of the young people themselves, there is no way they show that they have an apathetic approach or that they are <Col N="95" /> disinterested and that they have a lack of involvement in the society in which they are living.  There is no doubt that adult perception or media perception of young people has been biased towards saying that young people are no good, that they are disinterested and that they are apathetic.</P>
    <P>The facts are totally different.  No matter where you go throughout Ireland you will find a large proportion of young people participating in the society in which they live.  Ninety per cent of them need to become involved and they become involved as much as possible. There is no doubt that we do not provide the back-up services and the range of services which they need in order to give them social and economic happiness.</P>
    <P>It is significant in the report that the perception people have of young people becoming more and more involved in crime is not a factual perception particularly when one reads that the conviction rate for young people has dropped considerable during the past ten years whereas the overall crime rate has increased.  This must mean that the crime rate among young people is not growing at the same rate as the crime rate among the not so young.</P>
    <P>The involvement of young people in the educational system is questioned by many of them because they see that the educational system is not giving them the self advancement they need in social or economic terms.  We have the attitude in too many schools and colleges that the points are what you must go for.  The primary schools are sending children into a secondary school situation where points for third level education are all important. This leads to a narrowing in the educational system, and a narrowing in the educational process for these young children.  In fact 90 per cent of them will not get to third level education.</P>
    <P>When one reads through the report one sees that very few people from the lower socio-economic groups get into third level education.  There will have to be a change in the educational system which will give people who are not going <Col N="96" /> into third level education a better chance to participate fully in life.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous lack of social education in this country.  With this drive towards third level education there is a narrowness coming back into education which was there in the thirties and forties, which disappeared for a short time in the fifties and sixties, but is back in a big way now.  If one studied the education system in Ireland before 1900 one would find that social education was as important a feature as the three Rs in primary schools.  One would find that even in the hedge schools, which lacked all the facilities, social education was deemed to be as important as formal education for the day-to-day needs of these young people. When one reads of young children of eight, nine and ten years learning Greek and French as part of their normal daily educational system in hedge schools in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries one can see how narrow the educational system we have at present has become.</P>
    <P>The attitude of young people towards education is changing.  The system of education will have to change to take in these attitudes.  We will have to take into account that people will have to be educated so that they can live their lives fully, even though for quite a proportion of these young people this might not lead to full time jobs.  During the time when they may not be in full time employment they will be capable of doing something which will be of benefit to themselves and to society in general.</P>
    <P>Speakers are confined to 15 minutes in this debate and this seems an extremely short time to debate something which is so important in today's society.  Since we are congratulating the Minister for initiating this particular discussion at the beginning of the International Youth Year I hope we will be able to have a full discussion before the year is finished on the policy document that will emerge as a result of this very fine report.  I thank the Minister for ensuring that it was brought to both Houses in a speedy manner.  Anybody who reads it will see the problems we have in society.  It gives an indication how some of these problems <Col N="97" /> can be resolved but that is only if the political will is there and if we see a policy document emerging as a result of this.</P>

      <P>It is my privilege formally to second the motion proposed by Senator Browne.  I would like to add to the congratulations to the members of the committee who so promptly brought forward their final report on this matter.  It is, as most Senators have said, very apt that we should be discussing it in this year which has been designated as International Youth Year.</P>
      <P>Very often, with a degree of scepticism founded on the past but certainly not in this case, the idea of a report meant that it was an effort by the Government of the day to sidestep an issue.  The Taoiseach's comment is an example.  He said that this is not to be a sidekick away from tackling this problem in this particular year.  I congratulate the Minister of State for his work since he has taken office in the Department of Labour, with responsibility for youth, to co-ordinate the efforts within Government.  He said earlier that it was important for every Minister to have a copy of this report on his desk. Placing copies of this report, like the copies of all the other reports that lie on Ministers' desks, is not the attitude I would adopt to it but rather that an all-embracing responsibility would be placed within one Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is often said that many of the things done towards placating the intolerance of youth at present are only gestures I hope it will be seen in this particular year that this country, with 50 per cent of our population under 25 years of age, would recognise the importance of youth by elevating the Minister of State's position to a full Ministry even if it means the abolition of some Ministries less relevant in the current circumstances.  I am sure some people will treat that comment as being sceptical in so far as I see it as another job for another boy.  I say this, not because of the youthful image of the Minister of State but because of the need for some action to be taken and for power to be given to the person who has to <Col N="98" /> initiate that action.  It is in that context I make that suggestion.  Hopefully it will fall on receptive ears along the line if there is need during the year for the amount of work that has to be done in this case.  In the International Youth Year it is a special responsibility for the people of Ireland because of our population structure.</P>
    <P>This Government have given meaningful response to the youth of the nation to date.  When people refer to the youth as being an asset &mdash; politicians do it when it is appropriate at election time; clergy do it on occasions when they say that the faith is to be carried on through the youth of the country &mdash; we recognise and fully accept that.  Employers on certain occasions say that the hope for the future depends on the initiative and inventiveness of youth and lies in the enthusiasm of young people.  All of this falls on deaf ears most of the time.  Elections come and go and the youth are forgotten when the votes are cast.  That has been the case in the past.  I am delighted that the Minister has put an end to that rot and has changed that scene.  Even though we hear certain sections of youth protesting violently and militantly at times we can confidently say that youth, by and large are a responsible body and have shown responsibility down the years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank <Col N="99" /> you for giving me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment, that immediate arrangements be made for the provision of natural gas in the Limerick area as a matter of exceptional and extreme urgency.  I am delighted as a member of the Limerick City Council to do this and to do so not alone on my own behalf but on behalf of my colleagues on the city council who requested me to do so on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Since 1978 deputations from the Limerick City Council have been received by five Ministers for Energy. Firm commitments have been given that Limerick would receive an appropriate allocation of natural gas.  All of these deputations from both the city council and the Limerick Gas Company have stressed that unless an allocation of natural gas is made available Limerick Gas Company would continue to lose substantial amounts of money and customers and would have to close, with the imminent and immediate effect of putting 40 people out of work, men who have served the Limerick Gas Company and the people of Limerick for over 100 years.  This would mean also that approximately 6,000 consumers of 24,000 people in all would be left without any means of cooking. Such a closure was imminent in 1980, as can be seen from the city manager's report of that year.  This closure was deferred by Limerick Corporation when the Government announced their intention to extend natural gas to areas such as Limerick.  Since 1980 Limerick Corporation have persevered with the operation of this gas undertaking, an undertaking which has become a very serious financial liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The magnitude of the task facing Limerick City Council and the Limerick Gas Company can be seen from the fact that the purchase price of naphtha, the feedstock that is used by Limerick Corporation and the Gas Company, has risen from £14 per tonne in 1973 to £320 per tonne in 1983.  That represents an astonishing and unparalled increase of 2,200 per cent in a period of ten years from 1973 to 1983.  This has meant that the <Col N="100" /> accumulated cash liability of Limerick Gas Company &mdash; and of course it is a mere subsidiary of Limerick Corporation &mdash; is now in excess of £2 million.  It will continue to lose £1,000 per day unless there is conversion to natural gas.</P>
    <P>In addition, since 1980 Limerick Corporation at the behest of the Department of Energy have spent over £150,000 by way of consultancy fees on independent studies, all of which confirm that Limerick Gas Company could operate successfully, with profits, if given an allocation of natural gas, an allocation which is already available to over 1,000,000 people in Ireland, in Dublin and Cork.  A crucial deputation was received by a former Minister for Energy on 30 August 1983.  He confirmed and insisted that natural gas would be made available to Limerick, but he also insisted and informed us that certain conditions would have to be fulfilled before BGE would be instructed to proceed with the construction of a pipeline to Limerick. These conditions included proof of a viable market for natural gas; the setting-up of a new company with proven competence and with management and technical expertise.  The project, he insisted, must not depend totally on public funding and the transitional arrangements for the transfer of the affairs of the existing undertaking to the new company would have to be satisfactory.</P>
    <P>On 12 July 1984 the assistant secretary of the Department of Energy, on the direction of the Minister for Energy, wrote to the Limerick city manager in which he stated that &ldquo;within the context of continued public ownership&rdquo; the Minister wished to be advised whether a private minority participation was considered and with what effect or result. The letter continued, &ldquo;Such minority shareholding would not be inconsistent with continued public control&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All of the conditions that were specified by the previous Minister for Energy have now been met, and a proposal to set up a new company to run Limerick Gas has been negotiated.  The new company would consist of Amgas with 40 per <Col N="101" /> cent shareholding; Limerick Corporation, 40 per cent and BGE, 20 per cent. Negotiations were undertaken by Limerick Corporation and BGE during the summer of 1984.  An agreement has been reached on the terms of a supply contract and Amgas are agreeable to the terms negotiated.  I am informed by the Limerick city manager that no further business remains to be transacted between Limerick Corporation, BGE, Amgas and the Department of Energy at official level. What is now awaited is a Government decision on these proposals.  Limerick Corporation and Limerick City Council favour the implementation of these arrangements negotiated with Amgas over any other arrangements as to ownership and control of the gas undertaking for many reasons.</P>
    <P>The new company, with Amgas involvement, would bring to the Limerick Gas Company the strongest available expertise in the gas distribution business particularly in the area of marketing.  Amgas itself consists mainly of Calor Teoranta with 50 per cent; Irish Life with 10 per cent; McMullan Brothers, 20 per cent and Tedcastle McCormick 20 per cent. There is also the commitment to social policy considerations in the Amgas-Limerick Corporation proposal.  These considerations are reflected in the gas development plan, by providing, for example, for the supply of natural gas to both public and private housing developments and housing schemes not alone in Limerick city but also in its environs.</P>
    <P>No financial burden is sought to be imposed on the State in respect of this project other than the cost of the transmission pipeline &mdash; which is the duty of BGE &mdash; and the cost of conversion of the existing system to natural gas.  On the other hand, provision is made for the immediate recoupment of all present corporation indebtedness in the gas division. The corporation are entitled to 40 per cent of the profits on a continuing basis. The arrangements with Amgas are capable of immediate implementation as soon as Government approval is received.  This has the decided advantage for Limerick Corporation of curtailing <Col N="102" /> the continued build-up of losses in the existing undertaking, presently running at the rate of £1,000 per day.  The loss of customers continues relentlessly.  Further losses are threatened unless a supply of natural gas is made available immediately to Limerick.</P>
    <P>Amgas have indicated that if a clear decision is not forthcoming soon they will have to consider alternative arrangements for development of their financial and manpower resources.  In this connection, in the absence of Amgas as partners, Limerick Corporation is unaware of any other private sector partner who would be available to undertake the project jointly with them.  Therefore, it is quite clear that it is imperative that an immediate decision be given by the Government to enable natural gas to be provided in Limerick during 1985-1986 and to ensure that a satisfactory distribution company will exist by approving of the agreement between Limerick Corporation and Amgas, or at least approving of an alternative proposal which will be equally good.</P>
    <P>Therefore, on behalf of my colleagues in the city council, on behalf of the city manager and all the employees of Limerick Gas Company I am urging the Minister for Energy, who has a very special knowledge of and interest in Limerick, and the Government to give the green light for the provision of natural gas to Limerick and to authorise BGE under section 8 of the Gas Act, 1976 to proceed with the extension of the transmission pipeline to Limerick.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter here this evening.  I would like to thank the Minister for coming here to hear the case I have presented on behalf of my colleagues in the city council and on behalf of some of my colleagues who are particularly interested in this problem of providing natural gas for their own areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to compliment Senator Kennedy on the manner in which he has made his case.  From my discussions with Limerick Corporation and with the Lord <Col N="103" /> Mayor a few days ago when he visited me in my home in Tralee to discuss this matter in detail on behalf of the council, I have a fair understanding of the situation. I will reply briefly to some of the points made by Senator Kennedy and try to give him an idea of what the position is at present.</P>
      <P>It has always been recognised that Limerick was a location, and indeed a very suitable location, which should benefit from a supply of natural gas.  Recognition of this in fact is manifested in the financial and package which was afforded to Limerick Gas Company in 1981.  Various studies have been carried out subsequently by Limerick Gas which supported the viability of the project.  In the normal course of events one would have expected that the assessment of the project would have been concluded at an earlier stage.  However, there were many possibilities in relation to the composition of the new gas company to be formed and all the possibilities had to be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was my concern, and perhaps the concern of the previous five Ministers for Energy since 1979, that all the possible vehicles for the bringing of natural gas to Limerick should be examined thoroughly.  This, of course, involved the re-evaluation of the approach to the project and it brought the negotiations which were carried out during the past 12 months to a level of tripartite discussions between Limerick Gas, Bord Gais Éireann and Amgas.  I certainly have every intention of ensuring that gas is brought to Limerick at the earliest possible date. When I met the Corporation in September of 1984 I assured them of my intention to have the matter concluded as quickly as possible.  My concern, and I am sure the concern of every public representative in the Oireachtas, is to ensure that the agreement which is hammered out is a fair and acceptable deal and one which can be accepted by Government to protect the interests of this State, and of course in protecting the interests of the State one would also be protecting the interests of the consumer of the natural gas in the Limerick area.  Natural gas is <Col N="104" /> an exciting resource which we, as a State, are lucky to have discovered in the 1970s and it is one which we must take care to ensure is put to the best possible use as it is obviously a finite resource.</P>
    <P>As the Senator said, the Limerick Gas Company has been in existence for over 100 years.  The gas company has always been in public ownership.  The State has carried the losses of the company and has already provided additional financial aid to keep it going pending the final decision. The State, through BGE will incur further substantial costs in piping the gas to Limerick and perhaps further west in due course.  It is my responsibility to see that the State gets a fair and adequate return for this substantial investment.</P>
    <P>The Senator outlined the proposition as he understands it which in fact is under examination in my Department, and mentioned the possibilities for a project with 40 per cent private shareholding and the remainder remaining between BGE and Limerick Corporation.  Of course, the Senator did not mention other aspects of the possible deal in relation to call options by the private company involved, call options which would come to fruition after a period of about eight years which, of course, would be a very significant time in the lifespan of this project because the company would be coming into profitability, having paid its costs, at that stage, according to projections.  This is one of the fundamental difficulties in relation to the structure of the new company which has to be formed, because there has been an insistence on the part of the private company involved in discussions that they must ultimately have majority control over the new company which is to be formed.  Obviously the most important aspect of the consideration is the matter of the investment to be made by all parties and the returns being made by all parties.  It would be my intention to ensure that the costs are borne proportionately across the board by all parties involved.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the consideration of the project has been prolonged.  This is because the underlying issues of participation commence with investment.  I am <Col N="105" /> certainly anxious to see a successful outcome through negotiation between the parties.  I hope and I believe that this can be achieved quickly.  The timescale for the pipeline construction and the arrangements for the distribution of natural gas in Limerick city are dependent on the outcome of these discussions, and I do not envisage any major delays and I can assure the Senator, as I have assured his colleague, the Lord Mayor, Deputy Prendergast, that that matter will be brought to a conclusion fairly rapidly.</P>
    <P>I would say that the responsibility which I have to exercise in the public interest as Minister for Energy in the Government is to see that the deal is fair from the point of view of the State's interest and that the State is not asked to carry a burden which is not commensurate with the level of investment that the <Col N="106" /> State will be putting into this project and is not out of proportion in relation to the other partners in any new company which would be formed.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House, the Cathaoirleach and the mover of the motion that the project will be under way in 1985 and certainly from my point and from Bord Gáis Éireann's point of view we will be expecting that we will have the same expeditious handling of the building of the pipeline as we experienced in the Cork to Dublin pipeline and that the people of Limerick can look forward without any further delays to having a supply of natural gas which they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 February 1985.</P>
