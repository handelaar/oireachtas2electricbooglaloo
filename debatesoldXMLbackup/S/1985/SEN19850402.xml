      <P>I have notice from Senator Donie Cassidy that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter.</P>
      <P>The serious implications for the tourist industry in the Lakeland region of the midlands by the proposed closure of the Midland Regional Tourist Board's office in Mullingar.</P>
      <P>I regret I have to rule that this matter is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

    <Title>Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1985: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers of the Electricity Supply Board to place any electric line above or below ground, across any land and to attach to any wall, house, or other building any bracket or other fixture required for the carrying or support of an electric line or any electrical apparatus are set out in section 53 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927.</P>
      <P>In exercising these powers the ESB make every effort to ensure that they will cause as little inconvenience as possible, or disturbance to property and, indeed, it is an integral part of the board's procedures to visit landowners concerned to discuss with them the route of the electric line and the planned positions of masts. All suggestions for changes made by the landowners are then carefully and fully considered by the board in an effort to meet the wishes of the landowners and changes are made where this can be done within technical and economic limitations and without unreasonably affecting other landowners.  Finally, the board issue a wayleave notice in writing to the owner or occupier of the lands in accordance with section 53, subsection (3), of the 1927 Act and if within seven days the owner or occupier of the lands gives consent, or fails to give consent, the ESB may place the electric line across the lands in question.  The ESB do, however, pay compensation, but on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis, for the disturbance to farming or for the sterilisation of lands arising from the placing of the electric line over the lands.  The amount of compensation paid is based on guidelines agreed with the Irish Farmers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A problem has arisen for the ESB with regard specifically to subsection (5) of <Col N="1627" /> section 53 of the 1927 Act.  The ESB are erecting a 220 Kv transmission line from the generating station at Great Island, Campile, County Wexford, to a transformer station at Arklow, County Wicklow. The route of the line passed over particular lands in County Wexford where the owner objected to the erection of the line and locked out the ESB workers when they attempted to erect the line across the property in accordance with a statutory notice served on the landowner under section 53 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927.</P>
    <P>The ESB sought and obtained an injunction against the landowner in the High Court in June 1983 when all the various grounds of the owner's case were rejected by the trial judge.  The landowner then appealed to the Supreme Court and that court, having heard the case in early February 1985, issued its judgment on Thursday, 21 March 1985.</P>
    <P>The court acknowledged clearly the social benefits of electricity and its contribution to the economic welfare of the State and pointed out that the uncontradicted evidence adduced in the case of the necessity for and the value of the transmission line to the national supply system leads to an inescapable conclusion that the power to lay it compulsorily is a requirement of the common good.  The court did not, however, accept a contention that the payment of compensation <i>ex gratia</i> in an amount determined by the ESB is to be equated with a right to compensation, lacking as it does the essential ingredient of the ultimate right to have the amount assessed by an independent arbitrator or tribunal.  The court was, therefore, satisfied that the compulsory powers contained in section 53 (5) of the Act of 1927 are invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Legal advice is that the Supreme Court judgment means that, while the erection of all electricity lines can continue where there are consents or negotiated agreements, the use of the power to enter under section 53 (5), where there is not consent, requires to be supported by a <Col N="1628" /> provision at law for compensation and for the determination of that, in the absence of agreement, by independent arbitration.  I do not have to underline for the House the disastrous effect which delays or inability to carry forward their work would have on the ESB's every day operations in the extension of supply to all consumers whether industrial, commercial or domestic.  I am confident that the consent and negotiation procedures which the ESB have carried on with landowners and their representatives will continue to be successful in the vast majority of cases, but the court ruling requires an express statutory provision for compensation and on arbitration.</P>
    <P>The first 300 MW unit of the Moneypoint generating station is scheduled to come on stream on 1 October 1985.  The ESB have scheduled their weekly work programmes, including the erection of the transmission lines to Dublin, to meet this deadline.  The board have calculated that every week's delay in meeting the 1 October 1985 deadline will cost the board £1 million in lost benefit through having to meet electricity demand from other higher cost generating capacity rather than from the Money point station.  Any delay, therefore, in completing the erection of the 400 K V transmission lines will cost the ESB £1 million for each week's delay.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate the paramount need that the ESB be not held up in proceeding with their work even in cases where consent is not forthcoming. Having regard to the implications for the ESB arising from the Supreme Court judgment, it is imperative that the board's wayleave powers be made constitutional as a matter of extreme urgency. The Bill before the House is designed to achieve that purpose by providing for the entitlement of landowners to compensation in respect of the exercise by the ESB of the powers conferred under section 53 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, such compensation to be assessed, in default of agreement between the ESB and any landowner, under the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> When this Bill was in the Dáil last week a number of Deputies expressed the hope that the seven day notice in the Act could be increased to, say, 14 days or, at least, to give some better notice.  I sympathise with this point of view but I am assured that the ESB have never refused any objection made outside the seven day deadline.  On this deadline, I would like to remind the House that the period was 14 days in the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927 but this was reduced to seven days in an amending Act of 1945 solely to benefit consumers waiting for connection of electricity supply and, particularly in emergency cases, including, for example, local events such as fairs or fetes where supply was required within a very short time scale.  Nevertheless, I have undertaken to impress upon the ESB the need to give ample notice and to exercise the greatest care and sensitivity in dealing with landowners' rights.</P>
    <P>I would add two further brief comments. The common good in any democracy depends on reasonable people acting, all round, in a reasonable way. Electricity has brought immense benefits to all communities in this country and elsewhere.  It has brought immense relief to the darkness, hardship and low levels of comfort in rural life up to the mid fifties.  It is perfectly right that landowners' rights should indeed be sensitively dealt with, as I am assured they are, but it is equally right that everybody has a duty not to press his or her private rights to the ultimate, to the obstruction or detriment of the common good.</P>
    <P>However, I would emphasise that this Bill will increase and secure further the rights of landowners.  It will, of course, enable the ESB to continue with the essential work of expanding the social benefits of electricity to the economic welfare of the State which, as I mentioned earlier, has been acknowledged by the Supreme Court in its judgment, but its primary purpose is to provide for landowners a statutory right to compensation &mdash; in place of the <i>ex gratia</i> basis on which the ESB paid compensation heretofore &mdash; and to have the amount of the compensation settled by independent <Col N="1630" /> arbitration where this cannot be achieved by negotiation and agreement.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill which the Minister has brought in to amend the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927 is necessary in the eyes of the public and for the common good, and it gives us an opportunity of looking at some of the other aspects of the ESB's activities.  This Bill provides seven days notice for the ESB but if I ask them for a connection I would be lucky to receive it in seven months.  This has been a bone of contention especially for people building houses in rural areas who have found that not alone is waiting for connections very time consuming but also that the charges being extracted from them for power supplies are very high.  I ask the Minister to take up this point with the ESB because in rural areas people are having major problems with the delay in the provision of power supplies.  We can all understand that farmers have to be compensated for the very awkward situations in which they are very often left when the ESB are forced to erect pylons in positions which cause major problems in the use of their farm land. The amount of land lost to those pylons may seem very small in some people's eyes but the inconvenience caused can be a major problem to the farmers concerned. Tillage farmers can be forced to let a small plot of land lie unproductive due to the fact that it is covered by a pylon.</P>
      <P>Also in rural areas not all people who are getting supplies are granted the EC subsidy which to all intents and purposes has been almost abolished.  This subsidy of 80 per cent towards the cost of provision of a power supply in rural areas for farming purposes is a major loss.  Not alone should it be available to farmers, it should also have been made available to any person building a house in a rural area because such people have the problems of providing services for themselves, unlike people in urban areas, and they are being charged all along the way for the provision of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> The Minister also said it is hoped that Moneypoint will be in operation by 1 October 1985.  I hope that this will not sound the death knell for the small power stations such as those using peat and Arigna power station in my own area which uses home produced coal.  It is sad to think that we are now going to import coal at quite a high price and that we will leave some of our own natural resources unused for the provision of power.  The Minister states that it will probably be more economic, but everything cannot be measured in economic terms.  We were told some time ago that if a major breakdown were to occur at Arigna that station could become obsolete and would not be repaired.  I appeal to the Minister to make sure that this does not come about because the closing of power stations such as Arigna would be a major economic blow to rural Ireland.  While economics must be considered I hope that we will not do away with major employers and major sources of income in these areas which are so short of employment.</P>
    <P>I will not oppose the Bill, but I agree with a number of the speakers in the Dáil who expressed a preference for a 14-day period rather than the seven mentioned in the Bill.  The ESB do not do things overnight and should be in a position to give at least 14 days notice of their intentions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and recognise the need for it.  If in the past the ESB have been restricted in carrying out the work, there is a need to give them the opportunity to carry out that work with the utmost speed.  However, if the ESB are to have power to make their acquisitions speedily, it is necessary that there be a <i>quid pro quo</i> and that subscribers seeking supply of electricity will also have a speeded up reaction as a result of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often I am baffled by the operations of the ESB.  I am glad to get the opportunity to say that I believe much of the work of the ESB planning section lacks imagination.  I am sure you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, are well acquainted with <Col N="1632" /> the present direction and course of the Moneypoint power line, and a look at the amenities of the area over which it passes will reveal that it has destroyed very many fine landscapes.  While I understand that developments and progress cannot be halted, there should be some recognition of this fact.  I am not too sure how seriously the ESB take that aspect into account.  I see many landscapes destroyed by the unsightly erection of power lines which by their nature are very conspicuous.</P>
    <P>The planning that has gone into Moneypoint to date seems to have been an engineering blunder.  This time last year the power lines were practically completed in the area which passes very close to my place in County Galway but during the last three months I have seen men going back to those pylons, removing the original foundations and resetting them at an enormous cost.  Each pylon may cost something in the region of £50,000 to erect, I am open to correction on that, and with research and development, and the acquisition of land, each pylon could cost a far greater sum.  The ESB are removing the foundations of every one of those pylons and replacing them with hundreds of tons of concrete for new foundations.  I cannot understand why they have to go back at enormous expense &mdash; far greater than the initial cost &mdash; and reconstruct those power lines.  If the ESB have an answer for that failure of the engineering section, I would like to hear it.</P>
    <P>There is public concern about not just the power lines and the erection of those power lines over a particular landscape, but about the health hazard such power lines can be.  Many people have publicly expressed serious concern about this but to date, other than a glib assurance from the public relations section of the ESB, I have not heard a reasoned account from the ESB which would allay the fears about the safety and health of those living permanently adjacent to very high tension power lines.  In future developments &mdash; such as we have from Moneypoint to Dublin &mdash; there should be a far greater <Col N="1633" /> consciousness of the landscape or terrain over which those power lines would pass.</P>
    <P>Many people, including some of my constituents, have made very serious complaints against the ESB locally about the delay in knowing exactly what compensation they are entitled to.  Trucks, tractors, huge machinery, have ploughed into landscapes at all times of the year, often at very unfavourable times and the ESB must be criticised for that.  It would cost the ESB less in the long run if in future, they took all these circumstances into consideration.</P>
    <P>Compensation for damage to land is one thing, but when people actually objected to the ESB coming on to their land the reply they got was that the matter would be settled in the courts. Some people have been waiting three years for the courts to decide.  I know the ESB have no jurisdiction over the long delays that occur through the court system but I believe there would be far less hassle or need to go through the costly exercise of legal proceedings if the ESB were more forthcoming in dealing with the public than they have been to date.  A great PR exercise has been lost through the actions of the ESB to date. I would like the Minister to let us know if there has been a failure in the original design of the pylon, or if there has been a failure with regard to part or all of the Moneypoint line which is in course of construction.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the new connections that have been mentioned by the last speaker.  In rural areas where the ESB have supplied power they did not provide maintenance, except where there was storm damage or something like that. They left a system which would hopefully, supply the required service, but when new connections are demanded the applicant has to foot the bill for any additional work carried out.  When I say &ldquo;additional&rdquo; I mean that the new subscriber has to pay for the repairs and maintenance that are long overdue and will have to pay for the costing.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland one transformer can supply two or three houses and another applicant for domestic supply may not be <Col N="1634" /> a great burden on that transformer but if a new engineering works applies for electricity and a new transformer is needed the subscriber has to pay for it. This may cost thousands of pounds which many new subscribers are not able to pay.  Long term finance arrangements are available through the ESB, but they are equally costly.  Many people do not like to get large two-monthly demands, especially when they are setting up a new home.  This could cripple them financially at a time when it is difficult to get jobs in rural Ireland.  The ESB should not take advantage of new subscribers by burdening them with what is really a maintenance job the ESB should have carried out many years before.</P>
    <P>Under the western package there are substantial grants of 65 per cent for new subscribers, but the conditions laid down for that scheme are very rigid and selective. Many people who make applications under that scheme are turned down and the appeal system is nothing more than a rubber stamp.  Having been refused the grant assistance towards the provision of supply, it is very seldom that the person makes a successful appeal because rarely, if ever, are the ESB's decisions changed to the satisfaction of the applicant.  Perhaps this is an indication of the thoroughness of the first examination they give the application, but very often it has been proved to be otherwise.  They are reluctant to change their minds.  I ask the Minister to examine the question of new connections, particularly in the west, in places which are far removed from existing supply.  They should be less rigid in their demands and not confine supply to areas which are FEOGA aided.</P>
    <P>Many people wonder at the capacity we have for electricity generation.  The Minister mentioned that delays in the connection of some generating stations would cost £1 million per week.  At various times, particulary at election time, there are rumours that X, Y or Z stations, whether in peatbog land areas, the midlands or on the western seaboard in places like Screebe in Connemara or Arigna are to close.  There is a great debate and somebody brings in a rescue <Col N="1635" /> package.  The ESB and the Government should come clean on this.  If we are talking about planning, we must know exactly what is to happen.  That is important for the many people who have, over the years, provided service in the smaller generating stations and for those who live in the areas and are part of the social as well as the economic structure there. There should be a firm indication given about the lifetime of those stations.  They are not decisions that can be made at the snap of a finger.  The people working there are entitled to due notice that the lifetime of the stations are coming to an end.</P>
    <P>Often people who criticise the inefficiency of the peat-burning stations do so out of ignorance.  We can down them if we want to by quoting figures and percentages but it is important to recognise the need they fulfilled over the years.</P>
    <P>I recognise the need for this Bill whereby the ESB, with due consultation, have the power to make decisions, have forward planning and have the right to enter lands.  The ESB need to carry out a far better PR job if they are to be successful.  It would be much better than going through long court proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that after 50 years there should be some change made as far as the ESB are concerned. The ESB have too much power as regards the erection of pylons and poles on farmer's land compared to other bodies such as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who had to erect lines along the road if possible and not enter farmland at all.</P>
      <P>Farmers suffered a lot at the time of rural electrification.  They were not as organised as they are today and had to put up with what happened.  I saw poles placed 10 yards from a fence even though they could have been erected at the side of the fence thus avoiding obstruction to the farmer.  From now on I expect there will be more co-operation between the ESB and the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad to see our scenery being destroyed by pylons.  There are not many <Col N="1636" /> in my area but two years ago I met some people in Killaloe who were up in arms because pylons were being brought across the Shannon.  They told me they had made several protests to the ESB but had not succeeded in getting the route changed.  It meant cutting down woods and so on in that area.  That is something the ESB could have avoided.  It seems that when the ESB decide there is to be a line from Cork to Dublin it does not matter what stands in the way, it has to be destroyed.  I have not been in Killaloe since then and do not know what happened but I hope something will be done by the ESB to preserve the beauty of that area.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the ESB to consider putting heavy power lines underground.  There are enough wires all over the country as it is.  Gas cannot be brought by pylon or overhead wires but the ESB could learn a lot from the laying of the gas pipeline from Cork to Dublin. People said it would take two or three years to bring the gas to Dublin but it took two or three months.  One would want to be there to see those people at work and the way they made agreements with the landowners and so on.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to see that if this Bill was not passed it would cost the ESB £1 million per week to finish the Moneypoint line to Dublin.  I thought that line was finished some time ago.  It is two or three years since it was first mentioned.  Senator Burke mentioned that they had to reinforce the foundations of those pylons. That means there was a mistake made by some officials or engineers in the ESB. Moneypoint will cost a lot more, and who will pay for the mistakes of others?  It is the consumer who will have to pay. Shortly after the pylons were erected, a number of them were blown down by a storm.  In every walk of life today, it is the taxpayer, the ratepayer and the consumer who have to pay the penalty for mistakes made.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the west of Ireland it now costs about £2,000 for a new householder to get electricity installed.  The EC grant of up to 80 per cent has almost gone and is going altogether.  A young couple <Col N="1637" /> who buy a site and build a house have to pay £2,000 for the installation of electricity. That is going a bit far.  Electricity should be installed in every house without any cost as it was in the early days.</P>
    <P>The Bill is necessary.  In the old days farmers got little or no compensation for the amount of damage done to their farms by the ESB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and appreciate the rationale of this Bill and the need for it.  There is general acceptance that the supply of electricity is necessary not only for the economic wellbeing of the country but also the social wellbeing in the 1980s.  I should like to take this opportunity to make two general points.  First, I want to talk for a moment about the general strategy of the ESB in their approach to the provision of electricity and their plans for future consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Howlin, I allowed some Senators to drift a little bit.  I will also give you some latitude but not the amount I gave to an earlier speaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your position. The point I wanted to make was the need for power lines.  This is relevant to the Bill.  I became interested in energy when the Carnsore project was being mooted for my county in the latter part of the seventies.  At that stage we had a projected expectation of growth in electricity consumption.  It was expected that there would be a huge increase in demand for electricity throughout the eighties. That has not come to pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consequences of that in terms of costings for electricity are evident in that we have some of the most expensive electricity in the developed world, in the industrial countries we are competing with directly for markets.  Forecasting can never be an exact science but I hope that it will be possible to be a bit closer to the figure in the future so that our native fuel burning stations will not be in danger of being closed down or phased out, and indeed not only the native fuel burning stations but also some of the very efficient <Col N="1638" /> oil burning stations like Great Island referred to by the Minister which is located in my constituency.  It is important that we safeguard the jobs in existence there and the communities who are dependent on them, rather than rushing ahead and providing an electricity supply for which there is no demand and for which there is a bill to be met.</P>
    <P>I appreciate, as I said, that forecasting cannot be an exact science.  I also appreciate that the ESB have a responsibility to provide electricity and that the consequences of their decisions are very great for the nation.  Should they under-estimate demand, the consequences of that would be far more serious than overestimation. I fully accept that.  I hope the actual projections will be closer to the mark in future.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the environmental implications of the provision of electricity supply.  I do this from two perspectives. First, there is the effect on the visual amenities of having huge pylons dotted across the country.  Somebody described them in the other House as giants marching across the landscape.  The technology must exist to supply electricity without ravaging some of the most beautiful and picturesque landscapes in Ireland.  The technology must exist to provide it underground or by more aesthetic means than those currently employed.</P>
    <P>The other environmental aspect I want to talk about is a more serious one, that is, the growing belief that people living in close proximity to the overhead pylons, or working continuously beneath them or in their shadow, are at risk from a health perspective.  That is a great cause of concern and is a great worry to many people. Research in this area is limited.  I hope the Minister can assure me and the people who will be affected by this legislation that their health will not be adversely affected by the proximity of overhead pylons which are required for the common good.</P>
    <P>I want to re-echo the point made by other Senators about the prohibitive cost for young people of getting an electricity supply to their new homes.  The message often goes out from the State through its <Col N="1639" /> agencies to young people in particular: Stay put; do not try to do anything for yourself because we the State will provide it for you and, if you have the daring and the imagination to go out and build your own house and provide the essentials, we will tie a millstone of cost around your neck.  I hope the Minister will receive that message sent out by many Senators in the course of the debate today and look at some mechanism whereby the cost factor to young people in particular of getting an electricity supply can be reduced.  I accept the necessity for the Bill and I will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief.  The effects of the Bill will impinge on an area about which I, like the other Members of the House, have a deep concern.  I will not oppose the Bill. I agree that its primary purpose is to provide for landowners a statutory right to compensation in place of the <i>ex gratia</i> basis on which the ESB paid compensation heretofore.  It is a matter of extreme urgency both from the point of view of cost and the provision of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board have extensive powers under the 1927 and 1945 Acts.  Those are necessary although, as some Members said, they go a bit far.  In effect, the ESB can erect power lines wherever they want to.  They can connect lines to buildings.  In general there seems to be no end to what they can do.  In the early fifties I was fortunate to get employment with the ESB on the rural electrification scheme.  My experience would bear out what the Minister has said that, by and large, lines are erected by consent and under negotiated agreements. I do not know of any occasions when lines were otherwise erected. Nevertheless, many landowners are dissatisfied because while in effect they might be able to negotiate regarding the location of lines or poles, very seldom is there the choice of not having poles on their land.  It is Hobson's choice in all cases and often the value of the land was lowered by the placing of these poles, <Col N="1640" /> especially with regard to cultivation and ploughing in that area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the environmental aspect, I agree totally with what has been said by previous speakers.  In areas of scenic beauty such as Donegal, the west and Kerry, the environment is practically destroyed by these poles and networks of lines.  They are also just as objectionable in other areas.  The large pylons and large poles stand out as sore thumbs but rural electrification made this a widespread problem all over the country.  People who are erecting buildings are restricted by planning permission, but the ESB do not seem to be restricted in any way.  While there are proper criticisms of some of our buildings, these can be softened to some extent and enhanced by the planting of trees and shrubs, but nothing can be done about poles.  These poles stand up as pillars of progress and plunder at the same time, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the previous speaker that serious consideration should be given to having these power lines underground.  Section 53 of the Act should be altered to that effect.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
    <P>The Board and also any authorised undertaker may subject to the provisions of this section, and of regulations made by the Board under this Act, place any electric line above or below ground across any land not being a street, road, railway, or tramway.</P>
    <P>With regard to the environment and the visual amenities which have been mentioned, we are inclined to think of the environment as something apart from costs, but costs must include damage which will affect the people living there, which will affect our tourism and which will affect the attractiveness of an area. With all the other Members I would ask that power lines wherever possible, would be underground.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to the seven days notice which is mentioned in this Bill, I do not see any reason to change from the 14 days, although I appreciate what the Minister has said.  In section 4 of the 1953 <Col N="1641" /> Act 14 days notice is mentioned.  I would urge it as reasonable that we keep to 14 days notice but I appreciate that the Bill is necessary and I will not oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I welcome this Bill.  It deserves all our support. There are a few points I would like to raise for the attention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>One thing that is not specifically mentioned here or in the Minister's speech is the question of insurance.  One assumes that this whole area is adequately catered for already in previous legislation, but it is of paramount importance because if there were any injury or loss of life to humans or animals absolute, full and correct compensation should be provided for.  This is an extremely important aspect.  The Bill essentially talks about compensation to landowners for pylons erected on their farms.  It is very difficult to quantify precisely the effect of these pylons.  It varies enormously from area to area and from grass farming areas to tillage areas.  The pylons would not have the same consequential effects on the cultivation of pastureland as it would on tillage operations.  For that reason I suggest that arbitration might be provided for agreement on compensation where people are not satisfied with the guidelines drawn up between the Irish Farmers' Association and the ESB.  That is a very good basis, but perhaps there could be provision for some redress, or appeal through an arbitrator, or some way to get the matter sorted out.</P>
      <P>On the question of compensation, it would be very hard to quantify this precisely because we are talking of travelling on various types of land, about travelling with very heavy machinery on land.  On certain types of land this would do no harm but it would upset on a permanent basis the whole texture of other land, the whole draining quality of the land and the whole permeation of water through it &mdash; or, indeed, not through it &mdash; in the future.  For that reason, it is a very variable thing and I do not think it would be easy to standardise on a set situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of timing, the Minister <Col N="1642" /> very clearly spoke about consultation between the landowner and the ESB. Allowing for that &mdash; and it is very desirable that there be maximum consultation with regard to when the project would be undertaken &mdash; I would share the view that seven days is a short time, too short from the point of view of giving notice. There is another matter connected with this which ought to be examined.  With regard to the consultation, what exactly does this mean?  Does it mean that a certain route is planned by the ESB and the landowner is told that that is the route?  He has little choice in this, because if there is any deviation from set routes, it can in many cases reduce the amount of compensation paid.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister give us an indication of the level and also precisely the manner of payment?  Is it to be done through a person's accounts or will it be done on an annual basis?  I think nobody could oppose this Bill.  I wholeheartedly support it.  It is a progressive Bill and essential to allow certain developments for the good of the nation.  But, in that whole process, it is essential that the various elements I have mentioned, together with others mentioned by other Members, be taken into account.  At the end of the day the person on whose land these structures are placed ought not be at any loss.  Nor should they be placed in a position in which they would gain substantially therefrom.  But one must take account of the fact that these structures are there, that apart from their nuisance value in the operation of machinery and the like there is the danger of young people climbing these pylons which can cause accidents.  There is also a danger of injury to livestock from wires falling on them, which naturally is secondary to the dangers to human life.</P>
    <P>Having posed those questions I recommend that the Bill be given full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Members who have contributed in a very constructive manner to this Bill.  I <Col N="1643" /> am also grateful for what will have been its speedy passage through this House.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with two points of major importance raised by a number of Senators.  In relation to the cost of connections, the ESB pay 40 per cent of the capital cost of connections in rural areas with the applicant paying the remaining 60 per cent.  Under the western package electrification scheme the State pays 40 per cent of the capital costs of installation, the EC pays 40 per cent and the applicant the balance of 20 per cent. On this special scheme, which is part of a larger scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture, my Department merely act as agents.  The provisions of the scheme are clearly defined and apply to the bringing of electricity to farms rather than to dwellings in the western area.  It is a specific and limited scheme.  I would not like Senators to think it had a broader significance or application <i>vis-a-vis</i> electricity policy.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators raised the question of the possibility of putting wires underground.  I suppose it would be nice to see all pylons and poles disappear from our land with our scenery maintained in all its beauty.  I gave an example of the costs of such a policy <i>vis-a-vis</i> Moneypoint. If the ESB were to place the entire length, 480 kilometres, of these lines underground the direct additional costs would amount to £1.5 million per kilometre. That cost alone would be prohibitive. I do not think any reasonable person could justify it.  From an economic point of view it simply would not be feasible. In fact the current required to charge up a 400 kv underground cable is so high compared to that required by an overhead line that no active power could be transmitted from Moneypoint to Dublin, involving a major technical point.  So the major factor in placing these major transmission lines underground is one of cost but there is the technical aspect also. The cost element alone would be so prohibitive as not to be entertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ellis and others mentioned having a 14 day notice period rather than a seven day period.  Senator Fitzsimons <Col N="1644" /> said that, from his experience, seven days was not adequate.  The board make every effort to give sufficient early warning of wayleaves all along the routes they propose taking.  I do not think they have ever had any difficulty in negotiating with people who were not satisfied with the seven days notice regulation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of delays in implementing new connections, first, you must have your wayleaves cleared and, second, you must have a crew ready to undertake the work.  By far the most important factor in delays is the question of getting wayleave clearance.</P>
    <P>In fairness I think I should refer to points raised by a number of Senators regarding the bringing on stream of Moneypoint and the strategic planning of the growth rates of the ESB.  Back in the seventies we all thought that the growth path for electricity consumption would be substantially higher in the eighties than it was then.  Given the long lead-in time to the construction of generating stations one must realise that one cannot change policy overnight.  I firmly believe that the policy decisions taken in relation to Moneypoint were correct at that time. The ESB strategic plan has been published. My Department will have due regard to balancing efficiency.  Many Members will be aware that there have been serious criticisms of the high cost of electricity, especially to industrial users. We must make every possible effort to have an efficient and cheap supply of electricity.  Having said that, my Department will carry out their responsibilities in regard to the strategic plan as published. We will bear in mind all the social and economic issues in relation to the existing stations.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to compensation for machinery coming in on lands and Senator Hourigan raised the question of compensation, methods of payment and the manner in which it would be reassessed.  I should like to make it quite clear that this Bill is about the manner in which compensation is to be paid.  The crux of this Bill, having regard to the fact that one subsection of a section has been found unconstitutional, is that people <Col N="1645" /> who are compensated will be compensated by independent means.  That means it will be under the provisions of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  That covers the independence exercised in deciding the question of compensation.  The amount of compensation will be decided under that process and will not be predetermined by the ESB or predetermined by the landowner.  In view of the decision of the Supreme Court, we propose to have an independent means of arbitration in relation to the whole question of compensation.</P>
    <P>If there are any complaints regarding follow-up service for new connections, I would be glad to hear of them from the Senator and will have them examined. The ESB have a very good service section and I was surprised to hear some of the criticisms in that regard.</P>
    <P>By and large the Bill protects the citizen.  It has shifted the balance quite clearly after a period of many years in the citizen's favour.  I reject Senator Burke's allegation that there was a major engineering blunder in Moneypoint in having pylons moved.  My understanding of the matter is that the pylons are examined and strengthened where necessary before they are erected: in other words, all masts and foundations are rigorously examined when completed and all structural faults are eliminated before power is transmitted. That may explain what Senator Burke said was an engineering failure: rather it was greater care being taken by the board to ensure safety.  If Senator Burke wishes to pursue the matter further I will be happy to consider any submissions he makes.</P>
    <P>A question was raised by Senator Burke and others regarding the health of people living permanently near high tension power lines, particularly at Moneypoint.  The scheme is nearing completion. This question has been raised from time to time, not alone in Ireland but in other countries where power lines have been a common feature of the landscape for many years.  The World Health Organisation has concluded, on the basis of scientific evidence available, that <Col N="1646" /> power lines, even up to the level of the Moneypoint &mdash; 400 Kv lines &mdash; have no adverse effect on human health.  This report is available and if any Member of the House wishes to have a copy of it he can ring my office and I will have a copy made available.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the high cost of installation, particularly in the west.  I have outlined how that matter is dealt with under the present regulations of the ESB.  I fully realise that for a young couple getting married the cost of supplying a new electricity connection in isolated country areas is high.  As I said at the beginning, the ESB pay 40 per cent of the cost of capital construction in installation, and I feel that on balance that is a fair subsidy on the part of the ESB.</P>
    <P>Senator Howlin raised the question of planning.  I have dealt with that.  No one expected that the rate of increase in the consumption of electricity in the early eighties would be at or near zero.  In the latter half of the seventies the rate of increase was 7 per cent, 8 per cent or even higher.  The ESB have a statutory obligation to ensure that there is a sufficient capacity and a reserve capacity to meet all reasonable demands on the system.  We should not disregard the fact that Moneypoint is a coal fired station. We have had two serious upheavals in energy over the past ten years which have caused the price of oil to rise by ten times in the decade.  We do not know what is going to happen in the next ten years. For instance, we do not know if the war between Iran and Iraq is going to escalate and if it does what will be the effects. Neither would I like to prognosticate on the growth of the American economy or the growth within Europe or the British Isles.  If we were to return to growth rates of the seventies, we would certainly see a rapid increase in the consumption of electricity.</P>
    <P>We were right to take the coal alternative. I feel it is one which is safer and provides us with more security with regard to the supplying of energy to the country.  It is an expensive exercise capital-wise. That has been criticised but in <Col N="1647" /> the long term we are securing our electricity supply by broadening the base of options from the point of view of the primary source of energy, namely, moving from oil to coal.  It is within the framework of the EC which has adopted a positive strategy to move away from oil because of the damage it has done to economies and because of the uncertainty with regard to its supply and cost in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the environmental aspect, a matter again raised by Senator Howlin and other speakers.  The cost is prohibitive and we have to realise that. Senator Fitzsimons raised the question of scenic beauty.  He would like to see all the distribution network, the cables, underground but we have to face up to the fact that it is simply not economic.  I cannot change that.  The cost of putting cables underground is so high that it would have to be disregarded.</P>
    <P>Regarding the placing of electricity poles, the ESB in erecting poles and pylons on land do their utmost to place those poles close to fences and ditches where they will cause least inconvenience and obstruction.  When the rural electrification scheme was at its height, this was not always possible.  It is now the ESB's firm policy.  The directive to all of their staff is that the way leave provisions, which include the erection of poles, must be operated in a fair and reasonable manner.  Where objections are raised by landowners the ESB will always move poles or change the route of lines if this can be done without unduly affecting other landowners or without being an unduly expensive exercise.  Compensation had been settled on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis but now as a result of a Supreme Court decision compensation has been put on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan raised the question of insurance.  I am advised that the board have a very comprehensive policy. Where possible damage is fully covered under the insurance.  Claims are dealt with either by direct negotiations or by a common law action.  The question of notification of claims within seven or 14 <Col N="1648" /> days has never been operative and that the ESB have always been most anxious to negotiate and facilitate landowners.</P>

      <P>We are moving rapidly but we will not fly through it.  It is appropriate that Galway city has at last received recognition in this Bill.  In my amendment to the Bill, I can deal with such matters regarding the location and distribution of the electoral areas.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council and Galway Corporation are unique in that after much strain, stress and a lot of thought we came to an agreement about the boundaries which helped to resolve the problem and set the scene.  It is sad that many of the recommendations made and all of the unanimous agreements reached were pushed aside.  My amendment to section 8 (4) will deal specifically with this matter.  The recognition accorded Galway was a very welcome gesture, taking into account that this was the year of the quincentennial celebrations in the city.  It brought our city to a proper standing in comparison to Waterford, Limerick and Cork.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion in the other House that we should have the Mayor of the city called the Lord Mayor.  I am not pressing the point.  I do not believe in the title &ldquo;Lord Mayor&rdquo;, and &ldquo;mayor&rdquo; is adequate.  The honour bestowed upon the city is quite sufficient, but I would like the Minister to reiterate that this unanimity on the city boundaries was of vital importance.  A deep appreciation was shown, I am sure by him and his commission, of this unanimity.</P>
      <P>Guarantees can be dealt with later in the Bill but when we are defining the borough of the city it would be appropriate to have the assurance of the Minister that those guarantees and compensations to the county will be given.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with my colleague, and the Minister, in expressing my delight at seeing the status of the city of Galway being raised to that of a borough.  This is a very historical city which is developing at an accelerated pace.  Its expansion requires it to be defined as a borough.  I should like to ask the Minister when will it be established as a borough?  From reading the Bill it appears that there is nothing definite.  I know the dual managerial system is going to work with the present manager of Galway county managing the affairs for a period.  I should also like to ask the Minister when will the new manager be appointed to the borough?  When will it have its own identity and be working as one borough unit?  It is a little vague in the Bill as to when it will be given its full authoritative and authentic status and be working under its own manager and council.  Is it stated in the Bill that in the election in June members will not be elected to the borough?  Will the Minister be more specific on how members will be elected and when the borough will have independent status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The borough gets its <Col N="1651" /> own status, hopefully, by the end of the year.  The Minister should make an order by then.  Transfers to property, and other things, will have to be gone through.  In relation to the joint management structure, this is not unique or something new. In Dublin where there are one million people approximately in the corporation and council areas, there is a joint managerial system operating.  There is a city manager, Dún Laoghaire Borough Council manager and the county manager. They operate separately but there is one pivotal head, the city and county manager. With regard to the situation in Galway, as long as the present manager is there the joint managerial structure will remain, for two reasons.  First, in order to avoid any overlapping or disagreements or whatever may happen in such circumstances, it is better that the manager remain for that period. Secondly, the manager has been appointed to the Galway area and it is right that he should continue in his present position.  When he moves out for whatever reason, whether it be retirement, promotion or whatever, it would be a matter for the county council and the corporation to agree to a joint managerial structure.  If they agree on that the Minister will make an order accepting it.</P>
      <P>The simple answer to the question is that as long as the present manager remains in that position the joint managerial system will operate, but when he goes there can be a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister has said.  This is very basic at this time of transition from the county to the borough and in regard to the question of compensation.  It is fundamental to the question of goodwill.  He was present when all those arrangements were made subject to the question of compensation being agreed.  Our county manager is very understanding as regards the divisions of the county and what the new borough will take over.  From that point of view, it consoles many of the outgoing councillors from both sides that he would <Col N="1652" /> be the person to whom we could turn to as regards matters of this nature.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister I have a lot of faith in the whole idea that the county manager will see this through to a logical and agreed conclusion.  Indeed, one could always see in the future the logic in the managerial post being held by one person.  Some individuals may wish to have two.  There is a lot of logic in having the one administrator for the county as a whole because what concerns people in the county quite often concerns people in the city and <i>vice versa.</i>  For example, in regard to planning it is of vital importance to have one administrative head.  In the past I wondered why the old city council and the county council did not have more liaison as regards planning.  A lot of things went astray because different sections planned in different directions. The system was often cumbersome from the county manager's point of view.  I welcome this move.  Indeed, I can foresee in the future having the one administrative officer by agreement.  There would be a saving in that there would be no duplication in the administration of the county as a whole.</P>

      <P>For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby declared that, subject to any order made under section 8 or 24 of this Act, anything commenced or otherwise done before the appointed day in relation to, or in the name of, the Mayor, Aldermen and Burgesses of the Borough of Galway shall on and after that day be regarded as if it had been commenced or otherwise done in relation to, or in the name of, the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are at present going through the county development plan.  It causes me slight worry, not from the point of view of what the old corporation have commenced or done, or not done, but in regard to the new area going into the city and what the county council have commenced or otherwise done in relation to the county plan.  We spent an enormous amount of our time last year revising the new county plan for Galway and it enshrined one particular district of Galway city which was of specific interest, the Knocknacarra area of the city which is now part of the new borough.  It was a matter of great controversy in the <Col N="1655" /> county and was given a great deal of thought and serious consideration.  We agreed our proposed plan which is now at the display stage.  Does our work on that area stand for the incoming city borough?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The present county plan will still continue, even though parts of that county may be in the county borough area.  It will still be part of the overall plan until such time as the new borough makes its own plan.  The usual statutory formalities will be gone through.  That will be a new plan and what has gone before obviously will not exist.  Up to that the work which has been done will remain.</P>

      <P>In reference to subsections (1) and (2) I asked when this would be done.  The Minister said by the end of the year.  By the end of the year our county plan, from the county council point of view, will have reached finality. I assume it will probably reach finality some time in June.  Is the Minister saying that the new area which is to be part of the city is still the responsibility of the county council until this transfer takes place at the end of the year?  That is what I would like to know.</P>

      <P>They had no input to date, no presentation, no discussion.  The <Col N="1656" /> county council are planning now for the incoming borough.  That is an anomaly the Minister must make a decision on.  I suggest to the Minister that the county council should finish the county plan as regards planning and hand it over until the next stage of planning, which will be in four or five years time or whenever the council decide to revise the plan.  It would be very wrong at this stage to hand over to this new borough a plan which has been devised, worked on, thought out and specified by the county but on which the county have not the power to act with the finality which I think the Minister should give them.  It had been controversial and we resolved it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a valid point.  It reiterates the fact that we have the one manager here operating between the city and the county.  Obviously he has been part of the formulation of any plan and one would hope that this co-operation would still continue.  Anything that has been done has been seen to be in the best interest of the general area.  The order is to be made taking the new area into the borough and if the county borough are making a plan they can do so in accordance with what they see meets their needs.  They could change it.</P>

      <P>No.  Under the order the area is being taken into the county borough and the county borough will have that responsibility.  It would be bad to start off by giving the borough a responsibility and them immediately withdrawing some of it.  We will leave this to the good sense of the manager and the elected representatives.</P>

      <P>When devising a county plan a lot is not left to the county manager because otherwise the council who have discretion of interpretation would be failing as a local authority.  The manager has one interpretation of the plan and the council have another interpretation. Even the councillors individually could put different interpretations on the plan.</P>
      <P>We did not have absolute and total agreement on Aughnacarra.  We had not put the 1979 plan into motion two weeks when the county manager and county planners started to put a different interpretation on it.  It concerned open spaces and playing areas, and it became a serious matter of what people might have referred to as a vendetta against a particular landowner.  I do not wish to bring the local scene here to the Seanad, but in our new plan we resolved the problem with the county manager.  There were preconditions that the county manager had to do certain things before we agreed with this plan which was to reverse the change that had occurred after the 1979 plan.</P>
      <P>We would be letting the manager off the hook slightly and councillors might be offended by that.  This is something we discussed when we were deciding the transfer.  We were given the assurance that the county plan as we had planned it would be the county plan.  The Minister should give us some assurance also.</P>
      <P>In fairness, taking the circumstances, extenuating as they may be, the Minister could, by order, state that the proposed new county plan would be the function for the completion purposes of the county council until the transfers take place at the end of the year, whether by hope, by design or by co-operation.  We would need something stronger than just saying that responsibility would be transferred as well.  You cannot transfer something on which you have already made a decision but which is not final.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I accept that.  In fairness, if we are making an order and if the boroughs propose to make a plan themselves they will have to abide by the existing plan until they make their new plan.  There is nothing we can do to interfere with that.  In the cities there will be 15 elected representatives and they will have an interest in what has happened and in what is going on in the general planning area.  It is not a question of the manager having the sole say.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am harping a little on this because it is fundamentally important to the council.  I want to take the council's point of view.  Regarding the statement the Minister just made, the position is that all other boundary extensions were made under protest and these matters are still unresolved.  Here is one that was done by co-operation.  It is significantly different.  The least the Minister's advisers should be able to do is to give the authority for the positive ending of this county plan.  It is fundamental that the council be seen to be the authority to finish the county plan.  If a borough are not satisfied with the plan they can proceed with haste to have the matter finalised and start off a new plan for the city taking into account the whole new scene that will be created.  I assume they will do that.  The specifics of this plan are now beyond reach for them so the positive completion should be left to the council.</P>

      <P>Where the county are making a plan and the plan is agreed, that plan will continue in existence.  If it is not complete it can cause problems. Either we are or we are not giving the new county borough their authority.  It is important that we start by giving them full responsibility.  All we are saying is that everything that is in existence will be carried on but once the borough decide on making a plan, they will have that <Col N="1659" /> statutory legal right, as the county will have, to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that we are not going in with the county plan.  It has been completed only to the extent of 75 per cent.  All I am asking is that the council be given permission to complete the plan.  At present, all they can do is restart a whole new scheme which will take two or three more years to complete. We have spent a lot of time on this plan. Therefore, would the Minister not in some way or other allow the council to complete it taking into account that they physically have not got a county plan going in.</P>
      <P>The county manager would be only delighted to see the new county plan going up in smoke.  That is what I am afraid would happen but that would be a tragedy.  Some of the planners have caused us councillors great distress in the past number of years.  We had to put up with an enormous amount of innuendoes and publicity on television programmes etc., but those of us who had the courage to do so, persisted and won the day.  I would be very sad on behalf of those councillors to think now that all our efforts might be nullified because of the graciousness of the Minister in giving the borough the status of the borough of Galway.  There must be some way to consolidate the work of all councillors in this field.  This is an exception.  I cannot see anything in the Bill to indicate a personal desire to see something completed that had started five years ago and on which a lot of work was done.  Councillors did suffer a great deal of personal abuse and on some occasions were attacked in the streets.  They were proved right at the end of the day.  Because we have been kind and full of good nature all our work is now in abeyance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I beseech the Minister, as a person responsible within the county and who has always acted responsibly in that council, apart from politics at all, on behalf of those councils who did this work, to give them the authority to finish <Col N="1660" /> the county plan because it is a no man's land at present, which is a tragedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a different line from my colleague, Senator Killilea, in this regard because I see a new plan for the county borough being put into operation immediately as they will be in a different jurisdiction and a different geographical area.  The plan that is 75 per cent ready for the county and borough areas will have to be revised.  The fundamental proposals in the existing plan will probably be incorporated in the new one but you cannot plan for a geographical boundary area over which you do not have jurisdiction.  I can see the county plan being amended to delete the portion of the borough for which they will not now be responsible and the new borough, when established, having to prepare a plan for its own geographical boundary within that; it will be a new ball game.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the unfinished county council plan also will have to be amended in the county council jurisdiction area.  The plan is a legal document, it will have to be published and the public will have to have an opportunity of seeing it displayed in draft form.  I know this is done already but this change of the borough will mean a new plan for the borough and another plan for the county, deleting the borough geographical status.  I would like the Minister to be clear on that.  Two plans are essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed they are.  No Minister has ever interfered with the right of the local authorities to make a development plan.  If the county plan is not made by June it will be a matter for the elected representatives of the new designated areas to decide whether they should take whole or part of what the county council comes up with, or make their own plans. It would be wrong, and I think Senators accept the principle, to give Minister's power to intervene like this in matters where the elected councillor has the responsibility.  We should be very slow in telling Ministers to interfere.  Galway city will be electing 15 and the county will be electing 31, or something of that order.</P>

I admire the Minister's straight face when he says that the Minister should not have the power to make orders.

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for those little sums.  One would think we had got a golden egg from the golden goose.  We have not.  We got a very small increase and we were entitled to much more.  The terms of reference given by the Government to the commission provided that the county council should not be reduced in numbers, yet the Minister of State tells me the Government accepted this recommendation.  If the commission said that we would have no borough in Galway, would the Government have accepted that?  They could not because they would be giving the order. I thought the commission were bound by the Government's requests to them.  A criticism I have about all commissions is that they take the piece of paper, run away and come back and everybody is under the belief that their recommendations must be accepted, that they are sacrosanct.  I do not think they are sacrosanct. I am very disappointed in the commission because they reduced representation in our county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Galway is the second largest county in Ireland.  The city boundary extends to no more than two miles on either side of the city, and operation in the big urban area of the borough of Galway is very simple where public representatives are within a 25p bus ride.  It is not fair that people in Connemara or north or south Galway must travel long distances to meet a public representative who is representing them on the county council.  Would the Minister consider this aspect of it?  The commission were quite wrong, and I do not accept for one minute that they were in any way right to go outside the bounds of the Government's request to them. Because of the size of the county, its geographical content, the different cultures and the problems of administration there, we should not be deprived of one councillor because the commission said so.  If they had been told that the number should be so and so, that would be a <Col N="1665" /> different matter, but they were not told that.  They were told not to reduce the existing numbers, but that is the one thing they did.  I do not want to be misinterpreted as purporting to say that the city should have one fewer and the county should remain as it was.  In the Government's request to the commission there was no suggestion of what the size of the new city borough should be in terms of representation, but it was specified clearly and unequivocally that the size of the county should remain as it was.</P>
    <P>Now the Minister of State walks in here today and takes all this lying down.  It is immoral, it is wrong.  It proves again that these boundary commissions are a load of hogwash and something should be done posthaste to change the system.  All they are dealing in is numbers.  It is a racket of numbers.  If it is fed into the computer and the figures have to come out as so many people per public representative, then it must be that.  No geographical or cultural aspects are taken into account.  No account is taken of the mountain ranges which separate part of south Galway from the rest of the county. No account is taken of the sea.  I see nothing wrong in a county councillor of any party being in the Aran Islands.  With the problems that the people there have in the summer, surely they are entitled to at least one county councillor.  If the commission had been brave enough to go beyond the bounds and say that because of the size and the historical background of the Aran Islands, because of the industry and fishing carried out there and because of the numbers of tourists who visit the Aran Islands, the islands should have one county councillor, what would have been wrong with that?  The people of the Aran Islands should have an electoral area of their own and select one county councillor.</P>
    <P>It bears out the point I make that commissions are not on.  It is not fair, it is not appropriate, it is not right for any Government to say to a very fine judge, as all judges have been in their profession, a couple of weeks before the provisions are produced, &ldquo;Go on, divide up <Col N="1666" /> the country there, chair that commission and away you go.&rdquo;  I made this point here the last day.  Senator O'Leary, formerly of the front bench of the Government party in the Seanad and now for some reason best known to Fine Gael in the back benches, as an independent &mdash; I regret that very much because he is such a fine man &mdash; made the same point to the Minister of State, and it seems that he and I are being laughed out of court. Some people in my party may say that I am crazy and I am sure people in the Minister of State's party will say that Senator O'Leary is crazy.  However, I am entitled to my opinion, and my opinion is that constituency division by commissions is an absolute failure.  It has never taken into account the cultural and geographical aspects of constituencies in the case of either Dáil elections or &mdash; as is being proved conclusively now &mdash; the local government elections.  As we are giving the Minister all the powers of order, let me make an honourable suggestion. Could we not have a county councillor for the many islands along the Galway coast?  Could the Minister not provide for this by order and in so doing be brave?  This is a great opportunity for him to do so.  Under this Bill he can do it by order.  Give us back our 31 councillors and give that one councillor to the Aran Islands to represent not alone the Aran Islands but all the islands as far as Clifden and beyond.  It would be a lovely gesture and an acknowledgement that people in the islands have problems and it would be good for them to have representation on the council.  I ask the Minister of State to comment.</P>

      <P>First, it is important to realise that the commission are independent. They decided to look at this and, as Senator Killilea said, their terms of reference were correct.  This was an exceptional situation because population was going out of the county.  The present position with regard to Galway is that there is 5,549 population per councillor. As a result of the present recommendations, there is 4,295 population per councillor, which clearly indicates that there <Col N="1667" /> is a significant improvement in the ratio of population per councillor.  One could not make the charge that councillors are overburdened, or being asked to take on more than they had previously, because the opposite is the case.  A point worth making in this House with regard to Galway is that there are now 30 councillors in the county and 15 in the city, and all will have Seanad votes.  It is an important feature that the county will have greater representation on the basis of the Seanad votes and, as a result of the borough, Galway will have additional votes.  The point the Senator is making is that there will be fewer councillors.  I am not here to defend the commission's job.</P>

      <P>When one looks at the figures in relation to the population per councillor, one sees that the position has improved significantly.  That clearly indicates that the electoral commission did a good job.  The Government accept the commission's report.  The Senator spoke about my orders, and what I have and have not done, but a decision has been taken by the Government and that decision stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The first remark the Minister made was that he is not going to defend the commission, that they have the right to defend themselves.  Where have the commission the right to defend themselves?  Where can we have a word with the commission, other than writing them a letter, which does not carry much weight?  They are a supreme body away from the normal run of the mill.  We never see them; we never hear about them; we do not know them; they cannot listen to my point of view.  I made submissions to several commissions but not to this one <Col N="1668" /> because I thought it was a waste of time writing to them.  In their report they list the bodies, organisations and persons from whom submissions were received and they thank them.  Then they list the names, but no one knows what was said and we do not know whether they have read them.</P>
      <P>I have given an example in support of my belief that the set-up as regards commissions is absolutely wrong.  I would appreciate if the Minister would look to see if there is a better system available. This was an opportunity for the commission, it was a glorious opportunity for the Department of the Environment to recommend to the commission, it was an even more glorious opportunity for the Minister to recommend to the Department, who in turn would recommend to the commission, that the Aran Islands and the islands off Galway should have one councillor.  It is appropriate that they should have one councillor.  No person in political life today can stand up and say that that point cannot be defended.  I believe the Aran Islands are entitled to one councillor but they will never get one under this Bill.  Thought should have been given to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to express my complete dissatisfaction with this commission's report and with their decision to go outside the requests of the Government when they were setting out the rules in regard to what they wanted.  It has been proved conclusively that our county are the people who paid the price.  I will go further and state that in future if such proposals come before any county council my recommendation would be not to be so generous and not to support such ideas in the future because, as has been proved here, at the end of the day the county council and the councillors will have to pay the price.  I am very disappointed that the Minister could not say that he, by order, had recommended to the Taoiseach and the Government &mdash; I am sure they would agree with it &mdash; that this extra seat in Galway, should be restored and given to the Aran Islands and the other islands along the west coast.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter and to <Col N="1669" /> bring it before the Government before the Bill is finalised.  The Government must have some compassion.  I know they have not got a lot of time for the west, but many of them might enjoy a summer or fishing vacation in the Aran Islands.  I ask the Minister to make such a recommendation to the Government at the behest of the Seanad because it would have the unanimous support of this House.  I do not know who would gain politically from such a move but, technically it would make no difference to me, because whoever is elected will have to work for the people of all the islands.  I would appreciate a comment from the other side on this request that they agree to such a suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything Senator Killilea said about the boundaries and about one fewer councillor. This acceptance of the independent commission's report is departing from any workable arrangement in that area.  I want to cite the case mentioned here last week by Senator Killilea.  The three islands of Aran right across into Moycullen, Lettermore, Tuam and three miles the other side, will be defined now as an electoral area.  There is no way that any engineering staff, health staff, roads committee or any team with machinery on a tar spraying mission can organise that area.  I have been dealing with islands all my life and I know officials in Mayo who dread the day when they have to go to Inishturk or Clare Island.  Many of them are unable to cross the 11 mile stretch because of sea sickness and so on.  As a result, the people on the islands do not get the same representation as they would if they lived on the mainland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame the commission because they were independent and did not know the geographical spread of that area or how to work it.  It will never work.  If there is a meeting in that electoral area one has to wait for a plane to come from Aran and then one has to wait for a boat. If the people of Aran elected a councillor he could not hold meetings on an area basis because the area stretches from east of Tuam to the three Aran islands.  The <Col N="1670" /> commission did not know that because they were independent and were operating from maps.  I remember when we were trying to organise the dispensary district of Mayo a departmental official got a map and said that it would be easier to reorganise Bunderracha dispensary district at Leenane &mdash; because it was beside Killary Harbour &mdash; with Inishturk than with Clare Island to which it was attached at that time.  We had to come to Dublin and explain the position to him. He thought one could come by boat from Inishturk by Killary Harbour and into a village called Bunderracha which had a dispensary district.  He thought that a nurse or doctor could service these two areas.  They are about 50 miles apart by sea but on a map they look very close to each other.  That is the type of solution one will get from an independent inquiry or an independent commission.</P>
    <P>It is all right to listen to independent commissions observe their guidelines and recommendations.  If the Minister accepts everything that is in the commission's report it will not be for the good of the working of the system.  If Senators of all parties sat down together they could draw up a scheme that would not be advantageous to any political party but would be workable and suitable for the district.  I am totally against independent commissions.  Where it is not practical to implement their recommendations the Minister should intervene.  Senator Killilea is asking the Minister to intervene where the commission slipped up geographically and in other ways.</P>
    <P>They could easily have avoided reducing the number of councillors in Galway by one.  Of course, they went on population figures and they did not need to go to Galway.  I cannot see how a councillor sitting three miles east of Tuam could represent Inisheer, Inishmaan and Inishmore.  He would have to fly in and out of the three islands to look after his clients and there is no way in which this could be done.  The area should have a special identity.  It is a Gaeltacht area.</P>
    <P>A little Gaeltacht area in Meath was <Col N="1671" /> split by the commission.  That is disgraceful but the commission are not to be blamed because they did not know what they were doing.  The Minister should take corrective measures to ensure that the boundaries are suitable and that they are good working electoral areas.</P>
    <P>When we need to tar the roads on Clare Islands we must get a ferry from Galway; we must set a certain day to bring in the chips and roller and all our machinery. There is no other way machinery can be brought on to the islands.  There is only one ferry that has to be hired and this causes enormous expense.  The ferry comes about twice a year and since we have to service the electrical generators with oil it comes on set dates and we must watch to ensure that any work that needs to be carried out on the islands is carried out when the ferry can be availed of. The commission did not know about that. They did not know that the ferry exists or that we have to do that.  If county managers' representatives were on commissions such as this one they would have a better knowledge of local requirements. Those in the Department who are dealing with county councils would have a better knowledge of how county councils work.</P>
    <P>I totally agree with Senator Killilea.  I appeal to the Minister to amend the report where he thinks it is necessary rather than accept the report as it was presented to him.  We will go along with any amendment that is for the good of this Local Government (Reorganisation) Bill.</P>

I will explain why I cannot accept the argument he has been making in respect of what electoral area in County Galway the Aran Islands should be associated with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the electoral commission and the decision of the Government to accept their report, that was the correct <Col N="1672" /> decision.  I have been adversely affected by the boundaries that have been drawn but, that aside, I recognise that in relation to my own county an attempt was made to preserve representation.  The centre of the county had an abundance of population and that population was shared out to maintain representation in other areas. I happened to be unlucky, being the last house in the area to be involved.</P>

      <P>As regards the Aran Islands, I would make this point to Senator Killilea and Senator O'Toole: unlike either of them, I was born within 7½ miles of the Aran Islands.  I grew up there and part of my childhood was spent on the Aran Islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I spent part of my childhood in the Aran Islands.  Geographically the natural location for the Aran Islands is in County Clare.  They are sheltering beneath the Cliffs of Moher. Commercially and otherwise Inisheer, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows quite well, is almost a suburb of Doolin.  I am not satisfied to see the Aran Islands located either with Connemara or Tuam. They have a lot more in common with Doolin, Lisdoonvarna, Ballyvaughan, Fanore and Ballinalacken.  These are the areas with which the islands have always traded.  It would not be proper for me to list the commodities that have been traded regularly across that piece of the Atlantic.</P>

Their natural location is in the north Clare area which is based in Ennistymon.  Unfortunately for these reasons I cannot support Senator Killilea.</P>

They were prepared to accept, at least within reason, the recommendations of the commission.  They were prepared to see a movement of population which was necessary in our constituency where there were anomalies.  Perhaps county councils must share some of the blame for not taking action over the years about this.  I would be shocked if what the Minister is hinting at were to be the final outcome of all our deliberations here &mdash; to state categorically that a small community who legitimately feel they have been discriminated against cannot have recourse to somebody, that nobody will reverse a decision they feel is socially wrong and unjust.

Most people who will speak on this issue will agree that it is very important to have the man on the spot.  Who would know more about the problems of the Aran Islanders than the man on the spot?  Surely in this instance autonomy should have been <Col N="1674" /> given to this area to have a man on the spot.  I fully support Senator Killilea.</P>

Ba mhaith liom tacú leis an iarratas atá á dhéanamh ag an Seanadóir Killilea ar son Oileán Árann agus go mór mhór ar son na teanga Gaeilge.  Cloisimid go leor faoi na hoileáin agus na daoine atá ina gcónaí iontu agus na deacrachtaí atá acu leis an saol ansin.  Nuair a thagann sé chomh fada le rudaí éigin a dhéanamh ar a son nílimid chomh fial sin nó chomh flaithiúil sin nó chomh tuiscineach sin maidir leis na rudaí a bhíonn ann agus na rudaí atá caillte acu.</P>
      <P>Briefly, I support the plea that Senator Killilea is making here on behalf of the Aran Islands.  In doing so I am actuated and motivated principally from the point of view of the Irish language and its rights.  We hear a good deal about the islands and the difficulties the people living on the islands have to undergo because of their separation from the mainland.  When it comes to doing anything concrete, or specific, or materially valuable to improve the lot of these people, their lives and their conditions of living, we are not generous and understanding. The administration is not prepared to help them to the degree they deserve and to which we would be justified in helping them.</P>
      <P>Looking at the terms of the revision I find it extraordinary, totally illogical and a great shock, that the Aran Islands should be coupled in this delineation with an area in or around Tuam.  Tuam is 22 to 25 miles from Galway city and to couple the Aran Islands with an area in the precincts of Tuam is totally illogical and totally unreasonable.  I cannot see any justification for it.  Take, for instance, the difficulty that may arise.  There is no guarantee that the man or woman who may be elected in the area around Tuam will have any knowledge of the Irish language. How could a councillor elected in the area around Tuam represent the people of the Aran Islands if he or she is not conversant with the Irish language and not fluent speakers of the language?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1675" /> I find this totally unacceptable and for that reason I ask the Minister, not for political reasons, not for reasons of embarrassment or anything else, to have a look at this matter again and to use his position of responsibility as Minister to review this decision and have it changed in deference to the people who are living on these islands in very difficult conditions, who have kept the traditions of our country alive in the best sense &mdash; the language, the music, the culture and the way of life &mdash; to encourage them to continue to uphold these traditions by giving them a seat on Galway County Council. That is not unreasonable.  Senator Howard has already indicated that he would agree with that, although I would disagree with the other point that the Senator made that the Aran Islands should go in with Clare.  The Aran Islands always have been traditionally and historically with Galway.  They should remain with Galway.  I appeal to the Minister to review this position and to allocate a seat to the population of the islands along the west coast of Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If you wanted proof as to why you should have an independent commission, the debate for the last three-quarters of an hour would be good proof. If the politicians or anybody allied to them brought a report forward, they could well see the type of accusation that would be levelled against them.  The commission procedure has been accepted by all sides of the House and it has now become part of the scenario for drawing up constituencies for Dáil elections and now for local elections.  It is a good procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You get petitions from County Cork and County Kerry.  Senator Lynch was making his point about his county and Senator Killilea about his county.  This could open up a whole new scenario.  One could then ask the question, why set up independent commissions?  We must respect the integrity of the commissions as they operate.  There are two managers from local authorities who are on the two commissions, esteemed officials from <Col N="1676" /> my own Department and also two esteemed High Court judges.  That clearly indicates their independence and their integrity.  I know that no matter how you go about drawing any boundary or any line it will please some and it will not please others.  Nobody can convince me, no matter how well motivated, intentioned or inspired they were, that any body of people would bring forward a plan that would be agreeable to all.  The Government have accepted it.  Once there is talk about change, where do you stop?  We are talking about this amendment. Senator Killilea has another amendment down for making some other change.  I have accepted the commission's report on behalf of the Government. That is the right and sensible thing to do. After appointing a commission, to say we are looking at that and we are looking at the other, would be casting doubts on the credibility of the commission that the Government set up.  Governments in the past, from both sides, have done exactly what we are doing, and have accepted commission's reports.</P>

      <P>I do not want it to be suggested with regard to any of the people on those commissions &mdash; the two judges, the county managers and the esteemed people from the Department of the Environment &mdash; that I am in any way defaming characters or depriving them of the high esteem that they are held in.  Far from it.  Likewise, I do not want it to go out that I believe it is the job of the politicians to do the job that the commissions have been set up to do.  The commission was agreed by our Government. Fianna Fáil were in power.  We were not long in Government when our then leader, Mr. Jack Lynch, announced on television that he was accepting this commission. We all looked at it to see if it might appear to be a fairer and more balanced way of doing the job.  My answer is that it is not.  I am not saying that it should have gone back to the Minister or back to the politicians to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Boundary commissions have in actual fact resulted in failure.  The criterion that <Col N="1677" /> seems to be taken into account throughout the country is based on numbers. For as long as that happens then that commission will not be successful.  It is time there was a permanent commission, who are away from the Minister's clutch, away from the clutch of any political party or group and who should take into account criteria like the ones discussed here today concerning the environmental, social and economic aspects of areas and districts, to sit down over a period and work out where the anomalies lie.</P>
    <P>The politicians were making a better job of it than these independent commissions, and that is not the fault of commissions, past or present.  That is speaking of the parliamentarians who drafted the revision of constituencies for Dáil elections in the past.  They had a more humane touch, more a geographical touch and more a cultural touch.  They knew more of the problems involved. The point I am trying to make is that the system under which the commissions are assembled is wrong.  This is not a job that should be done in two months, or three months, or four months.  This is an ongoing job that should be looked at day in and day out while we have democracy.</P>
    <P>It is the first time that people have spoken in such terms about commissions, that they are not working out as they were intended to work out.  There was not the level of approach that was expected of them.  There could not be, because of the terms of reference given to them.</P>
    <P>There are people in my party who will disagree with what I have said, but I have seen it with my own eyes.  I can take it from a political point of view or from an individual point of view.  I see an unsatisfactory situation in a Fíor-Ghaeltacht, as Senators de Brún, O'Toole and Lynch as well as Members from the Minister's side of the House rightly said.  I saw it from a political point of view in my own county when the revision of the constituency took place on the second last occasion. My party do not have a public representative from Galway city on the new west side to Ballindine Bridge, or Shrule <Col N="1678" /> Bridge, where Fianna Fáil have not a public representative from Caltra, which is in south Galway, to the Ballindine Bridge.  Both of these are approximately 25 miles distant.</P>

      <P>I am pleading to the Minister to rectify the situation either by way of my amendment or by giving one seat to the Aran Islands and all the islands on the west coast of Galway.  If the Minister says he will do it now I will withdraw my amendment forthwith even though there are other parts of my amendment which must be examined.  That would constitute an acknowledgement that that seat should be returned to us.  I am suggesting that the place to put it would be in the islands, thereby obviating a major disturbance.  I should like the Minister to say why the Government allowed the change in the terms of reference given to the commission, to reduce the council membership from 31 to 30 seats?

      <P>I want to assure the Minister that my argument is based mainly on the terms of reference which state that in cases where the ratio of representation to 1981 population is outside these limits or the limits referred to earlier they should seek in the first instance to remedy such disproportion by minimal boundary changes as between neighbouring electoral areas, taking due account first of the desirability of preserving natural communities or hinterlands of population centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that there are extenuating circumstances which can affect the social fabric and wellbeing of a community. Approximately 200 votes, by the way, have been put into my electoral area, but I am willing to hand this area back into the Navan electoral area. where they always were, with Gibbstown which comprises the Udarás electoral area of Gibbstown, a community settled 50 years ago. This means that all their demands will have to be met by new engineering staff, new road staff, different county councils all of which were geared towards the one specific area.  While Rath Cairn celebrates this year 50 years in County Meath as an established community we cut a slice off the one that could be celebrating its fiftieth anniversary next year and shove it into a different electoral area.  If <Col N="1680" /> the Minister cannot do something about it, there is something very wrong, worse than I suspected in the beginning.</P>

      <P>Like some other Members I do not go all the way with commissions in their drawing up of boundaries. Perhaps the reason Governments appointed such commissions was the knowledge that if they had made the changes now proposed they would have been torn asunder by the Opposition parties.  For instance, the county of Louth was carved in many different ways by this commission, not to the satisfaction of any party.  As a council we discussed this, a council with a great mixture of Independents and members representing different parties.  We could not agree, within our council, as to what submission we should make.  We spent the best part of two days discussing the matter, at the end of which we decided to throw our hat at it.</P>
      <P>I can understand the wisdom of Governments deciding to hand this job to a commission, but at the end of the day, many people are annoyed at the results; I cannot say I am overjoyed at them.  This is the third time in my political career when I have had to follow my voters, jumping from one area to another.  I am not suggesting at all that a commission is not the right body to do the job, but perhaps they are the only people who can do it without running the risk &mdash; they are not here to defend themselves &mdash; of being torn asunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Killilea said that the former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, decided that a commission should do the job in his time.  Perhaps the Senator agreed with it at that time.  I am sure he went along with his party leader and agreed that it was right.  The results at that time may not have pleased him either.  I wonder if he got any change out of his party then. Perhaps he did not.  I am not overjoyed at saying that the die is cast at this stage, but I can understand the Minister saying the Government have accepted the decision and he must defend it whether right or wrong, it was an independent decision <Col N="1681" /> not favouring any particular party.  Certainly I can say publicly that the changes made in my county do not favour my party anyway.</P>
    <P>For that reason I can understand Senators Killilea and O'Toole and other Senators on the far side of the House appealing to the Minister to change that decision.  I can also well understand that the Minister will not make any change: his heels are stuck in the ground, he is not going to be moved and that is how we shall end up.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister at this stage.  The Government decided that they should appoint a commission.  The bed has been made and we may lie on it whether we like it or not.  I say that to all sides of the House.  I hear passionate pleas from the Aran Islands contending that they have no representative there.  If they had I should like it to be a representative of our party.  If they feel that way about it &mdash; and I refer to the opposite side of the House &mdash; they should select a candidate and ensure he gets elected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <P>I am sure if Senator Killilea and other Senators, who have spoken so passionately in favour of having a representative from that place, go out and throw their weight behind that particular candidate, it will help her or him to get elected.  I feel they are flogging a dead horse in making this request.  They lost a seat in one place and they are trying to make it up in the other.  I do not think they will succeed.  I go a little of the way with them in saying that, if there is a change in the years ahead, it will be on record that Senator Killilea and many others felt that they should have won.  If their pleas are not going to serve their purpose today they will be on the record and it will be borne in mind next time around.  It is nothing more at this stage than prolonging the agony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have accepted the recommendations of the commission.  I would say &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; that is the end and we should accept it on that basis.  We may not like it and, personally, I have no great <Col N="1682" /> interest in it.  They were an independent commission not trying to help one party or the other.  I would be less than honest if I did not say I was rather disgruntled when I saw the results, especially in my own area, because large parts of rural areas were combined with small parts of town areas.  This was not a great combination. Rather than being smaller and more compact the areas were more scattered and certainly more difficult to represent. I can well understand that a rural area is much more difficult to operate than that of a town or a city.  A councillor should have only half the numbers or even less to look after in a rural area than in a town.  It would take two days or more to go from one end of the area to the other in making calls on people, whereas in a town or city an area could be covered by walking in a half hour or less.  I would say to the Minister and to Members on the opposite side of the House that we should accept the situation at this stage.  I understand their pleas, but I do not see much happening and I think we should put up with our lot.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for his contribution.  I hope that in this House we are not flogging a dead horse in making those suggestions to the Minister. He has an understanding today that perhaps he did not have coming into the House.  I will leave that matter with him. If we were to press our case I would put this matter down in the form of an amendment.  I left it to the pleas of people from every part of the country who understand exactly what I am talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that I have been allowed to speak on this Bill.  Many Senators are beginning to question the performance and the end result of the independent commissions on electoral boundaries.  As stated by Senator Lennon, it was first announced in 1977 that the commission would be set up.  The results of that commission arrived on-stream at the end of February 1980.  Personally we had our problems.  I am not speaking about the commission on a personal basis but on what has happened.  At that time I said: <Col N="1683" /> we will make our case and we will show, from the point of view of the public representative, the errors made by the commission. The next commission sat and there was no change.  When this commission sat I thought the message would have been passed on to them.  What they had been doing was basing it on figures.  As the Minister correctly said, from the point of view of figures they are right but from a national point of view I am saying they are wrong.  That is why I think the Minister and the Government must act for future commissions.</P>
    <P>I made the suggestion &mdash; it was Senator O'Leary who first suggested it and we are both from absolutely opposite political parties &mdash; Senators Lennon, O'Toole and Lynch also made the statement and most of the people who have contributed strongly in this debate are now of the opinion that the independent commission as at present constituted is not right.  The results have proven to be wrong.  I do not want to labour it.  I do not want to suggest that the Minister came in here with his heels stuck in the ground.  I believe that the Minister, on leaving this House, will see the point we are trying to make.</P>
    <P>To date the functions of independent commissions are not working for the betterment of the people.  At the end of the day that is what matters if our democracy is to be sound, safe and strong.  I have given an instance here.  In my amendment I will give a different instance altogether. I believe and hope that the Minister will see my point of view.  The terms of reference given by the Government to the independent commission were to leave the size of our county council at 31.  They did not accept that.  They changed the terms of reference and the Government accepted it with open arms because every other government had accepted it as a result of commissions.  It is a good Government that will say they are sorry that they cannot and should not accept. I suggest that the Minister has an opportunity to give an answer to that.  At least the terms of reference should be adhered to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1684" /> Because of our political system, no matter how hard I or my party worked for a member of our party living on the Aran Islands we were unable to get him elected because, as stated in my own amendment &mdash; and I will explain it to Senator Lennon in detail &mdash; that is not possible.  I had the idea that we would make the Aran Islands a single seat constituency, in that they would be guaranteed to have one councillor, be he of a political party or not.  Whoever that person would be, firstly, he would have to be living on the Aran Islands and, secondly, his political status would be taken into account.  All the aspects I mentioned earlier concerning fishing, the problems of repair to roads and services as outlined by Senator O'Toole and the point of view of tourists should be considered on an island whose population is swelled to the limits in the summer season.  The least they could have is one person to liaise in regard to the problems of those islands and other islands along the coast.  It would be important to have representation in the county council. They were not capable of getting it under the terms of reference of Udarás na Gaeltachta. It is sad.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Minister that his dear friend, the Minister for Communications, Deputy Mitchell, recently visited all the Aran Islands. There was a photograph of the Minister transporting his wife around the island, he on the saddle of a bike and she on the carrier.  Senators would agree that that is not the way in which those internationally known islands should be serviced.  Senator de Brún spoke very well on the cultural aspects.  I appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the suggestion that a single seat constituency from the islands off the west coast of Galway will resolve the problem.  It would be an indication to this independent commission that they should not go beyond their terms of reference.</P>

      <P>On section 7, I take it that when the borough is set up, offices and a seat for the mayor will be provided. Is it envisaged that a grant for the setting up of the borough will be immediately in train or how do the Department start financing this?  Will the offices be rented temporarily at first?  Where will the Mayor of Galway sit?  Where will the administrative hub for the whole borough be located, or are there any plans in the Department of the Environment for the setting up of offices?  What type of financing will be available in the initial stages, for the setting up of the offices of the mayor and his administrative staff.  It is a fairly big undertaking to launch a borough in the city of Galway.  There are not many sites available for the setting up of the mayoral seat.  This should have a certain amount of distinction.  It should be sited where it would be indentifiable as one of the most attractive offices within that beautiful city.  Has the Minister plans in the Department, what grants will be made available and under what headings will the money be made available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the House to give this amendment due consideration taking into account that the Minister found my previous suggestion unacceptable.  The history of this amendment is quite simple. Earlier I asked for the appreciation of the Minister for the unanimous decision of the Galway County Council and the corporation concerning the revisions and the divisions of the city and corporation. That unanimous decision was given wholeheartedly after a lot of thought and <Col N="1687" /> because of a desire to do the right thing so that we would set in motion a series of events unique to Galway.  To the best of my knowledge no other boundaries were unanimously agreed.</P>
      <P>When Galway County Council worked out that agreement they considered suggestions that they had concerning the division of the county electoral areas. Hence the reason for my amendment which is self-explanatory.  When we agreed to the extension of the city boundaries on the west side we locked away, as the maps in your file will show, all of Connemara and separated it through Lough Corrib from the rest of the county. We sent a unanimously agreed recommendation that all of Connemara inclusive of the Aran Islands should be one electoral area.  Even though I have not said it in my amendment, we also suggested that it be a seven seat constituency. Then we went to the remaining electoral areas around the county.  Senator M.D. Higgins is not present because of a commitment he has in Ethiopia with a subcommittee of the House, but I am sure he would verify the fact that we made a suggestion, without nominating the size of the electoral areas, to be put to the commission that the three major market towns of Loughrea, Ballinasloe and Tuam should be the basis of the three new electoral areas.  In fact, they were the basis of the old electoral areas.  We added a rider stating that we would like to have included in those new electoral divisions the natural economic and social hinterland around them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a very reasonable decision of Galway County Council and it was unanimous.  What happened to it?  Our agreement was appreciated on the extensions of the city boundary but the unanimous decision of the county council concerning the other proposals around the country were quietly forgotten about.  I am sorry Senator Lennon has left the Chamber because I would like to remind him that the situation in our county as is proposed in the Bill in the new divisions of the electoral areas is slightly lopsided. One has to understand that the village <Col N="1688" /> and the townland of Inverin must have everything in common with the townland and village of Spiddal.  Yet the independent commission divided those two districts.  They are both Gaeltacht areas. They are both on the same stretch of coastline.  They are both served by the major village of Spiddal.  Yet the judge, and the commission, saw fit to split them in two, separate them forever.</P>
    <P>The case of the Aran Islands was made today and I will not add to it.  It is a Fíor-Ghaeltacht area.  It was taken out with Spiddal and designated for a new era of political life.  Crossing over the mountain ridge and the bog and down the north side of the peninsula of Connemara what happened?  Out of the original Galway electoral area the independent commission took the town of Oughterard and the DEDs of Letterfore.  A Breac-Ghaeltacht, which is a bit different from the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, was taken out of the Galway area, put into the Fíor-Ghaeltacht area further west and made into a new five seat constituency.</P>
    <P>I made a case on Second Stage and I will not go through it all again.  Whatever about the political situation in Louth I am absolutely and totally convinced today that the political situation arising in Connemara was part of a scheme.  I described last week how that was done. I explained that my party, Fianna Fáil, in the history of that area had always three seats out of four.  We got an increase of one seat and it was hoped of course, it would go to Fine Gael, but I want to restate that I do not believe they are going to get it no matter how the tacticians work.  The seat will go to an independent candidate working under the auspices of Cumhacht and I am not advertising for them.  The whole scandal only started then.  Then they moved into Galway to the remaining area of a line from Oughterard to the division of Spiddal and Inverin and took the population of that area, hoisted them over the Corrib and put them into the environs around the city to a certain limit only.  That is where I see the political guile again in operation.  We went northwards rapidly down through the county and arrived at <Col N="1689" /> the Shrule Bridge at the Mayo border and said that was fine.  We crossed up along and found it difficult to avoid the town of Tuam because we had to go west first on the road around the town and then take a sharp turn east in order to take in a little townland called Cloondarone which is two and a half miles from Tuam and east of it.  Then we had to create a new political peninsula and cross out again quickly to the River Clare and then fall in with the terms of reference of the Government to the boundaries commission when they said that they should take into account the existing electoral divisions in Dáil elections.  We only suited ourselves on that aspect of it.</P>
    <P>We proceeded rapidly again southwestward until we arrived at Cashla, Athenry.  Athenry is seven miles from Galway city and four and a half miles from the new city boundary.  Shrule Bridge is 26 miles from the city boundary. Unless one has a map one cannot understand what I am referring to but the Minister knows quite well what I am saying because he understands the political geography.  Then we came to Cashla, two miles from Athenry and took Athenry which in every election since the foundation of the State was part of North Galway and we put it in with Loughrea. We swung quickly in to give, like County Leitrim has, about a mile and a half of a sea front to that new Galway environment constituency and made it into six seats.  I am certain that this independent commission had to seek all this information from the Department of the Environment because they could not get it from anywhere else.  They travelled to Galway and spent a half day with the chairman and manager of the county council and the other half of the day with the mayor of the city and his staff.  I am sure all that data could not be processed into two short meetings.  The chairman of the commission after that visit could not say to me &mdash; I do not believe he could say it to anybody &mdash;&ldquo;I now have a perfect map of the county and I know where the line should be drawn and I am going to go back up to Dublin and do it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That commission had to &mdash; this is where <Col N="1690" /> the principle of commissions is wrong &mdash; go back to the Department of the Environment to get information.  That is where a good Minister for his party, would put the whole thing into motion and feed out the responses through the Department to the commission in the way he knows he would get answers to suit his political party.  I am absolutely convinced that that is what happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I never made that charge. What I said was that the system is such that there is no other way that the commission can get the information.  I am saying that the political play is, knowing that the commission have to get this information, that if one feeds in the information they can only extract what was fed in.  That is what happened.  I am not blaming the commission.  I am blaming the system.  I have no axe to grind with those individuals.  They are people I hold in high esteem.  It is the system I am against. This is my third time speaking about it and I will not speak about it any more. My mind is quite clear on it.  What did we do?  We made that a new six-seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not pre-empt what is going to happen but the unanimous decision of the Galway County Council in the first instance to make this sensible request of the boundary commission to have the major market towns and the hinterlands about them included in the electoral area was reasonable and honourable.  It is disgraceful that it was not acceded to.  That is what I am complaining about.  The natural hinterland to Galway city is the town of Athenry and the district about it but it was not even thought about; it was put into Loughrea.  That is why I am saying this system is wrong and why I reiterate in my amendment today the exact wording of Galway County Council's unanimous decision in agreeing on this city boundary and also agreeing <Col N="1691" /> unanimously on the electoral divisions. I shall put this amendment before this House today because I have to, as a person who played a major role in all that extraordinary unanimity that was reached in our county.  We made a decision in good faith and we hoped it would have been accepted in good faith.</P>
    <P>How on earth did we find that the simplest and easiest way to solve the problem of the Loughrea electoral area was to add an extra seat to it?  I read in the press recently that the daughter of a very famous Fine Gael family is seeking nomination in Loughrea &mdash; a member of the O'Higgins family &mdash; and it is my opinion that this extra seat was geared in Loughrea to try to ensure that this lovely young lady would be elected to Galway County Council.  Burns said once that the plans of men &ldquo;gang aft agley&rdquo;.  They went wrong on Mr. Jim Tully, a former Minister for Local Government and I am afraid they might go wrong on this occasion too.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, and in the opinion of many people, particularly in north Galway, there is a political input by a most devious way which was certainly not sought by the commission.  The input is there and it cannot be avoided.  That is the reason I felt honoured today to be able to put before the House this unanimous part of the agreement of the Galway County Council, which is not mentioned in any documentation from anybody &mdash; commission, Minister, Taoiseach etc.  We made this in the same good faith as we made the original one.  That is the reason I am asking that this amendment be added to the Bill &mdash; to correct a terrible wrong against the members of Galway County Council who did their utmost in good faith to bring about agreement on all of those relevant matters.</P>
    <P>It is most regrettable that those matters could not be taken on board by the independent commission, by the Minister and by the Government so that everything that was agreed unanimously in good faith should be acted upon in good faith. We were tricked and snookered.  The councillors of Galway feel that in this Bill <Col N="1692" /> they are praised for one aspect and totally forgotten about for the other aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Killilea's amendment.  The reason for putting down amendment No. 2 is to redress an anomaly and an injustice that we feel has occurred in a very small specific area in my constituency.  We accepted the findings of the boundary commission.  We had looked, as a county council &mdash; all political parties plus the independents &mdash; for certain changes to be made and for additional councillors in certain areas.  In the report we found that the extra councillors sought in our submission were not allocated but instead certain changes and fluctuations of population were taken into account by moving certain parts of the constituency from one electoral area to another.  I think they did a fairly good job.  There is no change in the number of county councillors.  No councillor has been added in my county but by agreement the council as a whole, Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil and the Independent member, felt that the Gaeltacht area of Baile Gib should be left intact in order to preserve the social life and attitude of this cultural community.</P>
      <P>This community was settled in this part of County Meath approximately 50 years ago.  These people vote together for the Udarás elections; they have been part of the Navan electoral area since they came to County Meath.  A very small portion, about 200 or thereabouts of this community, had been put into Kells electoral area and that is the part of this settled community who hail from Mayo, Galway, Cork and Kerry.  We feel that it is socially wrong and it is not in keeping with the strict terms of reference of the commission. I would be the first to admit that it was probably an oversight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would support Senator Killilea's remarks that perhaps the commission should be ongoing, having access to local information in any electoral area to see what would be right and what would be wrong.  I am sure if this had been the case they would not simply have looked at the figures and put that part of the Navan area into the Kells electoral area, which <Col N="1693" /> had a good percentage shortfall.  It needed adjustment and they put in the Rath Cairn area which had already been split up.  There were other reasons and implications for that because the Rath Cairn area was extended into part of the Trim electoral area.  They put that area with Athboy into the Kells area to make up an anomaly that did exist there where our percentage ratio was very low indeed. Had we had the local input into the commission and had they realised that in effect what they were doing was cutting off a section of the community and putting them into a different electoral area, having to communicate with different public representatives with whom they had not much communication prior to this, they would not have made that decision.</P>
    <P>There are extenuating circumstances and reasons for my tabling this amendment. It is affecting the social well-being and fabric of this settled community.  It is contrary to the terms of reference of the commission.  The Minister should have some way of redressing the situation and righting this anomaly which has occurred. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment, that this House will accept it unanimously and thereby be seen to do justice on behalf of this community.</P>

We are all concerned about the survival of Irish and most people agree that this matter has reached a vital stage. My view is not an optimistic one in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ballygibb and Rath Cairn Irish is the living spoken language.  We must remember that with those two areas we did not just have a transfer of people. We had a transfer of total culture.  It is important to remember that.  In addition, while the high hopes of those who established those areas may not have been realised, it is still not too late to make headway in this respect.  The Minister is very approachable and reasonable.  I have found him sympathetic in situations <Col N="1694" /> where a good case has been made, but it is not reasonable to split up this Gaeltacht area.</P>
    <P>The townland of Tailteann, the site of the ancient tailteann games, and the townland of Gibbstown, the site of the transfer of this culture about 50 years ago have been unified at a political level for at least 50 years.  It is only realistic, for the reasons stated by Senator Lynch and myself, that reconsideration should be given to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand Senator Killilea's desire regarding the recommendations of the Galway County Council to the county and county borough electoral area and boundary commission, I would ask him to withdraw the amendment for the reasons which I shall again outline.</P>
      <P>Recently the Government accepted the commission's findings.  As a result these are now Government policy and are in line with the practices that have gone before.  The same arguments relate to Senator Lynch's amendment.  Once you open up this total area of the commission's report, you must ask where it stops, where you bring any form of sanity to it. I do not think you can.  One has got to accept that and see this now on the ground.  If, then, there are serious anomalies there is no reason why the Minister, by agreement, cannot be petitioned on anomalies.  The Minister can make changes in particular areas.  However, it would be imprudent of any Minister to make such changes until we were satisfied that the provisions were not operable on the ground.</P>
      <P>On these grounds I ask both Senators to withdraw their amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to reiterate the question of the integrity of the commission and to emphasise that there was no political influence of any kind exercised either directly or indirectly in regard to them. It is important to put on the record of the House that this type of integrity exists with regard to independent commissions. As I indicated on Second Stage, if doubts are being voiced about commissions, people of their calibre would be slow to <Col N="1695" /> serve.  It is important that we always have a reservoir of public-minded people who are prepared to serve and serve in the best interests of the country.  I have no doubt that that is what motivates these people to give a lot of time, work long hours and at week-ends in serving on such commissions.  It is important that that tradition would always be part of our society.  It is important to say that because otherwise there might be some who would assume that I was agreeing with remarks being made.  I understand Senator Killilea's concern and why his local authority's recommendations were not accepted.  Again it is a matter for any body, when they examine proposals and submissions put to them, that they operate along the lines they consider best. That is the way it is and that is the way it should be and I hope that is the way it will be always.</P>
    <P>It is important to accept the principle of this.  Commissions are good in principle. As regards people suffering as a result of commissions working in one's constituency, I stood for election in 1973 and I am now a quarter of a mile from the nearest vote I had then.  That gives a clear indication of what can happen in cities.  Commissions operate on a principle and on the basis of doing what they believe is right, what is right in the interests of the electoral system.  As Senator Killilea said, a number on the Opposition side are awaiting this election in June to prove the point that they are now on the crest of the wave.  Why then is there so much concern about political interference? We all know that we cannot interfere with peoples' choices or attitudes. What we should be thinking about now is putting through the Bill, proceeding with the elections in June and letting the best man win.  Our councils, particularly Galway Borough Council, should be set up and in Dublin where we have new council areas, we should be getting on with that and looking for further reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>For the third time today I want to question the Minister's phrase that we should not interfere with the <Col N="1696" /> integrity of the commission.  I do not question the integrity of this or any commission. My remarks are being interpreted as questioning the integrity of the commission.  I am not interested in the integrity of anybody nor am I questioning the integrity of anybody, I am only interested in the end product which is the view of people from all sides of the political divide.  However, I question the right of the commission to question the integrity of the outgoing elected members of Galway Corporation and Galway County Council, who in good faith and with integrity came to several unanimous decisions on the adjustment of the city boundary and made recommendations to the commission.</P>
      <P>The commission's integrity is being talked about but nothing has been said about the integrity of the county councillors who in good faith sat for days to do the best job for their county, which many of them had served for a long time.  Let us keep integrity out of it.  You could fill graveyards with integrity.</P>
      <P>If you win an election you get all the laurels but if you lose you get all the sympathy.  Neither the laurels nor the sympathy are much good because a day's work has to be done.  No member of my party has ever questioned anybody's integrity.  I question why the unanimous decisions of the county council concerning their proposition to the commission for the electoral boundary of County Galway as well as their unanimous decision regarding the extension of the city boundaries were not accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lynch made the point about the division of a tiny Gaeltacht area in County Meath.  The end product in the last three commissions has not been favourable to all the people.  Perhaps it has been in favour of some people but any commission's report must come out in favour of everyone.  I submitted instances of where that has not happened.  It is most glaring in this report.  I believe what Senator Lennon said about the Minister coming in here with his heels stuck in the ground.  I have been constructive.  I have not in any way been destructive and I have instanced the reasons.  We had a <Col N="1697" /> split in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht in County Meath and we had the revelation of the burst up of the Gaeltacht in Connemara. There is no logic in the revision of Galway and it does not benefit the people.</P>
    <P>Why did the commission separate the people of Spiddal from the people of Inverin?  Is it logical to put the people of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht of the Aran Islands in with the people of the Gaeltacht of Tuam?  The Minister said he could always be petitioned but we have already petitioned and nobody listened.  Can we petition before the election or after the election?  It will be too late after the election. I have made reasonable petitions here today and I have explained the unanimity of our council's efforts carried out with integrity and good faith.  My definition of integrity is that all political parties and independents can reach an unanimous decision.  The manner in which the commission applied that is astounding because they did not suggest to the boundaries commission the number of seats in each area but told them to take three market towns and their hinterlands and to nominate the number of seats they wanted.</P>
    <P>That is why I cannot and will not withdraw this because I have worked with the councillors, all now outgoing; they made a wonderful contribution to our country and council and it behoves the Minister to take it on board when the commission did not.  This Bill empowers the Minister to do so and I am asking him to do it.  I am putting this amendment down on behalf of all the members of Galway County Council who did the honourable thing with regard to the reorganisation of our county.  It is a sad reflection that their wishes could not have been accepted and honoured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment specifically relates to section 21.  Further to what Senator Killilea said, I reiterate that I have not at any time during this debate questioned the integrity of the commission, but I see an opportunity for the Minister and the Government to validate the integrity of this commission.  Both <Col N="1698" /> Senator Killilea and I are dealing with two sensitive areas.  The Minister has stuck his heels in the ground and closed his ears to the pleas of people who have been members of local authorities for a number of years.  I have been a member of a local authority for 18 years and I have been asked by the elected members of all parties of the local authority to try to adjust an anomaly that they feel exists.  The Minister is not prepared to budge one inch in the interests of protecting the integrity of this commission by making that minor adjustment.  We could have looked for dozens of adjustments. We could have asked why we did not get the extra two county councils that we sought, but we did not; we said we would accept the recommendations even though we were not satisfied.  It was all done in good faith.</P>
      <P>On this issue as well as the issue on which Senator Killilea spoke, I ask the Minister and the Government to show their goodwill in appointing this commission and to validate the integrity of that commission by acceding to the request of all members of political parties in our areas to make that minor adjustment whereby I am willing to sacrifice 200 votes in order to consolidate that settled, cultured community.  If I felt for one moment that the Minister was not prepared to give at least sympathetic consideration to that, then I do not see why I am wasting my time here arguing on behalf of the other members of the county council or of the people of Meath or this community.  Let me ask the Minister if he would agree, as a man and a politician with vast experience of dealing with very sensitive issues which are close to the heart, that my request is very reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I did not question the integrity of the commission.  I did not imply that in what I said, and I think the inference is unreasonable.  The integrity of the commission is above question.  However, that is not to say that they could not make mistakes.  That is a different matter entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1699" /> I want to confine my few brief comments to the situation in Ballygibb.  The original intention here was to establish a small community, a small nucleus from which the Irish tradition would spread, and in those circumstances it is very important that unity be preserved.  As I have said, unfortunately the hopes were not realised, but it is not too late.  It is fairly late in the day, but not too late.  This small community has yielded, generally speaking, to external pressures and it was only reasonable to expect that it would to some extent; but the Minister is adding an impossible pressure, an unnecessary pressure, to proceed with this division. We want unity on every level in this small group, and if any change had to be made a case could be made to have an Irish speaking representative elected for this Irish speaking area.  I think that would be reasonable simply from the point of view of this small nucleus, this small cultural community which needs help more now than ever before.  If this help is not forthcoming this community will disintegrate and the fight for the preservation of Irish will be left so much behind.  From that point of view, the point of view of unity in this area which is so essential, from the social point of view which Senator Lynch has mentioned and from the preservation of Irish point of view which I have emphasised, I ask the Minister to accept that this is a reasonable request and to reconsider his position.</P>

      <P>It would appear from what we can gather on this side of the House that the whole purpose of any debate, especially on Committee Stage, is to tease out the various sections.  On Second Stage we made our case under the different headings.  It would appear to us now on this side of the House that there will be no change of attitude on the part of the Minister, that he is in a very entrenched position and that no matter what we say from here on in he will say that he is accepting the recommendations of this commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not questioning the integrity of that commission, as has been stated <Col N="1700" /> already, but we do not even know the personnel who were on the commission. We know that a commission called an independent commission was set up, and, as Senator Killilea said, we are questioning its product which has been put before us.  We have been trying to give the Minister our views and in that we include the views of the various councils throughout the country.  If the Minister is to get into such an entrenched position that he is not going to depart to the extent of even one line from the independent commission's report, then we can wrap up and go now because we are wasting our time here.  It is a very poor reflection on democracy, when we are trying to help the Minister to bring in legislation that is acceptable to everybody, if the Minister comes in here with his mind fixed on not changing anything that is in that, although he had all over the week-end to think about it while we were having our field days at the Ard Fhéis, winning the rugby match and losing money on the Grand National.</P>
    <P>The Minister had all the time to examine our submissions which were submitted with a view to trying to bring out a proper reorganisation Bill that would be suitable to the country.  I do not know what his views will be from here on, but if he is going to be entrenched in that position, then we are wasting our time debating this measure here.  Will the Minister tell us if he is going to accept anything that we put forward?  If not, then we can get on to the next business and let him off with this Bill because we are wasting our time here and this is not fair to us.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House feel that we are getting nowhere.  As legislators we are trying to be as responsible as we can and trying to screen and tease out every section here as we go along.  I hope we are helpful, but I feel the Minister's approach is negative.  I ask him to make some statement at this stage.  We could be here tomorrow if he gets our backs up.  We are well able to debate for days on this Bill even with the number of sections remaining.  We do not want to hold up the local government elections.  We do not want to be here all over Easter, but <Col N="1701" /> we have the ability on this side of the House to do that if necessary.  I ask the Minister to make a statement at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard the appeals.  They have not gone unnoticed and there is no question of being intransigent or indifferent or of wasting time. The idea of any Committee Stage is to tease out and examine a Bill.  I am surprised to hear Senators talking about an intransigent view.  Since the commissions were brought into being the principle has been to accept them totally and not just in this case.  I have argued on the other side of the House for changes also and my arguments were not accepted.  I heard numbers of Deputies asking for changes in the other House.  Only last week, on Second Stage and Committee Stage a large number of Deputies sought change. I indicated Kerry County Council and Cork County Council and the Opposition amendments.  We explained our reasons. Precedent and principle have built up here and it has become well established that such recommendation's are accepted.</P>
      <P>Senator Lynch talked about validating the integrity of the commission by accepting these principles.  I believe the way you validate the integrity of the commission would be by accepting their findings.  I will not get into an argument on this, but this is the view I hold.  If we talk about independence and commissions, then we should accept this; and, if we do not accept that kind of thinking, we should petition our respective parties and try to change the system.  We have had a number of these systems in operation which have never been changed, and I accept that they should not be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be intransigent or to oppose genuine amendments for the sake of opposition.  I am not casting any aspersions on why Senators are doing this &mdash; perhaps they are doing it because they are representing their constituents or whatever &mdash; but I have a view, the Government have a view, and the Opposition when in Government had the same view: that you accept the principle of independent commissions totally unless there is a very good reason for not doing <Col N="1702" /> so, and I have not yet seen such a reason. One can always argue about this community or that community, and one would regret any disruption of any community in that sense, but I did indicate that after the elections when this system is working one can have a look at it to see how it is affecting communities or if it is affecting the way of life of different areas.  If there are grave fears about it the people can petition the Minister and he can examine it and make the necessary alterations, but under the present arrangement it is only right and proper to accept what we have been given.  I believe it will work effectively and efficiently, as other commissions have done. But if it does not, it is not the end of the world.  As I said petitions can be made after we have seen how it is operating.  I accept the genuineness of Senator Killilea and Senator Lynch who put down these amendments.  I understand the disruption they believe will be caused, but I will not be accepting these amendments.  Again I would appeal to Senators to withdraw these amendments and let us proceed in an orderly way through the rest of the sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>At least twice today I asked the Minister if he can give a logical reason why the commission and he did not accept a unanimous decision of the county council when they took on board another unanimous decision of the same council.  I cannot understand the reasoning behind this.  No matter what we say here today, if in future anybody asks members of a county council or county borough to sit down and reach agreement, they will take the destruction of the agreement by the present commission, and obviously by the Government, as an indicator that it does not pay to have unanimity and to be constructive, because other councils have achieved far more by being divisive on this matter. We are the sufferers.  This is the most horrifying aspect of this Bill.  These two amendments are the only amendments put down in this House by this party. We did not do a repetition job, grab the Official Report of the Dáil, change the <Col N="1703" /> phraseology and have a debate for the sake of having a debate.  We put down these amendments because we felt sincerely and deeply about them.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister comment on the fact that following any other commission report no Minister has ever received in subsequent legislation the same authority as the Minister has in this legislation? Perhaps I was wrong to ask today for a single seat for the Aran Islands, but I believe I was right because their affairs could be looked after by one individual that would be a brave step for this Government to take.  I asked why the terms of reference of the Government were not adhered to by the commission. That was a reasonable request, but I did not get a reply.  This amendment was put down with integrity.  My definition of integrity is the act of responsible thinking by a county council to achieve unanimity. One of these amendments has to be listened to and acted on before the elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think these amendments reflect on the integrity of the commission. If the points we are making had been pointed out to the commission before they sat, or if we had had an opportunity to discuss those matters in either House before the commission sat, those anomalies might not have cropped up.  In future before setting up a commission we should have a three day debate in one or both Houses so that the ideas of the public representatives can be written down and studied.  Something has to be done to stop the result we are getting from the commissions, because the three of them have failed.  It is not a question of integrity; it is a question of results.  I do not want to question integrity, but the results of the last three independent commissions have not favoured all the community as they set out to do.  We have brought out two glaring, obvious, and pressing anomalies here today.  The Minister should be brave enough to go to the Government and say &ldquo;This has gone wrong, let us correct it&rdquo; and not wait for petitions, deputations and councillors gallivanting up and down to Dublin talking <Col N="1704" /> to this and that Minister.  When elected local government representatives do something constructive they should be listened to.  The impression given that they are gallivanting around corridors in this city for days on end trying to make a point is ridiculous.  It is unique but all it is getting is the bum's rush.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to get unanimous decisions in my county.  One could count the number of unanimous decisions on one hand.  It is a retrograde step not to accept this decision.  This is the opposite to the way in which we dealt with other commissions. This was the new way.  This was the way in which we were to have an input.  It has been pushed aside.  That is why I say that the system of setting up of commissions must be looked at.  It is of vital importance.  The commission did not achieve the proper results for the community at large.  I should like the Minister to comment on that.  Surely it can be done by order without upsetting the Bill, delaying the elections or sending the Bill back to the other House.  The case of Senator Lynch and Senator Fitzsimons is as obvious as a pearl.  It is not sensible to divide a community in County Meath, which is a Fíor-Ghaeltacht, and put it into two electoral areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply to all our questions has been in general overall terms.  We are not satisfied with many things that happened in my county but we accept the overall general principle of what the commission set out to do.  Many members of our county council are not happy but they accept the position.  Does the Minister agree that there is a specific case to be made here?  The Minister's attitude seems to be that we dare not set light to a sod of turf in case we set fire to the whole bog.  We are not asking the Minister to burn the bog but to do something about this anomaly.  The commission were probably not fully aware that this was a community brought from various counties to County Meath to be settled there and to promote Irish culture and the Irish language in an area within 40 miles of County Dublin and to keep alive the hopes and aspirations of the <Col N="1705" /> Government to preserve Irish as an entity.  Yet, on its fiftieth anniversary, we divide it in two.  Does the Minister agree that there is a case to be made in this instance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that there is an immutable tradition to accept the reports of the commissions without change.  It is pointless to try to argue and to convince the Minister if, in fact, his hands are tied.  A special case can be made for the Gaeltacht areas. These areas should be considered as inviolate and inviolable entities.  I notice that the Minister did not say that he disagreed with our point of view.  I ask the Minister to reconsider it and to accept &mdash; we are not questioning the integrity of any commission or of anybody &mdash; that a mistake was made which can be corrected now.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues. Clinical adherence to population per public representative must embody a lot of problems when it comes to trying to secure for any area the natural hinterland that is there.  Clearly in this case the acceptance by the commission &mdash; we are not questioning their integrity &mdash; of the necessity to try to have the same number of people per public representative regardless of the lay out and the geography of an area has thrown up these individual community and disruptive situations which Senators on all sides of the House would like to see changed.  The Minister should try to make some effort to tell the House that, if not in this case, at least in the future, cognisance will be taken of genuine community interests in cases where commissions are being established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect the fact it is a good idea to take electoral boundaries out of the hands of politicians because the problems that can emerge are well documented.  While there is little scope for it in the South there is plenty of evidence of what is happening in the North. The idea of an independent commission <Col N="1706" /> is proper and right.  To have a small group of people look at the country on that population clinical basis within the limitations that exist is wrong.</P>
      <P>We have spoken about decentralisation and how individual groups and communities could express their own personality in different ways.  This is totally frustrated when little townlands and groups of people are divided and could well end up without a local representative because the numbers are not sufficient in any of the areas to elect somebody in their communities.  It is unrealistic to expect a change at this stage but the Minister should indicate to the House his willingness to accept the principle of trying to hold our communities together as much as possible.  At a time when the law is being broken and there are security and other problems the necessity for strong communities and the transfer of responsibility to them is crucially important. We should start to go down that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify a few points.  The impression might have been given that throughout the country the recommendations were accepted. Recommendations were made by many councils.  In Cork city and county recommendations were made and there was total agreement about the way the city and county should be divided.  Unfortunately the recommendations the commission made did not meet with our approval at the end of the day.  This was an independent commission.  To give an impression that there is total agreement by all councillors throughout the country would not be right.  There are areas in Cork City, for instance, where the council recommended that something was best but the commission recommended otherwise. When the elections are over we will find out whether better representation is available for all the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Gaeltacht areas I can well appreciate the councillors' concern about a tidy community or a community that stays within itself.  I have a great <Col N="1707" /> regard for the Gaeltacht people.  Unfortunately for too long we gave the impression that they had to be recognised independently and left to do things their own way.  That is a pity.  We are now saying in Seanad Éireann that they must have only one type of person, or that they must vote for one person only.  It would be better for the Irish language if we were to say that they are now recognised in two electoral areas rather than one.  They could convey their Gaeltacht learning to other people in other areas.  That is what the idea should be.  We should be saying that the Gaeltacht people have a great deal to offer.  It is coming across to me that they can vote only for a certain type of person, or a certain type of party and that is a pity.  If we treat the language in that way, it will never grow.  If the Gaeltacht people are told that a certain percentage can vote in one area and the others can vote in another area, that must help the language.  This is the critical part of this debate.  I ask Senators on the other side of the House to please recognise that and give it a chance.  At the end of the day it might help the language.  As I have already said, an impression is being created that there is total agreement on the commission's report.  There is not.  We must wait and see what is best for all the people as Senator Killilea said.  We will see that only when the election is over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>A few points were raised.  Senator Smith raised the point about slavish adherence to population trends.  That is not actually true in the overall local authority sense, because one can look at Leitrim and Dublin city. There are about 10,500 people per councillor in Dublin city and there are probably about 1,200 in Leitrim.  That is a good thing because in small counties there should be that kind of proportion. I favour that personally.  When you have big conurbations of people, you can have a larger population unit.  Basically we should spread it out and give it as much representation as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that communities should be left intact, that <Col N="1708" /> was one of the recommendations by the Government to the commission.  They were not to upset communities.  All we can say is that that is the principle.  I am not saying that the principle was or was not adhered to.  I am not here to speak on behalf of the commission.  They made their own recommendations.  I am not here to give reasons why they did or did not do something.  They are an independent body.</P>
    <P>We can argue about nitty gritty changes, one change here and one change there, but that is not the question.  Senator Cregan indicated that a number of areas were unhappy.  In the Dáil a number of people sought changes and they were refused.  A number of bodies made recommendations and they were refused.  It would be wrong at the end to ignore a whole plethora of people who felt they had a good case.  People make a case because they feel they have a good case.  We all accept that principle.  They were rejected and rightly so.</P>
    <P>It would not be in the best democratic tradition to accept what are called minor proposals and reject others.  That would not be a good principle to adopt.  For that reason I am not going down that road, not because I do not understand people's views; I accept everybody's bona fides when they stand up here and make a case for change because they know the area pretty well and they know the reasons why they believe in it.</P>
    <P>In the overall situation, who could bring in a set of proposals and have them accepted?  Somebody said we would like to get away from this type of commission but we do not want politicians to do it. Whether a commission is <i>in situ</i> all the time or whether you appoint them as the need for change arises is not very relevant.  We have enough bodies set up on a permanent basis.  The way we are doing this is reasonable.  Otherwise you give it back to the politicians.  The politicians would not win anyway.  No matter what we say about a commission, if politicians put forward proposals here they would be blasted out of it.  Even if the Government let the Opposition write the proposals for them and took them on <Col N="1709" /> board, they would still be slated.  We are not going to win in that situation.  The road we are on is the safest road.  It is the best road in the best interests of local democracy and central democracy.

      <P>I want to make one point. Last July in the Dáil, the Minister for Justice, after a month of a debate refused point blank to make an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill.  I will not go into detail except to say that when that Bill came to the Seanad the Minister for Justice accepted an amendment which he had fought totally against introducing in the Dáil.  I merely want to say to the Minister of State that if we have reached a point where, because he refuses to make an amendment in the Dáil, that necessarily means no similar or other amendments can be made in the Seanad, the status of the Seanad is reduced quite considerably and is out of line with his colleague's attitude to the Seanad.</P>

Tá ceantair á ndeighilt ón a chéile, ceantair in a raibh pobal Gaeilge agus a bhí i dteannta a chéile le céad bliain, agus mar sin tá éagóir á déanamh ar an teanga i gcás Bhaile Gib agus i gcás na n-oileán ó iarthar na Gaillimhe.</P>
      <P>I want to say very briefly that an injustice is being done to the Irish language in this Bill.  In the case of Baile Ghib a community is being divided down the centre.  I disagree totally with what Senator Cregan has said in that regard, that it might be better to do that and to separate the Irish speaking public in that area and to decentralise them into further contact with people from other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of the scheme was initiated 50 years ago.  This year they are celebrating this County Meath colony of Irish-speaking people.  It is their fiftieth <Col N="1710" /> anniversary and they have already begun the commemoration of that great event. That scheme was initiated on the basis of centralising the people who migrated from the Gaeltacht into large communities, so that they would have opportunities to keep in close contact with each other and live, communicate, associate and propagate the aims for which they were put there, that is, to spread the language and remain an integrated community. That principle is being disrupted here.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that there is no precedent for rejecting any recommendations from a commission of this kind set up in the same way as this commission has been set up.  This may be so.  He added there was no precedent without a very good reason.  I would like to ask the Minister would he not accept as a very good reason the fact that the Aran Islands have been put in with an area just outside Tuam, a totally English speaking Galltacht area having no contact with the three Aran Islands?  Is that not a very good reason why the Minister and the Government should not have a second look at the proposals by the commission?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the people who constituted the commission were Irish speakers, or whether, any or all of them could speak the language, but it is very strange that they have come up with that solution in regard to the language.  I want to register a protest here this evening and put it on the record of the House ar son na Gaeilge.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, the Minister in his reply stated that the Government made a decision to accept the findings of the commission prior to a debate in the Dáil and Seanad.  I think perhaps the Government made a mistake there.  This, to a certain degree, could be dangerous for democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our argument is based on principles we have outlined here.  The more I think of what is involved and when I hear Senators de Brún, Fitzsimons and other Senators speak, I remember our Constitution <Col N="1711" /> and what is enshrined in it &mdash; to cherish equally.  The more I think of it the more I am convinced that an injustice has been done.  I still call on the Minister, because he has the power &mdash; and he has not denied that he has &mdash; to amend this legislation and grant what we feel is the right of these people to hold their community intact and not have their social outlook and attitudes impaired by the legislation which is before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say I disagree with Senator Cregan.  We all know of the old saying &ldquo;Divide and conquer&rdquo;, and we know how effective that has been in this country.  I am not saying that any group should be inward looking.  They should have external association and communication. But they should be in a position to preserve their own integrity.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has said, the terms of reference for this commission outlined that the integrity of groups would be respected. What I am saying to the Minister is that in this instance this has not been respected.  That is obvious from what has been said.  A mistake has been made here and a special case should at all times be made for the Gaeltacht areas, that is, for the preservation of our culture and our language.  I appeal to the Minister, in relation to this particular area which is so important, to reconsider his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards that remark, let us get the matter clear.  There is no question of anybody trying to split up any group.  The Gaelic language is very important to us as a society and, unfortunately, over the last ten to 15 years its position is certainly not improving. Whether that should be questioned, I do not know.  Even though I am not a great Irish speaker, I would be inclined to think that we should improve the use of the language in any way possible and that if anything in the Seanad could be done, it should be done.  It is of vital importance to us as a society.  At the same time, we are giving an impression generally in this House that we are talking about the Irish language as regards votes and we should <Col N="1712" /> not be doing that.  That is the point I am trying to put across.  Unfortunately, the impression is coming across that they must be seen to be voting together, but this is only for one day.  This commission are recommending something for the next five years and it will happen one day in the month of June.  After that the group will stay as they stand.  The impression that the particular group must vote only as one group together should not be taken.  That is the reason the Irish language is not being recognised for what it is.  There is a strong impression by those who do not generally speak Irish that these people stay together as a group and this should never be.  They are the blue-blooded people of our country and I do not deny that.  Let us not give the impression that they must all stick together and only do one thing.  I would ask that we broaden our minds and not give the impression that we are talking about the Irish language as a vote.  That would be a very sad occasion, indeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Galwayman and a person who has great regard for the Irish language, I would certainly support this amendment.  To be quite honest the recommendation made in this commission's report that the Aran Islands should be put in with the mainland, in with an area in west Galway expanding back almost into the town of Tuam is crazy. They are being taken away from their natural hinterlands.  The Aran Islands have always been associated with Connemara. They have the same ways of living. I know that they would feel far happier to be put in with Connemara than to be put in with the area now being recommended by this commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the councillors elected in that recommended area do not really understand the problems of the people of the Aran Islands.  These islanders would feel far more at home with the people in the Connemara area and that is the area that they should be in.  I can see no logical reason for dividing up County Galway the way it has been divided under this commission.  I am convinced that some very strong influence must have been <Col N="1713" /> used on the commission in order to get this recommendation through.  Galway County Council, meeting as a body, and Galway Corporation made certain recommendations to the commission, but these were completely ignored.  Those are the people who should know the problems of that region and understand them.</P>
    <P>One would be inclined to ask if there was any point in anybody making a submission to a commission like this if it is to be completely ignored?  One would have expected that a recommendation emanating from a body representative of the people such as Galway County Council or Galway Corporation would have been accepted, and they recommended that the Aran Islands be left with Connemara.  Unfortunately that recommendation was ignored, a retrograde step which the Government eventually will regret.  Even at this late stage I would appeal to the Minister to withdraw that recommendation and accept the amendment before the House.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for people who are used to having a certain person represent them to find themselves in the hands of complete strangers.  That is how people from the Galway electoral area would be referred to by the people of Connemara. I realise this myself because I was the victim of several electoral boundary changes.  Indeed, every election I fought had to be fought in a different area.  It is very difficult for the electorate as well as their public representatives.  I see no logical reason for this change being made now and why Connemara should be included with an area which would be completely foreign to them in every way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">

      <P>It will be open to any council to make a case for a change in their electoral area when we have seen the system in operation.  That is the way it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Aran Islands they have been with the Galway electoral area <Col N="1714" /> since 1942.  Therefore there has been no change there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>They are still in the Galway electoral area and have been since 1942.  Senator Hussey would know the area much better than I.  The point I am making is that they have not been taken out of their electoral area and put in somewhere else.  There may have been some changes that would alter certain areas there.</P>
      <P>As regards the Gaeltacht areas, there are difficulties about establishing electoral areas based exclusively on these areas because of the physical nature of the Gaeltacht.  To begin with the Gaeltacht is spread over seven counties and in six of those it is divided into two or more non-contiguous areas.  In several counties non-Gaeltacht areas are isolated by the Gaeltacht from English-speaking areas. Gross inequalities of representation would arise if all the Gaeltacht areas were to be represented by separate electoral areas, which would run counter to the principle underlying the establishment of the two independent electoral commissions, namely, the quality of representation within counties and county boroughs.  It would be difficult to justify the creation of separate Gaeltacht electoral areas in any counties other than Donegal, Galway and Mayo.  Even in those counties it would seem necessary to exercise a substantial bias in favour of Gaeltacht districts and accept electoral areas which are awkward in shape and include non-contiguous areas.  All of this does not mean that the Gaeltacht will be ignored in the context of local government reform.  The Government accept fully the desirability of having local structures which recognise the special nature of Gaeltacht areas and will be responsive to the needs of such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further legislation will permit the establishment of Gaeltacht committees in the relevant counties to which functions can be devolved.  This will represent a realistic response to the special needs of the Gaeltacht.  On the overall <Col N="1715" /> question of reform, I should make it clear that the Gaeltacht will have their own committees to which statutory powers will devolve.  If one thinks about it it will be seen that that is possibly the better way.  However, it will be open to further debate when this legislation comes before the House.</P>
    <P>Having given those reason perhaps the Senators would consider withdrawing their amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Séamus de Brún</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one very quick point in regard to what the Minister has said.  He has said that there has not been any change in the positioning of the Aran Islands in this electoral area.  I do not think that is correct.  The Minister may be technically correct but the Aran Islands have been in the same electoral area since 1942.  The position is altogether different now.  Heretofore the Aran Islands were included with the whole of west Galway and the whole of Connemara.  I know what I am talking about because I happened to be born there; I was born in Joyce country.  I know the Aran Islands very well and I know the areas, electoral and otherwise, very well.  What the Minister has said may be technically correct but is not electorally correct.  What has happened is that the Aran Islands have been taken away and included with an area of east Galway, a predominantly English speaking area, having no contact with the rest of Connemara, which is Irish speaking.  There is a vast difference.  I want to put on the record of the House that what the Minister has said is not correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  The amendment clearly states that the addition to the Galway area goes against the grain of the desire of the county council members, against that of the county manager and staff.  That is what the amendment is about.</P>

      <P>But it does not appear to have sunk into anybody's consciousness. The commission's terms of reference given them by the Government have been breached.  I do not know whether the Leader of the House is aware of that. Those terms of reference stated clearly that no county council should suffer a diminution in numbers because of reorganisation. We had 31 seats in County Galway and the commission, going against their terms of reference, allocated us 30.  Now the Minister contends that the county of Galway as a whole has increased while the specific terms of reference clearly stated that the existing council would not be reduced.  This point is being lost on Members.  We can talk about individual areas and so on.  It is all right for the Minister to say that the Aran Islands were always in the Galway electoral area.  But Donaghpatrick, Belclare, Claretuam, Gloondarone were not included and they are only two miles from the town of Tuam.  The county council asked that the market towns and their natural economic and social hinterland should not be separated.  The commission departed from their terms of reference. That is the first time I have ever heard of that happening.  We are the losers.  It is wrong of the Minister to ask me to withdraw this amendment.  In conscience I could not withdraw it.  It is the first time since we set up independent boundary commissions that the terms of reference were departed from.  We had better take note of that fact.  That is why I am pressing this amendment to a vote in this <Col N="1717" /> House.  It is not appropriate that we should be asked to withdraw it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask a question on paragraph 12 of the Second Schedule which concerns rates and charges. I made the point a few moments ago about the predicament we find ourselves in.  I wish to draw the attention of the Minister to the situation in which we find ourselves in Galway with regard to the statutory demands in respect of supplementary welfare which we have been unable to fulfil.  We have been consistent in our payment in that respect in that we have always apportioned to the Western Health Board an increase in the allocation in accordance with the increase we received from Central Government.  The bill has now reached the astronomical figure of almost £3 million and there is a demand of £1.5 million on us again this year.  We will be paying .8 of 1 per cent of an increase which will leave a further bill accruing again.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department are aware of this.  They are well aware that Galway County Council are unable to pay this money.  As a member of the health board, I am aware, too, that Roscommon County Council are unable to pay the bill and that Mayo County Council are in the same position.  We had hoped that this Bill would have had enshrined in it some new philosophy for the distribution of those accounts but I find no suggestion in this Bill as to how the Government propose to help county councils who find themselves in this dilemma.  I will not go into the history of the allocation of central funds to different county councils but it is well documented and well known that the appropriation of those accounts are given out in a quite unfavourable way.  The allocation of moneys for restoration and maintenance of roads, etc., is also given out in a very unjust way to our county.  There is nothing in this Bill nor in this subsection which in any way helps to alleviate this problem. We see the bills rising higher and higher and we are getting deeper and deeper into debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned on Second Stage, the primary objective of the Bill as expressed over the last 12 months by the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, <Col N="1723" /> and the Taoiseach, was that all our problems would be resolved with this reorganisation of local authorities.  We will be worse off when this Bill is enacted.  We will have only a few constituency or boundary changes, done poorly and badly.  They are completed in a most unsatisfactory way for many sections of our community.  This is not just happening in my county, it is also the case in Senator Lynch's county.  I ask the Minister to comment on this now.  I do not want him to use the word &ldquo;soon&rdquo; in regard to reform.  This is a pressing problem as two State bodies, the county council and the Western Health Board are going to the High Court in Dublin to decide who is responsible for this Bill.  The Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach must resolve this problem quickly.  I would appreciate the Minister's comments in this regard.</P>

He should also consult councillors who have given life service to their respective counties.  He does not even have to come to our side of the House.

      <P>On Second Stage, many <Col N="1724" /> Senators made the point that adequate compensation should be made to county councillors for the time spent at, or for the costs accruing to them in the performance of their work.  I am not suggesting that the Government should give councillors a salary and they do not request that, but adequate compensation must be made for loss of time in the job that they are elected to do.  I would not dare suggest to the Minister the best way to do this because I know he has to go to what was known in my time as &ldquo;the Gestapo&rdquo; in the Department of Finance to get this permission.  He should find out what they would make available in order to compensate the men and women who give their time freely in the work of local government.  It is disgraceful that when the pressures of life are so difficult they have to spend a full day at a county council meeting for a meagre few pence to cover their petrol costs, etc.</P>
      <P>Communication is the spice of trade and there is no adequate provision in this Bill to compensate councillors for the cost of postage.  There is nothing in the Second Schedule to suggest that any means by which compensation could be made for the normal use of the telephone system.  The day of a county councillor is not finished when the county council meeting is over.  Often they must go to meetings of community councils, estate meetings, drainage meetings, political party meetings.  They do not expect to get any remuneration for political party meetings because if that happened we would all be annihilated.  Their home life is disturbed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is, on the face of it, the relatively simple and straightforward one of statutorily underpinning a holding company formed on behalf of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. However, the Bill also forms part of the basis for the action taken by the Government in the past fortnight to avoid the collapse of a large insurance company.</P>
      <P>In my contribution, I intend to concentrate on both the general background and the specific circumstances which gave rise to the legislation now before the House.  I will be commenting on the serious problems of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland which have come to light in recent weeks together with the attendant implications for the Allied Irish Banks Group, the choices open to the Government and the corrective action taken to deal with these particular difficulties, and the arrangements likely to be made to enable the insurance company to be restored to a sound financial footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to start by referring to the position of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  We are dealing with an established company of almost 50 years' standing trading in a market in which they had long experience.  In these respects they differed from a newly authorised undertaking or a relatively recent entrant to the non-life insurance market, in which case the supervisory process applied involves particularly close monitoring of operations over the formative years of the enterprise concerned.  Furthermore, <Col N="1727" /> ICI were a company whose state was satisfactory over a long period of years. The company were trading normally, had a consistent track record of steady profitability and were disclosing a very comfortable surplus of assets over the required solvency margin.  Prior to 1984 they had a broadly based board of directors representative of their various share-holding interests; these included American and Dutch insurance interests and other institutional investors, including Allied Irish Banks.  Since September 1983 ICI were under the full control and ownership of AIB.</P>
    <P>I should explain briefly at this stage, firstly, the responsibility and competence of insurance supervisory authorities under EC law and, secondly, the system of supervision applied by my Department.</P>
    <P>On the first point, the position is that all insurers operating in the EC are subject to specific financial and other requirements laid down by EC directives which harmonise basic insurance supervision throughout all member states.  The relevant directive deals with the situation where a company headquartered in one member state may, in accordance with the freedom of establishment under the Treaty, extend by way of simple branch operation into another member state. That directive makes the supervision of the branch activities the responsibility of the supervisory authority of the member state in which the branch is located, while the supervisory authority of the head office must oversee the solvency of the global activities of the company.  In order to perform the latter function, however, the head office supervisor is dependent on the branch supervisor to vet and examine the accounts of the branch which feed into the head office accounts.  That is the system laid down by the EC and, while there is provision for co-operation between member states, the formal Protocol of Collaboration clearly recognises the division of competences between supervisory authorities as provided for by the directive.  In the case of the London <Col N="1728" /> branch of ICI, the appropriate supervisory authority was the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK.</P>
    <P>As regards the system of supervision employed in Ireland, my Department receive the accounts of insurers annually and undertake detailed analysis of the information supplied in relation to the different classes of insurers' business. The examination undertaken by my Department does not and cannot substitute for the role of statutory auditors.  It would be unreasonable to expect that the State should provide resources to double-check on the work done by auditors.  My Department's work is, rather, an independent outside test on the information supplied.  This is in line with the supervisory practice for insurance internationally.</P>
    <P>Arising from the tests applied to ICI, my Department began to be concerned about the adequacy of the technical claims reserves set up by the company in relation to their Irish business.  During 1983 the Department communicated formally to ICI their concern at this particular aspect of the company's operations. The company indicated in reply that they had learned that they had not made adequate allowance for the development of some very large cases which worsened unexpectedly; they had strengthened reserves to make additional allowance for this type of potential development and they hoped that the provisions would prove adequate.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the assurance of the company, the Department decided to examine the 1983 accounts of ICI on a priority basis when received.  These accounts were duly submitted on 26 June 1984.  Based on the 1983 accounts as submitted, ICI held free assets of £56 million, equivalent to a surplus of 124 per cent over and above the statutory solvency margin required.</P>
    <P>Following their analysis of these accounts in July 1984, the Department were not satisfied that adequate provision was made in the company's 1983 accounts for outstanding claims on their Irish business. This aspect of the accounting returns was gone into in considerable <Col N="1729" /> detail at a meeting between the Department and company representatives on 17 August 1984.  The responses of the ICI representatives at that meeting were considered inadequate by the Department, and the company were requested to provide further detailed information on the outstanding claims provisions struck for Irish business.  My Department had already decided to engage a firm of consulting actuaries to undertake an examination of the Irish technical claims reserves of ICI.  Discussions between the Department and the firm in question tok place in September 1984.  The study commenced in early October, and representatives of AIB and ICI were formally advised of this at a meeting with my Department on 14 November 1984.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the meeting in November 1984 was to discuss the insurance company's results contained in the interim report of the Allied Irish Banks Group for the half year ended 30 September 1984, which were being released at that time.  At the meeting in question, it was indicated to my Department that AIB had decided to strengthen the outstanding claims provisions of ICI by £23 million as at 30 June 1984, and that the bank would be taking immediate action to strengthen the capital base of the insurance company arising from this depletion of its free reserves.  The specific question of the London branch business of ICI was raised at the meeting also, and the Department was assured that while there were problems with the London branch, corrective measures were being taken to rectify matters; furthermore, there was no under-reserving apparent in the London claims reserves.</P>
    <P>In December 1984 the issued share capital of ICI was increased by £40 million, of which £30 million was fully paid up by AIB.  Subsequently, in a report dated January 1985, the actuarial firm engaged by my Department confirmed that the reserves of ICI in relation to their Irish business, as strengthened, were adequate.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, the above facts speak for themselves.  In relation to their supervisory functions my Department acted <Col N="1730" /> quickly and with diligence in recognising the claims reserving problems facing ICI on their Irish business, following which corrective action by way of identifying the shortfall and a substantial injection of fresh capital took place in December 1984.  Although not directly within their area of supervisory competence, my Department also raised questions with AIB and ICI representatives in relation to the London branch operations of the insurance company, and received assurances that there was no under-reserving of London business, and furthermore that corrective measures to improve the current trading experience of the London branch were being implemented.  The Department of Trade and Industry in the United Kingdom had not communicated any concerns to my Department in relation to the UK branch business of ICI. Given this fact and in the light of the reassurances received from AIB and ICI at the meeting in November 1984, my Department had no reason to question matters further at that stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to make clear that I am not imputing any dereliction of supervisory functions on the part of the United Kingdom supervisory authority.  Indeed, I understand that the UK branch accounts of ICI for 1983 disclosed a surplus of some £19 million sterling in admissible assets over branch liabilities.  Furthermore, the UK branch accounts were not qualified in any respect by the statutory auditors.</P>
    <P>It is clear in the relatively short space of time that has elapsed since November 1984, that there were serious problems with the former London branch business of ICI in particular, about which the former owners were, seemingly, unaware and which had not come to light at that stage.</P>
    <P>New auditors were appointed to ICI in mid-December 1984.  Detailed audit work got under way in January 1985 and by early February the auditors realised that there were serious deficiencies in the information systems and data base covering the London branch operations of ICI.  Once AIB were advised of this, they immediately ordered an accelerated <Col N="1731" /> programme by a special investigating team to establish as far as possible the true financial position of ICI's London branch.</P>
    <P>By the first week of March 1985 the results of this investigation had led AIB to conclude that ICI had very serious problems with their London branch operation.  AIB notified both the Central Bank and my Department of the position at separate meetings on Friday, 8 March. By letter dated 15 March 1985 the board of ICI notified me that they had concluded that as at 31 December 1984 the company did not comply with the requirements of the European Communities (Non-Life Insurance) Regulations in a material respect, and that this position still obtained.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the ultimate decision reached by the Government in relation to the problems of ICI, I would like to state that I consider that the management of AIB acted promptly and responsibly in bringing the matter to the attention of my Department.  I have to say more than this, however.  It is almost incomprehensible and more than a little disquieting that it apparently took so long for senior management in both ICI and AIB to begin to realise that there might be fundamental problems with the London branch operations of the insurance company, which after all accounted for about 70 per cent of total business in gross terms.  This is even more difficult to understand when one considers that problems had arisen within the head office operations of ICI in Ireland, and corrective measures were taken during 1984.</P>
    <P>The facts are far from clear at this stage, and it is difficult to say how much of the London branch's problems arose while AIB were a minority shareholder and how much actually arose during 1984, at which stage ICI were under the full control and ownership of AIB.  It is obvious that a serious lack of management control, particularly in relation to the flow of information between London and Dublin, contributed in no small measure to the present problem.  If the <Col N="1732" /> problem had been spotted and the position established at an earlier date, then the magnitude of the present difficulties would not be as great.  The belated realisation that there were problems in London is, therefore, all the more disappointing.</P>
    <P>The problem which came to light in ICI was one which called for urgent, firm and decisive action.  The Government decided on 15 March 1985 to acquire ICI from Allied Irish Banks Group for a nominal sum by a company controlled by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  The provisions applying to this holding company, Sealúchais Árachais Teoranta, form the greater part of the Bill now before this House.  On a petition from me under the Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1983, an administrator was appointed provisionally by the High Court to take over the business of ICI on the evening of 15 March, and the High Court confirmed the order for administration at a sitting on Monday 25 March.  The purpose of the takeover and administration of ICI was to ensure the continuation of the insurance business and the protection of all policy holders.</P>
    <P>The Government decision offered the best solution to the problems which arose within ICI and which could have had serious implications for the insurance market generally.  Other companies in the market could not readily have absorbed the market share held by ICI, particularly in the critically important employer and public liability classes.  Furthermore, it was the view of the Government that it would not be feasible for the parent company, Allied Irish Banks, to undertake the additional financial commitment and other reorganisation measures required to restore ICI to an even keel; the bank could not prudently persist in the attempt to resolve the problems of ICI without the risk of adverse effects on their banking operations.</P>
    <P>The placing of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland under administration, and the funding of that operation, are covered by existing legislation, that is, the Insurance Act, 1964, and the Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1983.  These acts provide the statutory powers for the <Col N="1733" /> appointment of the administrator by the High Court on the petition of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and for the provision of moneys from the insurance compensation fund to enable the administrator to carry on the business of the company as a going concern. I would remind the House that the administrator is appointed by, and carries out his duties under the supervision of, the High Court.  The insurance compensation fund is administered by the accountant of the High Court under that court's jurisdiction.  The entire process of administration, therefore, is under the control of the court.</P>
    <P>Pending the completion of the full investigation of the company now being undertaken under the direction of the administrator, it is difficult to say with certainty where the blame lies for the problems facing the company.  However, I have already referred to the lack of adequate information systems and of management control, particularly in relation to the London branch of the company. It appears that the information supplied by the London branch to their supervisory authority and to their head office in Dublin did not reflect the true position of the business being transacted in the branch.  The investigation now in progress is intended to establish how far the true position differs from the reported position.</P>
    <P>The problems which have come to light in this case clearly raise the most serious questions about the role of management, of directors, shareholders and of auditors of companies.  The chain of responsibility is clear.  The primary responsibility for ensuring the satisfactory conduct of company affairs lies with the shareholders and is exercised through the directors and management of the company.  The secondary responsibility for the correct presentation of the financial activities and standing of any company rests on the auditors.  In the case of the more important financial institutions, such as insurance and banking, the State has a tertiary responsibility.  The tertiary responsibility must obviously involve the State, through <Col N="1734" /> its various agencies, in laying down certain minimum standards and in assessing the adequacy of the systems and the competence of the persons involved in the first and second stages of responsibility. The State's role also involves, in the case of insurance, examination of the information supplied by insurers and audited as required by statute.</P>
    <P>The failings which have been disclosed in the present case confirm the need to proceed quickly with a redefinition of the statutory responsibilities of directors and of auditors.  The Government have already approved the provisions to be included in a major reform of companies legislation and drafting has been proceeding apace.  I have directed that those aspects of the full Bill which are of special relevance to the points which I have been making should now be finalised as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In addition to the changes in the area of company responsibility, I will also be giving special attention to an assessment of the supervisory role of my own Department. This will involve a full review of the frequency and quality of the information required from insurers and of the technical capacity of my Department to assess such information.  I am particularly concerned that my Department should have available to it in-house actuarial expertise in the examination of accounts and other information supplied by insurers.  I might add that the non-life insurance industry in general could also benefit from much greater use of expertise of this type which has tended to date to be concentrated in life assurance companies.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to speak in definitive terms about the precise financial position of ICI.  The company audit is in progress and the administrator estimates that it will take at least six weeks to clarify matters.  Based on the company's own draft unaudited accounts, it appears that losses in 1984 will amount to at least £65 million resulting in a minimum deficit of £25 million in the shareholders' funds in the company balance sheet.</P>
    <P>At this point, I should like to make it clear that one should be extremely wary <Col N="1735" /> of various amounts which have been bandied about.  Such figures are speculative and some of the orders of magnitude are so astronomical as to be totally unrealistic. Such speculation as there has been about possible losses in the company has not been based on the information derived by those who have examined the company's affairs.  That information, from those who have been in the company, is the only sound basis on which any decisions can be made.</P>
    <P>While I have stressed that the information available is not definitive, the Government had to act on the basis of the best information available from those who examined the company's affairs from within.  This information indicates that the losses incurred in London fall within the range of £50 million to £120 million.  I have to stress that I mention £120 million as an upper limit of losses and not in any circumstances as the most likely figure.  These figures are, of course, based on reinsurance contracts being sustained as it must be assumed they will be.</P>
    <P>Any financial assistance required by the administrator of ICI will be channelled through the insurance compensation fund.  Until such time as the exact financial position of the company is clarified, it is pointless to speak other than in general terms about the likely funding requirements. However, for the purposes of the administration of ICI, the compensation fund will be financed by funds provided by the Central Bank in conjunction with the banking system generally.  The Central Bank have indicated their willingness to provide this funding within the dimensions of the problem which I have indicated and subject to reassessment by the Government of the position at the end of 1985.  Sufficient funding will be provided to deal with the problem as it arises so as to obviate the need for recourse to the Exchequer.  As the Minister for Finance made clear during the Dáil debate last week, the Central Bank will be discussing with Allied Irish Banks and the other licensed banks the appropriate form and apportionment of this funding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> As a result of the helpful decision of the Central Bank last week to involve themselves in the funding arrangements, the prospect of direct Exchequer funding is, to all intents and purposes, removed. This welcome development is entirely in line with the Government's objective to ensure that, if at all possible, the ordinary taxpayer would not have to pay towards the rescue of ICI.</P>
    <P>An important focus on this whole debate is the extent of the contribution by Allied Irish Banks to the rescue of ICI.  As the owner of ICI they should, in the normal course, meet the entire cost. In fact they are contributing as follows. First, AIB will make a loan of £50 million, for a period of three years at a rate four percentage points below the three-year gilt rate, to the Central Bank.  This is equivalent to an interest subsidy of £2 million per year.  AIB have further agreed that, should the emerging position and the reassessment at the end of this year warrant it, they are prepared to extend the term of this loan facility for a further period not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>Second, AIB have agreed to place a non-interest bearing deposit of £20 million with the Central Bank to cover the contingent liability being assumed by the State in respect of the AIB's guarantee to the Institute of London Underwriters. This is worth £3 million a year at current interest rates.</P>
    <P>Third, AIB have agreed to share with the Government, in proportions to be determined when the ultimate losses are known, the proceeds of the bank's action against the former auditors of ICI.</P>
    <P>Fourth, AIB have paid a purchase price of £2½ million for Credit Finance Bank, which they had &ldquo;sold&rdquo; to the Government with ICI for £5.</P>
    <P>Fifth, AIB sold their 20 per cent share-holding in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland Life, a healthy and profitable company, for £5 also.</P>
    <P>Finally, AIB will be required to contribute in proportion to the additional funding package to be co-ordinated under the auspices of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The total of £70 million provided by AIB to the Central Bank will be passed <Col N="1737" /> on to the insurance compensation fund to finance the operations of the administrator of ICI.  These funds will, of course, be entirely separate from the moneys already in the fund and the continuing 2 per cent contributions which are helping to finance the administration of the PMPA.</P>
    <P>With regard to the arrangements which I have outlined for financing the administration of ICI, there are a number of general points to be made.  I understand that the company have good liquidity at present and that the need for a substantial cash injection is not foreseen in the immediate future.  The losses will not all have to be made good in any one year in that finance will be required according as claims fall due to be paid over a period. The administrator will use his commercial judgment as to how to obtain the best return for the company from the assets available to him.  There has, of course, been debate as to the amount which should be paid by AIB.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank, whose job it is to assure the soundness of our banking system, were involved in the discussions leading to the decision to rescue ICI. Their strong view, as a regulator of the banking industry, was that the contribution by the bank that I have already outlined was the limit of what AIB could prudently be expected to make at this time.  The Central Bank were also most anxious that there should be certainty about AIB's liabilities, as uncertainty would be damaging to the bank and to the financial system generally.  The Government and this House must give due weight to the advice of the Central Bank which has been charged by both Houses of the Oireachtas with the responsibility of ensuring the soundness of the banking system.</P>
    <P>If the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, a wholly owned subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks, had gone into liquidation this would have had consequences for the bank itself as well.  In such circumstances, the terms on which the bank itself could then borrow money would immediately be affected.  If this happened all of those who borrowed from the bank would also <Col N="1738" /> suffer.  We have rescued not the shareholders of the AIB, but its customers, the public at large and the policyholders of the ICI.</P>
    <P>If ICI had been left in AIB's ownership, the continuing uncertainty as to the bank's potential liabilities, and the resultant speculation, would have held many dangers for the bank.  Other proposed solutions, involving meetings of financial institutions generally or an extraordinary general meeting of the bank, would have lacked the confidentiality and the speed necessary for an effective rescue.  This ruled out some other solutions to the problem which might otherwise have been attractive.</P>
    <P>AIB remain a strong financial institution, despite the heavy losses which they incurred on the ICI fiasco.  The AIB board have announced that they will maintain their dividend despite the losses.  While I personally regard this as a somewhat insensitive announcement, highlighting the bank's much greater concern for shareholders than for the policyholders with the ICI or for the general public, I am advised that a cut in dividend would be taken in the stock markets here and abroad as a signal &mdash; in this case false &mdash; that the underlying strength of the AIB was somewhat damaged.  Confidence of this kind is very important in international financial circles.  As a country which borrows substantially abroad, it is vital that our financial institutions be seen to be strong.</P>
    <P>I believe that I need refer only briefly at this stage to the provisions in the Bill. Sections 2 to 13 are standard provisions in relation to State companies.  In this case, Sealúchais Árachais Teoranta is merely a holding company which will hold the shares in ICI on behalf of the Minister.  The directors of the company are two officials of my Department and the company will have no employees. Neither will it have effective authority over ICI, which will remain fully under the control of the administrator, who is answerable to the court.</P>
    <P>Section 14 of the Bill empowers the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to guarantee up to a limit of <Col N="1739" /> £20 million ICI's liabilities in respect of marine business underwritten on or before 15 March 1985 by virtue of the insurance company's membership of the Institute of London Underwriters.  The marine business involved is sound and of good quality.  The State has undertaken a contingent liability in respect of a guarantee covering the institute business written by ICI up to the date of sale of the insurance company by AIB, at which time their membership of the institute terminated automatically on change of ownership.  It is extremely unlikely that the guarantee will be called upon.  The additional exposure arising in respect of the marine business involved is put at an extreme of £20 million.  AIB have already deposited £20 million interest free with the Central Bank to cover the State's exposure in respect of the guarantee.  In the event of any liability arising in excess of designated reserves, the amount involved will be deducted from the £20 million before the balance is repaid to AIB.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is consequent on section 14, and provides that any advances under the latter section shall be from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill contains minor amendments to the Insurance Act, 1964 so as to allow for the creation of priorities on the insurance compensation fund; and also to permit the High Court, before approving payments out of the fund, to have regard to the state of solvency of the fund.  These amendments are of a technical nature only.  The remaining sections of the Bill are standard ones.</P>
    <P>The steps which have been taken by the Government to deal with the ICI problem will permit the recovery of Allied Irish Banks from the setback which it has suffered.  This is essential for the wellbeing of the economy as a whole. It is important to bear in mind that financial institutions depend on trust and can operate properly and effectively only in an atmosphere of confidence and calm. Those who indulge in uninformed speculation about the affairs of financial institutions, wherever they do so, should be acutely conscious of the possible damage <Col N="1740" /> that they may cause by their very indulgence in this speculation.  This applies to the banking and insurance industries alike, and I am sure that in debating this Bill today all Members of this House will maintain a responsible attitude in the national interest.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, will endeavour, as we did in Dáil Éireann, to debate this matter in a very responsible manner in the best interests of the nation.  Having said that, it does not follow that I agree totally with all of what the Minister has said.  There are many points in his speech I do not fully agree with and I will elaborate as I proceed.</P>
      <P>First, I should like to make a point which will be made by many people, the man in the street, business people or whatever.  If, for example, an ordinary customer of Allied Irish Banks sought to borrow £20,000 or £50,000 for a particular project, or for the purchase of a house, or a business premises, the bank would examine the client and the project in very great detail.  The AIB like other banking institutions have great expertise in particular areas.  They have trained personnel to fully examine accounts, balance sheets and records of companies.</P>
      <P>It is painfully obvious that this expertise did not pertain when Allied Irish Banks purchased ICI.  We all know that if anything went wrong with the type of customer I described, the bank would be very tough indeed and would bring him to court to get their money back, as indeed would any other financial institution.  It seems to me that in this case Allied Irish Banks, despite all the expertise I have mentioned, bought a pig in a poke.  The Government, in a panic measure, bought the same pig in a poke without having any concept of the size of that animal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allied Irish Banks said they made a competitive bid as if to suggest in some way that there was a private action. Obviously, we know now that was not the case at all.  Mr. Scanlan from Allied Irish Banks, made the point that this competitive bid did not entitle them to <Col N="1741" /> put in their people, as it were, to examine the company beforehand.  He suggested that it was bought on the basis that it looked good, that it had a good growth record, that it was the sixth most profitable public company in the country.</P>
    <P>I would have to suggest that, from a bank like the Allied Irish, or from any institution of their size and importance, that is simply not good enough.  It is not good enough to say it looked good and had a good track record.  They should have investigated the company to the fullest extent before purchasing it.  Even after buying the company &mdash; we are told by the Minister that accounts will be available in six weeks from 15 March &mdash; if they were not happy they should have made an onslaught on the affairs of the company.  They should have sent in their actuarial and other experts to find out about the company.  It was quite clear two years before AIB bought the ICI that there were real problems within that company, particularly at that stage with the Lime Street, London office of the company.  The kind of operation that the London office were engaged in was in speculating on whether Wrexham would get into the third division or re-insurance on Australian bush fires and high risk satellite and bloodstock insurance, of which they knew little.  Many of these areas, I would have to suggest, were more appropriate and more suitable for Corals or for Ladbrookes, but certainly it seems that the mistake was made by AIB in not finding out more about the company.</P>
    <P>The reports are fairly freely available that all was not well long before AIB bought the company and they should have taken note.  We know from 1981, in the London office in particular, the kind of mad, fast growth that the company had.  There were worrying signs.  Brokers were given, we know, binding authority to accept risks which clearly left the ICI very vulnerable to obvious claims and to huge increases in business over which they would have very little control.  We know too that the ICI in London have acted as a front for other re-insurers accepting business and then passing it on <Col N="1742" /> to other insurers to reduce the risk.  This is a very vulnerable area which could cost the company very dearly in the future because as we know claims will continue to come.  It takes years for claims to pass on.  A claim reported today may not be paid for five years.  An incident may have happened a year ago and may not be even reported until now.  That is the kind of situation.</P>
    <P>Generally, the affairs of the ICI London office over the past five or six years have been in a deplorable state, reinsuring, as they were, in 15 or 16 countries of the world.  This was common knowledge long before AIB bought the company.  Why did they not have, as we would expect, a full investigation before getting involved?  I will go further and say why I think the proposals suggested now are at least realistic, and I do not wish to upset the apple cart.  My own opinion and that of many, many people is that AIB should carry the can for the mistakes they made.</P>
    <P>It is very unsatisfactory.  We do not know still the amount of the outstanding liabilities.  I am very mindful of what the Minister has said, not to be speculative on this area and I do not wish to be.  I just know no more than the Minister knows.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, last week and again today the Minister, Deputy Collins, have referred to the fact that it could be between £50 and £120 million.  London experts perhaps can be believed and perhaps they cannot.  I do not know.  They are setting the figure as high as £500 million and even higher.</P>
    <P>Whatever the figure, I find it very hard to believe that AIB would renege on a figure as low as the figure suggested by the Minister.  I feel that they would have stayed with the problem.  They would have endeavoured to sort out the problem of ICI, rather than lose the confidence of the financial world, as they have since 15 March.</P>
    <P>Last November <i>Business and Finance Magazine</i> outlined the alarming details of the ICI problem.  I do not think the Government paid any heed to these rumours.  I know rumours are things you <Col N="1743" /> do not heed, but these were so widespread and such common knowledge for very responsible people that I think they should have been heeded.  We were hearing rumours for a long time about PMPA until finally the collapse happened.  It was bound to happen in this case also.  There was no action on the part of the Government. The inactivity was all too obvious and certainly they should have acted much more quickly.</P>
    <P>We have heard of the rescue package. It has been outlined here by the Minister. I do feel that the suggestion that Deputy Haughey came up with was very intelligent and responsible and I am glad the Government have accepted his suggestion of the manner in which the whole problem can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Many people around the country feel as I do that AIB should have taken full responsibility.  It is immoral that they should have £85 million of pre-tax profits and that they should have dividends of £16 million available for the shareholders. I know that the problems are there for shareholders and the Minister has outlined them.  The manner in which the problem is now being solved is agreed and accepted and we go along with that. I hope that it works.  Again, the fact that the rescue package is so different from what was first suggested highlights the total confusion of the Government in this matter.  Certainly, many people &mdash; and I am included &mdash; feel that the Government acted in haste, that they panicked.  It can be said that there is still a degree of panic in the area of Government in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank have been involved in this rescue package in a very practical and real way, but could I ask the Minister am I to assume that the Central Bank are involved for up to the figures that he quotes of £120 million?  Is that the top of the pile, as it were, for which the Central Bank will underwrite the business or the losses, and if they do reach the astronomical figures that have been suggested &mdash; and which we all hope are only figures pulled out of the air &mdash; will they stay with the problem or will it be back to the <Col N="1744" /> Government and the taxpayer or what? I do not know what will happen if claims for losses continue to pour in.  This should be and must be thrashed out.  I again do not wish to highlight it but even on Sunday on radio we had a gentleman from Insurance Solvency International making the point that this had been a very badly run company for years, that there had been serious problems and that on the latest report the ICI difficulties could take years to run off.  Are the Central Bank going to stay with the problem for as long as it takes, or for as much as it takes?  Perhaps the Minister would make a comment on that.</P>
    <P>In addition, of course, to the direct insurance, we have in London the re-insurance. There they were operating on a re-insurance and a direct insurance.  We seem to have no concept whatsoever of the losses from London.  Despite what the Minister says regarding the quality of checking insurance companies &mdash; and I support his view that there should be a greater amount of attention paid to the examination of accounts &mdash; I would have to say to him, even forgetting the London office for a moment, that it is common knowledge that, in the Dublin office of the ICI as recently as last November at a meeting of staff and some management during the ICI strike, the ICI in Dublin had reduced quite dramatically their estimate for outstanding claims.  A figure, I believe, was suggested of 40 per cent.  If that is the case, why was that done?  Was it investigated and if it is true can the Minister comment on it?</P>
    <P>I find it unbelievable that AIB would walk away from a debt as low as £50 million to £120 million.  How can the AIB say they are going to write off £80 million and then the subsequent low interest loans of £70 million, knowing that by walking away they could be doing severe damage to the reputation of the company?  For a figure like that I believe that rather than walking away they should have stayed because the damage to their standing and reputation will be enormous.  We know that the share prices and the value of the company generally have dropped considerably.  My <Col N="1745" /> contention is that they should have stayed with it, they should have endeavoured to put together a package to protect their good name, to get the ICI out of their problems.  A rescue package could have been worked out by AIB in conjunction with expert people and finance groups around the country.  There were many options open to them which have been repeated many times since the collapse. That is what should have happened.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to what the ICI regard as the jewel of the company, namely Insurance Corporation Life.  The management and staff, consisting of about 100, are obviously very anxious to clarify the status of their company in the light of the appointment of the administrator. It is a well known fact in insurance circles that this company were doing extremely well, that they had profits last year of £3.2 million, that they had very good senior management and were a company which people looked up to.  It is shocking that they should now come under the same umbrella as ICI.  For Insurance Corporation Life the situation is that the brokers and the insuring public generally are not happy.  The company will not progress as they have in the past unless something positive is done.  This could have formed part of the package that I referred to because this company would certainly be worth anything from £18 million to £22 million.  They could well have been involved in the overall package to save ICI by the AIB if they had the goodwill to get down and to do that particular job.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the 2 per cent compensation fund.  We want an assurance that there will be no increase.  This was introduced in October, 1983 at the time of the collapse of the PMPA and it applies to all non-life premiums.  It is a most unfair situation.  Whilst it was there for a specific purpose &mdash; the collapse of a motor insurance company &mdash; it is now most unfair that all old age pensioners, and persons with modest private houses, should have to pay an extra 2 per cent on their fire premiums to bail out a company who went out of business because of their own mismanagement.  There is not alone <Col N="1746" /> the granny or the old age pensioner's premium but the industrialist may be paying as high as £200,000 or £300,000 for his premiums, his motor and employer's liability, public liability and fire.  It is certainly eating into companies' profits.  I ask the Minister to guarantee no increase in the levy.  It is high enough.  I hope sometime it will be eliminated and that the public generally would have cheaper insurance as a result.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the problems of the industry.  The employer's liability section and the public liability section in particular, are in a chaotic situation at present.  I read that the small firms association claim that some of their members are paying as much as £1,000 and £1,500 per employee, a situation that has got out of hand in quite a short space of time.  It is almost impossible to get any size of heavy risk placed for employer's liability or public liability, even the type of risk for which a few years ago, I would venture to suggest, companies would charge a nominal premium, for example, the Department of Labour team work scheme or the Department of Labour new social insurance scheme.  They will experience difficulty in operating because community groups will find it extremely difficult to get the cover they require. This is something the Government will have to examine.</P>
    <P>A chaotic situation has developed in the insurance industry.  I have said before that it is my contention that this country is fast becoming uninsurable, not just in the employer's liability, public liability and the motor insurance areas, but even in regard to household policies which, up to a few years ago, was the real profit making area for insurance companies. They are losing hand over fist at present with burglary claims mounting; premiums are shooting up a pace with the number of claims being made.</P>
    <P>This is nothing new to the Government. These problems have been highlighted many times by different people. The root cause of the problem &mdash; in so far as the motor, employer's liability and public liability insurance are concerned &mdash; is the jury system about which we <Col N="1747" /> have been talking since 15 March.  The Minister, in his speech in the Dáil, indicated an intended modification of the jury system.  There is the uncertainty of the jury system.  Juries are not alone granting inconsistent huge awards at present but are also deciding on liability. I have seen cases where there could be no liability.  Yet when such cases go to court a huge award is given.  I spoke to a person who was on a jury that gave a decree for £63,000.  I asked how it was computed.  One man said £93,000, another said £63,000, another said £48,000 and they took the middle one; there was no expertise whatever in deciding. That type of award is contributing to the size of the premiums and to the losses generally in the insurance business.</P>
    <P>It is well known that insurance companies &mdash; and I refer to the liability aspect even if there is no liability &mdash; will endeavour to settle rather than let a case go to the High Court before a jury.  That is why I welcome the Minister's statement of an intended modification of the system.  What the modification will mean I do not know.  We know that the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure are currently considering a recommendation that the judge should give a recommendation, a direction or some form of guideline to juries on the scale of an award to be made.  This was very strongly recommended in the report of the committee set up by the then Minister, Deputy John Kelly, in 1983, the Motor Premium Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>I would suggest giving the Circuit Court unlimited jurisdiction.  In this way we would have a much better system. There would be no jury.  There would be some degree of consistency on the part of judges.  There would be less than half of the legal fees and cases would move much faster to the court.  Unless something is done, and done quickly, there is no doubt that there will be massive increases in motor insurance, employer's liability and public liability insurance premiums. There will be major underwriting losses.  Insurance companies will go out <Col N="1748" /> of business and those with branch offices here will pull away from the Irish scene.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given much consideration to the examination of company accounts, something I welcome.  At the time of the PMPA collapse I said that if the same auditors who examined Vehicle and General in England had examined the PMPA the PMPA would have been asked to stop trading.  Obviously a much more detailed examination by the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism is urgently required. I am delighted that this is happening.</P>
    <P>What many people are asking now is if further companies will collapse.  I hope not.  Four or five weeks ago, in reply to Deputy Flynn the Minister indicated that all was well.  I have no doubt but that the Minister said that in good faith in the light of the information he had on his desk.  That is all the more reason why the investigations into companies affairs must be done with all haste.  The PMPA and the ICI are both huge loss makers. When one examines the blue book for 1983 it shows both the ICI and the PMPA as the biggest loss makers.  There are two huge loss makers and two Government administrators.  Will the Government endeavour to amalgamate both companies under one administrator?  Is this at the back of the mind of the Government? Perhaps the Minister will comment? Since 15 March it has been a very sad story for many people.  I am delighted that a solution has been found and that the Government have accepted the Fianna Fáil policies in regard to solving this problem.</P>
    <P>It is a very sad reflection on business generally.  While it is commonplace nowadays to belabour politicians for their incompetence and ineptitude, in some cases with some justification, ineptitude is not the prerogative of politicians.  The ICI debacle raises all kinds of questions about the calibre of the people in the highest echelons of commercial life.  The problem of the ICI will not end with the passing of this Bill, but I hope I am wrong.</P>
    <P>It is a bit of an insult to expect the <Col N="1749" /> Seanad to pass this Bill without knowing the true financial liabilities, but being a responsible Opposition we will help to protect the good name of the financial and insurance arms of our society.  I hope that the doubts I have about many aspects of the ICI affair will prove to have no foundation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OMahony" hpid="Mr. O'Mahony Mr. O'Mahony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Mahony</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us agree that we are faced with a debacle of the first rank in dealing with this matter.  I was interested to hear Senator Fallon claim credit on behalf of Fianna Fáil for the arrangements made last Thursday whereby the Central Bank will at least in the initial period fund potential liabilities of ICI.  I would remind the Senator and the Fianna Fáil Party that the internal reserves of the Central Bank, from which it would appear from briefings given by the Minister for Finance that the initial moneys will come, are public moneys. Until such time as we see whether or not the licensed banks will contribute towards the repayment of any loans put up by the Central Bank and until we see how much of any such loans from the Central Bank are paid by the licensed banks we will not know who will pay for the ICI liabilities.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that, following in the wake of the PMPA disaster and taking that in conjunction with the whole series of private sector company closures in recent years, the collapse of ICI demolishes once and for all the theory that private companies are better managed than their public sector counterparts. Patently they are not, a fact which is no consolation to any of us.  It is worth reiterating a point of view, which is, that the quality of management in this society is appallingly poor and something to which we must turn our minds with more intensity than we have in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beyond that comment on the failure of management, one can only be appalled at the level of hypocrisy demonstrated by the management of private sector companies which fall into difficulty.  In many cases the people who privately decry the role of the State in economic affairs are the first to come cap in hand to the <Col N="1750" /> Government to be bailed out when problems arise.  In many respects that is what has happened in the case of ICI and its parent company AIB.  AIB made an appallingly bad decision in deciding to buy ICI.  In addition they allowed the problem to run on for at least 12 months after they must have become aware that they had unusually acute difficulties to face.  They consistently underestimated the scale of ICI problems, certainly since the period March 1984.  Yet they had the gall to put the gun to the Government's head, at one week's notice, when they decided to get out of ICI early in March of this year.  In behaving in this way, in demonstrating such a combination of ineptitude and arrogance, they were behaving no differently than the management of many privately owned Irish companies. They should have behaved differently.  After all, AIB is the largest financial institution in the State and one of the largest private companies.  Their responsibility to act prudently and competently was overwhelming, given their role in the financial system; yet they did not do so.</P>
    <P>I will concentrate now on two principal aspects of the matter.  First, the question of why the scale of the ICI problem was not identified sooner by the ICI and AIB and, second, the response of the Government when AIB came to them early in March of this year.  There can be no doubt that AIB made a major mistake in purchasing ICI.  For some inexplicable reason their decision to purchase ICI in September 1983 appears to have been based on the historical performance of ICI rather than the current position of the company.  The ICI showed underwriting losses of over £7 million in 1982 after a first ever underwriting loss of £422,000 in 1981.  In 1982 the underwriting loss of over £7 million was very significant in historical terms.  Even though it must be set against an investment income of £15 million in that year, which included some once-off gains, it should have set some serious warning bells ringing in the ears of AIB management.  At the very least, the 1982 ICI results should have led AIB <Col N="1751" /> to analyse thoroughly ICIs 1983 half-yearly performance prior to the acquisition of the enterprise and their entire shareholding in that company in September 1983.</P>
    <P>One can only conclude that AIB's lust for expansion and the new competitive spirit which had emerged between the Bank of Ireland and themselves, a state of affairs which in my view is detrimental to customers of both banks, made them blind to the requirements of even minimal prudence in their takeover bid for ICI.  The 1983 results for ICI, available in the early part of 1984, confirmed the downward trend in ICI's position.  Underwriting losses rose to £13.6 million, which was just about compensated for by an investment income of £15.9 million.  This superficial data alone which was available in March 1984 to AIB should have provoked a major and urgent investigation of the company's affairs by AIB.  Yet, apparently, it did not.</P>
    <P>When one looks beyond the superficial data, however, the degree of AIB's negligence in overseeing their wholly owned subsidiary becomes even more horrendous. It is quite clear from the 1983 ICI accounts that reserves and liabilities were underprovided relative to a very rapid and significant increase in premium income.  It became clear in March 1984 that the company were going hell for leather to increase business and premium income but were underproviding radically for this business in their insurance funds and liabilities.</P>
    <P>It appears from what the Minister said that the Department spotted this at the very earliest opportunity when the AIB accounts were made available to them in June 1984.  It must be said that AIB put aside £5.6 million in their group accounts of March 1984 against underprovision in ICI but, on the basis of ICI's 1983 performance, this could not in any way be seen as adequate provision.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I should like to raise a related matter of some significance.  AIB have indicated that they intend to sue ICI's former auditors.  Ernst and Whinney, in respect of their auditing of ICIs <Col N="1752" /> accounts prior to the take-over in 1983. It seems to me they are right to do so.</P>
    <P>However, another question arises at this stage.  AIB's own auditors, in preparing AIB's accounts for the year ended March 1984, had a responsibility to supervise and scrutinise the 1983 accounts of the ICI wholly owned subsidiary.  That scrutiny would normally include, at the very least, an arms length but thorough investigation of ICI by means of questionnaires and other means.  It would also, at the very least, involve a thorough examination of Ernst and Whinney's audit.</P>
    <P>Why then did AIB's auditors not insist that AIB make a greater sum than £5.6 million available for underprovision by ICI in the group's accounts of March 1984?  This is a mystery to me, given ICI's 1983 accounts and given what must have been known of the very rapid increase in ICI business in the previous years.</P>
    <P>Now that the Central Bank have taken on the key role in sorting this mess out, it seems to me it should call in AIB's auditors to find out how and why they allowed under-provision to continue in ICI beyond March 1984.  It may well be that they were subjected to pressure by ICI in this regard, perhaps because AIB wanted their group accounts to show the best possible results, but the fact remains that an explanation is required from AIB's auditors and I hope it will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Everything I have said so far concerning the management failure of AIB must be said with even greater vigour concerning the management and board of ICI.</P>
    <P>That company engaged in a programme of rapid expansion from about 1979 onwards, but, apparently, did so without building in adequate management control systems, information systems or provision against liabilities, particularly in the latter years.  It has been well known for some years that ICI have been undertaking high risks both domestically and in London in order to expand their business but the scale of these risks were either not known to the ICI management or they were prepared to tolerate them for reasons which are not explicable in purely business terms. <Col N="1753" /> In particular it is beyond comprehension that ICI knew so little about their London operation as late as the end of 1984 despite the fact that London accounted for 70 per cent of their gross business in that year.</P>
    <P>How can this have been?  How can the information flow from London to the Dublin headquarters have been so inadequate that ICI, and AIB, were able to say in November 1984 to officials of the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism that there was no under-reserving on London business? How can the information have been that bad, that incorrect, that irrelevant to the true position especially when the dog in the street in the insurance sector in London knew differently and when even officials in the relevant Department here suspected things to be different at arms length?</P>
    <P>It is noticeable that AIB, in their interim report for the half year ended 30 September 1984, set aside a further £17.4 million from group reserves to insurance claims provisions in ICI.  But the startling thing is, if one is to judge by comments of AIB's chief executive in a recent edition of <i>Business and Finance</i>, this provision was made in respect of domestic ICI business only, that is in respect of 30 per cent of ICI's total business.  If the domestic business representing 30 per cent of gross business income was seen to be in such bad shape in September 1984, why, in the name of commonsense, should there have been such complacency about the London business, which was not only larger in size but, as we know, in a far higher risk category?</P>
    <P>I cannot answer that question, nor can anyone else, apparently, least of all AIB. Was the information and financial control system in ICI of such a poor quality that no one in Dublin knew what was going on in London or were people in London disguising the true nature of their business in a situation of lax control generally? It would seem from what the Minister has said &mdash; it is the first time I have heard it put in those terms &mdash; that there does seem to be a suggestion now <Col N="1754" /> that the information supplied by the London branch, to quote the Minister:</P>
    <P>...to its supervisory authority and to its head office in Dublin did not reflect the true position of the business being transacted in the branch.</P>
    <P>That seems, if it is a new insertion into the debate to be an important one which has not been said as explicitly to date, if I interpreted the Minister's comments correctly.  Either way, whether it is that someone in London was sending back false information, or whether it is that the information control systems in ICI were so appallingly poor that they were not able to know what was happening in London, a sworn public inquiry into the London business seems to be called for. The Minister should see to it that this is initiated in an appropriate way irrespective of what funding arrangements are made regarding ICI's liabilities, assuming that such arrangements can be made at all.</P>
    <P>Finally, regarding ICI, there is one matter in regard to their accounts which puzzles me.  I am neither an accountant nor a financier and I may well be missing an obvious explanation through ignorance. Nevertheless, I have a duty to ask the question in the hope of a satisfactory answer.  In ICI's 1983 accounts, it is shown that executives or directors of that company were allowed to buy 158,000 &ldquo;A&rdquo; ordinary shares at a price of 320 pence each in September 1983 under a share scheme for executives approved at an extraordinary general meeting in March 1975.  The company advanced £96,000 to directors to enable them to purchase some or all of these shares. Presumably these were sold to AIB later in September at AIB's offer price of 350p a share, representing a small though not insignificant gain of £47,000 pre-tax.  In 1983 ICI accounts also indicate that, with the exercising of the option on these 158,000 shares, all share options under the 1975 share option scheme had then been exercised.  What puzzles me &mdash; there may well be an obvious answer which I am missing &mdash; is what happened to the options granted to executives to purchase <Col N="1755" /> 294,375 shares under the 1975 scheme, which options are mentioned in the 1980 accounts but which do not surface in subsequent accounts of ICI so far as I have been able to tell.  If these options were not taken up why are we told in the 1983 accounts that all options under the scheme had been exercised?  If they were taken up, the questions which arise are when were they taken up, by whom and at what price?  I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify this matter for me before the debate concludes.  There may be a straightforward explanation which I am missing.  In any event I would like to set my mind at rest in the matter.  I am not sure that share option schemes should apply in the financial and insurance sectors. The Minister might consider this matter at a future date.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the Government's response to the debacle when they were faced at very short notice with it by AIB. For the reasons I have given concerning the obvious, though gradual, build up of ICI's problems over the last two years and the degree of information which AIB must have had about the scale of these problems in London, at least for the past several months, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that AIB set out deliberately to panic the Government into a solution benign to themselves in the early part of March of this year.  The initial agreement made between the Government and AIB on 15 March was indeed benign to the banking institution concerned.  It comprised AIB's handing over an unknown quantity of ICI liabilities to the State through a State company in return for a preferential interest loan of £50 million over three years, valued at £2 million a year, and an interest-free loan of £20 million over one year, valued at £3 million. The deal was that the State in effect was to take on loans worth £70 million at preferential interest rates against liabilities which were and still are unknown. The net cost to AIB of the State potentially burying itself in significant quantities of debt was to be £9 million over three years.  One can add in the £2.4 million in respect of ICI Life, but it is not in the <Col N="1756" /> same category because that is still a viable concern.</P>
    <P>There was, of course, under the initial agreement to be a levy on banks and insurance companies to assist the State in meeting ICI's liabilities, whatever they might be, but the reality about such levies is that they are rapidly passed on to the consumer so that one way or another the taxpayer was going to be up-front so far as ICI's liabilities are concerned.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to make an important point which has been missed so far in the general discussion of this matter.  AIB and their apologists have made a great deal of the fact that they have already written off about £86 million on ICI.  Given the nature of our capital gains tax laws this is not strictly speaking the truth.  What they have done is generate a £36 million to £54 million capital gains tax loss which can be set against future capital gains taxes, perhaps after a decent interval has elapsed.  The real loss to AIB of selling ICI and its unknown liabilities to the Minister for £5 will at best be a £32 million loss, from AIB's point of view, and at worst a £56 million loss, depending on the rate of capital gains tax which will apply.  These are the real parameters of AIB's write-off loss, not the £86 million mentioned by them and their apologists but losses considerably less than this because of the nature of our capital gains tax laws.  I am sure that their tax consultants are already working on a suitable scheme to achieve this purpose.  I would urge the Minister to propose an amendment to the Bill to ensure that the Exchequer does not lose between £36 million and £54 million in capital gains tax in the next few years as a result of AIB's write off of their £86 million loss in ICI.</P>
    <P>As far as the arrangements announced last Thursday by the Minister for Finance in the other House are concerned, there is no doubt that these constitute an improvement on the initial position.  They lead to the further removal of the taxpayer from the long-run liabilities of ICI. I must reiterate the point I made at the beginning that if, as the Minister for Finance appears to have said in his briefing <Col N="1757" /> following his announcement, the Central Bank moneys which will be put up are to come from its internal reserves, then that money will be coming from what is in effect public moneys.  The effect of reducing the internal reserves of the Central Bank by whatever amount will be twofold at least.  First of all, the income on the Central Bank's internal reserves will be reduced commensurately, and similarly its contribution to the Exchequer from its surplus will be reduced also.  Secondly, its ability to lend to the Government from its reserves will be reduced by an amount equivalent to whatever money is put up to bail out an AIB management error. Thirdly, if there are spare internal reserves of the Central Bank around, as I have no doubt there are, then it seems to me that these reserves, or the proportion of them which we are now talking about, could be put to better use for public purposes than to the purpose of bailing out the largest financial institution in the country.</P>
    <P>The notion that Fianna Fáil will claim credit for this package, at a time when we still do not know whether AIB will pay any more than it committed itself to pay in the beginning and at a time when we still do not know how much, if anything, the remainder of the licensed banks will pay, is foolish in the extreme on their part.  We will have to await the outcome of discussions between the Central Bank and the licensed banks, which have been promised, before we can pass any judgment on the latest position announced in the other House last week. Commitments have been given that details of these discussions will be brought back to the Oireachtas in due course when we can see precisely how much AIB's liabilities are and how much of these liabilities will be met from public moneys of one sort of another.</P>
    <P>The reality is that most people are deeply aware not only that AIB have made a massive blunder and put another millstone around the neck of the State, but that they are getting away extremely lightly indeed.  The people who are getting away lightly in management terms, <Col N="1758" /> if not in any other terms, are people who have never been hesitant to close businesses or to foreclose on individuals when it suits their own private interests as a financial institution.  There is little sympathy with them, particularly when one sees that it appears at this point that perhaps half, perhaps more, of the amount they had claimed to have written off will be recouped in capital gains tax losses and that, in addition to this, they will pay a mere £9 million in the next several years to meet whatever their massive liabilities are.  That is the way it stands until such time as we see the outcome of discussions between the Central Bank and themselves.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer briefly to comments made in the Dáil by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism concerning his desire to bring forward elements of the proposed comprehensive company law reform legislation which is in the course of being drafted so that he might expeditiously deal with aspects of affairs which have arisen from this debacle with particular reference to the obligations of auditors. All of us sympathise with the Minister in his desire to rectify certain omissions in the law in these areas, but many of us are aware that legislation of a comprehensive nature has been available in advanced draft form for at least 18 months and many of us would be very sceptical if elements of this advanced draft legislation were to be brought forward and other elements of that same draft legislation left behind, perhaps never to surface again in the lifetime of this Government.  That is something I would like to draw to the attention of the Minister of State because many of us would treat with great seriousness, particularly after a delay of 18 months in bringing this legislation forward, this comprehensive and long awaited company law reform legislation.  Many of us would look with grave suspicion indeed at elements of it being brought forward now when indeed there may well be other more important elements left behind which we in this party wish to see implemented as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, if not the circumstances in which it had to be introduced into this House and to the Dáil.  I congratulate Senator O'Mahony on a particularly good analysis of the financial problems which the AIB and the Government had to tackle but I regret that he should have yielded to what was obviously an ideological temptation to take this as an opportunity to hit the big banks.  I do not believe at this stage that it is helpful to use words such as &ldquo;lust, arrogance and ineptitude&rdquo; nor to say that this is typical of privately owned companies. Such ideological beliefs have their own place but at this stage in the debate it is too late and also in many ways too early to raise these questions.  Those who knock the bank and what has happened and those who knock the bank and the Government and what has happened have an obligation to give us a different scenario.  What they have not told us is what they would have done in those circumstances. If is perfectly evident to me that, had the Government not acted so promptly and so decisively, we would have had a financial crisis of catastrophic proportions.  It is easy now, but I think wrong, to point out all the flaws which existed and the action that was taken. What we need from those who criticise what happened is a substitute scenario.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That temptation to put the boot into Allied Irish Banks is very prevalent and is probably at the moment very popular, because banks are by nature not very popular institutions.  That has been the case since biblical times.  While we should certainly lay blame and not hide the fact that a disastrous commercial decision has been made, we should also take a responsible attitude to what we are to do next. We should resist the temptation, which has been yielded to by many in the Dáil and here in the Seanad as well as outside the House, to bandy around figures when we do not know what we are talking about.  It is evident and obvious that the extent of the liabilities of ICI, the bank and the Government are as yet not known, but I choose, because I see no reason not to, to accept the good faith of the Minister when he says he believes the <Col N="1760" /> maximum figure is £120 million.  There is no other evidence apart from the sort of rumours which I have heard, and which other Members of the House have obviously heard from London and elsewhere, to suggest that the figure is higher. Until that figure is shown to be higher, it is wrong for Members of the House to bandy around figures because it affects the stability of the financial institutions if we say irresponsible things without reason.</P>
    <P>Certainly there are serious questions to be asked as a result of this.  There is an enormous amount of probing to be done by the Government and there are lessons to be learned.  I support Senator O'Mahony's call for a public inquiry at a very high level on this.  This is necessary because the extent of what happened is highly significant and highly dangerous. It points to something which is seriously wrong in the financial world here, and if it can happen once it can happen again and again.  We do need greater safeguards in the financial world if we are to prevent it happening again.</P>
    <P>There are questions to be asked about the system in which we live and, while I believe in free enterprise and private enterprise, it has taken a blow and a serious blow.  We should ask whether huge organisations such as Allied Irish Banks should be exceptions to the normal rules which apply to private enterprise and competitive commercial life in this country.  Is it right that because Allied Irish Banks are so big they should not be made to suffer for their mistakes in the way that a small commercial organisation such as a small industry, a small business or a small professional man would be made to?  Is that correct or is it not?  In theory it is absolutely correct that they should be made to pay the same price but in practice it is impossible for such monolithic organisations to do so.  We should then ask whether we should allow such organisations to become so big that they, in fact, hold such entrenched and privileged positions.</P>
    <P>The action which the Government took on this issue was guided, it seems, by one principle and one alone.  That was <Col N="1761" /> confidence &mdash; confidence in the banking system, in the Government and in the country, because in banking terms, as we all know, confidence is paramount.  It is not the amount of money you have, it is the actual amount of money people will trust you to hold for them.  The Government had to take prompt and decisive action if the confidence of the whole international banking system was not to be shaken.  Why the Government had to move in and Allied Irish Banks could not be left on their own was because the losses &mdash; and this is the reason why the Government still has to hold the reins &mdash; of ICI for which AIB were responsible were unquantifiable and they remain unquantifiable and that uncertainty required a bigger organisation even than AIB to step in.</P>
    <P>On that Friday, had the Government or AIB been able to say the losses are X amount and that is all, then it would have been all right to leave the bank in charge provided the bank could stand the losses. But it must be remembered that had the Government not stepped in the scenario would have been catastrophic.  AIB do 40 per cent of their business internationally and abroad and had they seen on that day that AIB were shaken from a loss which was unquantifiable, the consequences are unimaginable.  Whether all deposits with AIB would have been withdrawn, whether exchange dealings with AIB would have been stopped, I do not know but the consequences of a loss of confidence in the international community are unthinkable.</P>
    <P>The Government had to step in to stop that run.  Had that lack of confidence spread to the country as a whole the same consequences would have occurred.  It is premature and wrong to say that there would necessarily have been a run on deposits of that and other banks.  It is probably wrong to say that necessarily there would have been withdrawals from building societies but there would have been a situation in which the people of the country as a whole would have been uncertain about their banking institutions and this undoubtedly would have been conveyed within minutes to those from <Col N="1762" /> whom the Government are borrowing abroad.  We, regrettably, depend enormously on foreign borrowing and had our capacity to borrow abroad been questioned or limited in any way, a new scenario with the IMF and so on would have arisen.  It was essential for the Government to take prompt action to stand behind Allied Irish Banks, whether we like it or not, if these consequences were to be prevented and this is what the Government did, and this was responsible action on their part.</P>
    <P>The decision of Allied Irish Banks to maintain their dividend for the current year has received an enormous amount of criticism both in the press and in these Houses.  This is directly related to the issue of confidence and I understand why the Minister says he does not see why that dividend should be maintained. I, as a stockbroker, feel that ethically and morally it was wrong to maintain that dividend because I see no reason why the shareholders should receive a similar payout while other people are paying, but once again the Minister put his finger right on it because, like it or not, had the dividend been cut the ripples of horror would have gone through the international banking community and the consequences would have been the same. While the shareholders may, in the short term, be the beneficiaries of that decision, the country will also benefit simply because the dividend is a yardstick by which the international banks will have judged AIB.  In absolute terms it was outrageous that the dividend should have been paid but in realistic terms, as a short term measure, because it is that yardstick, it was necessary.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the decision of the Government to change their mind and I do not regard it as a decision to follow Fianna Fáil's policy or anybody else's but to adjust what they were doing so that the taxpayer would not foot the bill.  It would be quite wrong for the taxpayer, under any circumstances, to pay the price of a bad commercial decision by a private company, however large. Undoubtedly, there will be serious inequities in who pays for what, but it would <Col N="1763" /> be wrong for the taxpayer to foot this bill.  It is probably wrong that other banks should have to move in because they are competing with Allied Irish Banks themselves and I welcome the Government's decision to see that the taxpayer will not have to foot this bill.  Possibly it was necessary to put the full weight of the taxpayer, the Government and the Department of Finance behind ICI in the initial stages until it was realised that there would not be any run on the banks or any lack of confidence.</P>
    <P>At this stage a decision should be made as to what extent the bank should pay and be made to suffer.  There should be a gradual process whereby, when we realise how much is involved, the bank should pay to the maximum of their ability without the evident danger of the bank going into liquidation.  Because the losses are unquantifiable at the moment the bank's liabilities should also be unquantifiable and if the losses are a lot larger than anticipated, then the bank, if they can stand those losses, should be made to pay more than they have promised at the moment, but not to the extent of liquidation.  In other words, liquidation or any threat to the Allied Irish Banks would be a threat to the financial system of the State and, therefore, to the existence of the State itself but this should be balanced by the fact that the bank are acting in a commercial world in which they should suffer like everybody else for bad commercial decisions.</P>
    <P>We have heard a few uninformed comments about the role of the shareholders in Allied Irish Banks and in any company. The Minister said, and theoretically he is right, that the ultimate responsibility lies with the shareholders in a company.  The shareholders are the owners of Allied Irish Banks.  Enormous play has been made of the fact that shareholders are big fish, fat cats and that they should be made to pay for this because they can afford it. This is patently not true.</P>
    <P>In Allied Irish Banks, there are 27,000 shareholders who cover a large and disparate group of people.  They are the nominal owners of the bank; they are 99 per <Col N="1764" /> cent Irish and mostly pensioners, small holders with small earnings, small savings, with two out of three of them holding less than £2,700 worth of shares. The typical shareholder of Allied Irish Banks is not a fat cat; he is someone who has put a small amount of savings into a company which he believed was rock solid and the typical shareholder in AIB was not looking for overnight gains.  He was not looking for a huge return or a massive dividend.  He was putting his money where he thought it was safe. While ultimately those who invest in the Stock Exchange are seeking a capital gain and while they should be prepared to take the losses which are the balance of that sort of capital gain, it should be remembered that those nominal owners are mostly small shareholders without very much money.  There are, of course, the large holders, the pension funds, the other banks and the other insurance companies, but on the whole they are holding money for people who will depend on income from it and who are not fat cats. Very few rich people own shares in AIB.</P>
    <P>To say that ultimately responsibility lies with AIB is technically true but probably unrealistic.  It is inconceivable that the shareholders in AIB would come together and decide on something like the way AIB ran ICI.  The management and board of AIB are supposed to be there because they have expertise, and management and board are entrusted with this by the shareholders.  The average shareholder has nothing like the technical or financial expertise to question the decisions of management.  So much in the financial world is taken on trust in all these things that it is unrealistic to say that the shareholders take the ultimate responsibility.  They pay and should certainly be made to pay because they, too, have made a wrong decision.  That is the way the system in which we work operates, but we should not say that without realising who these shareholders are.</P>
    <P>One question which must be asked among others which have not been touched on this debate, and I do not wish to duplicate, is whether it is wrong for the banks to become involved in activities <Col N="1765" /> which they do not fully understand. Should the banks be involved in other related activities in which they have no expertise?  I do not know whether the basic problem in this was that AIB decided to get into a field which they had no competence to judge.  They were not breaking the law.  They were doing nothing that they should not have done, but it should be considered whether banks should be allowed to invest in and fully own insurance companies, building societies or any other financial institutions. Surely the banks should be making an investment for their shareholders but not taking control over another company. Would it not be better if a bank were to be limited in such companies to, say, 10 or 20 per cent which would not give them a controlling interest?  Indeed, it would be preferable if they were limited to the extent that they did not have such a large holding that they had effective control if the rest of the shareholders were dissipated very widely.  This trend in the financial world is worrying because the tendency is for too many banks to seek to diversify too far too fast and not to understand the businesses into which they are entering.</P>
    <P>In that context it should be asked also whether the very fact that AIB had taken over ICI made the executives and the employees of ICI irresponsible.  If you have a big financial institution behind you there is an enormous temptation to take risks because you know at the end of the day that the big financial institution will fork out.  That brings us to the ideological argument touched on by Senator O'Mahony which is the difference in efficiency between private and public enterprise.  While this is no advertisement for private enterprise, it must be said in reply to Senator O'Mahony that one of the great problems of semi-State bodies and public enterprise is that they know also that those who work and make decisions for fully owned Government organisations know that at the end of the day if their decision goes wrong the Government are behind it.  That makes it possible and more likely for them to make irresponsible decisions and irresponsible <Col N="1766" /> financial decisions.  In some ways ICI as a fully owned subsidiary of AIB acted in the same way as a semi-State body can act in their relationship with the State.</P>
    <P>This is indeed a blow to private enterprise and it should be regarded very seriously.  All sorts of questions should be asked.  What is the role of a board in a situation like this?  Can the board know what is going on if information, as has been suggested here, is not being conveyed to them?  What is the role of non-executive directors in private companies even as large as this?  If information is not being communicated to them, are they to blame?  Ultimately, yes they are, but as a result of this debacle we must learn lessons and police the insurance world and the banking world much more carefully. It does not really matter at this stage who is responsible for what happened a few weeks ago or in the last 18 months.  We should not be asking whose head we should have on a plate.  We should ask why this was not discovered sooner and we should ensure that it will never happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the measure before the House.  I am quite happy with the content of the Minister's speech here this evening and I agree substantially with some of the points made here.  I do not wish to repeat much of what was said here, but I am sure I will be pardoned if I revert to one or two matters occasionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only reasonable that we should congratulate the Government on having acted decisively and positively in a very serious situation. The decision that the Government had to reach between 8 and 15 March was very serious and had far-reaching effects.  As Senator Ross indicated very ably, catastrophic consequences could have arisen if proper decisions and the proper approach were not taken by Government.  An urgent response was needed, and the stability of the institutions of banking and insurance were at risk, as has been stated here this evening.  An additional factor was that employer's liability and public liability cover of a substantial number of the <Col N="1767" /> workforce here were equally at risk.  A giant in the insurance industry was tottering and, were it to collapse, it would bring with it the giant of the Irish banking industry also.  The consequences could have been widespread and serious, and it is satisfying that we can look back, two to three weeks later, and say that the real risks with which the Government and the country were confronted between 8 and 15 March have been successfully handled, that confidence in the banking institutions has been reasonably maintained, that this Bill is part of a strategy that has been successful and that the Government's involvement has been successful and has saved a situation that could have had extremely serious consequences.</P>
    <P>I believe that this measure and the events that will flow from it will in time restore the Insurance Corporation of Ireland to a commercial footing.  I sincerely hope it will assist AIB to overcome the setback they have received, and I want to say that particularly in relation to the AIB in view of some comments which I will be making later on concerning their performance.  But what I welcome most from the Minister's contribution tonight is the assurance that at the end of the day it is very unlikely that the taxpayer will be asked to carry any part of the cost.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of this situation that one cannot avoid referring to. Indeed, it is impossible to speak on the matter, and it would be wrong to speak on it, without giving clear expression to the widespread feelings of anger and dismay shared by the general public at the events which led to this situation.  As far as I am concerned, that anger and dismay created a feeling of unanimity among the general public that I have rarely seen on any issue, and it was directed solely at the institutions responsible for the creation of this mess.  There were several factors that were part of that dismay, some of them have been referred to already this evening and there were others.  There was, first and foremost, the performance of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland running itself to the point <Col N="1768" /> where liquidation became inevitable. There was also &mdash; this has not been referred to, but it has certainly figured in the minds of many people throughout the country &mdash; the perceived connection between ICI and Irish Shipping.  There was also the incredible position that this situation developed while ICI were either partially or fully under the control of the AIB.</P>
    <P>It is stretching credibility &mdash; the Minister to some extent was saying the same thing, but perhaps in not so direct language &mdash; to believe that AIB should say that they were unaware of what was happening when through most of 1983 and into 1984 there were at least six occasions, either through formal communication or through meetings, that the Department expressed their concern about the operations with ICI.  Not alone was that concern conveyed to ICI but it was also conveyed to AIB.  I believe that should have been sufficient to alert AIB, if that was necessary, to the risks that were developing in ICI.  Reassurances were received by the Department from both ICI and AIB that these worries or doubts were unfounded.  In view of what has since happened, it is again stretching credibility to suggest that there was not deliberate concealment of a rapidly worsening situation.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Government's decision was necessary and it has been successful. There were big and serious problems in insurance, in the employers and public liabilities sectors.  There was a threat to jobs and many people could have been left without insurance cover.  There was the damage to AIB itself, as has been outlined by the Minister and my colleagues, because they might have to meet in full the losses incurred by ICI, and there was a resulting damage that could occur by loss of confidence in the banking industry.  These were logical, demanding and sustainable reasons why the Government should have acted as they did in the interests of the country, the people and the economy.</P>
    <P>Having said that much, I feel, as I said earlier, that there is a duty on us to convey the feelings that are shared by the <Col N="1769" /> public.  When this news was broken to the public by an AIB spokesman people found it quite offensive because it appeared AIB were suggesting something along the following lines.  While AIB had found themselves with a mess, it was now all right because they had succeeded in passing it on to the Government and, through the Government, to the taxpayer, that the Government and the taxpayers between them could resolve the situation, but AIB had no further responsibility, their profits would remain intact and the dividends would be paid to their shareholders.  The reaction that resulted from that explanation has been the most explosive I ever had to deal with.  Events like this rarely happen, but the reaction to that insensitive explanation was so explosive that I believe the ramifications of it will be felt for many years.</P>
    <P>There are many people in business, farming, and even professional people who have been receiving quite a hard time from the banks, AIB are no exception. Many of these people found that money was showered on them when times were good and things were booming, but as soon as times got difficult the banks wanted their money back.  In many cases very little mercy was shown to people who found themselves in difficulty. People who overborrowed were harassed, in many cases in a most brutal and merciless fashion, and many businesses went to the wall.  Many people have found themselves in difficulty simply because they were unable to live up, 100 per cent, to the standards set for them by the banks, including AIB.  It appeared for one awful moment that the banks and their directors were imposing standards and responsibilities on their customers, but when they were in the same difficulties they would avoid their responsibilities and be free of the standards, responsibilities and obligations which were placed on many business people.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in bashing the AIB. As far as I am concerned, they were a fine company and I am sure will be again. I accept the need to maintain confidence in them.  It is a matter for the Allied Irish <Col N="1770" /> Banks and their shareholders to deal with those who have damaged it.</P>
    <P>The old Munster and Leinster part of the bank, which I can speak of from experience, was an institution which supported the co-operative movement.  It financed many worthwhile developments. For a long time, it was a motivating force behind many of the successful developments and industries that are based on agriculture.  I would like to see AIB return to that position.  There is no doubt that in recent years &mdash; Senator Ross said that 40 per cent of their turnover was transacted outside of the country &mdash; a policy decision was made to swing away from this position and seek opportunities in other countries.  Their involvement with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland was an example of that.  Their involvement with the First Maryland Bank in the USA is another indication of that.</P>
    <P>It is easy to be wise after the event but if the funds that were committed to both of these ventures were made available for development within this island, a far more satisfactory situation might have developed as far as the people and the bank are concerned.  It is not in the long term interest of AIB that somebody else should carry the can.</P>
    <P>I accept there is a need to assist the bank.  The arrangement which the Minister spoke of with the Central Bank is one that will assist the AIB and one which will help them overcome their difficulties. It would be unreasonable &mdash; this view may not be shared by others &mdash; to expect other financial institutions to help carry a burden they were not responsible for creating.  At the end of the day, the cost of the salvage must be borne by AIB no matter how long it takes and in the meantime they must be assisted to ensure that no lasting damage is done to them as a banking institution.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the taxpayers &mdash; we got this assurance from the Minister this evening &mdash; should not have to pick up the tab.  It is equally important to ensure that bank customers, irrespective of what bank they deal with, either <Col N="1771" /> through extra charges or levies will not have to pick up the tab.  Those who purchase insurance must not be asked to pay by way of charges or levies.  At the end of the day the pool to provide the money has to be AIB, their shareholders, their funds and investments.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the First Maryland Bank, USA.  I am told that is a prime asset.  It has a value in excess of £150 million.  If customers of the AIB or any other bank are compelled daily to dispose of assets to make their repayments, I do not think there is any reason why now when the AIB are in the same position as some of their customers have been that they, too, should not realise this valuable asset if that is required.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that a calculated attempt was made to dump this problem and the objective was to walk away unscathed from the mess that was created. That cannot and must not happen. It is for that reason I welcome the Minister's assurance that there will be a continuous review of the position.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the assurance from the Minister that there will be tighter controls by his Department in situations such as this and that the Government are to bring forward changes in company law aimed at strengthening the responsibilities of directors, companies and auditors.  I welcome the fact that the capacity of his own Department to monitor developments in the various bodies will be improved.</P>
    <P>It was stated by a Minister in the Dáil that modifications were being planned in relation to the jury system as far as the assessment of damages was concerned.  It is now accepted by the vast majority of people that the assessment of damages by juries is, in many cases, excessive and has a spin-off effect which results in increased premiums and increased cost of insurance cover.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the precise involvement of the Central Bank and the funds available to them in this rescue operation.  Is the role of the Central Bank simply that of a co-ordinator? Many people are asking this question and I hope I express it correctly in relation to the resources which the Central Bank <Col N="1772" /> would possibly be making use of in this rescue operation.  In view of the fact that the resources which are available to the Central Bank are revenues which, if not otherwise called upon, are available to the Exchequer, to whatever extent they will be utilised in this rescue operation that amount, as it were, will not be available to the Exchequer.  Consequently, this represents in some way a cost to the Exchequer and to the taxpayer.  That is a question I am not clear about and I would like to have an answer to it.</P>
    <P>The measure before us is necessary and valuable.  I am satisfied that the Government acted correctly and properly.  I am pleased with the Minister's speech this evening which clarified the means of resolving this situation.  I hope they will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Mainly because meaningful changes have taken place since the legislation was first introduced in the Dáil I will try to facilitate the Government in the passage of the Bill as it now stands. Like many other Senators I wish to make it quite clear that I have serious reservations and I am fully entitled to feel sceptical about the entire affair and, in particular, about the Government's handling of the problem.  The 1964 Bill which the Minister referred to allows the Minister for Finance to advance money to the insurance fund from which the administrator can draw funds to pay the ever-increasing claims.  The assumption that this is a plan to nationalise the industry is borne out by the fact that the two companies presently under the administrator's control have 60 per cent of the motor insurance market and 25 per cent of the liability market.  If this trend of acquisition continues, many of the private companies will be forced to withdraw from Ireland, thus further increasing the Government's share of the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the 1982-83 blue books, one can see the companies now under administration were in dire financial difficulty and this view should have been easily seen by the Department's insurance section, if they had this expertise to <Col N="1773" /> understand the figures they were dealing with at that time.  Obviously, this statutory body is ineffective to deal with the job on hand and the blame for this must be put fairly and squarely at the door of the Minister.  Surely after the problems of the PMPA, the Minister must have had a detailed report on the state of other companies and, if not, the Minister has been extremely negligent in his duty as overseer of the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>The sad part of the whole situation is that the Government are using stop gap measures only to deal with the huge problem facing the whole insurance industry. Mounting losses over the past number of years are putting a number of companies in difficult trading positions and these losses and their causes are not being dealt with by the Government.  At present the insurance industry accepts that up to 20 per cent of the cost of all liability claims are paid in legal costs.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister state categorically that the banks and the Central Bank will underwrite all losses and, if not, at what level will they stop underwriting these losses?  If there is a limit, will the Exchequer, and therefore the taxpayer, be held liable if the legislation is passed?  If the limit of the banking institutions is £120 million as suggested in the Minister's speech, then there is a strong possibility that this limit may be reached if the fringe re-insurance market reneges on fulfilling its treaty obligation.  I should like to ask the Minister has the London office ceased trading?  One would have thought that it should have, as most of the losses are being associated with this office in London.  If one notes the report in <i>The Post Magazine</i> dated 28 March 1985, one will see that the Irish Government have confirmed that they are continuing to underwrite the unprofitable holiday insurance cover for the Association of British Travel Agents.  I will quote from <i>The Post Magazine:</i></P>
    <P>The Association of British Travel Agents, which last year switched underwriters of the Extrasure holiday cover from Accident &amp; General to ICI, said it had received assurances from <Col N="1774" /> the Irish government that this was ongoing.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have telexes from the Irish government confirming that every policy sold will be honoured according to our agreement with ICI,&rdquo; said Ray Bernstone, chairman of ABTA's insurance committee.</P>
    <P>Legislation was introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Cluskey, on the collapse of the PMPA, or the pending collapse of the company at that time according to the Government, and we should have learned from that episode, but apparently no lessons were learned. The Government have not taken the necessary steps to monitor the insurance business in this country and outside it. Had the Government taken heed of the advice given at that time, and had they taken seriously the questions raised in this House during discussions on the passage of that measure, and taken the appropriate action as was suggested at the time, we could possibly have avoided this debacle.</P>
    <P>I want an assurance that the consequential effect of what has happened to ICI will not be as disastrous as what happened with the PMPA when thousands of investors, decent, hardworking Irish men and women, lost their entire life savings which they had invested with the PMPA.  Furthermore, consequent to that legislation there is the burden by levy on insurance premiums which insured people have to bear as a result of that episode and will have to bear for many years.  I asked many questions on that issue which the then Minister failed to answer.  I want a full assurance that the Minister here today is fully armed with the information and that he will give clear, positive and definite answers to the many queries raised in this House during the debate this evening.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me and very obvious to everybody that when the Minister, Deputy Bruton, decided to take the initiative in this instance he had not got his facts right.  What started out initially as a matter to be dealt with by his Department, eventually finished up in the other <Col N="1775" /> House being dealt with or salvaged by the Minister for Finance.  Now it is back where it started.  Figures were mentioned during the Dáil debate ranging from £65 million to £120 million, the figure quoted here today.  Figures have been mentioned in newspaper reports which I agree are startling and astronomical.  Surely the House is entitled to know which figure is at least the nearest one to presenting a true picture of the actual amount of money involved.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether anybody has quoted an article in yesterday's <i>Irish Press.</i>  I will quote from it.  It was headed: &ldquo;State may have to close down ICI, says expert.&rdquo;  It went on:</P>
    <P>The Government may eventually have to wind up the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, according to the managing director of a leading London company which provides a confidential solvency guide to the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>Speaking on RTE's This Week programme yesterday, Mr. John Gardiner, of Insurance Solvency International, said he could not really see the company surviving.  And he warned that ICI could face a final shortfall of £500 million.</P>
    <P>There is also talk of reinsurers withdrawing their cover.  I noticed in the Minister's speech that the company will be dependent on reinsurers.  If this happens on a large scale, then the full risk falls due to be paid by the insurer &mdash; in this case, the ICI.  Therefore, the ICI will be fully responsible for any risks that fall due.  I have a certain sympathy for the Minister taking this Bill here this evening. In the Dáil during Question Time on 30 January when a specific question was raised with regard to the ICI, the Minister stated that there was no cause for alarm. There is certainly cause for alarm today. A very serious situation has arisen which I hope will not deteriorate any further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me say that Senator Ross said that a member of the Labour Party, Senator Flor O'Mahony, has taken advantage of AIBs problems. <Col N="1776" /> The situation is that the Minister has analysed very well &mdash; an analysis which instances many circumstances in which the London office of the ICI were guilty of gross negligence which nearly in themselves brought the AIB banking organisation down.  This is a very serious situation with which we are faced in the Seanad and the Dáil.  We were presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i>  The situation was that if we did not pass this Bill there would be lack of confidence in Allied Irish Banks, there would be a run on the bank themselves and the whole financial institution of the State would grind to a halt.  We were told that we, the State, were now to take over the ICI.  We have already taken over the PMPA.  The situation is that we, the State, are left with the leavings of a private enterprise to do with it as we wish.</P>
      <P>There is a connection between Irish Shipping Ltd. and the ICI.  We met the late William O'Neill on the semi-State bodies committee, who was a director of ICI.  It was put to him at that stage and to the directors of Irish Shipping whether they wished to be a private or a State company.  Their answer at that time was that, naturally, they would wish to be in private enterprise.  The point I put to the late Mr. O'Neill was that in circumstances where the company are in a disastrous position they would like the benefit and the umbrella of the State, but in situations where there was money to be made in a highly lucrative business, they wanted private enterprise.  You cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of AIB have announced that they will be maintaining their dividends despite these severe losses.  We are told that that is for confidence in the banking institution.  I wonder is it confidence.  As we look at the accounts of Allied Irish Banks, we see that the directors' fees and emoluments for 1984 were £760,000, for 1983, £635,000, an increase of 24 per cent with inflation running at 9 per cent.  Possibly we will be told that the directors' fees should continue to be paid at an increased level for next year because if it does not happen there would be a lack of confidence in the banks.  I would query that. <Col N="1777" /> Perhaps we have been given information that is correct, that there would be a lack of confidence if the dividend was not paid.  I find it very hard to understand why the directors of these banks would pay themselves such an increase.  A question the Minister should be asking the banking organisation is, why, in effect, they paid themselves and their directors a 24 per cent increase in 1984.</P>
    <P>We are told that had ICI gone into liquidation under the auspices of Allied Irish Banks, it possibly would have brought the bank down.  The information we are presented with is the information given to the Minister by Allied Irish Banks.  They say that if they were in complete control of ICI and if that company were to go into liquidation they themselves would be faced with a run on the bank.  I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>This company have been a highly successful company up to now.  They have many interests abroad, possibly too many abroad.  Nearly 40 per cent of their business is abroad.  We see all of the investments that they have abroad.  We see from their annual report how many companies they are involved in &mdash; 33 wholly owned subsidiaries.  They have companies in the Channel Islands, in Jersey and in Scotland.  In the United States, they have associated companies. They have a controlling interest in Allied Energy Resources Limited.  They have interests in Allied Combined Trust Limited. They have Channel Islands Insurance Consultants Limited in Guernsey. When a bank get themselves involved in an insurance company, get involved in all sorts of speculative operations, is that the function of the bank?  I know from experience that I would not be prepared to get involved in industry because my profession is accountancy, a profession I understand.  I do not understand other areas and I definitely would not get involved in them.  The competence of the bank to get involved in an insurance company, the competence of the Bank of Ireland to get involved in a building society and the competence of the bank to get involved in all these associated companies outside the State must be queried.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1778" /> I agree with what Senator Howard said about the contribution that Allied Irish Banks have made to the Irish economy. They were a very aggressive banking operation with highly qualified managers, excellent people to work with, but they had their ruthlessness.  There is no doubt that many small businessmen will tell you what information they ask for when they go in looking for an overdraft facility. They look for projections, they look for three year's annual accounts; they look for cash flow statements.  Most of all they look for security and that security is signed security by the applicant so that, even in the case of a company, the individual is held liable as far as the bank is concerned.  When many companies here have gone into liquidation those who have suffered have been the State and the creditors.  Rarely have the bank suffered, because their collateral has been guaranteed by the individual.  Therefore we must query the circumstances in which the AIB became involved in a company in the insurance business, bought a company, without examining their books and records.  It was most annoying to hear one of the directors of AIB say on television that they had bought a company but they really did not know what they were buying.  That is a very sad reflection on a company who preached to us on numerous occasions about their management practices, sought management accounts at all times, lecturing us on what should be management procedures.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said, and I have seen several statements to this effect, that heads should roll.  I would like to know exactly what the Minister means by saying that some heads should roll, for example, who should take responsibility for this fiasco, as the Minister himself described it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <P>I know the Minister here did not say that, that it was said by another Minister in another place.  I accept that the Minister did not say that <Col N="1779" /> here.  But I want to know who in the AIB should resign, who should suffer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should be somewhat more precise as to who said heads should roll and where.  It is not my information that either Minister Bruton or myself said that heads should roll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my understanding that Minister Bruton had suggested it, that the blame should lie with some individuals who got themselves involved in an insurance company, who bought a company, whose directors admitted they had purchased a company and did not know what they were buying.  That was an extraordinary statement to make.  Perhaps I am misquoting the Minister.  It is a crazy situation that a company with the background of AIB could buy an insurance company and not know what they were buying.  If the Minister did not say that heads should roll, I believe heads should roll.  I am amazed that people in top positions in this organisation have not already done the honourable thing.  We are told by this banking organisation that the reason that that has not yet happened is that it would lead to lack of confidence on the part of the public.  Confidence cannot be very high in an organisation admitting to having purchased a company who in the United Kingdom were insuring the bloodstock industry, insuring areas not accepted by other insurance companies, for example, a football team so that they would not go down in their division.  It was correctly said by other insurance companies in England that this company were obsessed with new business, with taking over new business. Their premiums, in 1982 amounting to £11.9 million and in 1983 £32.3 million, demonstrated that they were undercutting their competitors, that the only way they could increase their premiums was to underwrite risks which would not be handled by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the company's accountants produced accounts which were misleading; that may be so and it may still be proven to be correct.  If that <Col N="1780" /> is proved to be correct then it should be remembered that the auditors themselves have insurance, that it is right that the AIB should go after this firm of accountants proving that they were negligent. The preparation of accounts is done from the internal records of any company.  One must come to the conclusion that the internal records of this insurance company left much to be desired.  It may well be proven that the company records audited by the auditors were incorrect. If negligence can be proved there then enters in the auditors' insurance.  That is an area at present being pursued.  I understand that so far no decision has been taken on behalf of a court to give costs to the AIB.</P>
    <P>If the Government are bailing out AIB and are doing so only for the security of the State because that institution occupies such a predominant place in the financial institutions of this State, then the State must be willing to accept a share in this bank.  We are told that the reason is that that might lead to lack of confidence, that is if the State were to become involved in AIB.  But there is already lack of confidence that any company should have taken such drastic action.  If the State is willing to bail them out, the State should have a substantial share in AIB.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Howard when he said that perhaps part of the solution might lie with their wholly-owned companies all over the world, that the AIB may decide to sell one of their subsidiaries. I cannot see that leading to any diminution of confidence.</P>
    <P>Many times this banking organisation have, in their annual reports, scoffed at the public sector, calling it inefficient, bound up in red tape and so on.  We must now ask: where does the inefficiency lie? Were even a grocery shop run in that fashion it would be out of business very quickly.  It should be remembered that in September 1983 AIB took over the ICI. In January 1984, 14 months later, AIB paid £9.525 million for Irish Shipping's share in ICI.  One must ask: what evaluation was undertaken by the AIB when we are told that, at the end of 1984, losses were in the region of £65 million?  Yet <Col N="1781" /> they were prepared to pay £9.525 million to Irish Shipping Limited for their share in ICI.  We are told that the losses involved here will be in the region of £50 million to £120 million.  I should like to think that that would be the case and no more.  The Minister has correctly said that speculation on the amount of losses in this company would be damaging.  I agree with those sentiments.  We shall know what losses are involved only when the auditors have completed their review of the whole company in approximately five to six weeks time.  If we find it to be in excess of this figure we will have to make other decisions.</P>
    <P>There are areas in which banking organisations should not be allowed to be involved.  Lessons should be learned here.  It is time the Government looked at the situation where banking organisations, for whatever reason, get involved in speculative operations and examined the competence of a bank to get involved in these areas.  I agree with banks extending their area of activity throughout the world provided their activities are in the banking arena and not in speculative businesses.  I agree that the managers of the AIB in most cases have been top class people who have in many cases helped our economy enormously.  For whatever reason, they decided to expand into the insurance area and it was detrimental to the bank.</P>
    <P>Company law should be changed as the Minister has outlined, so that we will have proper control over directors and so that the various companies will be accountable.  It is past time to reform company law.</P>
    <P>The banking sector is not immune from the realities of commercial life.  When they get involved in areas in which they have no competence it is a very bad day for themselves and for the State if they rely on the Government to bail them out. The Minister has acted very wisely and the Government are to be commended on the way in which they handled this. For reasons already outlined financial institutions are vital to the State and it is important that confidence in them be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I share the sentiments of everyone when I say that there is no joy for us in finding ourselves here for the second time in a short space of years dealing with a major financial collapse in the insurance industry.  We must not only try to ensure that this problem is dealt with as quickly and as fairly as possible but we should try to learn the necessary lessons in the hope that we will not have to at some date in the future be faced with the possibility of a third collapse, or even more collapses.  There are steps which can be taken.  I would like to feel that they will be taken in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House too long as the evening is progressing and other Senators wish to speak.  I am tempted to go on at great length as I have a certain sense of familiarity with many of the points being made because I sat on and had the privilege of chairing a committee of inquiry into the insurance industry which sat from 1970 to 1976 during the preparation of its final report. Even then, over ten years ago, some of the issues now being talked of were already starting to surface.  Some of the initial warning signs were there and we talked about the kinds of action needed to end them.  While at least some changes were made in the wake of that committee and its report, we have by no means progressed as far as had been suggested then and we certainly have not taken account of subsequent developments in financial practices over the past decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to how we should deal with the present situation let us try to clarify who should pick up the bill in this instance.  Suppose the ICI were just a private limited company with no State shareholders, no banking shareholders and so on, I presume we would say, just like any other company that runs into difficulty, it should go bankrupt and presumably the cost in that instance would primarily be borne by the policyholders. No speaker so far has suggested that policyholders might reasonably bear some of the cost in this instance.  Yet over and over again we have heard suggestions that for a number of years both in their Irish <Col N="1783" /> and non-Irish business the ICI have been grossly undercutting the rates charged by other companies.  If that is so, surely in the normal course of private enterprise behaviour if people buy cheaply and take the risks inherent in buying cheaply they must reasonably be faced with some of the loss.</P>
    <P>In this instance, looking at the history of ICI, had they not changed hands a few years ago, would they still be essentially a form of semi-State company in which case had matters run would we have been aware of the situation so quickly?  Apparently not.  Apparently it would have taken perhaps another couple of years before the real scale of the problems would emerge.  Who knows?  We cannot say, because we do not know the extent to which the recent business practices of ICI were in any way the consequences of the change of ownership.  Senator Ross suggested in this House, and I have heard it suggested outside, that perhaps after the change of ownership, the ICI management were tempted to chase new business too aggressively because they felt they had more or less unlimited financial backing from the new owners.  If that is so, it is unfortunate.  Had ICI remained largely associated with their former owners would the State have found itself faced with an indeterminate headache at some indeterminate date?  Those are two of the possibilities.</P>
    <P>The factual situation, which complicates it, is that ICI had come into the ownership of AIB progressively over the last few years and was finally totally owned by them since 1983.  The reason that complicates the situation is as we have heard, that AIB being a major financial institution, we cannot afford to see a situation where AIB are jeopardised because of the losses involved in their ICI subsidiary.  For the sake of the soundness of our banking system we have to ensure that the damage to AIB is contained. This is one aspect; another aspect which touches on the question of who should pay part of the tab in the way in which AIB came to take over the ownership and the responsibility for the <Col N="1784" /> conduct of the affairs of ICI.  As I understand it, when AIB were embarking on this acquisition there were discussions with the Central Bank and the Central Bank specifically directed them that they were not to devote an undue proportion either of their financial resources or of their management to the running of ICI. Rightly or wrongly as I understand the position AIB did that.  They tended to leave ICI alone, certainly in the early months.  It was only when the warning signals sounded and when questions were being raised that AIB found themselves forced to go in and take a closer look at what was happening in their newly acquired subsidiary.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to develop that aspect of the matter too much.  It is not my brief to try to defend AIB but there appears to be a complicated situation.  We are not dealing with a simple privately owned insurance company.  We are dealing with one that had ramifications with State companies and, especially now, one where there was a somewhat uncertain or confused statement as to how a bank were supposed to conduct their affairs when they acquired a financial subsidiary such as an insurance company.  This is one of the areas we will have to pay attention to.</P>
    <P>How did this happen?  We will not know the full story for some time and I am not going to get into the irresponsible process of speculating about what may be and might not be.  Even from the limited information we were given in the Minister's speech it seems as though at the very least ICI conducted their affairs in a rather imprudent manner.  For that reason I do not think they deserve any particular support because, looking at ordinary commercial companies, if they behave imprudently they have to bear the consequences of their own folly.  I have very little sympathy for ICI, but what about the sympathy for AIB?  Are they entitled to any consideration?  We have heard the case argued for and against why it is necessary to try to give some guidance on the limit of their liability, because otherwise we might damage the <Col N="1785" /> confidence of depositors.  Most reasonable people will go along with that.  One area that has been commented on, and I agree with the criticism, is that they were wrong to suggest that they would maintain their dividend.  I disagree with Senator Ross's remarks.  He said he thought maintained dividend payments were necessary to keep up confidence, but surely not.  The shareholders have suffered a loss.  In effect, writing off the £86 million means that AIB have lost roughly 20 per cent of their total assets.  Whether the shareholders like it or not, that is what has happened to them.  Even if one allows that AIB may mitigate some of that loss in future years through being able to use tax losses, they have also lost the ability to earn money on that volume of assets.  There is a loss whether one measures it as a once and for all sum now or measures it as a loss of a future stream of profits which they could have earned. If they have suffered that loss, that should be reflected in a reduced payment to their shareholders.  Surely that is the way to bring home to the shareholders that there has been serious damage done to the company.  There is no point in pretending that there has not been.</P>
    <P>With regard to the misleading presentation of the ICI accounts, Senator O'Mahony said that the 1983 underwriting losses surely gave the danger signals. I would have to say, not necessarily in themselves, because once one hits periods of high inflation one expects the investment income, or money earnings, which insurance companies earn on the reserves that they must hold to settle their outstanding claims in the future to rise dramatically.  If they were to be reporting no underwriting losses they would end up with much greater profits certainly in money terms and very probably, in real terms also.  In order to avoid excessively high premium rates being charged there is nothing wrong with an underwriting loss appearing in a period of high inflation.  One has to look at the profit and loss situation of an insurance company. That is one of the developments that happily we managed to get in the last few years instead of the totally antiquated <Col N="1786" /> system that prevailed up to the seventies where one only saw the underwriting accounts and did not see the full profit and loss situation for companies.  That meant that there was even less prospect of being able to get a reasonable snapshot picture of an insurance company's affairs.</P>
    <P>The more substantive point is that what was lacking in looking at the affairs of ICI, whether one took account of their investment income or not or whether one looked at the balance sheets and so on, is that when one is dealing with an insurance company in the non-life area the real problem, aggravated through inflation in recent years and coupled with the changing behaviour of juries is that it becomes increasingly difficult to get reliable estimates of the eventual settlement cost for outstanding claims.  In 1976 in our report &mdash; even in the polite language which had to prevail for a committee of 23 people representing all shades of opinion within the insurance industry as well as various outside interests &mdash; on this topic, we said:</P>
    <P>Despite recognition of the special features of insurance the requirement under the various Acts to report annually in static terms on what is, in fact, a dynamic and evolving situation limits the usefulness to the Supervisory Authority of the prescribed accounts and schedules in assessing the financial stability of the insurance undertaking. The Committee considers it desirable that undertakings should be required to provide data in sufficient detail to enable the Supervisory Authority to satisfy itself&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  That the provisions in the balance sheet in respect of outstanding claims and unexpired risks are adequate and have been evaluated on the basis of sound business practice and statistical techniques;</P>
    <P>(ii)  That the insurance funds which these provisions represent are covered by equivalent and matching assets etc.</P>
    <P>The crucial portion is, &ldquo;the basis on which outstanding claims have been evaluated, including statistical techniques&rdquo;.  I am a <Col N="1787" /> little bit saddened that it is only now, in the wake of the second collapse, that we have in the Minister's speech reference to the fact that he wants to look at strengthening the staff in his supervisory sector and take aboard actuarial techniques which have been used for a long time in the life assurance area.  It should have been done a number of years ago. The whole basis of the insurance industry, as was made clear throughout that insurance report of ten years ago, was changing rapidly and we should not still in 1985 be talking about developing an adequate supervisory system nor should we still be left with the situation where by all accounts, ICI did not have anything remotely resembling a modern system.  There were about three simple tests that could have been run for the ICI or any other firm.  All you had to do was look, first of all at the statistical sample, the basis on which estimates for settling outstanding claims were done on a year by year breakdown.  It is no use getting an aggregate figure and being told that at the end of 1981 you might have an estimate of £10 million for outstanding claims and in 1982 it is £15 million and in 1983 it is £20 million.  One would want to see for each year in which the risk was incurred how the eventual settlement pattern runs out because typically what happens is that it is the smaller, less costly claims which are settled quickly in the first year or two after the premium was paid and it is the small number of very expensive claims which are typically settled three, four or five years later. They are the ones that play havoc with the company.</P>
    <P>That is why we will not know for quite some time what the eventual outcome in the ICI affair is going to be, even though we are promised more accurate estimates from the auditors who are currently working on the problem.  We have to recognise that at best all they can do is give us their up-to-date assessment which they will regard as reasonable.  That is the first thing to look at, the actual statistical techniques and estimating procedures that are used.  It is possible to compare <Col N="1788" /> the practices of companies in this respect. I am sure the Minister will know from the work in his Department that there can be significant differences between companies in this area but it is a crucially important area to follow up.</P>
    <P>The second thing to look at &mdash; and it should have applied to the supervisory authority as well as to the AIB, even if they were not intervening on a day-to-day basis &mdash; is the actual distribution of business by various categories, because it is one thing to write a large number of policies for motor cars or for householders but it is a totally different matter to get into once-off specific types of risks, for example, satellites, bloodstock, bush fires in Australia and so on.  Any of those types of risks by definition have a very small number of cases, so if there is no claim on the one or two expensive race horses it is a very pleasant outcome but if there is even one Shergar-type situation or one jumbo jet disaster, clearly it can wreck any small to medium sized insurance company.  Looking at the distribution of business can be a very important control check on these companies.  We have to ask to what extent that type of assessment is carried out.</P>
    <P>The third area is what sort of pricing policy was being followed, because if even half the stories are true about the way in which ICI were quoting premium rates, whether in Ireland or outside Ireland, we would have to ask whether the Minister felt he had powers to intervene and take steps, if necessary even to revoke the licence of the company.</P>
    <P>These are the sort of questions that must be asked when looking at the behaviour of ICI.  It seems to me that, given the complications in the matter, certainly policy holders should bear some of the risk.  This may well become important in the future, because the Minister quite rightly, when giving the best estimates that we can have at the moment &mdash; of £65 million to £120 million &mdash; of the extent of the losses which may emerge, says that these figures are, of course, based on re-insurance contracts being sustained, as it must be assumed they will be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> We know that there have also been suggestions about the format in which some of that re-insurance business was arranged.  I presume that must be the basis for some of the speculation about the very large eventual losses which could emerge from this ICI case.  I would have to say that on the face of it, and especially if they are outside this country, I do not see why the Irish taxpayer should have to pick up some of the costs.</P>
    <P>One of the areas to explore very carefully, since this is the first time it has come up in our experience, is the relationship between supervisory authorities in different countries.  I do not want to appear to be engaging in what might be called Brit-bashing, but London has prided itself on being in effect the leading insurance centre of the world for a very long time. Indeed when the UK was joining the EC, many people in the city of London felt that this whole financial sector was one in which the UK would have a particular expertise and, therefore, they would be able to generate a lot of business for themselves in the wider European context. If they have this expertise and so on, and they have far more companies and a much greater volume of trade, to what extent have the UK supervisory authority adequately discharged their responsibilities?  Under the EC arrangements it is their responsibility to ensure the adequacy of ICI's London affairs.  I know it is a fairly sensitive area but one which it will be necessary to explore, if not on this occasion, in the eventuality of any future difficulties between companies.</P>
    <P>What happens if the parent authority is not satisfied with the quality of the supervision given by another member state?  In this instance what happens if we in Ireland are not completely satisfied that there was adequate supervision in London?  Do we have redress through the Commission and if necessary can we take them to the European Court?  These are matters which ought to be pursued, even on a hypothetical basis.  It has become important to prepare adequately for any possible future situation.  Of course, it could apply the other way around.  As <Col N="1790" /> we know there are non-Irish companies operating here and what happens if anyone of them ever get into trouble and the finger is being pointed at the inadequate supervision of their branch activities in Ireland?  That is one matter that has to be explored.</P>
    <P>We have to put our own house in order; we have to explore our relationships with other supervising authorities and now we have to get the Central Bank to spell out policy, even if it is not the sort of policy that is published in great detail in the press.  They will certainly have to clarify their attitude towards the investment and diversification activities of the financial institutions.  In this instance they allowed a major bank to take over an insurance company but in effect hamstrung them by saying they could not really get too heavily involved either with their management or with their money.  Rightly or wrongly that appears to have given rise to at least some of the delay in dealing with the issue, but on the other hand I am told that other companies in the financial sector have not been able to get approval for various kinds of involvements either by way of shareholdings and so on in other types of financial concerns.</P>
    <P>It appears from the examples that have been quoted to me that there is a lack of consistency in the Central Bank's policy in this area.  That may not be fully verifiable but somebody will have to take that matter up and if the Central Bank are to allow banks to take shareholdings in other financial type institutions, they must then work out a revised and adequate code of supervision.  They cannot, as they apparently did in this case, just send a letter to AIB, discuss the details of it and then walk away from it. It is for that reason that I welcome the fact that the Central Bank have come forward in the past week to say that they will help with the financial arrangements for this rescue because it is a bank that needs to be rescued, not the insurance company, and it is the Central Bank that should look after the financial problems of banks.  Unless there are some exceptional reasons, it should not be other <Col N="1791" /> agencies within the State.  As we know, if the Central Bank actually have to use any of their money it means eventually that the taxpayer is the one who is paying because if they did not have to use their money in that way it would be available to the Exchequer in the same way as any other tax revenue would be available.  It is only a question of whether the taxpayer pays today or pays later.</P>
    <P>The third area that we must examine is the reform of the legal system and not just talk about not having juries in a number of actions.  That is important also but when we were drawing up this report on insurance, while we recommended a number of changes, there was also a split in the committee, but by a majority we suggested that in the case of motor insurance &mdash; and I suggest that this applies to many forms of liability insurance &mdash; we should get rid of the liability system.  The old argument for having it was that there would be too much moral hazard if you did not keep liability.  The notion that if you were just going to have what is called &ldquo;no fault insurance&rdquo;, people would behave recklessly.  Many of the most expensive claims today arise from people who are not insured anyway.  If one takes motor insurance one finds that the Insurance Bureau of Ireland figures rise drastically every year.  This is because many accidents involving uninsured drivers crashing into insured drivers give rise to very expensive claims.  Similarly, in many of the employers' liability cases, one cannot say that the existence of liability leads to any significant improvement in safety because of the employer being liable.  Nowadays workers very often have a much more relaxed attitude to safety and it is not directly the employer who can have any real responsibility for many of the accidents that take place during working hours, whether in his premises or out on the road.  Much of the liability concept is out-dated and irrelevant. The reason for many of the other claims mounting is that we are dealing with people and societies that are far more affluent, but the distribution of affluence is always very uneven.</P>
    <P>Take the extreme case of some forms <Col N="1792" /> of liability which a trader might face.  If some famous pop star or footballer comes into one's premises to buy £50 or £100 worth of goods and he suffers an accident it may cost you a couple of million pounds merely because he is a very expensive commodity.  That should be done away with.  Any form of accident should essentially involve the paying of scheduled benefits.  We should fix a scale of benefits which would compensate for loss of earnings during the period of injury up to a maximum figure, perhaps twice the average earnings, and if there are highly paid pop stars or footballers let them take out their own personal insurance and not have it as a liability on anybody else.  The same concept could be applied to most motor insurance.</P>
    <P>We should get rid, too, of the notion of insurance companies completing a transaction by paying a single figure.  I do not see the point in having an insurance company paying £1 million in a severe injury case.  Sometimes that sum would be inadequate if, unfortunately, the person lives on in great pain and suffering for up to 50 years.  Sometimes it is grossly excessive because the person concerned might die six months afterwards.  We should not be developing the kind of society where we provide in an irrelevant way for many of the hazards of life. Surely what most people want is that if an accident occurs, any expenses whether by way of medical treatment or loss of earnings, up to a reasonable figure, should be covered and then lump sums calculated on whatever arbitrary basis suggested by way of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment for various injuries, broken arms or legs and so on.  That would introduce one crucial difference into the whole system.</P>
    <P>Some people may ask how can life companies get it right and non-life companies get it so wrong.  The non-life business as it stands is becoming more and more of a lottery or a guessing game because no insurance company when they take on their premiums this year can tell you how much they will have to pay out in the next one, three, five or ten years on these policies.  The only way it can be made a manageable, sensible, practical <Col N="1793" /> business is to specify the amounts in each case and the way to specify even for the long duration accident cases would be, not to pay a once-for-all sum to permanently disabled people but to pay annual sums so that on a gradual basis a predictable manageable sum can be developed. There would not then be these violent fluctuations in the declared results of insurance companies and opportunities which can give rise to the sort of situation we are discussing tonight, whether they result from incompetence, foolishness, fraud or just plain stupidity.  The only consolation we have in this case is that at least the problem was spotted within 18 months of its starting to develop and it was not allowed to drag on and become a real nightmare.</P>
    <P>For that reason the Government were right to act as quickly as they did. Whether they should have gone as far as they did in apparently indemnifying AIB is a more contentious matter.  In the first instance, AIB were the people who made the investment.  They were the people therefore who would have collected the profits had the venture been successful and in general they have to pick up the tab for the losses.  The only mitigating element for them is that in so far as they were constrained by the directives of the Central Bank they may be entitled to some sort of consideration.  But since the taxpayer is not yet paying out any money we should welcome the Bill, have it in operation as quickly as possible, wait for more accurate information in the not too distant future and then see what can be done after that.  I have not touched at all on whether this new company should continue actively to trade as an insurance company or whether we should embark on a policy of running it down.  Part of the answer there will have to be taken on the basis of whether there is a sufficient availablity of insurance in various classes. We know that for some categories of business there appears to be a reasonable choice of companies.  In other cases, we are told that it is extremely difficult.  At any rate, that is the context in which to look at the question of continuing this company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1794" /> I emphasise that I do not see any long term solution to many of these problems, no matter how well we improve our supervisory procedures and so on, unless we really bite the bullet on the whole concept of liability.  One of the first areas in which to start, because it is of economic importance is the question of employer's liability.  The fact that employers are paying £20 a week or more to insure their workers must be a real drag on employment.  I see no moral justification for it, quite apart from the economic damage it is doing.  I do not see that it is necessary to provide against genuine hardship; the way to cope with that is along the lines I have suggested, by scheduled payments which could be provided at a nominal cost by comparison with the present system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and it will have my support.  The action taken by the Government is wise and the House would be doing a service in passing this legislation speedily.  It is of great importance to the insurance industry and the banking fraternity and their lack of interest in this debate is surprising.  It appears that the rescue package of the Government and of the Oireachtas is taken for granted.  They can sit at home and relax, confident in the knowledge that we work as late as is necessary to clear up the mess which they created.</P>
      <P>As public representatives we must look at how we have behaved ourselves and how the people who represent us have behaved.  I am conscious of the rule of the House whereby individual members of the Minister's staff cannot be criticised. The custom is to criticise the Minister and, therefore, I have to address my remarks to the Minister.  I am doing so in the knowledge that it is not his personal responsibility or that of his predecessors, but the personal responsibility of other people whom I cannot finger in this House tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland were clearly signalled in the information which was available to the Minister's Department over the last three years.  I would like to run quickly <Col N="1795" /> through a few things that the Minister has said and quote some statistics which will give credence to what I will say.  The Minister in his speech said that ICI were a company whose state was satisfactory over a long period of years.  The company were trading normally and had a consistent track record of steady profitability and were disclosing a very comfortable surplus of assets over the required solvency mark.  Later on in his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>As regards the system of supervision employed in Ireland, my Department receive the accounts of insurers annually and undertake detailed analysis of the information supplied in relation to the different classes of insurers' business.</P>
    <P>Further on he said:</P>
    <P>Arising from the tests applied to ICI, my Department began to be concerned about the adequacy of the technical claims reserves set up by the company in relation to its Irish business.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not specify when that occurred but followed on by saying:</P>
    <P>During 1983 the Department communicated formally to ICI their concern at this aspect of the company's operation.</P>
    <P>Presumably, the concern manifested itself during 1983 on the consideration of the 1982 accounts.  I have considered in detail the accounts of two insurers: one of course is the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and the other the Hibernian Insurance Company.  These are matters of public record.  I picked the Hibernian Insurance Company because, contrary to what people say, they are a very fine insurance company with a consistent record of conservative and sound reporting to the Department.</P>
    <P>There are two very significant areas of business where underwriting profit and losses have occurred over the recent past &mdash; the motor insurance and liability insurance in general.  Liability insurance in some of the reports which are before the <Col N="1796" /> House are divided into two, employer's liability and public liability in general. In respect of some of the reports, that division is not made.  These reports are available and form the basis of the book which is published annually and is known as the blue book although it is not blue. In the book in question are statements of assurance business as presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with section 27 of the Assurance Companies Act, 1909, and section 5 of the European Communities Non-life Insurance Account Regulations 1977.  That indicates quite clearly the state of play of each insurance company on an annual basis and, presumably, forms the basis of the investigation and the monitoring to which the Minister refers in his speech. That book is backed up by individual statements from each company.  For example, in respect of the year 1983 there is a statement from the Hibernian Insurance Company which goes through in detail the various underwriting profits and losses of that company which are recorded on each category of business during the year.  It summarises all those and shows whether the company made a profit or a loss.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the Hibernian Insurance Company made a very healthy profit.  The same kind of information is available in respect of the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  One of the significant things about these reports is that they are not static as suggested in the insurance report.  Whether it happened after the report to which Senator O'Donoghue referred or not, they update the information available in the previous years.  They not only reported the position in 1983 but they give the position in 1982 and 1981, 1980, 1979 and back as far as 1978.  You can see the emerging pattern over the years, how the company are behaving themselves and how their reserves were deemed to be adequate or inadequate. For example, in respect of liability insurance, in 1978 the Hibernian Insurance Company provided a sum of £4.85 million for claims which they anticipated would arise during that year, amounting to £4.1 million.  Every year as they reported to <Col N="1797" /> the Department, up to this year, they have adjusted that figure upwards and downwards with more up-to-date information, always referring back to the accidents that occurred in 1978.</P>
    <P>Therefore, that company over the years have been able to reduce slightly and gradually the amount of money which they provided in respect of accidents occurring in 1978 so that at the end of 1983 when the whole situation was nearly washed out they could say that the total amount of money which they needed to provide was £3.45 million.  For 1980 the information is the same.  They said originally in respect of 1979 that the amount of money which they would require to provide in respect of accidents which occurred in 1979 under liability was £5.4 million.  They thought later that they would require £6 million.  It is a very small increase over a period of years, especially when you take into account high inflation during that time for a very stable situation. Throughout that time that pattern emerges in the Hibernian Insurance Company's reporting system consistently year after year.</P>
    <P>If we look at the situation of the ICI and the position that obtained in 1978 we find precisely the same thing.  They have a classification of insurance called liability. In 1978 they deemed it appropriate to provide £4.1 million in respect of accidents which occurred in 1978.  By the end of 1983 that had increased to £7.3 million. Similarly you can go to 1979 and say that they originally estimated that £5.3 million was required to provide for the claims in respect of occurrences during 1979 and what is needed according to their estimates now is £11.7 million, more than double.</P>
    <P>Steadily over the years in respect of the ICI every year the matter was reconsidered and a greater and greater sum of money needed to be provided.  This is where the Minister comes in, although not personally.  The Minister said that during 1983 the Department were concerned, but I say to him that the Minister should have been concerned considerably before that.  I have not looked at previous years, 1977, 1976, 1975, but I can say in <Col N="1798" /> respect of 1981 that the 1981 accounts of the ICI showed an increase in respect of the 1979 liability provision from £5.3 million to £9.1 million.  That was available to the Minister during 1982.  In other words, during 1982 it was quite obvious that consistently over the years ICI had underprovided the amount of money necessary in respect of the claims they had to meet.  It was also quite clear, if you looked at other insurance companies, specifically the Hibernian Insurance Company, that that did not apply.  Consistently from day one with all the uncertainty with regard to quantity, number and type of claim, they were able to estimate accurately within plus or minus 5 per cent the amount of money for which they would ultimately be liable.  ICI were unable to do that to within 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>That information was available in the Minister's Department not during 1983 but certainly during 1982 and maybe much earlier.  Therefore, the Minister should look very carefully at the kind of advice and monitoring which took place in his Department over those years.  Part of the responsibility in respect of this internal problem in so far as it relates to the problem in Ireland is within the supervisory authority and capacity of the Minister.  The Minister is responsible for that, as is quite obvious to anybody who was examining these accounts.  I was not examining them but it is not my job to examine them.  I am sure the other Members of the Seanad were not examining them.  It is not our job to do so, but there is a section in the Minister's Department to examine these and that was not being done, or if it was being done it was being done badly.</P>
    <P>It is grand to say that the responsibility is in some way magically tied to the perverse awards from juries.  I have no objection or hang-up with regard to investigating whether the jury system is good now or will be in the future.  The Minister should bear in mind that the average amount of a motor claim which is awarded in respect of any accident in Ireland consistently over the years is in the order of £1,700 or £1,800.  What appears in the newspapers are cases in <Col N="1799" /> which awards of £200,000 or £100,000 of £50,000 are made.  That is not typical. The average cost of a claim is £1,700 or £1,800.  For that to be the case it is obvious that the overwhelming majority of payments must be very small indeed. It is also obvious that the problem with the Irish insurance market is not that bigger sums are being agreed, with or without the jury, but that we do not take the standard of a motor car seriously, that we do not take the problems of protecting our employees seriously and that too many accidents occur.</P>
    <P>The problem relating to ICI did not occur only in respect of liability insurance. There were also consistent under-provisions in respect of motor insurance: £500,000 in 1982, £1,600,000 in 1981, £800,000 in 1980 and £2 million in 1979.  I am sure that other companies have under provisions from time to time but they are matched now and then by surpluses, and that was not done in the case of ICI.  The supervisory function of the Department should have alerted the Minister and the House through the Minister.  They should have alerted the Government about the problem which was being built up with regard to ICI.</P>
    <P>As a result of a small investigation of these facts from information available in the Library of this House I extracted those startling figures.  Those same figures were available not only to the Minister but to the board of AIB.  I cannot see why the board of AIB should suggest that they were in some way not able to read the signs with regard to the assessment of the liability in respect of this risk.  I might say that I am a very small shareholder in AIB, but the attitude of their board of directors is in my opinion an absolute disgrace.  The way in which they have sought to duck responsibility in this is disgraceful and any one of them who had the interest of the shareholders at heart and who investigated the affairs of ICI prior to the take-over would have seen the danger signals there in respect of the business in Ireland.  Forget the business in the UK.</P>
    <P>We cannot remove from responsibility <Col N="1800" /> the directors of ICI.  It is not without significance that these are some of the same gentlemen who presided over the debacle in Irish Shipping.  The names keep cropping up.  Foreign adventures seem to have a fixation regarding the directors common to ICI and Irish Shipping. I cannot say anything about the insurance business in London undertaken by ICI but it would appear to have been entered into in an extremely irresponsible way.  As a result, the responsibility for this must be shared by the company, by the board of Allied Irish Banks and as pointed out by Senator O'Donoghue, probably by the supervisory authority in the United Kingdom.  I am not aware of how the supervisory authority in the United Kingdom operate, but it is possible that they too should be the subject of our investigation.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of giving the Minister the authority to commit £20 million of Irish funds to this project but I am not in favour of writing a blank cheque in respect of any unascertained amount of insurance losses abroad.  The Bill in no way commits the Government over a period of time to that and we should not do so.  We should be quite firm about this. I do not mind picking up losses incurred within this country or picking up moderate losses in respect of adventures abroad, but once one gets into the realm of £150 million or £200 million, or a figure of that kind, it is time to cry halt.  This is a limited liability company just like any other.  There is limited liability available to the shareholders of the company, and if we are pushed too far we should use it.</P>
    <P>I understand that the future health of Allied Irish Banks is very important to the economic welfare of the country and I commend the Minister and the Government for taking such steps as were necessary to restore the confidence of the people in the validity and future of Allied Irish Banks.  It is only right and proper that should be done.  However, we must broaden the discussion slightly to recognise that banks in general and banks operating on a wide scale basis in Ireland in particular, retain a special relationship <i>vis-a-vis</i> the economy.  It has been proved <Col N="1801" /> by this Bill that the Government cannot afford to allow a bank to suffer from financial pressure.  The Government, whether they like it or not, must step in and pick up the tab in respect of these foreign adventures by the Allied Irish Banks, or any other bank that may get involved in a similar type of venture.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as a free lunch. For every unwritten guarantee which the banks have of being backed by the Government there is a corresponding responsibility and duty.  They have a responsibility and a duty not to get involved in businesses in which they have no conceivable right to be in.  Banks should not be in a business like insurance where there is virtual unlimited liability in respect of some risks.  There should be an Act of the Oireachtas which stops banks from being involved in businesses like that.  The ability of banks to expand their portfolio and their business activity should be restricted by size and/or type of operation.</P>
    <P>When the banks were campaigning against the bank levy, they pretended to the Members of the Oireachtas that they were only ordinary limited liability companies who should pay ordinary taxes and should be treated in the same way as any other limited liability company but that is not the case.  They have a special relationship with the Central Bank and with the economic health of the country. We have our responsibility to them as a result of that, but they have responsibilities towards us as well.</P>
    <P>I am not enthusiastic about the appointment of an administrator and I do not think that appointment should continue indefinitely.  I have no objection to an administrator being appointed in respect of any business which has already been transacted but if it is intended to keep this company in business in the future, it should be run by a board of directors like any other body, the normal future trading activities of the company should be isolated from the past and the responsibilities for normal trading should be taken from the administrator.</P>
    <P>The appointment of the administrator is peculiar.  He is not appointed by the <Col N="1802" /> Minister but by the court.  He does not take instructions from the Minister.  If this administrator, or any other administrator commits this Government and this Parliament to picking up the tab for his actions, he should be under the control and authority of the Government and the Oireachtas.  If it is decided to continue trading in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland &mdash; and I understand that is the intention and I wish them every success &mdash; it should be done by setting up another company for the purpose of carrying on future business and restrict the administration to the winding up of the old company. I do not want to delay the House or to make any other criticisms of other sections of the Department nor do I want to get into a deep discussion with regard to the type, range and scope of claims and their methods of processing which could well be discussed by this House and the other House in the future.</P>
    <P>There are profitable insurance companies in Ireland making money.  I have mentioned one but there are many others.  They make money by prudence. They do not make money by an irresponsible acceptance of risks.  Similarly, as members of the public and as legislators we must recognise that there are circumstances in which risks we might like to see accepted &mdash; for example, very young people driving cars &mdash; cannot be accepted.  It is not a question of how much we will accept them for, maybe they just cannot be accepted.  That is something we have to recognise.  Maybe it is not right that people should be entitled to drive cars at 17 years of age; maybe young people should not drive cars until they are 18, 19 or 20 years of age, for their own protection and for the protection of members of the public, because of the difficulties which this category of driver has in getting insurance.  We have to educate the public too in that regard.  We have a duty in these matters.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage.  I hope that from time to time the Minister will make available to us sufficient information so that we can discuss the affairs of this company.  Finally, I would like to say to the Minister <Col N="1803" /> that when he is deciding which of his officials should hold the shares in this company he should appoint an official who was not supervising the company up to now rather than the officials who were. We should reward virtue and punish transgression rather than the other way around.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to dwell on the responsibility of AIB or ICI in this matter because that has been dealt with adequately and fully by many previous speakers.  At this stage of the debate perhaps we should be looking to what lessons can be learned from this debacle, what we can do to ensure that it does not happen again, or what we can do to improve the system, quite apart from preventing something as dramatic as happened in this case.  Having regard to what happened the PMPA a few years ago and what happened the ICI, it would be possible not to call into question the effectiveness and the adequacy of the supervisory authority.  The position of the PMPA was widely known and commented upon for almost ten years before it actually collapsed.  I recently came across an article in <i>Business and Finance</i> dated 1975 in which the solvency of the PMPA was questioned and very compelling figures were given to show that solvency was very much in doubt.  The position of that company was continually questioned and brought to the notice of the supervisory authority for eight years before the crash happened and yet nothing was done until the position was so serious that it was too late to do anything. Huge losses were incurred and the insurance companies and, of course, ultimately the policyholders had to pay for the mistakes that were made in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was widely commented upon and known for several years that ICI were taking risks that other companies would not take.  They were under-pricing, taking policies and giving cover at prices which made no sense whatever to other companies and it is quite clear that they were unrealistic.  Senator O'Leary has taken <Col N="1804" /> figures from the blue book which show that they were making inadequate provision for the claims that were arising.  It would be impossible not to reach the conclusion that the supervisory authority has not been effective over these years. I am not necessarily blaming the officials of the Department.  They must not have had adequate resources to do this job.  I do not think they had the expertise to do the job.  It was commented upon that one of the rather absurd things that happens in the Civil Service is, and it happened in this case, that the officials in the Department who were given this job gradually built up some expertise in the matter but were moved to another section.  That is just one example of what happened in that Department.</P>
    <P>The fault, in so far as there is fault, lies with the Minister of the day, the key person who was in charge of the Department, not necessarily the present Minister but successive Ministers who did not organise the supervisory authority adequately, did not give the resources, did not provide the necessary expertise, the actuarial advice and so on.  This led to these two very unfortunate occurrences, one of which we are dealing with today.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the supervisory authority which I should like to comment on and that is the proposition that was made in the Minister's speech that the supervisory authority are not responsible for what may happen when a company in this country have an office abroad.  It is asserted that in such a case that is the responsibility of the supervisory authority in the other country wherever the office may be.  The supervisory authority exists to ensure that an insurance company remain viable, that they are able to pay their claims, that there is no breakdown affecting the citizens of the country and no breakdown of a major kind which may even affect the economy of the country as almost happened in this case.  There is little use in having a supervisory authority examining under a microscope the home business of an insurance company and ignoring what happened abroad, as happened in the case of the ICI.  If the foreign business is <Col N="1805" /> in trouble and if risks are taken which could lead to a very serious collapse of the company, then quite obviously the Irish office would be affected and, would be unable to pay their claims.  Irish citizens would be affected.  It is really pointless to have a situation where what is happening abroad is not the responsibility of the Department or the Government if it gets out of control.</P>
    <P>Placing responsibility on a foreign supervisory authority can be useless and in this case it appears to have been ineffective because London is, as Senator O'Leary said, regarded as a place where there is a very high degree of simplification in regard to insurance.  Consequently one would expect that the supervisory authority there would be highly sophisticated and highly effective.  Nevertheless, they did not seem to be able to realise what was happening in this case.  If that is the position in London, what is it like in several other countries which may have an insurance company with offices here and we may be relying on the supervisory authority in those countries to ensure that the Irish company's foreign office are not doing something which may lead to trouble?</P>
    <P>There are EC regulations and the supervisory authority in the other country would probably insist on examining the activities of the Irish company in their country.  I see no reason whatever why the supervisory authority here should not accept responsibility for the company's activities abroad and why it should not get the returns from that country and look at them in exactly the same way as they look at what happens here at home. There would not seem to be any insurmountable difficulty for an Irish company which had an office in London in sending two sets of returns, one to the supervisory authority in London and the other to the supervisory authority in Dublin so that the supervisory authority here will know what is happening and ensure that the activities of the company in London or abroad are under control.  If they do not do that, the end result will be that the company may get into trouble and that <Col N="1806" /> could affect not merely the people abroad but the citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate in this House and the other House there was a good deal of talk about the legal system and legal costs.  We are debating the collapse of ICI which was not due to their activities or trading in this country but mainly to what happened abroad in America and so on.  Nevertheless in the course of the debate we found that not only abroad but in this country they were trading at a loss and that a great deal of new money had to be injected to keep them from getting into trouble.  Again, the question of the legal system in this country has been referred to on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>The legal costs in this country are certainly high but overall they are nothing like some of the figures suggested in the course of the debate.  Examples were given of cases in which costs were four or five times the damages, where the plaintiff got something like 20 per cent of what the legal costs were.  It is possible to pick out a case like that but it is far from being typical.  The statistics are there.  It is quite easy to find them.  They have been reported on on many occasions. They have appeared in a number of different reports over the years.  They have been fairly consistent over the years.</P>
    <P>For many years 16 per cent of all the money paid out by insurance companies for claims consisted of legal costs.  In recent years when VAT was put on legal costs, that added another 23 per cent so that that figure went up to between 20 per cent and 21 per cent.  Of the total amount that insurance companies pay out in claims to people injured in accidents, marginally under 80 per cent goes in damages and marginally over 20 per cent goes in legal costs.  That is the figure.  I am not suggesting that it is an entirely satisfactory figure.  I am not suggesting that every effort should not be made to try to bring it down.  That is the figure, and not the kind of figure that has been bandied around in the course of the debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to look again at the system of dealing with claims, <Col N="1807" /> the system whereby an injured party brings his case before the court and looks for damages for the injuries and loss he suffered.  One of the first matters that comes up for discussion and comment is the question of juries.  It has been suggested that juries should be abolished.  The Minister for Finance said in the other House that this question was under consideration and was going to be modified. I am not quite sure what &ldquo;modified&rdquo; means.  I hope it means abolished.  I believe juries should be abolished.  I do not think they serve any useful purpose. It should be remembered that we had the same system as the one which exists in the UK.  We had the same system when the State was founded here.  The UK had juries for negligence actions.  Because of the war effort, during the Second World War they decided that they could not spare people to act on juries.  They abolished them for the duration and they never went back to juries.  They have managed very well since then without juries.</P>
    <P>I believe juries no longer serve any useful purpose.  They should be eliminated at this stage.  It would be a very useful contribution to bringing down the cost of claims and the cost of the legal system.  For the same kind of injuries, the damages given here by a jury are very often twice as high as those given in the UK.  For example, in the case of the loss of an eye, or a fractured hip, or something of that kind, the damages given here are in or about twice as much.  That has been the position for some time past.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that damages are not only too high but sometimes too low. They vary very widely indeed.  Because for some time now every member of the public has been entitled to be on a jury, it used to be householders only.  This means that people probably only act on a jury once or twice in their lives.  In a serious action where a person has serious injuries, probably most of the jury have never been in such an action before and have no idea of what is an appropriate amount of damages to give.  Not only have they no idea, but there is a strict <Col N="1808" /> rule that neither the judge nor counsel can assist them in the matter, or suggest to them what an appropriate amount should be.  Because of that, damages vary widely.  By and large they tend to be generous. Very often they are too generous and this leads to an appeal and extra cost. That means a new trial and the whole procedure costs very much more than is necessary.  That is the position about damages.  Without juries, damages would be less and the cost of ascertaining what damages should be would be less.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that it is not only in regard to damages.  Juries also have to decide very difficult points of liability, not only in road accidents where the average member of the jury possibly drives a car and may have some idea as to the rights and wrongs and the obligations of drivers, and so on, but in many cases they are dealing with accidents in factories, and so on.  They have to deal with very difficult points in regard to the obligations of an employer.  In such cases it is not surprising that juries come to conclusions that do not appear to be correct. There are appeals on these points. There are new trials and an accumulation of costs.</P>
    <P>The whole system of juries leads to more and more appeals, new trials and accumulation of costs.  The jury trial itself takes much longer than would be taken without a jury.  A case which could be dealt with by a judge in a day can take two days and sometimes longer before a jury.  This leads to extra costs.  The whole system leads to a very much higher cost of trying cases as well as much higher damages.  I hope when the Minister said that the Government were considering modification of the jury system he really meant abolishing it.  It would be absurd to tinker with the system.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for one moment that abolishing the jury system is the only thing that can be done or should be done. It is a very important first step.  There are other reforms which could be introduced. Most of these could be introduced more effectively in the absence of a jury. Although some of the points made by Senator O'Donoghue could be very <Col N="1809" /> useful, they would raise some important constitutional issues.  I am not sure that they could be introduced without very serious change in the law.</P>
    <P>One of the points which has been made, and which has often been referred to, is the question of the delay in having a case brought before the court.  Although that was the case some time ago, I have to say that a great improvement has been made in this regard in recent years principally due to the former President of the High Court, now the Chief Justice, and the present President of the High Court. The position now is that a case that is set down for trial can be heard within about seven months.  If it is not heard within seven months, then it is not the fault of the system.  The courts are now geared to deal with the list that is before them within seven months, which is as satisfactory and efficient as one could expect. The delays in the law, if they exist now, are not the fault of the system.  They may be the fault of the person himself, or a solicitor, or somebody who does not avail of the system that exists.</P>
    <P>The question of appropriate damages must arise in the context of what I have been saying because there are, of course, many different views about this.  Those who support the retention of juries say that the awards in the UK are sometimes ridiculously low and that it would be wrong to adopt that system.  They argue, why should awards be less than they are here at the present time?  Who can put a figure on pain and suffering?  Who can say that the figures very often awarded in this country for pain and suffering are wrong, that they are too high, because it is impossible to measure pain and suffering? Of course, it is impossible to measure pain and suffering and it is quite true to say that if a person gets, perhaps, £100,000 for the loss of an eye the argument can be used, would you voluntarily lose an eye for £100,000?  Of course, very few people would.  But there must be some limit, some yardstick, some system. Certainly, the system that applies in this country at the moment tends to give awards which are unrealistic and which, I think, are impossible to continue.  The <Col N="1810" /> fact of the matter is that the insurance industry cannot continue to afford to pay the kind of damages that have been paid in recent years.  They cannot afford to pay the damages which some people here arguing in favour of juries say are merely adequate.</P>
    <P>One must look at the whole condition of the insurance industry at present to realise that there is a limit to what can be paid in damages.  It is quite obvious from recent events that the insurance industry is under very severe strain.  When you look at what happened to PMPA and ICI, when you look at recent figures from the blue book which show, in regard to damages and in regard to losses arising from the insurance industry's insurance of motor accidents and factory accidents, that in 1981 there was a collective loss of £24 million on this kind of insurance.  In 1982 there was a collective loss to virtually all the insurance companies.  There was not a single one that made money. In 1982 it was £74 million.  In 1983 it was £97 million, almost £100 million and we do not yet know what the figure is for 1984.  In these circumstances, it is quite clear that an insurance company can only remain solvent and in business by increasing premiums drastically.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is an outcry because premiums are already too high. The insurance companies would be the first to admit that premiums are too high. They have to try to collect premiums. They know the resistance from their clients but, on the other hand, if damages are going to continue to be paid on the basis of what has been done up to now, then premiums will have to go up.  We must face up to the fact that premiums will have to continue to go higher and higher &mdash; which would have a very serious effect, not only on motorists but on employers who would find it almost impossible to remain in business.  We cannot have it both ways.  The damages must be curtailed in some way or the premiums will have to go so high that the whole system will be inoperable.  Possibly one of the good things that arises from the matter we are discussing is that we are being forced to face up to this <Col N="1811" /> dilemma.  This whole matter is very unfortunate for the people who are involved in one way or another and for the economic life of this country.  I can only hope that we will learn some lessons from it, that there will be a tightening up, changes and reforms in the areas which I have mentioned and in other areas, and that some good will come out of what has happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to make a few general observations on non-life insurance and, like Senator Ryan, to focus on the jury system in High Court actions.  The non-life insurance industry in Ireland, in common with experience in other countries in the EC, the USA, Australia and so on, has suffered serious underwriting losses in recent years.  The most common reason for these adverse results in all countries is a greater claims consciousness by the public, aided by an increasingly involved and interested legal system.  Actions by trade unions also have contributed in encouraging their members in relation to accidents which, of course, they feel is their legitimate function. Then there is the extraordinary increase in crime-related claims &mdash; for example, burglaries, house breaking, car thefts and particularly arson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our legal system can be criticised on two fronts.  Penalties imposed by the courts are usually inadequate and the widely fluctuating jury awards in High Court cases have now brought the £600 million non-life insurance industry to a sorry state.  According to the 1983 blue book of Irish-controlled undertakings, premium income was £243,172,000 of which the Insurance Corporation and the PMPA combined have £115,245,000.  In other words, almost 50 per cent of the non-life business has now been forced into State hands.  Failure to manage by insurers can be a contributory cause of losses to the insurance industry.  Indeed, the serious lack of management control in the Insurance Corporation has already been underlined by the Minister in his opening statement and was an important <Col N="1812" /> contributory cause to the present problem.</P>
    <P>Much emphasis has been placed on the London branch of the Insurance Corporation. The same company, however, has Irish underwriting losses of approximately £43 million which is very serious in itself.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reference the Minister made in the other House to the review of the jury system.  Like Senator Eoin Ryan, I want to make the case for the abolition of juries in High Court actions.  I welcome the fact that Senator Eoin Ryan, himself a practicising lawyer advocates the abolition of juries.  But I suspect that his views on the abolition of juries are not shared by a majority of his profession.  Consequently, the onus rests fairly and squarely on the Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan, his Department and through him the Government, to bring forward legislation which I hope will propose the abolition of juries and not to tinker with the problem in some other way.</P>
    <P>First let me take personal injury actions in Ireland.  The jury are required to make decisions both as to the liability and the amount.  However, the reality is that the normal jury have no competence to decide on what is an appropriate amount to award for any particular injury or disablement.  Senator Eoin Ryan underlined the lack of experience of jurors in serving on juries.  It is unrealistic to expect 12 people, with little or no knowledge or experience of such matters, not only to take decisions on legal liability but also to assess damages.  Inevitably this results in awards which are inconsistent, unreliable and totally unpredictable. Moreover &mdash; and perhaps this is one of the most compelling reasons for the abolition of juries &mdash; latterly jurors do not anymore represent what is termed ordinary citizens.  For example, in practice most people in business and the professions manage to extricate themselves from jury service.  With increasing frequency teenagers are serving as jurors. Ireland is the only country in Europe where compensation for personal injury is assessed by juries.  The level of compensation awarded for personal injury in <Col N="1813" /> Ireland is considerably more generous than is the case in Great Britain where the jury system was abandoned in civil actions some 40 years ago.  The level of motor insurance premiums is directly related to the level of compensation paid. The British motorist, therefore pays far less for his insurance than does his Irish counterpart.  High premiums encourage people to remain uninsured.  It is estimated that one-fifth of Irish motorists have no insurance, a point to which I shall return later.  The unpredictability of jury awards inhibits early settlement of claims and encourages claimants to develop exaggerated and unrealistic expectations of the compensation which they should receive.</P>
    <P>It also leads to far too many very expensive appeals to the Supreme Court. To those who argue that the Supreme Court is there to control excessive awards in the High Court, I say this is absolutely no answer to the situation.  Appeals to the Supreme Court are a very expensive process.  The unreliability and unpredictability of jury awards, as well as being unfair to defendants, can create injustices for the injured parties.  Two people with identical injuries would be most unlikely to obtain similar damages from two different juries and in all probability would be awarded significantly different sums by way of compensation.  Such a system is manifestly unfair to both plaintiffs and defendants.</P>
    <P>The jury system is cumbersome, unwieldy and timewasting.  Because it is necessary for the issues to be explained in the most minute detail to the members of the jury, trials continue for much longer than if they were held before a judge alone.  A battery of professional witnesses may be required, such as doctors, engineers, architects and so on, to give verbal evidence and be subjected to cross-examination, all for the benefit of the jury.  Much of this could be dispensed with and replaced by documentary evidence, such as medical reports, if there were no jury.</P>
    <P>The delays are such that a large backlog has developed in the High Court, a very serious matter in itself.  The jury system is <Col N="1814" /> extremely expensive.  In most High Court actions four lawyers act for each party &mdash; a solicitor, one junior counsel and two senior counsel.  In my book this is one big racket which must be terminated.  The professional witnesses, to whom I have referred already, must also be paid &mdash; and this compounds the cost problem &mdash; sometimes for merely sitting in the courthouse waiting to be called.  It is estimated that the cost of litigation accounts for some 20 per cent &mdash; Senator Ryan said 20 to 21 per cent &mdash; of the total amount paid out by insurance companies in injury cases.  Twenty per cent may sound a relatively reasonable proportion of the damages but when this is translated in terms of money that has to be paid out by insurance companies it is a very substantial sum.</P>
    <P>As far as the Bill before us is concerned, the unpredictability and unreliability of the jury system, coupled with the delay in having cases brought to trial, creates severe difficulties for insurance companies in attempting to estimate outstanding liabilities.  This has been a key problem in the case of companies that have got into trouble in the recent past. This has been a major contributory factor in the problems and losses which have affected a number of companies recently.</P>
    <P>I want to focus now on the grave impact of the jury system on employer's liability insurance and its consequences for thousands of industrial jobs.  Employer's liability insurance this year is expected to cost industry approximately £70 million, an average increase of 30 to 50 per cent on last year.  This cost on industry has very serious implications for employment. The Government profess that unemployment is the key social, political and economic problem facing them.  To take remedial action in this regard is one way of protecting existing jobs.  Money which is urgently required to maintain output and employment, not to mention increasing both, must be diverted to pay higher insurance costs.  As a consequence, thousands of industrial jobs are placed at risk.  The insurance companies are forced greatly to increase the cost of employer's liability insurance because of <Col N="1815" /> the excessive level of damages awarded by juries in the High Court together with the huge legal costs associated with the system.  As in the case of personal injury claims, appeals in respect of employer's liability awards made in the High Court have been subsequently reduced on appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Of course, cases are heard before the Supreme Court sitting without a jury. Appeals to the Supreme Court are no answer to the problem because of the very expensive legal costs inherent in making such appeals.  Because of the excessive levels of damages awarded by juries in employer's liability cases Irish industry ultimately must pay for the excessive jury awards through increased premiums.  The losses incurred by insurance companies, mainly as a consequence of jury awards in respect of employer's liability claims, have increased from £11 million in 1981 to £34 million in 1983.  The ultimate consequence of this is increased premiums on Irish firms with the obvious consequences for job maintenance.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that there is an overwhelming case for the abolition of the jury system as it applies to employer's liability insurance claims.  I hold the same view with regard to personal injury claims.  For both types of cases the jury system has since been abolished in Britain, where judges sitting alone decide on the levels of the claims.  Over time these judges have built up precedents on the level of damages.  The British experience shows also that, without juries, there are fewer and quicker trials and quicker settlement of claims with consequential savings.  Judges sitting alone will bring a degree of logic and realism to the levels of awards in injury cases and this will reduce premiums to a more acceptable level.  The consistency that would flow from the judge's decisions, sitting alone would encourage solicitors acting for their clients to settle before going to court and thereby reduce legal costs.  While some cases are settled before they reach court, a solicitor is normally unlikely to settle the case before going to court because, given the unpredictability of <Col N="1816" /> jury awards, he does not know what his client is likely to be awarded.</P>
    <P>I want to return to the indication of action on juries by the Minister for Justice and by the Government.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Justice is reviewing the question of the jury system.  I hope firm proposals will be brought before the Government in a short time.  Last year I criticised the jury system when speaking on the Road Traffic Bill, but there has been no action in the meantime.  It is regrettable that we have to have one further crisis before we get action from the Minister and the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I take issue with a number of points the Minister for Justice is reported to have made, as indicated in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 28 March 1985.  The Minister is reported as saying that it did not necessarily follow that a judge sitting alone would recommend a lower damages figure than a jury.  This is incorrect.  Time after time the Supreme Court, sitting without a jury, have reduced, on appeal, excessive awards made by High Court juries.  In the same article Deputy Noonan is reported as saying that the insurance companies had not demonstrated that the abolition of the present jury system would result in lower awards. That follows logically from experience. Many claims are settled outside the court, but they are heavily influenced by the level of awards granted in the courts.  I am convinced that the abolition of juries would result in lower awards and I would be very surprised if the Minister for Justice could demonstrate otherwise.</P>
    <P>The question of uninsured drivers has serious implications for the level of premiums and for the viability of insurance companies.  In the present economic climate many drivers cannot afford to pay higher premiums.  Therefore, they take risks and hope they will not be caught.  It is estimated that Ireland has the highest level of uninsured drivers in Europe. There are 20 per cent here compared with 8 per cent in Great Britain and as low as 1 per cent in other European countries. There may be a case for some leniency in the first offence of uninsured driving <Col N="1817" /> but I strongly urge that in the case of a second or subsequent offence the fine should be the equivalent of the value of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>I call for the abolition of the jury system in High Court actions.  Without the abolition of juries in personal injury cases the present untenable situation can only become worse.  Senator Ryan has echoed this by saying that the insurance companies cannot afford to go on making the types of awards they are obliged to make.  Given the crisis we now have in connection with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, it behaves the Government to take action forthwith on the jury system.  Secondly, the cost of employer's liability insurance should be brought into line with other countries.  Thousands of jobs which are genuinely at risk at present because of high insurance costs would be that much more secure after the abolition of the jury system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill in that I support the Government's action in the crisis with which we were presented with regard to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  The Government had to take emergency action because they had a direct need to uphold the position where employers have to keep up the employer's liability insurance for their workers and their public liability insurance.  The Government could not allow a situation to develop where a major insurance company failed, putting many people out of employment because of the insurance situation.  Secondly, the Government were put in the position where, in order to maintain the viability and stability of our banking system this kind of action had to be taken.  Given the situation with which they were presented, the action they took was the right one.  They had to deal with the emergency as they found it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not mean that there are not questions to be asked about the background to this situation.  Quite a number of aspects have already been mentioned in the debate.  I am pleased that in various statements the Minister for Finance and other Ministers have said that it will not be the taxpayer who will pay for the difficulties of the Insurance Corporation <Col N="1818" /> of Ireland.  It may not directly be the taxpayer, but whatever kind of levy is put on the banks or on the insurance companies, this will come back in the end to the ordinary person who is either using the banking system or buying insurance. It is no use to imagine that this finance will come out of the air.  Whatever additional cost is put on the banking system or the insurance system works its way down to the consumer of these services.  Whether we pay as taxpayers or as people who have bank accounts or insurance policies, we can be sure that eventually we will pay.</P>
    <P>When the crisis arose over the PMPA Insurance Company there was a feeling in this House, in the other House and among the public that this was an individual crisis, a once-off situation, where this insurance company had got into difficulties and had to be rescued.  With this second crisis and the various facts that have been revealed, it appears that the insurance industry is suffering from a very severe sickness.  We need to look at the insurance industry and the various factors that go to make it up.  It is essential that the Government should do this through their supervisory authority, and by other means.  Otherwise we will find ourselves repeating rescue operations and dealing again and again with what might be described as crisis management, rather than planning ahead and making sense out of the insurance industry.</P>
    <P>A great deal of attention has been drawn, in particular by Senator Hillery, to the jury system.  I have no axe to grind about this because this is not an area with which I am particularly familiar or with which I deal.  But, it is not nearly enough just to say the jury system is appalling and, if we cure this, the situation will clear up.  There may be excessive awards and there may be difficulties with legal costs, but the vast majority of cases never come to a jury to be decided.  A lawyer can practice at a lower level for years and deal with the initial drafting of proceedings in personal injury cases or employees injury cases without a case coming to hearing.  The vast majority of them are settled so that the jury decisions <Col N="1819" /> are not as statistically frequent as might appear.</P>
    <P>While I do not want to go into all the details of what Senator Hillery said, he has some rather odd ideas about the rules of evidence as they apply before a judge sitting alone, as well as before a judge sitting with a jury, as far as documentary evidence is concerned.  He is a little over-optimistic about the consistency of judicial decisions from one judge to another as regards either money matters or any other matter.  When Senator Hillery talks about the level of Supreme Court decisions and the reduction of jury awards he should remember that it is only in cases where the awards appear to be particularly out of line that they are appealed. One cannot make a very telling argument about the level of awards from the cases that go to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>However, my feeling is that we must as a community think a lot more about our own part in this and not just try to get out of it as easily as we can by saying, it is the jury system and if we do away with that everything will be lovely.  The reason there are so many personal injury claims through road traffic accidents is that there is a very high level of road traffic accidents here.  There is a very high level of road traffic accidents where drink is a factor.  Only an average of 40 per cent of people here wear seat belts despite the fact that this has been legally compulsory since 1979.  The figure is something like 40 per cent here and something like 90 per cent in Northern Ireland where the law was brought in more recently.  Most people know, and any lawyer dealing with personal injury actions knows, that the wearing of seat belts is not just a safety measure and if one does not wear a seat belt it is regarded as contributory negligence and, therefore, may cut down the award given.  Those who drive around the city of Dublin or, indeed, in rural areas and look at the standard of driving will come to the conclusion that it is no wonder there is a very high level of road accidents here.</P>
    <P>There are very large numbers of awards in personal injury actions because <Col N="1820" /> there are very large numbers of accidents, regardless of the level of each individual award, and that is something we are all responsible for as a community. Do we go out driving when we have had too much to drink?  Do we forget to wear our seat belts?  Do we take unnecessary risks when we are passing other people on the road?  They are the factors that build up claims and raise insurance premium levels for motor insurance just as much as the jury system.</P>
    <P>With regard to employer's liability, how much attention do we really pay to safety at work?  We have had fairly recent legislation on safety at work and yet there is a feeling among people that insurance will pay off for any amount of carelessness, whether carelessness by the employer or carelessness by the worker. That is the kind of public attitude which builds up claims and causes the rise in employer's liability insurance.  We need to look at those issues as well as the legal issues.  I am not saying we should not look at the jury issue, of course we should and we should look at the legal costs issue too to try to cut them down as much as possible, but we cannot just escape our own responsibility.</P>
    <P>I very much support what Senator Eoin Ryan said about the need to look into the supervisory system of insurance and to ensure that we do not just supervise what happens here but supervise what Irish companies do abroad.  We need to look into the part played in this situation by auditors, both as protectors of shareholders, as protectors of creditors and as protectors of the public.  Their role is envisaged in the Companies Act as being also an element in the supervision of what companies do.  It is important that we look into that and make sure they are fulfilling that role properly and are not shifting their responsibilities on to somebody else.  As far as the supervisory role of companies operating abroad is concerned it is essential to try to set up and operate properly some kind of system, for instance within the EC, which would supervise companies from one country to another and create warning signals when difficulties are about to occur.  One <Col N="1821" /> cannot help saying this because in this case it is so difficult to understand how it is that the authorities in Allied Irish Banks can say that they were unaware of difficulties and that until their auditors told them what was happening in London just a few weeks before the Government took action, they did not know.  I am a person, for instance, who has virtually no expertise in high finance, a person who simply reads the newspapers and the odd business magazine and so on, and yet certainly it was drawn to my attention months ago that there were problems with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland operations in London in particular. I really find it incredible that the management of a major organisation like Allied Irish Banks first of all can say that they did not know what was going on and, secondly, did not read what was in the newspapers and immediately carry out very full investigations.</P>
    <P>The Government in dealing with this matter not only must safeguard the public and the banking system but must make the management of Allied Irish Banks feel their responsibility for this.  I know that the decision of the bank to pay as high a dividend as it would in any case has caused considerable concern and, indeed, rage among ordinary members of the public.  Yet I can well understand that part of the reason for that was that the bank must maintain their secure image to investors and so on.  The fact is that the public has an image of shareholders in the bank as being rich individuals who have money invested in this way whereas, in fact, probably most of the shareholders are institutional shareholders or small investors.  It is a simplistic way to look at the matter and say they should not have paid any dividends if they made such a mess of things.  I would suggest that if the Government are considering imposing levies through the banking system, or through the insurance system that the other banks and insurance companies should not be asked to pay up to the same level as Allied Irish Banks who, after all, have the responsibility for this.  Whether it takes a long time or a short time, their management must be made to feel <Col N="1822" /> responsible by being asked to pay very considerably more towards the rescue moves than any other financial institution.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill but the need for such Bills in the future should be reduced or, if possible, eliminated by looking at the whole insurance sector and trying to deal with all the factors I have mentioned. There should be a very distinct improvement in the supervisory system so that early warning signals come through to both management and Government before matters reach the stage they reached in this company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The shock absorbing capacity of the public has been sorely tested in recent years with major closures of one kind or another but the extraordinary saga of ICI hits at the very nerve centre of economic life here.  It is most regrettable that it should happen, both from the point of view of the private sector and the banking industry as a whole.  I accept that the Government have an extremely difficult problem and that it was absolutely essential to mount a support operation for AIB and ICI to ensure that the banking system and the insured were protected.  However, I do not accept that the taxpayer is out of the woods.  In that regard I should like to refer to Minister Collins's statement that the prospect of the direct Exchequer funding was to all intents and purposes removed.  That statement, and another later and the evidence available to the Government lead me to believe that there is an uncertainty as to where all this will end.  Because of that, I want to indicate to the Minister the disquiet, difficult to describe, among the public at the initial decision of the Government to take over the Insurance Corporation of Ireland and at the prospect that the ordinary taxpayer already beleaguered, would have to undertake the heavy burden of financing a share of the rescue package.  We can accept that the Government should have intervened but it is clear that they did so in the initial stages without considering the full implications of this decision.  It is abundantly clear <Col N="1823" /> that the Government did not negotiate with the AIB on the basis that the taxpayer would not have to pay any share of the rescue package.  The Government too readily accepted that there was no other solution.  We had an early statement that the Cabinet did not have a clue as to the total extent of the loss and that a mini-budget could not be ruled out.</P>
      <P>In the earlier moments of this shattering collapse the Government indicated that AIB, the Central Bank, the insurance companies and finally the taxpayers would have to carry the can.  It is fair to say that the Government, by this earlier action, inflamed public opinion and unintentionally or otherwise did no service to AIB who themselves, in their smug presentation of the case, scored an own goal.</P>
      <P>My colleagues and others have referred this afternoon to the difficulties in the insurance business.  They are in two areas, at management level and at policy level.  This is the second major insurance collapse within two years.  We still have not learned the lesson from these experiences. Other Senators have outlined in some detail &mdash; I will not go into it at this late hour &mdash; the well-known documented facts relating to the problems in the industry and these are again more recently evident in the recent edition of the blue book.</P>
      <P>Insurance companies operating within the EC are obliged to present their annual accounts and meet strict solvency margins before their annual licence can be renewed.  Can the Minister inform us if this requirement is being met in other areas, or is there a possibility that some other accounts are deficient, cannot be understood or hide some serious aspects of their businesses?  It is extraordinary that the insurance licensing authorities in this country and in the UK, as far as this saga is concerned, could not have known about or been more suspicious of this situation since many people outside that arena altogether had information available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that there is only 30 <Col N="1824" /> per cent of the business of this company operated in Ireland and that the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism were primarily concerned with that aspect of it and that the remaining 70 per cent of the business, which was London-based, came under the auspices of the Ministry of Trade in the UK.  Were there any contacts between the two Departments or when was the last time that any substantial contact had been made between the two Departments on a company involved in both countries and obviously not meeting the EC requirement as far as solvency margins were concerned?  Has the Minister information from AIB as to the investigation that they commissioned before investing the £30 million indicated?  The argument is made that at that stage AIB were minority shareholders and did not have access to all the information, but for a bank who do the rest of their business very well it seems in that instance that the management or the people concerned left a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>The disquiet among the public had to be seen to be believed.  Even though some Fianna Fáil Senators have taken the credit for the action by the Government it is quite clear that their own backbenchers have to share in some of that credit. In the light of the earlier action by the Government most people would ask whether, in the event of ICI making a huge profit for the bank, the taxpayer would share in these gains?  It was obviously proven that there was inadequate research, that there was indecisiveness, particularly as far as the transactions in London were concerned, yet the initial proposal was for part of the rescue to be carried by the taxpayer.  Is it true that the management of ICI in London were involved in extremely high risk and wildly speculative insurance cover?  What information do we have in relation to this aspect of the whole business? It is in this precise area that the ongoing difficulties are going to present themselves.</P>
    <P>Some speakers have referred to the fact that when AIB took over this company the profits for the previous years <Col N="1825" /> and their track record were very good. How can one be satisfied about the track record of any company where, on the best evidence put forward by the Minister, it could take three or four years to know the extent of their liability in certain cases? What then would the profits for 1985 mean, if there was a profit, when unknown claims which were on channel but might not be paid for a couple of years could totally shatter that kind of situation?  That is why the solvency margin area is so important in all of this. Have we any evidence or information as to what the next few years are going to tell, particularly as they relate to the London office?  Would it be true to say that the London base, with the wrong pricing policy, attracted the business that I have referred to and was an easy prey where other insurance companies were very reluctant to become involved?  It is clear that that office in particular, and that is not exonerating what has taken place here, has done a blatant disservice to this country and has to be held accountable for the ineptitude and downright carelessness.  In their scope and potential the activities of ICI in London border on the criminal.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear &mdash; and other Senators have made this point &mdash; that the problems in ICI were there at the time when AIB took over the company.  Was there a deliberate deception or what kind of modern accounting and data technology was being used?  The Minister of State for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism placed the cost of this whole debacle between £50 million and £120 million and £120 million at the very limit.  In the next breath he tells us that it will take five or six weeks to know the extent.  Is he entirely satisfied that the £120 million is the outside limit?  Would the AIB have jeopardised their public standing and credibility if that was the total extent of the problem?</P>
    <P>One can argue that no bank can live with an uncertainty of this magnitude but when one now knows that the Central Bank was prepared to become involved in the funding of the rescue package, could that not have been done initially, <Col N="1826" /> or is there a lot more yet to come which AIB could not possibly stand up against for the future?  One has to assume, or is forced to assume, that when the AIB took the extreme action they took, they were afraid that the continuing problems could dismantle their whole business. Thankfully the action of the Government, while I do not agree with the stance they adopted in the first week or ten days, has at least averted that kind of more serious problem though the situation is serious enough.</P>
    <P>We welcome the intervention of the Central Bank.  The Central Bank should ensure that they monitor much more closely any future involvement by any of the commercial banks in risk business outside the parameter of normal banking business.  After this experience the most rigorous examination should be applied by the Central Bank in any proposals of a similar nature.</P>
    <P>One of the overriding principles in all of this has to be that where a person or the bank invests in a project where they hope that their money will be richly rewarded, they cannot transfer the loss if the gamble goes wrong.  There has been a lot of criticism of the AIB during the afternoon and in this instance the condemnation of the management and the whole process of the examination of ICI is justified.  I would like, however, to put it on the record that the AIB is an essential part of Irish economic life.  It has taken a morale battering in this case. It is an institution that has made a lot of strides.  It underpins about 25 per cent of the banking business and has a sizeable part of our external business.  Through its network of services, its borrowings and savings, it affects the public and both commercial and public life to a very considerable degree.  By and large it has performed well in the economy.  Its financial strength and liquidity is of serious concern and obviously in this matter public confidence plays a very significant role.</P>
    <P>I wish to support those Senators who have encouraged the Minister in regard to the line he took in the earlier part of his statement in the matter of improving the monitoring and regulatory process. <Col N="1827" /> One can perhaps blame the Department for some errors in this regard but I am one who believes in the importance of having the skills in the Department to monitor and regulate these processes.  However, there is no replacement for good management. The availability of the best personnel in the world to monitor these kinds of situations would not prevent ultimate failure if management were to fail.  All one can hope for is that the warning lights that Senator McGuinness referred to would be detected as early as possible and that the long and final chapters in bolting the door when the horse has gone would be reduced to a minimum.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what has been said during the afternoon that the ICI in their business transactions had lower reserve ratios than the rest of the insurance companies. It is clear also that the mounting claims were considerably more that the reserve capital and that if you work this in reverse, the profits for earlier years could be very easily without real foundation.</P>
    <P>We need a shake up in the whole insurance industry.  We need changes in the legal code.  Reference has been made to the abolition of the jury system.  Companies need to have a proper pricing policy.  I accept in general what Senator McGuinness said with regard to this but I differ from her on a fundamental point, that is, where she puts a lot of the blame on the public for the accident ratios and other claims where they feel that insurance companies are easy prey and open to exorbitant claims.  I put it to the House that many insurance companies in the way that they present their policies attract this problem because selling insurance is all about indicating to the public what will be available to them in the event of this or that happening.  As well as making the public aware of what they may be entitled to, the companies themselves in sponsoring and promoting their schemes attract some of the problems.</P>
    <P>One has only to think for a minute of the effect of some earlier closures.  I referred to the PMPA and I have in mind people in my own constituency, at least <Col N="1828" /> half a dozen, who are in the very relatively small investor category and who were involved in PMPS.  I do not have to indicate the trauma that these families and others suffered in that respect.  This is one of the reasons for many people in other areas asking why in this instance it seemed as if the bank were being allowed off the hook, whereas many others down through the years had to carry the can for the mistakes of senior management in other companies.  The Minister referred to the intervention of the Central Bank and to the funding.  Am I correct in assuming that in this case, unlike the PMPA, there will be no further levy on insurance companies, or, alternatively, to what extent are other lending institutions outside the AIB to be involved in the rescue package?  When ordinary people make mistakes they are asked to dispose of part of their assets and in this case, since the AIB have been involved in a number of quite successful ventures, they should be asked to dispose of some of their assets as a solution to this problem.  Their readiness to do this, provided it does not do any long term damage to them, would help to alleviate public disquiet and, perhaps, have the effect of renewing confidence, even to a greater extent, in the bank.  I ask the Minister to ensure that when the Central Bank are working out this solution &mdash; I suppose it will be done in secrecy &mdash; the most equitable scheme for all concerned is worked out because in the final analysis, this will find its way back to the public in one way or another.  It is crucial that the taxpayers are protected and that the AIB, the lending institution and the insured public are enabled to continue their business at a high level.</P>
    <P>I have a final question in relation to the establishment of this semi-State organisation, small as it is.  What are the proposals in relation to the slimming down of ICI and will they be continuing at a high level of operation?  If this is so, the State should be involved to the minimum possible and only in circumstances where there is absolutely no other course.  We generally welcome the Bill. We will be supporting it on Second Stage <Col N="1829" /> and hope that the measures contained in it will resolve this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not speak for long. To say there is a crisis in the insurance industry is putting it mildly.  The collapse of the ICI is affecting not only the insurance industry but the financial world. Their creditworthiness has been shaken to its very roots.  The banking and insurance industry are supposed to operate under strict Government guidelines. What went wrong with the monitoring system on this occasion?  Did we not learn the lesson from the PMPA?  There are more questions to be asked about the collapse of the ICI.  Are the controls governing the insurance companies adequate and being implemented?  Do the staff have the confidence to monitor these large and complex industries?  Has the Minister given the staff necessary resources to carry out their statutory duties?</P>
      <P>What is the point in these large insurance companies making audited returns to the Department if these returns are not accurate accounts of their trading position and of their financial situation? I suggest the introduction of inspection procedures that would give the Minister and his representatives full access at any time to all the records of every insurance company.  Not alone would this protect these large institutions but it would also protect the interests of the small depositor, policyholder and the employees who have found themselves completely at risk in recent events.  A number of functions, including the role of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, should be included in this review which should be carried out as urgently as possible.  If these officials are to discharge their duties competently, it is incumbent on the Minister responsible to ensure that they have the training, resources and statutory powers to carry out their functions properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would seem that not only were regulations flouted nationally on this occasion but that guidelines laid down by the EC were also transgressed.  How many more crises do we need before the Government take appropriate action?  We have had a <Col N="1830" /> number of Government appointed bodies looking at the problems of the insurance industry both before and after the PMPA crisis and it appears as if we have learned no lessons.</P>
    <P>The time has come for complete reappraisal of the whole insurance system in this country.  For example, one out of every five cars is without insurance cover. This does not take into account the most recent phenomenon of the car thieves.  I ask the Minister to look at some of the systems that are in operation in motor insurance throughout the world.  For instance in certain American states, basic third party insurance is automatically linked with the car registration and licence. You cannot drive a car without the basic third party insurance.</P>
    <P>Our uninsured rate here of 20 per cent as against the rest of Europe which is around 3 to 4 per cent probably reflects our general attitude to law breaking. Schools could also play a role in educating young people in good citizenship, especially in relation to respect for the law.  It does not take a financial wizard to realise that the increase in house burglaries and car thefts inevitably cause major financial problems for insurance companies which, in the final analysis, are paid for by the taxpayer in the form of increased insurance premiums and an extra contribution to the Exchequer.  The Minister will have the full support of all responsible citizens if he introduces a radical overhaul in this area.</P>
    <P>If the board of AIB, with all the financial expertise at their disposal, could not identify the critical position of ICI when they took over, what chance do the understaffed, ill equipped if well meaning amateurs in the Department have of dealing with the complexities of 20 insurance companies, many of them controlled from outside the State?</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Members who contributed to this Second Stage debate.  I welcome the comments made by Senators which have been, by <Col N="1831" /> and large, responsible and generally supportive of the difficult decision which the Government had to make in this matter. I appreciate the concern expressed by Senators in relation to how the losses which will arise in the ICI will be met. These concerns were also foremost in the mind of the Government in dealing with the issue.  There have been some suggestions, including one from Senator Ross who is generally supportive of the Government's action, that the Government had a change of mind on how the administration of ICI should be financed. There has been no such change of mind or change of direction on the part of the Government.  The initial Government statement on the evening of 15 March, when a takeover of administration was announced, made it quite clear that the financing would be broadly based and would involve the Central Bank, and the banking and insurance sectors generally. It has always been the Government's objective to minimise and to avoid, if at all possible, any burden on the taxpayer. The decision of the board of the Central Bank on 27 March 1985 should make it possible to obviate the need for recourse to the Exchequer and has been widely welcomed.  It is fully consistent with the Government's statements from the outset.  While the Government were clear that there should be a contribution from the Central Bank and the banking sector generally to the resolution of the problem they could not make the decision to this effect on behalf of the Central Bank, which is entirely independent of Government. That independence of Government is a vital part of the whole structure of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Howard asked about the precise role of the Central Bank in the financing of the rescue.  The initial funding of the fees of the administrator is likely to be made in full from the loans from AIB which will be routed through the Central Bank and hence to the insurance compensation fund.  The Central Bank have made it clear that they will be discussing with the Allied Irish Banks Group and other licensed banks the appropriate <Col N="1832" /> form and apportionment of the funding to be provided by the Central Bank.  This will, therefore, be a matter for the Central Bank to deal with in the first instance. However, I understand that if any question arises of the Central Bank themselves putting forward any funds, these funds will come from the bank's reserves which are generally used to support the currency rather than from the surplus of the Central Bank which is surrendered to the Exchequer each year.</P>
    <P>I think it appropriate that I quote for the record of the House the basic statement of 27 March of the Central Bank as given in the Dáil by the Minister for Finance on 28 March:</P>
    <P>The Board of the Central Bank... decided, having regard to its statutory responsibility in relation to banking and financial systems generally, to indicate its willingness to provide sufficient funding, in conjunction with the banking system, within the dimensions of the problem indicated by the Minister for Industry Trade, Commerce and Tourism and subject to the end-year reassessment referred to by him, to deal with the problem as it arises so as to obviate the need for recourse to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>That is the central statement regarding the funding of administration.  I would not like to go further than that statement.</P>
    <P>It is important that I stress the role of the Central Bank.  They anchor the whole Government policy in securing AIB as one of our leading banks and also in ensuring that the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, now in administration, will be brought back to a healthy state in a matter of time under the administrator.</P>
    <P>The next matter I would like to deal with at some length refers to the supervisory role of my Department and here I must reject many of the criticisms made by Senators.  EC directives harmonise basic insurance supervision throughout all member states and make it quite clear that the supervision of the branch's activities is the responsibility of a supervisory authority of the member state in which <Col N="1833" /> the branch is located while the supervisory authority of the head office must oversee the solvency of the global activities of a company.  In order to perform this latter activity, however, the head office supervisor is dependent on the branch supervisor to vet and examine the accounts of the branch which feed into the head office accounts.  I want to reiterate that because I referred to it in my opening remarks and it seems not to have been taken up correctly by some Members. The Department of Trade and Industry in the United Kingdom, which was the supervisory authority for the branch activities of the ICI in the United Kingdom, had not communicated any concern to my Department about the UK branch business of ICI.  Given this fact and in the light of reassurances received by officials in my Department from both Allied Irish Banks and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland at the meeting in November 1984, my Department had no reason to question matters further at that stage.</P>
    <P>Like many Members of this House I realise the public disquiet at this most unfortunate debacle.  There are serious questions regarding the management of ICI, especially their management in England and the decision on management control of the AIB.  There is obviously a serious lack of management control, particularly in relation to the flow of information between London and Dublin which is most disquieting.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised about the limit of liability.  On the best information available to me which is based on examination of the company's figure from within, the losses incurred in London fall within the range of £50 million to £120 million.  I have to stress that £120 million is the upper limit of losses and is in no circumstances the most likely figure.  Also they are based on the principle of the reinsurance contracts being sustained, one must assume.  However, it is now up to the administrator in his task to carry out a full investigation, and the position will be fully reviewed when all the information comes to hand.</P>
    <P>I will try to deal with some matters <Col N="1834" /> raised by Senators in the course of the discussion.  I must admit that some of the matters raised were not directly related to my Department and therefore I would not wish to deal at length with them. Perhaps I should dispose of the question of the jury system because it has been raised by a number of Members.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, stated in the House that access to juries for actions in relation to liability cases may be modified.  This is a matter primarily for the Minister for Justice who, I understand, will be bringing in proposals before Cabinet in the next few weeks.  I do not wish to enter into a debate on the merits or demerits of the jury system or the consequences of change in that it is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, but the Government will be examining this within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The question of a 2 per cent levy was raised by a number of Members.  I should state that that levy is the maximum levy under the Act and any change would require legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon suggested that there was undue activity on the part of my Department when rumours circulated in November 1984 in relation to ICI.  That is not correct.  It should be clear from my earlier statement that my Department were not inactive, indeed we were extremely active and brought great force to bear on the issue when it came to our notice.  This culminated in the investment of £30 million by AIB in ICI.  That happened towards the end of last year which, as far as we were concerned, assured us that the company were in a sound financial position.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon also asked what would the Central Bank do if the losses exceeded £120 million.  It would be quite wrong to speculate on losses in excess of this figure.  I am disappointed some Members felt obliged to quote what I can only call excessively speculative figures in this area.  The figures I am relaying to the House are based on the best possible information available to my Department at this time.  When a fuller report is available and a clearer picture emerges, we will make that information available to <Col N="1835" /> the House.  It will have to be made available in any event because of the need for funding arrangements.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon also referred to the position of the Insurance Corporation Life company.  The future of this company will be determined by an administrator who must have the sanction of the court for any decision to sell this profitable and sound company, if that is the course of action he proposes to follow.  He now has responsibility for what we all readily acknowledge is a sound and profitable company.  The matter is now in the hands of the administrator.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon also referred to reports that ICI have arbitrarily cut reserves for claims in their 1983 accounts.  I do not know if these reports are true &mdash; as far as I know they have not been substantiated.  I have already referred to the fact that my Department detected inadequacies in these accounts on examination and found also, following independent actuarial investigation, that the additional capital provided by AIB restored the Irish business of the company to a satisfactory footing.  The later problems appear to have arisen almost entirely on the London business conducted by the company.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Mahony asked about transactions on share options available to executives of ICI.  I do not have any information on this matter nor can I at this stage give any undertaking that I will be able to provide this information, as it falls outside the scope of my Department's supervisory function.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Mahony also asked me to consider an amendment to the Bill to avoid the possibility that AIB's losses could be offset against any liability which they might have to capital gains tax.  The Senator will appreciate that this is the first time this point has been made and I could not undertake to put forward an amendment in an area which is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Finance without full consideration.  I will, however, bring the Senator's comments to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> It has been pointed out by some Senators that there has been a genuine and considerable loss to Allied Irish Banks and especially to their shareholders.  That is a visible and measurable loss.  Senator O'Mahony criticised the fact that the people who are at the centre of ICI and Irish Shipping seem to be the same people and that some of them are very trigger-happy when criticising Governments or the public sector.  I take the criticism made by other Senators also in that regard.  Frankly, I do not think we are going to achieve anything by going too deeply into that.  We had a situation which had to be resolved and the Government acted wisely and quickly in meeting their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the blue book and ICI is that the blue book is a very useful book.  It shows a flow of developments over a period of years.  It allows my Department to see changes in companies' affairs over a period and it allows us to take remedial action, as we have done on a number of occasions and as we did with ICI.  On not infrequent occasions we asked companies to come in and justify figures and then remedial action was taken.  We appointed consultants to examine books where we felt it was necessary.  While we may now be strengthening this section of our Department, it has not been lacking in expert advice and, where necessary, it was brought in from outside.  I have full confidence in the qualifications of the staff in the insurance division of my Department and I reject the criticisms which have been levelled at them this evening by some Members.</P>
    <P>We must remember that insurance companies are owned by shareholders who have their responsibilities and are run by a board of directors who have their responsibilities and by officers of the company who have a legal responsibility, but, above all, the auditors of these companies have a very serious and onerous responsibility.  We in the Department have to take these people on trust and depend on their professional integrity when examining their annual returns.  I referred to this matter in my opening <Col N="1837" /> speech and I do not wish to go over the same ground again, but it bears repeating because we are a supervisory authority; we are not an auditing authority in the sense that we go through all the books. We examine the figures which are given to us very minutely and we take corrective action as and when we deem it necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can support a call for a public inquiry.  I am satisfied that the action taken by the Government in appointing an administrator and the powers which he has will lead to the publication of the full facts of this case over a period of time.  For that reason, a public inquiry is not called for, nor can it be justified.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross stated that the AIB should pay more, and other Senators echoed that quite clearly.  They said the responsibility for this affair rests squarely on the shoulders of AIB.  However, as I have said, the Central Bank will be taking up the matter of the apportionment of contributions to the insurance compensation fund.  I think they will act very responsibly and reasonably.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard made a number of points, some of which I have dealt with. He fully realises that the Government acted in the best interests of the work-force and the policyholders of ICI.  That is quite clearly part of the reason why we moved as efficiently as we did.  We look forward, as do other Members of this House, to the full report of the administrator. That will have to be an in depth study of the management within ICI and the relations between ICI and the AIB. The AIB, as far as I am concerned, acted correctly and swiftly in advising both the Central Bank and my Department when this matter came to light.  They did so in a correct manner because they were aware and they made us aware of the need for corrective action.  We swiftly took action which secured the integrity of one of the most important banks as well as the future of the ICI, albeit under an administrator.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard suggested that the AIB should divest itself of valuable assets.  He mentioned the First Maryland Bank in the United States.  It is important <Col N="1838" /> that our banking system is seen to be strong, to thrive and to be international. We have a very open economy.  We trade abroad and it is only proper that our commercial banks should be aware of the markets that lie outside of this country and, having been established abroad, act on behalf of Irish companies overseas and create business.  This is a matter which is outside the realm of my Department and is really a matter for the banks.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch indicated that there were meaningful changes in the Bill.  I have outlined that in regard to the Central Bank.  We had intended from the very beginning to have the Central Bank involved and I am glad that they decided to become involved.  As regards the question of insurance companies withdrawing from Ireland, he blamed me as Minister with delegated responsibility, for neglect. He mentioned the reply I gave in the Dáil on 30 January 1985, as reported in the Official Report at column 1031 <i>et al.</i>  I was not asked a specific question in relation to the ICI.  I was asked if I was aware of the crisis position that exists in the writing of non-life insurance, the number of insurers who sustain substantial losses each year and the difficulties that are created for insurers and consumers alike who take steps to insure the protection of all interests involved.  I answered:</P>
    <P>I do not accept that a crisis exists in the writing of non-life insurance business in this country.  Non-life insurers in Ireland are operating in difficult conditions, in common with most other insurance markets worldwide.  The industry has taken corrective measures, including premium rate increases, to improve matters and these are already showing fruit. Excluding the largest motor insurer, which as the Deputy knows is under administration, [that is the PMPA] and the inclusion of whose reported results would distort the true picture, underwriting results improved in 1983 over 1982 with losses reduced from 21 per cent to 18½ per cent of premiums written. Market underwriting performance improved in five of the seven main <Col N="1839" /> accounting classes, and two of those classes recorded an underwriting profit during 1983.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that, while financial results may vary from year to year, the Irish insurance industry is basically sound and customers need have no worries about doing business with it.</P>
    <P>As the supervisory authority for companies operating in Ireland and for companies whose head offices are in Ireland but who trade abroad I can still stand over that statement.  That was the best information available to me at that time. I, therefore, reject that there is any negligence on the part of my office or my advisers in the insurance division of my Department.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch exaggerates when he suggests that the PMPA and ICI between them control 60 per cent of the motor insurance market.  According to the blue book for 1983, the motor market share of both companies amounts to only 35 per cent.  Senator Lynch also suggests that the placing under administration by the Government of both the PMPA and ICI should be seen as an attempt to nationalise the insurance industry.  I do not think he is serious when he suggests that.  I doubt vey much if we would have picked two such companies to take over the motor insurance market.</P>
    <P>Senator Conway made some comments regarding AIB directors' fees which are outside my control.  He also referred to the bad judgment of AIB in acquiring ICI.  He said they seemed to be obsessed with gaining new business.  I hold no brief for the AIB decision or the management of ICI, especially the management of its London office.  Many questions will have to be answered over the next few months.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donoghue in a long discourse raised many matters.  I am aware of his participation in the inquiry into the insurance industry and I am familiar with many of the points he raised in the course of his contribution.  He dealt with the reference in the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Insurance Industry to <Col N="1840" /> the basis on which outstanding claims are evaluated.  I should pay tribute to him for the work done by the committee and by the Senator himself who chaired the committee in its final period of work.  The Senator will be aware that many of the steps which he referred to have been brought into effect by my Department as a result both of developments in supervision and of the implementation of the relevant EC directives.  These steps form the basis on which my Department identified the problems of the ICI in relation to their Irish business.  Sophisticated techniques have been used by my Department on a consultancy basis since 1978.</P>
    <P>The point which I made in my opening speech was that actuarial expertise was required continuously on an in-house basis.  It will be my aim to achieve this at the earliest possible date so that supervision can be undertaken even more efficiently using this in-house facility and the most modern techniques and facilities.  I am not saying that provision has been lacking. It is clear that it has not been lacking in the case of ICI's Irish business, as I indicated quite clearly in my opening remarks.  I will refer to the PMPA at a later stage.  I am aware that there are limitations and I would like to redress them as speedily as possible in order to avail of the best expertise that is available on a broad scale.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary compared the adequacy of claims provisioning for Hibernian Insurance and ICI and drew some conclusions from this in relation to the quality of supervision undertaken by my Department.  In passing, Senator O'Leary referred to Hibernian Insurance as being an excellent company.  I am pleased to support him on that.  I suggest that he might have a discussion with Deputy Pádraig Flynn on his untimely and unjustified comment with regard to that company. Under-provisions for claims are not unique to ICI.  It is quite wrong to generalise from the out-turn for a few years of one or two classes of business, and to conclude that a company were, or are, in <Col N="1841" /> danger of insolvency, or that my Department provided poor or inadequate facilities.</P>
    <P>In the case of ICI serious questions about the adequacy of their provisioning first arose in the 1981 accounts.  The company were repeatedly tackled on these matters in 1983 and 1984 and correction of the under-provisions was arranged at my Department's insistence.  Initially these corrections were made from the free reserves of the company but, in November 1984, it was necessary for AIB, as the shareholders, to increase the share capital of the company by £40 million and to inject £30 million.</P>
    <P>Turning to the more general points about the adequacy of claims provisions, I have already indicated that under-provisions were not unique to ICI.  The record of Hibernian Insurance has been as good as Senator O'Leary said.  However, the company are perhaps exceptional in the quality of consistency in their provisions. Comparison of ICI with Hibernian Insurance, therefore, gives a misleading picture. Whereas all insurers are liable to be wrong in their original estimates for claims, this does not mean that the insurers will become insolvent.  It is quite nonsensical to use the benefit of hindsight to prove such a case in one instance.</P>
    <P>My Department have identified inadequacies in various insurers from time to time and have insisted that such problems be put right.  This is done as matter of course, and in the normal process of supervision without any publicity or trumpet blowing on the part of my Department.  It has to be done in a confidential manner because the protection of confidence in insurance companies is vital to their very existence.  I would object if the quiet efficiency which is shown in the work done by officials in my Department were to be ignored in favour of selective criticism which is given with the benefit of the very inexact science of hindsight.</P>
    <P>Supervision is not just an annual look at the yearly returns of the insurance companies or the production of the blue book.  It is an on-going examination of the insurance companies which come <Col N="1842" /> under the responsibility of my Department and, therefore, of my insurance division.  We have been extremely careful in continually monitoring insurance companies. I do not wish anybody in this House or elsewhere to feel there was any slackness or negligence on the part of officials in my Department or on my own part.  That is not the case.  It is patently untrue.  The blue book published each year gives us a trend and allows us to see movements.  We certainly tackle the problems as they arise and come to our notice.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan referred to the PMPA and rumours about it going back-over a period of ten years.  It is no secret that successive consultancy studies on PMPA were carried out using the best expertise available.  These varied from consultant accountants examining the full accounts, to claims experts sampling of standing claims estimates, and actuarial evaluation of re-insurance arrangements. Apart from some minor concerns which were corrected up to the year 1981, not one of those studies &mdash; and there were seven or eight of them in total &mdash; pointed to any serious deficiency in the reserves of the PMPA.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1981, however, a claims expert identified a change of reserving practice not mentioned in the accounts. It was then necessary to quantify the effect of that change in order to establish where, and to what extent, under-provisioning existed.  This study took 15 months to complete.  When it became available and its conclusions were confirmed within a short time by an independent study, the action taken in October 1983 was initiated.</P>
    <P>I repeat this in some detail for the benefit of the House because it exemplifies and reaffirms my Department's active role in monitoring insurance companies. The PMPA were closely policed through special consultancy examinations as well as departmental efforts over a long period.  Rumour alone could not justify any action until a problem was shown conclusively to be in existence and that problem was identified and dealt with in 1983.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1843" /> There is an important point there. There have been rumours about many insurance companies here and elsewhere, and about other financial institutions too. These rumours can be malicious.  Certainly there cannot be adequate grounds for direct State action without adequate reason which in every case would have to be shown to the satisfaction of a court. Rumours, of course, have another quality. They can prove a rumourmonger right if what is speculated about happens in any form at any time in the future.  But that is not an adequate reason to spread rumours or to react excessively to them. I say that in general terms.  We have had a responsible debate here tonight which has avoided, by and large, references to rumours.</P>
    <P>I have noted the comments made by Senator Ryan and Senator Hillery on the effect of the existing jury system on insurance costs.  I am not unsympathetic to some of their comments.  As Senators are aware, the Government have decided to modify the right of access to decision by juries on the extent of damages for personal injuries.  As the subject is not immediately germane to the Bill before the House, and pending the detailed proposal which the Minister for Justice will be bringing before the Government, I do not think I should comment in detail on the matter at this stage.  I think I have made it quite clear that it is not the intention that the taxpayer would foot the bill, as pointed out by Minister Bruton and myself.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness raised the question of traffic accidents.  It is a fact of life that the level of non-insurers of motor vehicles is between 10 and 20 per cent. Perhaps the figure is nearer 10 per cent. The report of the Prices Advisory Committee on motor insurance indicated clearly that there was a problem for society to solve.  If people do not want to tax or insure their cars or put on their seat belts, or drive properly or while sober there is little I can do to change their minds on that.  In regard to industrial accidents, I am aware of a report on safety in industry which indicated that there was a need for <Col N="1844" /> safety in the workplace.  I understand that the Minister for Labour is examining what action to take.  These are measures which, even if you have statutes, cannot be implemented.  If the general populace wish to ignore them, we are going to continue to have high levels of uninsurance and of accident rates.  There is a need for greater consciousness and civic spirit among the people, in order to tackle the problems of insurance and the high level of awards made by the courts.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith raised the point that we were not out of the wood yet.  We will continue to monitor insurance companies in a very detailed, professional fashion. Senators can be assured that supervisory responsibilities will be carried out by my Department in a very professional manner, as has been the case heretofore. I express my gratitude to Senators for their generally constructive and supportive comments.  I have not replied in detail to all of the points made.  I know the Senators do not wish to be delayed unduly here this evening.</P>
