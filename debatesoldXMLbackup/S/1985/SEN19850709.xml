      <P>I have notice from Senator Mark Killilea that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to reconsider the departmental proposal to change the headworks on the Anbally group water scheme to allow the original source to be used rather than the change to the mid-Galway group water scheme supply, thereby allowing the group water scheme to start immediately.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 today and to complete as much of the business ordered as possible.  Senators may well think that this is ordering an undue amount of business for today but I am sure that all Members of the House would wish that legislation should be dealt with in the days remaining before the Dáil <Col N="1444" /> adjourns for the summer recess.  For that reason, I think we should be flexible as regards the question of whether we should suspend the sitting from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  We should also be flexible to some extent as regards the hour of adjournment.  I am not suggesting a late sitting beyond proposing that if we were coming up to 8 p.m. and we had a Bill in progress, we might sit beyond 8 p.m. on ordinary business to not later than 9 p.m., giving us an adjournment at 9.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of Members of the House, I would indicate that the Valuation Bill will pass all Stages in the Dáil today, which will enable us to discuss that Bill tomorrow.  Tomorrow it is proposed to discuss any business left over from today and also to take up motion No. 7, which is the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  On Thursday, the Farm Bill will be with us from the Dáil.  It is proposed to debate that Bill, taking advantage of the fact that the Dáil will be still in session, and also to continue the debate on the report of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides for equal treatment for men and women in the social welfare system.  This is required in accordance with the terms of an EC directive adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1978.</P>
      <P>The main area of discrimination in the social welfare code concerns the entitlement of married women.  This Bill is a reforming measure which will remove fundamental inequalities in the code affecting married women.  The changes will have a major impact both on the thrust of the social welfare code and on the operations of my Department on which they will place substantial new demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> The implementation of equal treatment in our social welfare system raises complex issues and so that Senators will have a full picture I should like initially to outline in detail the background to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The directive &mdash; the number, for the record, is 79/7/EEC &mdash; on equal treatment was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 19 December 1978.  It applies to certain schemes only and these are statutory schemes providing protection against sickness, invalidity, old age, unemployment and accidents at work and occupational diseases.  It does not apply to survivors' benefits nor to family benefits and, naturally, the implementation of equal treatment does not preclude provisions relating to the protection of women on grounds of maternity.</P>
    <P>Social assistance, in so far as it is intended to supplement or replace similar social insurance schemes, is also embraced by the directive.  In accordance with the directive all sexual discrimination in the schemes referred to whether this is direct, or indirect by reference to marital or family status, must be removed and the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>There are four distinct areas of such discrimination all of which have been part of the social welfare code for some considerable time now.  First, certain married women receive lower rates of benefit than men and other women in the schemes of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefits.  The married women so affected are those deemed by the social welfare system to be dependants of their husbands which, in effect is any married woman living with her husband.  Her personal entitlement to flat-rate disability or unemployment benefit is £34.70, whereas the standard rate for most other beneficiaries is £39.50 per week.  These are the new rates applying from this month which I will be using throughout this speech.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the maximum duration of entitlement of a married woman to unemployment benefit is 312 days which is 52 weeks of benefit.  For most other categories it is 390 days, a difference of 13 weeks.  In relation to unemployment <Col N="1446" /> assistance, married women are effectively debarred under existing legislation from applying for assistance.  For a married woman to qualify, either her husband must be dependent on her &mdash; and under existing legislation this means that he must be wholly or mainly maintained by her and incapable of self-support by reason of mental of physical infirmity &mdash; or she must not be a dependant of his. In this regard, the present definition of dependency provides that all married women are dependent on their husbands as long as they are living with them.  In practice, therefore, the vast majority of married women cannot apply for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The final and most complex element of discrimination relates to the payment of increases in respect of adult dependants. Differences exist in the conditions under which increases are paid to men and women in respect of adult and child dependants and these differences are heavily biased in favour of men.  As I mentioned, a married woman is almost always regarded as her husband's dependant and accordingly he qualifies for an increase of benefit in respect of her regardless of her employment status.  A married woman on the other hand can qualify for an increase for her husband only if he is invalided.  Neither of these definitions reflect dependency in a way which conforms to present day realities and they must be revised.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of dependency concerns the payment of increases for dependent children.  Married women can qualify only rarely for these as the children are deemed by the legislation to be normally resident with the father.  The expression &ldquo;normally resident&rdquo;, which Senators will see in the Bill and elsewhere in social welfare legislation, is a mechanism to determine who should receive increases in respect of dependent children. Where children are living with both parents the existing legislation deems them to be &ldquo;normally resident&rdquo; with the father rather than the mother.  To comply with the requirements of the directive this situation must be changed.</P>
    <P>These four areas describe the scope of <Col N="1447" /> the problem which must be tackled and the Bill now before the House does this in, I submit, a balanced and equitable manner.  I will return to the provisions of the Bill and the manner in which equality is to be implemented later.</P>
    <P>Before that, however, Senators might wish to consider in a general way what exactly is meant by this concept of equality which we are attempting to introduce into the social welfare code.  First, I would point out that the present directive is the third in a series concerned with equal treatment for men and women in the social affairs area.  The first of these, in 1975, was concerned with the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women.  The next, in 1976 dealt with matters relating to access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions.  These two directives in essence dealt with inequalities existing between the sexes in the labour force. Finally, we are only concerned, in this third directive, with matters relating to social security schemes provided by the State.  Senators may, for instance, feel that women are still not treated equally in the labour market notably, though not exclusively, as regards levels of pay.  Such discriminations inevitably spill over into other areas.  Whilst they are a cause of concern to everyone and should be put right we cannot address or redress all these inequities in our present Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>We are obliged by the directive to provide equality of treatment in matters of social security.  The principle of equality in the directive could be described as a neutral concept.  It must be applied unconditionally to all.  Within the broad area of application defined in the directive we cannot apply it on a selective basis seeking to have equality here and there but not in schemes or parts of schemes where it does not suit us.  We must remove the fundamental inequalities which exist against married women and give them the same entitlements as others.  However, it would be wrong to go to the other extreme and implement <Col N="1448" /> equality by applying to them out-dated rules and definitions which now have the effect of favouring men.  What we have to do is to get rid of concepts and rules in the social welfare code which are inconsistent with the changed role of women in society, and define a new set of principles which will be both relevant to current and future needs &mdash; so far as we can foresee them &mdash; and which at the same time will be neutral in their application as between men and women.</P>
    <P>The implementation of equal treatment thus provides us with the opportunity, not to say the obligation, to review and, where necessary, to replace some concepts and rules which we have maintained in the social welfare system through the years though the social situation they were intended to reflect has changed so radically.</P>
    <P>We are faced with a number of serious discriminatory factors in our system which we must eliminate.  But let me say here that the fact that person A is entitled to a benefit &mdash; of any sort &mdash; to which person B is not, does not necessarily imply discrimination against B.  Even where it does, it does not follow that the only or the best way to remove the discrimination is that B should automatically receive the same entitlement as A has got up to now.  A's entitlement may in fact be legally well founded but totally unjustified in the light of current facts and another solution may be called for. The resolution of inequalities can, therefore, be approached in a number of ways. For example, where the discrimination relates to differences in the rates of payments, equal treatment could be affected by bringing all payments up to the highest level.  An alternative would be to equalise entitlements at the lowest level.  There are any number of possibilities in between.  The main point is that in implementing an equal treatment principle the main aim must be a balanced overall result which reflects today's social and economic relationships and does not perpetuate those of another era.</P>
    <P>In fact, the discrimination we are faced with in the social welfare code, which is clearly contrary to the EC directive, <Col N="1449" /> cannot be dealt with by applying in a simple, straightforward way on a universal basis to both sexes the rules or conditions now applied to one sex only.  While the elements of the discrimination in the code as it stands can be individually distinguished they are all related back to the principle, which is embedded deeply in the code, that in principle married women are financially dependent on their spouses.  That is what has to be tackled first and all the other elements of reform will then fall into place fairly readily in a logical structure.</P>
    <P>The underlying concept in the social welfare code always has been that the husband was the breadwinner and head of household and the person to whom the full benefits of the social security system should be available.  Consequently, the husband is also deemed by the existing social welfare legislation to be the person to whom increases in respect of dependants should be paid.  Any married woman living with her husband has up to now been regarded as his dependant and any children are also regarded as his dependants.  Only where the husband is incapable of self-support through mental of physical infirmity can the wife at present claim him as her dependant.  As a consequence, the husband almost always qualifies for increases in respect of his wife and children even where the wife is in employment or receiving benefit in her own right.  In such circumstances the needs of a married woman have not been seen, up to now, as being the same as those of a married man.  This has led to the inferior personal entitlements such as lower personal rates of benefits which I have described.</P>
    <P>This approach may have been legitimate at a time when it was most exceptional for a married woman to take up employment outside the home but this is no longer the case.  In present circumstances it results in many thousands of married men being paid adult dependant allowances in respect of wives even when the wives are either in employment or receiving a social welfare payment in their own right on the basis of an insurance <Col N="1450" /> record built up when in employment. If equal treatment were applied without rethinking the concept of dependency, simply by giving married women exactly the same rights as married men now have it would lead to ludicrous results.</P>
    <P>If that were done it would result, for example, in the case of a married couple where both are absent from work due to illness in a situation in which each would be given a separate entitlement to disability benefit with increases for each other and for any child dependants.  Even more ludicrously, it would enable a wife claiming disability benefit, for instance, to get an adult dependant increase in respect of her husband &mdash; and child dependant increases to boot &mdash; even though he was in employment earning a large salary sufficient to support the whole family in comfort on his own.</P>
    <P>Simply to extend to women the present conditions which men enjoy would mean that a wasteful and inequitable payment of adult and child dependant increases, even in respect of spouses at work in well-paid employment, which occurs at present would be expanded enormously and would indeed reach gigantic proportions. For example, it would mean that a family where both husband and wife had been at work but now had separate entitlements to social insurance benefits would receive twice as much in weekly payments as a family where only one spouse had a recent employment record. Equal treatment on those lines would cost about £100 million to implement. But cost aside, no Minister for Social Welfare could justify the allocation of very scarce resources to such inherently biased and inequitable an approach.</P>
    <P>I am grateful that the review of the dependency concept which has taken place in the context of implementing the EC directive has highlighted the need to redefine dependency in economic terms rather than basing it on sex or marital status.  That is precisely what one of the key sections of the Bill, section 3, sets out to do.</P>
    <P>This is a major step forward in defining the implications of equality but it has <Col N="1451" /> tended to be overshadowed by the arguments about some consequences of the new economic definition of dependency. The new economic conditions of dependency defined in the Bill, which will apply uniformly to men and women, are based on the principle that one spouse will be regarded as dependent on the other spouse only if he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that spouse.  Under the provisions of the Bill, the existing presumption that any married woman living with her husband is automatically a dependant will disappear and any person, male or female, who is in employment or in receipt of a social welfare benefit in his or her own right will, in general, not be deemed their spouse's dependant for the purposes of qualifying for increases of benefit.</P>
    <P>There are necessary exceptions to this general principle in certain cases to which I will return later.  A great deal of illinformed comment was made about this proposal when it was first announced and, in outlining for Senators the effects of the Bill, I will show just how wide of the mark this reaction was.  For the moment, however, I would like to complete the outline of the Bill's provisions.</P>
    <P>The effect of this revision of the dependency conditions will be that there will be no <i>a priori</i> presumption about whether either married women or married men are dependent on their spouses.  All married persons, <i>qua</i> married persons, will have the same status within the social welfare code.  Several changes in entitlement follow from this.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill, with the Second Schedule, provides that married women will have the same personal rates of disability benefit, unemployment benefit and invalidity pension as other persons, while section 7 provides for the payment of the corresponding higher rates of occupational injuries benefits.  In this case equality is being applied by a levelling up process because it can be so done without creating any new forms of discrimination.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the discrimination in the matter of the duration of the payment of unemployment benefit is being removed <Col N="1452" /> under the provisions of section 6 of the Bill.  For the same reasons as in section 2, a levelling up approach is also being adopted here.  This section also contains the usual transitional measure in such cases where the period of the payment of a benefit is being extended.  It provides that anyone whose benefit expired before the section comes into effect and who would still have been entitled to benefit if the provision had always existed, shall be so entitled to the end of the now extended period.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, married women will be entitled to apply for unemployment assistance. The condition debarring them at present is contained in section 136 (3) (d) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 and reference 4 in the First Schedule to the Bill provides for the abolition of this provision.  After the passage of the Bill, therefore, married women who are unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking employment will be eligible to apply for unemployment assistance on the same basis as other unemployed persons in similar circumstances. Unemployment assistance is a means-tested scheme and, in common with the other assistance schemes, in assessing means the income of the spouse is taken into account.  There would be no reason to depart from this principle in the case of the extension of the scheme to married women and the means test will continue to apply.  Section 13 contains the necessary changes to enable the existing test to be applied in the context of the new situation where either spouse will be entitled to apply.  Where both spouses have entitlement the means will be aggregated and split between them and section 12 (2) contains the necessary provisions in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also provides a mechanism to ensure that the unemployment assistance scheme is not used simply as a means of topping-up family income.  This provision was the subject of a great deal of discussion when the Bill was debated in the Lower House and I would like to outline for Senators what exactly is involved in the provision.  Subsection (1) deals with the situation where both spouses <Col N="1453" /> apply for unemployment assistance.  It provides that each will receive half the rate appropriate to their family size.  Subsection (4) refers to the situation where one spouse is on benefit and the other is on unemployment assistance.  In this case the amount of unemployment assistance will be such that added to the other spouse's personal benefit entitlement, their overall entitlement will equal the appropriate married benefit rate.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the Lower House, fears were expressed by some Deputies that this provision would remove any financial incentive for married women to apply for unemployment assistance in their own right.  This is simply not so. When this Bill is enacted married women, for a start, will have the same right as all other unemployed people to apply for unemployment assistance. Even where their husbands are also drawing unemployment assistance they will have, for the first time, a direct personal right to half the family entitlement.  There is, therefore, a positive incentive for them to sign on where they are seeking employment.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies also wondered whether the provision could be discriminatory either within the terms of the directive or on other legal grounds.  It was suggested that the fact that a married couple would not receive the same amount of assistance as two unmarried people could be discriminatory on marital grounds within the terms of the directive and that it could be unconstitutional in the light of the judgment in the Murphy income tax case.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of unemployment assistance, at £32.75 a week, is higher than the adult dependant's increase paid with benefits generally.  The effect of this section is that the total entitlement of married couples who are both claiming unemployment assistance will be no greater than the appropriate rate for a husband and wife &mdash; and children as the case may be &mdash; where only one spouse is claiming assistance and the other is an adult dependant within the terms of the Bill.  Each of two unmarried people living together could, on the other hand, be entitled to a personal rate of unemployment <Col N="1454" /> assistance giving them a higher household income than the married couple.  The same situation could arise where one of a couple had a benefit claim and the other an unemployment assistance claim.</P>
    <P>But that does not constitute a form of discrimination within the terms of the directive.  The directive outlaws all discrimination on grounds of sex, whether the discrimination is direct, or whether it is indirect by reference to distinctions made on grounds of marital or family status. Section 12 of the Bill contains no discrimination on the basis of sex either directly, or indirectly by reference to marital status.  An inequality of entitlements may arise as between married and cohabiting couples, but that is not an inequality which will be reflected in a sex-based bias.  I have had this and the constitutionality question examined thoroughly and the legal advice available to me indicates that the subsections are sound on all legal grounds.</P>
    <P>There remains the issue of two unmarried people receiving more by way of social welfare payments than a married couple.  This is a very complex issue.  It has wide-ranging social and other implications. It cannot be tackled in this Bill to ensure equality between the sexes in accordance with the terms of the EC directive.  All that subsections 12 (1) and (4) propose to do is to provide that families are compensated at the appropriate rate in respect of the contingency of unemployment and that the unemployment assistance scheme will not be used to over-compensate some families.</P>
    <P>The other change of significance in the Bill concerns the proposed new arrangements for dealing with increases in respect of child dependants.  The removal of the presumption of dependency and the treatment of married women in the labour market as in principle financially independent in exactly the same way as married men, automatically provides a basis for recognising within the social welfare payments system their role in contributing to the support of their children.  At present only the husband can, in general, <Col N="1455" /> qualify for child dependant increases.  In future where one spouse only is in the labour force, be it husband or wife, that person, when claiming a social welfare payment, will qualify for the full increases in respect of children.  Where both spouses are in the labour force clearly the full increases could not be paid to either spouse when claiming benefit. To do so would be to ignore the contribution which the other spouse makes to maintaining the household.  The Bill provides that in such circumstances each spouse will have an entitlement to 50 per cent of the appropriate increases when claiming benefit.  The relevant sections of the Bill in this regard are section 4, in relation to benefits generally, section 11 in relation to unemployment assistance and section 14 in relation to old age pensions.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made in section 5 for the payment of increases for children with maternity allowance.  I would like to emphasise to Senators that this is not required by the terms of the directive. The additional provision is being made because prior to receiving maternity allowance a woman may have been in receipt of disability benefit and entitled to increases in respect of her children. On becoming entitled to maternity allowance, therefore, it is appropriate that the level of her entitlements should remain the same and the new arrangement, provided for in section 5, will achieve this. Where the husband is in employment or in receipt of benefit the payment of the child dependant increases with maternity benefit will be at half the standard rate in line with the principle described earlier. The inclusion of this extra provision demonstrates that the Government's primary concern in implementing the directive is to achieve a balanced overall package which ensures that equality is achieved in a real and coherent rather than in a piecemeal sense.</P>
    <P>These then are the main provisions to provide for equality of treatment.  The Bill contains a number of other changes which are of a technical nature to permit <Col N="1456" /> the implementation of equality on the basis outlined.</P>
    <P>I should like now to discuss the effects which these equality measures will have. As I mentioned earlier, these examples are based on the rates due to take effect this month and which are provided for in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  Over 46,000 married women on social welfare will benefit from the provisions of the Bill.  For a start they will be entitled to higher rates of benefit.  The vast majority would be on disability or unemployment benefit.  They will, quite apart from the effect of the other proposals entitling them to increases for dependants, each receive an increase of £4.80 per week at current rates of benefit.  Married women on unemployment benefit will have the duration of their benefit entitlement extended by 13 weeks.  Furthermore, all married women will be eligible to apply for unemployment assistance subject to their being capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment in the same way as other applicants and to their satisfying the means test.</P>
    <P>The most complex area in regard to equality of treatment is that relating to increases in respect of dependants and much of the debate on the equality of treatment proposals &mdash; to the extent of overshadowing the other major reforms contained in the Bill &mdash; has been concerned with the proposed new dependency conditions.  Demands have been made that all benefits must be levelled upwards and that no one should suffer a reduction in entitlements.  I have explained why the present conditions which apply to men cannot automatically be applied to women.  To do so would imply that in order to achieve equality all married men should automatically be regarded as dependants of their wives claiming benefit, irrespective of employment or economic status.  Equal treatment on these lines could not be defended on rational grounds and would require a massive injection of financial resources. Equal treatment, therefore, must involve a revision of the present dependency conditions. What the Bill does is not alone <Col N="1457" /> to define dependency in a non-discriminatory way but in a way which also reflects the concept in a socially and economically realistic manner.  Only spouses who are wholly or mainly maintained by their partners will be deemed to be dependants and this will be deemed not to be the position where a spouse is employed, self-employed or entitled to benefit in his or her own right.  However, where the employment is part time work of an insignificant nature or of inconsiderable extent &mdash; and this is defined under existing regulations &mdash; the spouse will continue to be regarded as a dependant and the full dependant increases payable.</P>
    <P>Married women will benefit substantially from this change.  In the case where only the wife works and her husband is a dependant &mdash; in a reversal of the traditional roles &mdash; she will now be entitled to the full adult and child dependant increases as long as her husband is not on benefit &mdash; at present she can qualify only if her husband is an invalid.  This would give married women with three children in such circumstances a gain of £54.20 a week compared with the present provisions, in addition to the higher personal rates to which she would now be entitled.</P>
    <P>In families where both spouses are economically active there will be offsetting gains and reductions.  A married woman with three children, for example, whose husband is employed or on benefit, would, when on benefit, gain about £14.30 per week in addition to the increase of £4.80 in her personal rate of benefit.  Reductions in the entitlements of some husbands will occur but such reductions are inevitable because the present adult dependency arrangement is not defensible.  As I stated earlier, it gives a husband an increase for his wife not alone where she is in employment but even where she is entitled to benefit in her own right.  In effect, the social welfare system is at present paying on the double for the same person.  This must stop. There is no objective reason why such families should receive more from the social welfare system than families in which only one spouse is claiming benefit and the other spouse is not economically <Col N="1458" /> active.</P>
    <P>There are at present over 170,000 payments being made per week by way of increases of benefit in respect of adult dependants.  Almost all of these would be payable to married men in respect of their wives.  In the vast majority of these cases, however, that is where only the husband works, there will be no change whatsoever in his entitlements and he will continue to be entitled to full increases in respect of his dependants.</P>
    <P>The information at the disposal of my Department indicates that only in about 20,000 cases of married men in receipt of benefit with wives in employment or also on benefit would entitlements have been affected and steps will be taken to alleviate the effects of the revision in many of these cases.</P>
    <P>Of this figure of 20,000, in about 12,000 cases the wife is in employment.  In a small proportion of these cases the earnings of the wife would be low and the reduction in the benefit entitlement of the husband would represent a substantial loss of income to the household.  From the beginning, these cases were a cause of particular consideration and when the Bill was drafted the necessary powers were included to enable alleviation to be provided in such cases.  The new definition of adult dependant in section 3 enables the Minister for Social Welfare, by regulation, to specify other persons to be adult dependants.  This provision will be used to ensure that where the earnings of a spouse are below a specified figure she &mdash; or he, for it will be applied equally to both sexes &mdash; will continue to be a dependant and full increase for dependants will be payable.  This will be a permanent feature of the new dependency arrangements.</P>
    <P>The introduction of an earnings floor has operational consequences in that it would further complicate the payments delivery system.  Its effect on the overall level of service which the Department can give to the public is therefore a crucial issue at a time when staffing restrictions and a massive increase in the claims load are already combining to put the system under enormous pressure.  For this reason <Col N="1459" /> the rule must be simple and straightforward so that it will be easy for claimants to understand and will not increase significantly the amount of time needed to process applications and make payments, which would disimprove the service to clients.</P>
    <P>Ideally, an earnings rule might be graduated so that benefit is reduced as earnings increase.  This will simply not be possible in operational terms in the near future and accordingly the earnings rule will initially consist of a single cut-off point of about £50.  The possibility of introducing some element of graduation at a later date will be kept under review in the light of staffing and other constraints. The introduction of this rule will mean that in about 3,000 of the 12,000 cases where the wife of a beneficiary is in employment no reduction in benefit entitlement will occur.  Of the remaining 9,000 cases the wife will have earnings in excess of £100 per week in over half of these.</P>
    <P>The situation where both spouses are separately in receipt of social welfare payments was also a matter of concern. About 8,000 such cases are affected by the new provisions.  After equal treatment each spouse will have the full personal rate of benefit and between them they will have the full increases for children. It must be accepted that the social welfare system is providing fully for the family within the system and the level of benefits provided.  However, the net reduction of about £20 in household income compared with their present entitlement could represent a substantial loss and equal treatment will be phased in in these cases by an arrangement which will repay some part of the loss.</P>
    <P>Section 20 contains a general power enabling temporary and transitional arrangements to be made on a limited basis and this will be used to make a special payment of £10 in these cases for one year or the duration of the claim, whichever is the shortest.  No permanent arrangements could be considered under this heading as any steps that are taken <Col N="1460" /> are themselves in conflict with the principle of equal treatment.  All 8,000 cases will benefit from this arrangement.</P>
    <P>To summarise, of the total number of 20,000 cases affected by the revision of the dependency conditions steps will be taken to alleviate fully or partially the adverse effects of the revision in over half of them.  Debate on the alleviating measures should not obscure the main purpose of the Bill which is the removal of fundamental inequalities in the present system.  The Bill in its entirety is a positive and logically sound response to the provision of equal rights in the social welfare code for married women who pay the same social insurance contributions as other employees.  They will, by virtue of the provisions of this Bill, now have the same benefit entitlements.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that in this measure we are providing for equality of treatment in an equitable and practical way.  Forty six thousand married women will gain substantially. Of the 170,000 married men in the system 150,000 are not affected at all and only about 20,000 stand to lose to the extent I have mentioned at this stage. Alleviating measures will be provided in about 11,000 of those cases which will wholly or partly eliminate such losses. That is a fair balance.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the Dáil some Deputies sought to get highly selective mileage out of the reductions which would occur in the entitlements of some married men without offering any alternative set of principles on which a realistic concept of dependency could be constructed while avoiding this effect.  As I explained above, loss of benefits as a result of this Bill will occur in a small number of cases only and it will occur, unavoidably, because any revision of the concept of dependency which has existed in our code made necessary by equal treatment must result in some reduction in entitlements.  Those who would seek otherwise should at least make some attempt to define the concept of dependency they wish to substitute for what the Government propose and say clearly what would be its financial and other implications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1461" /> Previous Ministers for Social Welfare faced with the problems arising from equal treatment came to the same conclusions as are provided in the Bill.  When the equal treatment directive was adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1978 the then Minister for Social Welfare, who is now the Leader of the Opposition, had a statement inserted in the Council minutes to the effect that the Irish delegation, in accepting the adoption of the directive, considered that nothing in the directive prevented arrangements being made to control dependency payments so as to avoid paying increases of benefit in respect of a spouse when that spouse is already receiving benefit or is in employment, or to control payments of increases for children.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly the then Minister envisaged that a revision of the concept of dependency involving controls on the payment of increases for a spouse in employment or on benefit in his or her own right would be required.  His policy in regard to equal treatment was exactly in line with the proposals I have now outlined.  This is, I consider, the only realistic approach to implementing equal treatment and now that Senators have had an opportunity of reflecting on the issues involved I feel that they will conclude likewise.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of the changes being made in the social welfare system by the Bill let me assure Senators that my Department will be extensively advertising the changes when the legislation has been enacted so that the public will know clearly their rights under the new provisions.</P>
    <P>Before ending, I should like to mention two further matters.  The first is very much related to the fundamentals of the equal treatment debate.  It has been raised by many commentators though it is not a matter which needs to be provided for in the Bill.  This concerns the application by my Department of the statutory condition which requires applicants for unemployment benefit and assistance to show that they are available for work.  I want to put on record that this condition is a fundamental principle <Col N="1462" /> of all unemployment insurance and assistance schemes and is recognised as such in social security conditions drawn up by the International Labour Office.</P>
    <P>In the legislation this condition is phrased in a non-discriminatory fashion and does not need to be amended in the Bill now before the House.  I propose to deal with the issue in some detail here today, however, because it has given rise to proposals in the Lower House to amend the Bill and because I believe the discussion has tended to get out of perspective at times.</P>
    <P>The need for an &ldquo;availability for work&rdquo; condition in unemployment payment schemes is evident.  The purpose of the unemployment payment schemes is to provide income maintenance for persons who are involuntarily unemployed and who are available for and genuinely seeking employment.  In determining availability for work it is necessary to establish whether persons claiming payments genuinely wish to and are seeking to obtain work, whether commitments of a domestic or other nature exist which might limit the person's freedom to accept, or might prevent acceptance of, full time employment which would normally be suitable, and whether restrictions are being imposed by the person on the kind, place or hours of employment acceptable to them, any of which would unreasonably diminish the prospects of obtaining work.  The determination of availability for work is made by deciding officers and appeals officers, in the exercise of their statutory functions, through the interpretation and application of any or all of these broad criteria in relation to the facts and evidence available in each particular case.</P>
    <P>In determining claims to unemployment benefit or assistance, deciding officers must satisfy themselves, in the light of those broad criteria, that the claimant concerned is available for work. To so satisfy themselves they must try to ascertain all of the facts of the case.  In the first instance, that is done by issuing claimants with a claim supplement form which contains a list of questions related to their overall availability for work.  In <Col N="1463" /> the light of the response and any other information available to the deciding officer, the claim will be allowed if there appears to be no doubt.  If, however, there is any element of doubt about a claimant's availability the deciding officers are obliged to query the position by asking the claimant any questions which they feel may be relevant to the case.  Information may, therefore, be sought about what efforts the claimant has made to obtain employment since becoming unemployed, whether he or she has registered for work with the National Manpower Service, what type of work the claimant is seeking, whether there are any factors which would prevent the claimant from taking up work if it were offered and so on.</P>
    <P>In the Lower House, a number of Deputies said that questions about child minding arrangements were a form of administrative discrimination against women applicants.  Obviously many married men and women with young children are able to make child minding arrangements which allow both spouses to take up employment.  Does that mean that child care responsibilities or domestic responsibilities generally never place restrictions on a married person's availability for work?  Those responsibilities can and do affect the availability for work of one or other spouse in certain circumstances. In such cases it is fair and reasonable that a deciding officer should be in a position to know whether applicants' child care responsibilities adversely affect their availability for work.</P>
    <P>Child care responsibilities are, however, just one of the factors a deciding officer might have to take into account in determining whether a claimant is available for employment or not.  In fact it should seldom be the determining factor; the main factor is the efforts the person concerned has made to resume employment.</P>
    <P>Questions relating to child care arrangements are designed to try to establish whether the claimant is really available for and seeking employment and therefore entitled to unemployment <Col N="1464" /> benefit.  A deciding officer or appeals officer is concerned with a claimant's circumstances only in so far as he needs to be satisfied that the claimant is free and willing to take up employment.  It is not the case that claims are rejected merely because the claimant has a young child. In fact a small survey carried out in an employment exchange here in Dublin confirms that the vast majority of married women who claim unemployment benefit receive it, that the vast majority of married women in receipt of unemployment benefit have children and that they have a very wide range of child minding arrangements.</P>
    <P>Those who would argue that this type of questioning should not occur often imply that the mere fact of persons presenting themselves at an employment exchange and indicating that they are available for employment should be accepted without further inquiry.  To those I would say that this is simply not realistic.  The vast majority of people presenting themselves for unemployment payments are, I am convinced, genuine cases of people who through no fault of their own are in that situation.  On the other hand, and Senators should be in no doubt about it, there are those who will seek to exploit the social welfare system if given the opportunity to do so.  To dispense with the controls that now exist would I feel leave the schemes open to abuse.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the controls that are now in place are not excessive.  In order to ensure that they are applied without any hint of administrative discrimination against women applicants the Minister has stated clearly both in the Lower House and to groups who made representations to him that he will be taking the necessary steps to ensure that in the future all conditions relating to entitlement to unemployment benefit, and all inquiries made in connection with these conditions, are applied impartially as to sex.</P>
    <P>New guidelines will be prepared for the staff administering the unemployment payment schemes explaining clearly the requirements of the EC directive that no <Col N="1465" /> discrimination either in laws or administrative provisions is permissible and that in applying availability for work criteria there must be no discriminations on the basis of sex, directly or by reference to marital status, in questions asked or conclusions drawn.  In general, the guidelines will specify that questioning about child care arrangements should only arise when it is directly relevant to the claimant's availability.  In many cases there will be no need to question the statement which must be answered by claimants on the relevant form.  Men and women will be treated equally in this regard.  For instance, where one spouse is in employment and the other is claiming unemployment benefit or assistance, the claimant, whether a man or a woman, may be asked about child care arrangements if it is clear that the question is relevant to their availability for work.</P>
    <P>Staff will be asked to exercise special care and consideration in asking any questions in this regard and monitoring arrangements will be put in place to ensure that direct or indirect discrimination does not occur.  This is, I think, as far as we could go.  In the Dáil amendments were tabled by Deputies seeking to have discriminatory questions made an offence under the Acts and to have some part of the provisions of the directive inserted into the Social Welfare Acts. Apart from the fact that the tabled amendments suffered from a lack of necessary definition, on the basis of the legal advice available to me there are more fundamental legal objections to such provisions.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is enacted the legal provision for equal treatment in social welfare matters will consist of the directive as well as the Act.  The directive itself will be formally part of Irish law.  Under article 5 of the directive we are obliged to abolish all discriminatory practices, not alone in the statute law but also administrative provisions which conflict with the principle of equal treatment. Under article 6 machinery must exist to enable persons who consider themselves wronged by the failure to apply the principle <Col N="1466" /> of equal treatment to pursue their claims by judicial process.  I am advised that the existing mechanisms comply with the directive in this regard.</P>
    <P>The position under the law will be, therefore, that any persons who feel that they are not getting equal treatment in accordance with the directive have a legal basis for pursuing the complaint.  To try to reinforce the existing legal basis by quoting or paraphrasing parts of the directive would be unnecessary and would only complicate the matter by adding a new and ill-defined statement of rights to the clear statement already contained in the directive.</P>
    <P>I think there is no argument about the need to end any discriminatory practices that may exist.  All that might be at issue would be how best to do this.  I am satisfied that the approach I have outlined in some considerable detail is fair and reasonable and is an adequate basis both in legal and practical terms for ensuring that the system will not be discriminatory either at statutory or administrative level.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to deal with the operative date of the provisions.  The deadline contained in the directive for implementation of its terms is 22 December 1984.  High Court actions have been initiated by two married women, and plenary summons issued on behalf of over 100 others, seeking to have the provisions of the directive deemed directly applicable and equal treatment in accordance with its provisions implemented from 22 December last.  The President of the High Court has submitted a reference to the European Court in Luxembourg for a preliminary decision and we must await the outcome of this case before we know where we stand in the matter.  In passing, I might add that arising from the provisions of the directive a case is already before the European Court concerning the implementation of the directive in the Netherlands.  Clearly, therefore, we are not alone in the difficulties we face in introducing the concept of equality of treatment into our social security system.</P>
    <P>For the information of Senators I should mention that while a directive is binding on a member state as to the <Col N="1467" /> results to be achieved it leaves it open to national authorities the choice of form and methods to be adopted.  Senators will realise from the outline I have presented that in implementing equal treatment in the Irish social welfare code we are dealing with a complex issue which could not be proceeded with until the Houses of the Oireachtas had discussed the issues involved and passed the necessary amending legislation.</P>
    <P>In this regard also the suggestion has been made in some quarters that some parts of the proposals involving the increased rates of benefit should be made retrospective to December last.  The outcome of the High Court cases will obviously have a major bearing on the outcome of this issue.  At this point I can only say that we should not or could not look at any parts of the equal treatment proposals in isolation from the point of view of retrospection.  The package, as a whole, is a balanced and equitable approach to providing equal treatment, involving the removal of the automatic presumption of dependency of married women and conferring on them in consequence full entitlement to social welfare rights.  Retrospection obviously cannot arise in the case of the elements of the package which involve reduced entitlements and I see no case in principle for providing for it on the other elements.</P>
    <P>In putting this Bill before the Seanad I have attempted not only to give a clear explanation of the details of the Bill itself but to present an analysis of the many complex issues that lie behind and arise from the application of equal treatment in our social welfare system.  I am happy to have the opportunity of addressing Senators on this reforming measure and I strongly recommend the Bill to them.  I look forward to hearing their views and will respond to them as fully as I can at the end of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to thank the Minister of State for a very long and detailed statement on this Bill. I agree with him that it is a very complex Bill.  Very few people in the fifties and in <Col N="1468" /> the sixties would ever have believed that a Bill of this nature would form part of our entire social welfare code.  Very few people would have believed that this legislation would ever have been necessary. As the Minister said, in those days it was quite the norm for married women to remain in their homes to care for their families and to look after the homes generally.  It was the exception rather than the rule for married women to take up jobs outside the home.  In the Ireland of the fifties and the sixties the traditional family saw the father as the only breadwinner. The Minister made the point that the underlying concept in the social welfare code has always been that the husband was the breadwinner, the head of the household and the person to whom the full benefits of the social security system would be available.  This role has long been a feature of the Irish way of life.</P>
      <P>From time to time people get involved in arguing the merits or otherwise of wives working because here again we have the same situation.  Again it is an EC directive.  This Bill provides for the very fact that we find ourselves today in the mid-eighties era.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for equality of treatment for men and women in the area of social welfare, as directed under the terms of an EC directive which was adopted in 1978.</P>
      <P>As long as married women seek employment and as long as they continue at work outside the home they should be entitled to the same standard of benefit as their male counterparts, particularly in the social welfare area.  We have noticed in this House and elsewhere down the years that there have been great anomalies in the social welfare code which have clearly discriminated against women.  It is right that legislation should be introduced to end this discrimination. It is clear that this form of discrimination should cease.  I certainly would welcome that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1978 directive ordered the gradual application of equal treatment for men and women in social security matters.  We all accept that we have been extremely <Col N="1469" /> slow in implementing the directive.  In my view, whether it was implemented in 1979 or any year since then, it should be implemented on a slow, gradual basis over a period of years.  I say this deliberately because despite what the Minister says &mdash; and there are good points in the Bill &mdash; many of the features of the Bill will prove to have a devastating effect, on many families.  Equality legislation that this Bill is going to produce will create a huge financial worsening for many families and must be a cause of concern to us all.  One could argue that in equality legislation a worsening of the family income should not happen, but it will happen in this case.  Thousands of families in receipt of social welfare benefits will find themselves worse off.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to sound political but it has been one of the strong points of the Government, which includes the Labour Party, that they have stressed in their Joint Programme for Government that no further damage should be caused to the less well-off sections of our community in a period of recession.  I see this in many cases as a blow to the underprivileged and clear damage to the less well-off. This, surely, would be contrary to the beliefs of the Labour Party as they indicated at the commencement of Government.</P>
    <P>On looking at the Finance Bill of this year we find that there were very miserly increases in the whole area of social welfare. Many of the increases which we had all hoped would take place from the first day did not commence until July and some will not commence until November.  Any increases that were given were damaged by the action of halving the food subsidies last autumn, not to mention &mdash; again in the Finance Bill &mdash; the imposition of VAT on clothing and footwear.  These types of issues have continued to make the less well-off become even poorer and are causing great concern to many people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a break in Government &mdash; it is not my business whether there is or is not &mdash; or if there is to be a break between the Labour Party and the Fine <Col N="1470" /> Gael Party then it should be on some worthwhile issue such as jobs, or social welfare, or taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was quite extraordinary to me when I read over the weekend that a break was possible on a comparatively unimportant Local Radio Bill.  However, let us return to this important Bill and say that the redefining &mdash; as the Minister has spelled out many times in it &mdash; of the concept of adult and child dependencies will cause hardship to many families.  I cannot stress this sufficiently.  The Minister suggested that all that was said in the other House was not correct or accurate. My understanding and realisation is that a family could lose up to £50 per week as a result of this Bill and that will really cause havoc.  Just in case I am way off the mark, I note that the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Fennell, is on record as saying: that unfortunately, the new approach, though very desirable and commendable, would result in a loss for some families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are cases where both husband and wife are at present separately entitled to social welfare payments.  The overall net loss for such families will amount to about £20 per week.  A worse situation and one about which she would be even more concerned as Minister with responsibility for Women's Affairs, is where the husband is on benefit and the wife is at present working.  For a couple in this situation, with three children, the legislative proposals could result in a reduction of up to £37 a week on a flat rate benefit.  Clearly, that situation would be catastrophic for any family.  I believe that the living standards and the lives generally of these people will be damaged very severely indeed.  Every possible effort must be made to ease the burden on the thousands of families who are going to suffer in this situation.  I want to stress &mdash; this is the point of the Bill &mdash; that every effort must be made to minimise the impact of this dependency condition. I understand that the Minister intends to make &mdash; as he said in his <Col N="1471" /> address &mdash; a transition payment of £10 a week in cases where both spouses are separately drawing benefit.  Obviously this will help but when the full impact becomes a reality I wonder if it will be enough.  We are talking about people who are on the breadline, who are in the worst possible financial position.  Clearly they require all the help they can get from the Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill has many good points.  The question of married women being admitted to the unemployment assistance scheme, subject to a means test, is clearly one we would welcome.  We would hope &mdash; the Minister has gone into great detail about this &mdash; that the means test will not be over-stringent and that the women's availability for work will be dealt with in a dignified way, as it should be.  This, over the years, as the Minister knows only too well, has caused many complaints. It is, indeed, an old chestnut and one which must be dealt with in a very dignified way.  Let us hope that it does not continue to be a major problem.  The fact that 46,000 women hope to gain extra benefit, at a cost of £17 million, is welcome. Although the weekly increase of £4.80 per week is quite small, nonetheless we would have to say it is a help.</P>
    <P>The good points of the Bill are minimal. I hope I am wrong in saying that I believe the difficult parts of the Bill will prove catastrophic for many families.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Its effect on the overall level of service which the Department can give to the public is therefore a crucial issue at a time when staffing restrictions and a massive increase in the claims load are already combining to put the system under enormous pressure.  For this reason the rule must be simple and straightforward so that it will be easy for claimants to understand and will not increase significantly the amount of time needed to process applications and make payments, which would disimprove the service to clients.</P>
    <P>I would agree with these sentiments.  We all know that for years there have been <Col N="1472" /> problems in the Department of Social Welfare.  I wonder, as a result of this measure, if more staff should be employed.  As a result of the measures, the complex issues involved and the extra workload involved many new staff should be employed.</P>
    <P>It is time the whole system of operating the Department of Social Welfare received a major overhaul.  It is quite difficult for people to fully understand the system.  It has become extremely cumbersome and extremely costly.  We have at the moment over 30 different categories of social welfare recipients, receiving over 40 different rates of payment.  It is vital to present a simple system so that people will know their rights, and how to apply, in the simplest possible way.</P>
    <P>There are many anomalies and inequities in the present system.  It has been suggested that the system we have at the moment is damaging to the human dignity of the people who are applying, particularly in the area of appeals.  I know that the Minister for Social Welfare is working on new arrangements and a new system and is awaiting a commission report.  The quicker it comes the better.  I certainly would hope that any new system would remove this attack on human dignity and that the claimants would be allowed to apply with ordinary human dignity.  That is something we all hope for; that is something for the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the difficulty in other European countries of implementing this directive.  I would appeal to the Minister, even at this very late stage, to consider further action to prevent the extreme hardship that some of the measures will bring to so many families and, in particular, to families on low incomes. As I said at the outset, it is a complex Bill, one that will be debated for a long period here today and tomorrow.  It is one that will cause a lot of hardship.  It is one that the Government should treat with great care because of the fact that hardship will be created for so many couples living on low incomes.  Nonetheless, it is a Bill that had to be introduced.  I <Col N="1473" /> hope that it will prove as successful as the Minister hopes it will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at the outset to compliment the Minister on his very informative speech.  He has gone to great trouble to make the provisions of the Bill crystal clear and to explain any difficulties of operation that might arise and how they are going to be dealt with in fairness and in justice to everybody.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as a very significant step forward in giving equal rights to women.  There is still a long way to go in society to ensure that women have equal rights with men.  This is definitely an important step forward.  It is right that the Government should set the headline by ensuring, under the social welfare code, that rights are extended to women. It is to be hoped that other sectors of society will follow the headline set in this directive from the EC and that this Bill implementing it here will have a beneficial effect in seeing that society moves along on that advanced line.</P>
      <P>It is right that people should be aware that as conditions are at present there are some very unfair anomalies.  For example, why should women who pay the same PAYE and the same PRSI and work the same hours as men have fewer benefits than men because of their sex and marital status?  This Bill brings that sort of condition to an end and it is not before time. Why should a woman who, because of her husband's illness is, in fact, the family breadwinner be denied the same treatment that is given to the father when he is the breadwinner?  Provisions like that could only be regarded as highly discriminatory. It is good to see them being removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a fairly decided advance in ensuring equal rights for women in the social welfare code.  It is right that from the very outset it should be accepted as such.  It would be wrong to try to cloud up the big advance being made in that way by drawing attention to some small difficulty and to some particular cases where it is possible that a relatively small number of people might be worse off under the terms of the Bill.  In fact, almost <Col N="1474" /> 50,000 married women will benefit under the Bill.  This Bill, I have been told, results from a directive passed by the Ministers of the EC in 1978.  There could be cause for complaint at the delay in implementing it.  It is now being implemented and we should express satisfaction at that.  There are real benefits for wives in the Bill as introduced, such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, occupational injury benefit and benefit for those in receipt of invalidity pensions. Those on unemployment benefit will gain an extra 88 days.  In the other House attention was drawn to the fact that some households would lose by a cutback, but the Minister has gone to great lengths to explain that as far as possible cases of people who will suffer a loss of income from the State under these headings will be dealt with sympathetically.  On that ground, the Minister is to be complimented.</P>
    <P>It is evident that much thought was put into the preparation of the Bill to ensure that it operated to the advantage of as many people as possible.  In every way it is a Bill to be welcomed.  We hope that it will be taken as a headline for the further development of society and that soon we will get away from the position of regarding women as second-class citizens in any way.</P>
    <P>There is one provision in the Bill to which the Minister drew attention and to which I would like to refer briefly.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>There remains the issue of two unmarried people receiving more by way of social welfare payments than a married couple.  This is a very complex issue.  It has wide ranging social and other implications.  It cannot be tackled in this Bill...</P>
    <P>I can see that point.  I am pleased that the Minister drew attention to the fact that you could have unmarried people receiving more by way of social benefits than a married couple.  That would be something of which I could not approve and of which the people of the country would not approve.  It would be wrong that the State should give subventions to immorality. <Col N="1475" /> I accept the statement of the Minister that it is not something that could be dealt with under this Bill.  I express the hope that measures will be taken in the near future to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to some pains to explain that it was necessary to have checks on applications for unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  I agree wholeheartedly with what the Minister said.  It would be rather naive to think that these schemes could operate without checks and cross-checks in many cases.  We have a number of people who will take advantage in every way possible of any laxity and draw money to which they are not entitled.  We all know people on unemployment benefit who are working at the same time.  Any measures the Minister can take to cut out abuses like that would be heartily welcome.  I, for one, compliment the Minister on his insistence that these precautions must be included to ensure that schemes of this kind related to the benefits of those in hardship or in financial difficulties are not abused.</P>
    <P>I extend a sincere welcome to the Bill and I compliment the Minister on the way it was introduced in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the Bill, particularly as it is a Bill which works towards something which many of us have been looking for for a long time &mdash; the end to discrimination as between men and women in the social welfare code.  The Bill, as the Minister said in his long and very comprehensive speech, has followed upon the EC directive in 1978.  It is, perhaps, a little unfortunate that the Bill could not have been brought in in time for the due date in December 1984 to comply with the directive.  I am not saying that this is necessarily the case, but it certainly gives the impression that the Bill is brought in quite quickly now in response to the fact that certain women took High Court actions and that the matter has been referred by the President of the High Court to the European Court to deal <Col N="1476" /> with.  The Bill is being brought in now, some six months after the end of the period allowed by the directive, but if there had been a little more concentration over the past seven years, since 1978, perhaps, the Bill could have been brought in in time for December and saved the necessity for individual women taking legal proceedings in order to try to establish their rights.</P>
      <P>However, I do not want to carp about this because the Bill is very comprehensive and the Minister has brought it in with an extremely full and comprehensive explanatory speech which will be a help to all those who are studying the effects of the Bill when it appears in the reports of the debates of this House.</P>
      <P>There are just one or two things that I, like other Senators, would like to comment on.  The Minister explains that the fact that we are bringing in equality as between men and women does not mean that we simply have to apply to women exactly what applies to men now.  I take this point; it is obviously a logical point and one which from here on out will have to be brought into effect.  But it is unfortunate, as has been pointed out by Senator Fallon, that in some ways the application of this principle, the fact that we cannot just extend the same benefits that we have now for men to women means, in effect, that certain families will lose out and lose out quite considerably. I accept that the Minister said that this will be dealt with in a sympathetic manner and, perhaps, there will be some saving allowed in it.  But it is a little unfortunate that we could not have a system whereby at least for a period these families, until some other adjustments can be made, should not be so drastically reduced in their benefits and assistance. Obviously, for the families that apply from here on out, one must apply the regulations as set out in the Bill.  I would ask the Minister to treat families who are going to be affected at present particularly sensitively and, at any rate, not to apply a sort of immediate cut-off of a large amount of their income because this will make life very difficult for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> The Minister pointed out that when you are talking about bringing discrimination between men and women to an end you are somewhere between bringing up everything to the level that is now paid to men to the sort of highest factor, as it were, and bringing everything down to the lowest common denominator, but doing so equally.  This, again, is a logical way of approaching it.  We have to do something that is in between the two extremes.  However, it will come as a blow to quite a number of families, I know they are not a very large proportion of families, but that does not actually affect the pain of each individual family involved, that they should lose a considerable amount of what they are getting at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would also remark on something which was raised by Senator O'Brien &mdash; a matter to which attention was drawn by the Minister &mdash; of the position that will obtain that if two unmarried people live together in a stable relationship and if they have children and so on, they may very well be better off than if they are a married couple.  This, of course, is not a matter of discrimination as between men and women.  I see that, because this is not a discrimination between men and women, it does not exactly form part of this legislation.  But we are in a situation where the actual marriage rate of young people has been dropping quite considerably in the last few years.  Certainly, if we continue to bring in social legislation which, as it were, discriminated in favour of those who are living together without marriage, we could expect the marriage rate to drop even more rapidly.  I am not necessarily approaching it from a moral point of view, certainly from a social point of view, if we are considering a position and if we want a society where the married family is the basic unit of society we have to be very careful that we are not acting even unconstitutionally, perhaps, in allowing a situation to arise in our social welfare code where if you decide to get married, it may distinctly reduce the benefits which you get.  It is an active discouragement to those couples who are living together without marriage <Col N="1478" /> to take the step of getting married and becoming a legal and constitutional family.  I agree with what the Minister says, that this is a very complex issue and it has wide-ranging, and other social implications.  Indeed, this is precisely what I have been saying.  Just because it has wide-ranging, social and other implications does not mean that it cannot be dealt and that it must not be dealt with.</P>
    <P>My third point relates to a matter mentioned towards the end of the Minister's speech &mdash; the question of availability for work.  The Minister dealt with this at considerable length.  In the past it has indeed been a great problem for married women where they applied for benefits and stated that they were available for work.  It has been the case in the past that where they have young children, there has been an in-built presumption that they are not available for work.  This presumption did not apply to men even though men, too, have young children and men too, especially in today's society, play a considerable part in looking after their young children.  One has only to look around the city of Dublin quite often now to see cases where families are relying to quite a large extent on the woman's earnings and the man may be unemployed.  Frequently we see men wheeling the pram, out doing the shopping and out taking part in the care of the family and so they should.  This is an excellent thing.  One can see a very good relationship developing between children and their fathers in this situation.  But surely this must mean, as suggested here by the Minister, that if you are going to ask questions about childminding, &mdash; I can see that there are situations where questions about childminding may be asked &mdash; you must ask them of men as well as of women and the same kind of criteria should apply.  Much will depend in setting up this system on the sort of in-built feelings of the deciding officers and the appeals officers.  It is all very well to say that these questions must be asked of men as well as of women if they are going to be asked but the questions arise &ldquo;Do you actually accept what the woman is saying to you?  Do you accept what the <Col N="1479" /> man is saying to you?  Are you asking the questions of the man as a matter of form but of the woman in a much more emphatic way?&rdquo;  This is something that will need to be monitored greatly.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, if he has the information available, how many and what proportion of the deciding officers and appeals officers are, in fact, women and are married women who would have experience of this kind of situation?  If you have a situation where most of the established deciding officers and appeals officers are men who have worked the old system, it may be quite difficult to get them to reorientate themselves to get rid of this somewhat settled form of discrimination which has gone on for many years.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's bona fides in saying that he is trying to deal with this and that he will be seeking to ensure that questions will be asked of both men and women.  He is seeking to put monitoring arrangements in place to deal with that matter.  It has been a very distinct area of discrimination in the past and it will need a great deal of monitoring and a great deal of care to ensure that it will not continue in the future.  Those are the main items I would like to refer to in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>I again welcome the introduction of this legislation which brings about something that many of us have been campaigning for for a long time &mdash; the introduction of a fully non-discriminatory social welfare code.  I hope it will work out in practice as well as is intended by the Minister in bringing in the regulation and that it will fulfil the directives of the EC as they were intended to be fulfilled.</P>

      <P>This legislation which follows the 1978 directive from the Council of Ministers is one that the Labour Party have been discussing for some considerable time.  I would just like to reassure Senator Fallon in regard to some concerns he expressed in his introductory remarks.  It always worries me when somebody from the other benches begins to worry about the face of the Labour <Col N="1480" /> Party.  Can I assure Senator Fallon that, although his own party were in Government on two occasions since 1978, they did absolutely nothing about the question of equality for women in any area of legislation.  It ill behoves him to preach to a Labour Minister in this House or to members of the party about where they are going and what their commitment is, particularly in the area of social welfare. I take it that he understands that above all the socialist parties in Europe, the Irish Labour Party have always been instrumental in ensuring that the recipients of social welfare were always protected and were indeed.  I do not suppose Senator Fallon is suggesting for one moment that what up to now were adult dependants of an unemployed man, and earning, in a professional capacity, £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000 a year, that because they are now no longer determined as adult dependants in some way the Labour Party might have lost their souls or worry about the effects this legislation would have on the poorer sections of the community.</P>
      <P>If Senator Fallon reads the Bill <i>in toto</i> he will find that it has no effect whatsoever on people in that category.  I would like, when the Senator makes a contribution in the House that he would take into account the full implications of the Bill and not worry about the Radio Bill or anything else because that has nothing to do with this legislation.  When the fundamental principle of taxation is being dealt with, the Labour Party have certain principles. There is, first of all, the principle of an agreed programme.  We also have a principle in relation to the area of legislation that would give the right to certain privileged sections of the community to have access to large amounts of money which the Labour Party feel should be available for people in the social welfare code.  I hope the Senator will follow that line through when making remarks, as he did, about the Labour Party, their joint programme and social welfare recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation, first of all, is most welcome. This Government have been responsible for quite a lot of legislation, <Col N="1481" /> particularly in regard to this area of discrimination, on sexual grounds, against women.  They have held that regard should be had for the person as a person in his or her right, irrespective of marital status.  Women should be treated the same as men in any area of legislation, in areas of income, or in areas of social welfare.  That is precisely what this legislation is doing.  The Minister outlined initially that some 46,000 married women on social welfare will benefit from the provisions of this Bill.  That in itself is to be welcomed but in the process of trying to remove areas of discrimination that is not the sole reason for the introduction of the legislation, although it will cost the State an additional £16 million which the Government have included in their Estimates this year to benefit all those married people.  That was not the sole reason. The reason there was delay in the introduction of the legislation was to try to deal with certain categories of people who would in this situation, by being treated equally, lose in the overall in the family income.  That, of course, for us and, indeed, for our partners in Government, delayed the bringing forward of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill confers on the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, certain rights in determining what an adult dependant is.  It will take into account the income of that adult dependant.  It will be able to set out, by way of legislation, a category of person over and above which it could no longer be accepted would be in fact an adult dependant of somebody else.  In this case we are talking about adult dependants of social welfare recipients.  If a person is gainfully employed and earning £5,000 a year or more, no right thinking person would consider that that person is legitimately or legally an adult dependant of the social welfare recipient.  That is what this legislation is about.</P>
    <P>It is good to know that so many people will benefit and that the amount of money involved is so great, £16 million additional income to people in their own right.  They will receive it by way of right which in the past has been denied them by <Col N="1482" /> way of discriminatory legislation.  There will be income increases of up to £4.80 a week and there will also be an extension of their entitlements over an additional 13 week period.  All these things are to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that of the 170,000 payments that are made for adult dependants almost all are payable to married men in respect of their wives.  That is the reality of life and I think it refers to Senator Fallon's previous contribution when maybe 20 or 30 years ago that was not the case.  But in the past ten or 12 years or so women have in their own right been going out to work and rightly so.  No area of legislation should prohibit them from doing so.  They can be employed gainfully and make a major contribution in our economy and also to all sections of our community, economic, social, political and otherwise.  It is only right that women should have the opportunity to do that.  Instead of discriminating against them on sexual grounds, they should be treated as adult human beings.  It ill behoves all of us on this side of the House, those of us who are males, to be talking in a patronising way about women in this regard and the sooner all these areas of legislation which discriminate against women are eliminated from our code the better I would like it.  They have proved, for any of us who have worked with them in many capacities, that they are capable of fulfilling and doing their job as well, if not better than, most men.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the Minister's statistics which he has available to him and, of course, only a Department have statistics available.  These figures indicate that only about 20,000 cases of married men in receipt of benefit, with wives in employment are the kind of people we are now beginning to interfere with.  If we take the provisions of section 3, which the Minister talks about, it is quite likely that we will reduce down to about 7,000 or 8,000 the number of people who would actually lose by this legislation.  On the basis of social equity, those who will lose in this respect will be in the higher income brackets and in the non-dependent brackets.  They would not <Col N="1483" /> begrudge the vast majority of people the benefits that will accrue from this measure.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness made the point that deciding officers who go through the process of deciding people's eligibility for unemployment assistance will now have written into this legislation the views expressed here, that a liberal attitude would now be taken towards the application of married people for unemployment assistance.  Heretofore, it was almost impossible because the deciding officer interpreted the social welfare code as indicating that if a married woman had children, that for the purpose of the Act she would not be available for work.  In a case of a mother-in-law being available to mind the children for the wife who was anxious to go to work and capable of doing so, I produced evidence of the person trying to get work, having written documents from employers confirming that this married woman who was unemployed had looked for work.  It is humiliating to have to bare your soul totally to a deciding officer at that level.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will remove some of the anomalies and that because married women are now being treated equally with married men in the area of unemployment assistance, deciding officers will now be much more liberal in deciding a case of an unemployed married woman who is genuinely seeking employment, and out of economic necessity would need employment to sustain the family and home, often in conjunction with the husband.  We have now reached the stage where two incomes, because of their size, are required to have any level of comfort that people are entitled to in 1985.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the implementation of this legislation regard will be had for the lower paid workers in the manual sector, the cleaning service where many women are employed and for far too long have been discriminated against by their employers.  I hope that if they now continue to work, and where their husbands are incapable of work due to, say, illness or being disabled in some way or, indeed, <Col N="1484" /> that that person would genuinely be out of work, that he would still be deemed to be dependent as he is on a fairly low income under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>That has been the cause of the overall delay in the implementation of this social welfare legislation.  We were trying to strike a level in which hardship would not be created for people in that category.  I hope that it will mean something in the region of up to £100 a week for a working wife of a social welfare recipient.  After that there is no hardship caused.  If it is interpreted in that light the general acceptance of the scheme throughout the country would be a favourable one.  The overall beneficiaries are much greater than those who will suffer in some way. Nobody wants to legislate in an area where suffering is caused.  Suffering in a monetary sense means that someone who is on a fairly high income, and the husband cannot claim for a dependant, is not suffering but it does have an effect on the overall income into the family.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that is the reason why the previous Government could not grapple with this.  They always find it difficult to legislate in an area where they will make any enemies at all.  In this area you are making more friends than enemies.  The principle is important.  It is something which this Minister and the Government have come to grips with.  I hope that when the Bill is enacted new applicants coming into the area will be treated differently from existing applicants with whom the State might have some sort of a legal contract instead of wiping it out overnight for the sake of bringing the Bill in.  We should look at this area of possibly allowing to continue for a period people who are now beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the fact that some people have taken this case to the European Court had absolutely no bearing on the Minister, because we have been discussing this legislation for the last year and a half.  It was to overcome these problems that the Minister listened to the parliamentary party process, which is what democracy is all about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will <Col N="1485" /> be very brief.  I would like to make two points that have been more or less developed already.  The Minister has told us that the Bill provides for equal treatment for men and women in the social welfare system and that this is required in accordance with the terms of an EC directive by the Council of Ministers in 1978.  It seems strange to me, as well as to some other Members, that it took so long to bring in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The main area of discrimination in the social welfare code concerns the entitlements of married women.  The Minister explained that this Bill is a reforming measure which will remove fundamental inequalities in the code affecting married women.  This is something which we all welcome in so far as it will do so.  I am particularly anxious to welcome it because I am a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  This is a subject which has come up many times.</P>
      <P>We are in a situation where it has been necessary to redefine &ldquo;dependency&rdquo;. There are four distinct areas of discrimination. Firstly, certain married women receive lower rates of benefit than men and other women because they are regarded under the present legislation as dependants of their husbands.  Secondly, the duration of unemployment benefit for married women extends over 52 weeks at present, while other categories qualify for 13 weeks longer.  Thirdly, unemployment assistance for married women is debarred to a considerable extent. Fourthly, discrimination regarding payment of increases for dependent relatives is affected.</P>
      <P>The other aspects of dependency concerns the increases for dependent children. These are deemed to be normally resident with the father.  The first point I should like to make has also been made by Senator Ferris.  It is referred to by the Minister.  The Minister stated that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the passage of the Bill, therefore, married women who are unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking employment will be eligible to apply for unemployment assistance on the same basis as other unemployed <Col N="1486" /> persons in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to state:</P>
    <P>Furthermore, all married women will be eligible to apply for unemployment assistance subject to their being capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment in the same way as other applicants and to their satisfying the means test.</P>
    <P>The Minister develops this further:</P>
    <P>Information may, therefore, be sought about what efforts the claimant has made to obtain employment since becoming unemployed, whether he or she has registered for work with the National Manpower Service....</P>
    <P>There are many people out of work who would qualify for unemployment assistance and who are not anxious to avail of it.  This is a point I made before in relation to the two and a half day scheme.  This is confined to people who are 12 months in receipt of unemployment assistance.  This is unfair.  With regard to the question of child minding arrangements &mdash; and this has been mentioned in the other House &mdash; there is an administrative discrimination against women applicants.  I want to state that, under the Housing Acts, local authorities are empowered to provide child minding facilities, play groups, creches, or whatever are necessary.  It seems very few of them provide these facilities.  In a situation where these child minding facilities are not provided there should be no obligation on married women to prove that they have provided alternative means of looking after their children.</P>
    <P>We have a situation which has obtained for quite a considerable time where the local authorities in building housing schemes have the statutory power to provide these facilities and they are not doing so.  There is a serious breakdown here and this is something I would have liked to have seen dealt with in the Bill.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that in the situation where women are being asked to provide this information the benefit of the doubt would be given in all cases where these facilities have not been provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> The second point I wanted to make is that it is a fact, as the Minister pointed out, that where two unmarried people are living together their total benefit will be greater than for a married couple. Quite apart from the Constitution that is a serious problem which must be examined. In regard to the whole question of marital breakdown, and at the present time we are considering the report of the Joint Committee that is not a satisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>Also, in the second report which we had from the Joint Committee on Women's Rights which dealt with social welfare there are aspects which could have been included in this Bill.  I do not intend to deal with them except to point out that a recommendation was made in that report for an improvement in the administrative procedures in the Department of Social Welfare, including the acceleration of the process of computerisation to ensure a more speedy and efficient service to the public.  The Minister mentioned the problem in dealing with the large number of people involved.</P>
    <P>The last point that I want to make has also been mentioned by the Minister.  It is in relation to the earnings rule.  He said the rule must be simple and straightforward. This is something that we would all agree with but if some people are going to suffer due to the fact that the cut-off point is around £50 I think in all cases the benefit should be adjusted upwards.</P>
    <P>Two points I want to make and emphasise are, first, that local authorities are not performing their statutory duties in relation to new housing schemes where they do not provide child minding facilities. They are empowered to do so; they are not doing so.  In relation to existing schemes there is a scheme of grants from the EC whereby this facility could be provided.  Also, in relation to marriage breakdown the fact that two single people living together would benefit more than a married couple is something about which I would feel uneasy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief but I could not let the opportunity pass to welcome most wholeheartedly this Bill which at long last has seen the light of day.  I am pleased to see that the 1978 EC directive is being translated by the Houses of the Oireachtas into legislation.  We all know that very often Governments chose to pay lip service to women's issues and that a recommendation about women or, indeed, any people who are concerned in that recommendation, is only as much use as a stone parachute unless it is translated into legislation.  It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this measure and I congratulate the Minister and all concerned in bringing it to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for giving such a detailed and most comprehensive speech outlining the background to the Bill.  I find his approach extremely informative and absolutely refreshing.  Even now all of us will agree that it is somewhat unusual to see such emphasis being paid to equality matters and it is all the more welcome for that.  I am also very much reassured to gather from the Minister's speech that the constitutionality of this measure has been thoroughly and closely examined and that it has been found to be soundly based.  That is a reassurance all of us who are concerned about this area will be very pleased indeed to have.</P>
      <P>The entitlements of married women have been, and to some people still are, a very vexed question.  Many people are nostalgic about the family as it was in the fifties and sixties and indeed I thought I saw certain elements of that when Senator Fallon spoke.  It is not that he did not feel that the existing situation was a reality but he did seem to hark back in a slightly nostalgic tone to the way things were.  We all have to admit that the way things were is not the way things are and not the way things will be.  We must have legislation and we must have new shapes, new forms and new structures in our society to reflect what is and what will be.  What was is for the history books, albeit pleasant, nostalgic and cosy and secure and something that we as adults have had experience of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1489" /> This reforming measure will remove fundamental inequalities in the social welfare code affecting married women and for that it is to be welcomed.  In the Minister's speech I find demonstrated the fact that the Government's primary concern in implementing this directive is to get a balanced overall package which ensures that equality is achieved in a real and coherent manner rather than in piecemeal fashion.  In charity I would say that it was in endeavouring to do that that this Bill has taken the time it has taken to see light of day.  Nevertheless, I feel that most of the possible difficulties attached to it have been addressed and that it is important, necessary and vital that all loopholes should be attended to.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech, and certainly in the legislation, there is a very firm statement of principle.  One of the areas that I was concerned about is the area of a disadvantage or a discrimination which might occur to some less fortunate families who will be caught, as it were, in the intricacies of this measure.  I would ask the Minister to look at this once again to see if in some way an upward adjustment can be made, or if he can in any way produce an amelioration of the situation as it affects these people who would stand to have their incomes suddenly and dramatically reduced.  Those of us who care about equality and want an end to discrimination would not like to see it achieved at the expense of people who could least afford to cope with a sudden reduction of their incomes.</P>
    <P>I also want to draw attention to the area of cohabitation which was touched on in the Minister's speech.  While I do appreciate that it is not possible for him in terms of this piece of legislation to deal with this ever-popular activity, nevertheless for everybody who cares about the institution of marriage and about the stability of Irish society I think it is important that we would not be seen to discriminate positively in our legislation in favour of those who would prefer to cohabit rather than those who would prefer to put their relationship on a sound legal footing by way of marriage.  I am concerned that <Col N="1490" /> this anomaly arises in the context of this legislation.  I ask the Minister to state in what way he feels this could be got over because, human nature being what it is and the economic realities being what they are, and in view of the various pressures on the shoulders of young couples, many people will take that way out and ensure that they get a better income and forego the formalities of marriage for that reason.  We should not do anything to make that an inviting or attractive prospect for them.</P>
    <P>The questions that are to be asked of those looking for social welfare benefit or assistance about the capacity they have to ensure that their children are satisfactorily minded are an interesting element and one to which the Minister drew attention. I am happy that this will be sensitively handled and that those who are asking the questions &mdash; appeals officers or deciding officers will have their attention drawn to the delicacy of this area and the way in which they must question both men and women about their responsibilities in relation to their children.</P>
    <P>I found Senator McGuinness's point about how many of these appeals officers and deciding officers are married women an interesting one and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about that.  I found it intriguing to hear Senator Fitzsimons speak about the statutory responsibility which could be taken up by the local authority in the matter of providing créches and child-minding services in local authority homes, and that because this was in the statute people could not be unduly questioned as to how they personally were assuming and adopting that responsibility.</P>
    <P>Those are the points I wanted to make in relation to this legislation.  I welcome it wholeheartedly.  It has been a long time coming but nevertheless it is extremely welcome.  The Minister's speech was first-class and I hope it receives the publicity it so richly deserves.  I am pleased too to note that sufficient publicity will be given to this legislation so that people will be aware of their new entitlements in this regard.  I look forward to the Committee and Report Stages of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be obvious to everybody when a Labour Senator stands up that the principle of equal treatment under the social welfare code is an automatic choice of his because it has been that way since 1912 when we were trying to do it under British rule.  So, it is not a new concept for us.  As a trade unionist the same applies.  The directive is there since 1978 and there was ample opportunity to bring it in before this, but at least the Minister has grasped the nettle.  It is interesting to look back at what might have happened.  The unions were concerned with the manner in which the legislation might be introduced.  Originally, when it was proposed to equalise the social welfare system it could have resulted in a lot more than the 9,000 cases which will now be at a loss to bring about the equalisation.  After discussion between the unions and the Minister a substantial area of agreement was reached and even the problems of the 9,000 have been made less acute.  But about 9,000 will suffer a loss as a result of this Bill.  The reason for this is that it is not easy in a society where you were not dealing with equality of treatment either in work situations or anywhere else to bring about reform without bringing in some packages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government proposed to introduce equality by a package of measures. Some decisions, for example, to raise certain benefits for married women and allow married women to apply for unemployment assistance, were positive.  On the negative side you had the stopping of adult dependant allowances and child dependant allowances for married men on social welfare whose wives are working or receiving welfare benefits themselves. There was a positive and a negative side to it and it had to be done in practice.  Again, with the mind of the Minister working to try to bring about equality, great areas of agreement were reached.  It is very interesting to realise that originally we could have been looking at a situation where a family with four dependent children, with the husband on long term urban unemployment assistance and his wife earning £80 a week <Col N="1492" /> making a total weekly income of £164, stood to lose about £40 a week.  Judging by the Second Stage speech of the Minister it seems that this problem has been eased to a great extent.  Overall, the problem has been made less acute and it is nothing like the difficulty that it presented in the early stages.</P>
    <P>I am not too clear from the Minister's speech about the position of elderly couples with no dependent children.  For example, the husband would be on a contributory old age pension earning £60 a week making a total weekly income of £139.  Originally he would have stood to lose about £30 a week on the reckoning of the unions at the time.  I wonder how far the Minister has gone in alleviating that situation.  Has he got over that problem?  I am not too clear on that.  I am not being dogmatic about it; I am just seeking advice on it.</P>
    <P>Looking at equality of treatment everybody believes that there is no problem in introducing it.  When you begin to examine the extent of the losses that can come as a result, the problem becomes so great that you have to take some action.  The trade unions got in touch with the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  They had several meetings with the Minister and the modification was made.  The blow in many cases has been softened.  Following the Minister's Second Stage speech I am not clear on that point and I should like to know something about it.  The Minister's speech was so comprehensive that it has taken many points out of the area of debate that might have been otherwise raised, and of which I had a note.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare have been established over a long number of years.  I spoke of 9,000 people who would be at a loss of some sort.  This commission were set up to meet the growing demands and will have to go back to the early days of the century to see how schemes started and how they developed and evolved.  It is not an easy task but, in the course of their work, if it is not too far advanced, they might have a look at whether they can supplement what the Minister has done so that the problems <Col N="1493" /> of equality will be less acute and less burdensome on the sectors that will be affected by it.</P>
    <P>The commission are vital in the sense that they are so fundamental to the importance of the whole social welfare system.  We are hoping that they will provide the blueprints for development in the years ahead.  I trust that in the course of reporting they will also recognise the difficulties in a declining financial situation or, as it is commonly known now, an economic crisis, and that they will make some recommendations on redistribution, even in the area of capital taxation, so that the question of social welfare and the taxation base can be dealt with.</P>

      <P>I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to those Senators who have contributed this evening in a very constructive way.  As some Senators said, my opening speech covered all aspects of the Bill but in view of the points which a number of Senators have raised I will refer briefly to some of them again.</P>
      <P>The main issue raised by Senator Fallon and by one other Senator was the question of dividing the Bill into the good parts and the bad parts and accepting all the good things in the Bill and not accepting the bad parts.  I doubt if there is any Member in the other House or this House, myself included, who would not like to bring in a Bill giving everything to everybody and making sure that nobody would lose anything because of it, but that is just not possible.  As I pointed out, the resources that such a measure would require are far beyond what could be afforded.  In fact those in the workforce, taxpayers and PRSI payers could not be expected to fund the kind of scheme that would be required if we were to bring in a Bill to give equality across the board and level all the benefits upwards instead of the way it is being done here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are not levelling all the benefits downwards.  In the vast majority of cases there is an improvement in rates but, unfortunately, <Col N="1494" /> I must concede that in a small number of cases there are people who will be adversely affected by the Bill's provisions. As I stated in my opening remarks, the whole question of dependency is a very complex one, particularly in the way that the dependency was operated under our social welfare system where we had a system &mdash; and will still have until this Bill is passed &mdash; where husbands can draw the dependent relative allowance for their wives even though they could be in good jobs with substantial earnings.</P>
    <P>In fact, irrespective of the earnings of a wife, under the present system a husband can draw dependency allowance for her even though the husband's former employment might have paid less wages than the wife's employment.  To extend the right to a wife when unemployed to be able to claim for her husband, who could be in a good job with good earnings, and to claim for her children, would just not be on.  That, in effect, is what Senator Fallon is looking for, even though he did not say that.  There is no way in which an equality law can be brought in that could have any other effect because at the moment the law states that an unemployed husband can claim for his employed wife and all the dependent children.  If that situation is allowed to stand, then equality would mean that the unemployed wife can claim for her employed husband and their children.  No Senator who has raised this point has been able to reconcile that argument with the necessity to implement the rules on equality in accordance with the directive, because it is not possible to reconcile those two arguments.</P>
    <P>If it were possible I am sure the leader of the Senator's party, who was Minister for Social Welfare when this directive was made and was Minister for more than 12 months afterwards, would not have put this directive on the shelf and conveniently forgotten about it.  We have to face up to the fact that the inequalities in our social welfare system and the discrimination against women, particularly married women, must be eliminated.  Admittedly, there is this price that a small minority of people have to pay.  These people have <Col N="1495" /> been and still are of major concern to us in Government and that is another reason why the bringing of this legislation before the House was delayed.  We sought in every way possible to alleviate any possible hardship that might arise from bringing in this legislation and I believe the Government have gone a long way in alleviating the possible hardships that might arise in this case.  We must remember that after the passing of this Bill 46,000 married women will gain substantially from it and of the 170,000 married men in the system, 150,000 are in no way affected.  Of the 20,000 that stand to lose to the extent that I explained in my opening statement, the alleviating measures being provided will cover about 11,000 of these cases.  For some of these 11,000 these measures will wholly or partially eliminate any losses at all.  It is safe to assume that in that 11,000 there are people whose spouses are in very good employment; they are not all in poor employment though some might be.</P>
    <P>We are looking at a situation in the social welfare system, even in the cases we are talking about, where there is going to be hardship because there is going to be a loss.  These are cases where there is an income coming into the house.  One of the spouses in these cases, the wife, is at work.  The measures to alleviate the hardship are substantial and, in fact, go a long way to eliminate the hardships concerned.  It is misleading to argue that one could bring in a system to do away with inequality and discrimination on sex grounds in the social welfare code and, at the same time, have no losses.  As I said in my opening speech, such a scheme, which would mean levelling up all benefits, would cost about £100 million. I do think that could be justified under any heading.  Even if for some reason the Government had £100 million extra to spend tomorrow those people would not be the worst off in the social welfare code.  There would be other categories who would be in a far less favourable position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" /> I want to clarify a point Senator McGuinness raised when she said that the Bill was brought forward as a result of the High Court action.  This Bill was circulated in Dáil Éireann on 13 December 1984 and the High Court action was not taken until this year.  It was taken in February 1985 so that, in that sense, the Bill is not coming in to try to redress some legal action that is afoot.  Members of the House have referred to the delay in bringing in this Bill and they are quite correct in that.  I submit that the Government have done everything possible to bring it in as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuiness, too, referred to the questioning of married women in relation to their claims for unemployment benefit.  I explained why unemployment payments schemes must have conditions relating to an applicant's ability to work and why deciding officers must be permitted to carry out the necessary investigations to satisfy themselves that applicants are genuinely looking for work.  I also pointed out that the vast majority of married women claiming unemployment qualified for it and that, in most cases, these women have children. The picture is not at all as bad as some commentators would seem to suggest.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator McGuinness accepting the legitimacy of asking questions about child minding where such questions are relevant to a claimant's availability for work.  I do not think that there can be any argument about the need for adequate controls.  Neither would there be any argument &mdash; certainly not from me &mdash; against the application of these controls on a non-discriminatory basis.  We are all agreed that if there are discriminatory practices they must be eliminated.  I am satisfied that in the provisions of the directive itself and the new guidelines that will be issued, we have the requisite basis for a non-discriminatory system.  Senators can be assured that we will be closely monitoring the situation and any measures that might become necessary will be taken.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness asked how many deciding officers and appeals officers are women.  I have not got the information <Col N="1497" /> here, but many deciding officers are women and many more, of course, are men who have wives at work and have to make arrangements for child minding. They are familiar with the circumstances in that regard.  Deciding officers and appeals officers are selected on merit and ability.  There is no marital or sex discrimination in the selection of deciding officers and appeals officers.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia referred to the question of cohabitation.  I mentioned this fairly extensively in my opening remarks but I also mentioned the fact that it was a problem that could not be dealt with under this Bill.  As Senators are aware the Commission of Social Welfare are examining all aspects of our social welfare code.  I am sure this matter is receiving attention from them.  We can only wait and see what they will come up with. The main point I want to reiterate is that that aspect should not be part of this Bill. It has nothing to do with discrimination between the sexes or the inequalities that exist in social welfare benefit.  I should like to thank the House for their reception of this Bill and the speed with which they have allowed this Stage to be dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I was advocating that this Bill should be introduced long before now.  I see it as a major contribution to the upgrading of our cattle herd in general, especially improving <Col N="1498" /> quality in beef and dairy herds.  Agriculture accounts for one-third of our exports and it is in our interest to ensure that the quality of the cattle we produce meets the demands of the market and rewards the producer.  For the financial well being of the country and the farming community the livestock industry is most important and every effort should be made to ensure that quality animals are produced.</P>
      <P>This Bill is very necessary.  Last week I was at the royal show and I visited the CBF stand.  This agency are responsible for promoting the export of our cattle. I saw cattle exhibited there and I was disappointed at the quality on exhibit on that occasion.  The farmers who were with me on that occasion were also disappointed. This is one of the reasons that this Bill is necessary.  It is important to have quality.  I am sure higher standards will be required by the countries to which we will be exporting our livestock in the future.  I am sure when grading is introduced we will find it difficult to compete. I am sure it is the Minister's intention in introducing this Bill to improve the standards of our cattle to meet the demands of the market we intend producing them for.</P>
      <P>Some people may feel that sections of the Bill are harsh.  The Sneem Cooperative Society are concerned that they will not be in a position to produce cattle as a result of this Bill.  I do not agree with this.  In the long term we need this Bill for the improvement of cattle throughout the country even without the amendments that were introduced in the other House.  We have pity for the small farmers and I am sure their problems can be overcome but we have to produce quality cattle.  I am sure only a small percentage of the cattle produced in the disadvantaged areas will eventually reach the export market.  Concern has been expressed in relation to the non-availability or scarcity of first quality animals.  This will sort itself out.  As I have already stated, the marketplace will determine whether it is possible to become breeders of good quality animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our beef industry is a £1,000 million <Col N="1499" /> industry, of which 80 per cent of its products are exportable.  Therefore, it is important that we have proper pedigree beef sires.  Mention has been made of three-quarter bred bulls.  I do not know what this means.  It is just a glorified name for a scrub bull.  The Minister is introducing amendments to the Bill to ensure that bulls will be examined, especially in the disadvantaged areas.  It should be ensured that the people who are given licences for these bulls produce top quality bulls.</P>
    <P>The position of our dairy herd has not been good despite the availability of AI. The yield of the Irish dairy cow is approximately half the yield of the dairy cow in other countries, for example, the Netherlands and Denmark.  To improve on this situation the AI stations and the cattle breeding societies must become more thorough and selective in their selection of sires.  This programme has been in existence for 30 years.  It is a poor reflection on the programme that the national average milk yield per cow is approximately 700 gallons.  The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of 16 February condemned this Bill.  It was stated in that issue that our legislators are still living in the distant past and so are many of our pedigree Friesian breeders.  I should like to point out if pedigree Friesian breeders were allowed import their own sires for their cattle we would have a higher average than the 700 gallons national average.</P>
    <P>A herd competition was organised by the Irish Friesian Breeders Association last year and the year before that.  The highest average of the herd that won was between 1,500 and 1,600 gallons.  This gives an idea of the contribution the pedigree breeders are making to agriculture. If everyone took example from the pedigree breeders, in their breeding programme and in their stockmanship, I am sure we would not be in the super-levy situation we find ourselves in today. We would have a higher base and would be in a position to maintain it.  It is unfair of the editor of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, who is a member of Bord na gCapall to say what he did.  I do not know if <Col N="1500" /> his knowledge of cattle is equal to his knowledge of horses, but that does not qualify him for chairmanship of the board.  I am sure it is his loyalty to one of the Government parties that qualifies him for it.</P>
    <P>I should like to take issue with the Department in restricting the importation of semen of good bulls to pedigree breeders.  Breeders visited England and saw a progeny of a bull and some of them imported the semen.  When other farmers, including myself, looked for licences to import, we were told that they would not be granted to us.  The Department are slowing down progress in this respect.  They should take advice from the breeders who have experience in this area and have put years of work into a business that has been handed down from father to son.  There should be no deterrent in regard to the importation of semen when breeders, who have been very successful in breeding top quality cattle, want to import such semen. This will be for the benefit of agriculture and for the national economy also.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the National Milk Recording Co-op which is based in Bandon.  Their report was presented to the Minister some time ago and he congratulated them on the great work being done.  I should like also to congratulate them and their chairman, Michael Buckley. This is another scheme which was ridiculed and criticised by the editor of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal.</i>  If we are to make progress in the quality of our livestock production the Minister should take cognisance of the views put forward by pedigree breeders.  It would be advisable for the Minister to meet these societies and hear their views.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have his officials look more positively and leniently, especially when it is for the improvement of our dairy and cattle stocks, at the issuing of licences for the importation of semen from good bulls.  I commend the Minister on the introduction of this Bill. I welcome the Bill and I hope the Minister will be able to implement it in its entirely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister <Col N="1501" /> for bringing this Bill before the House. It is a step in the right direction.  It is certainly a forward step after, perhaps one could say, a few backward ones down through the years.  One would imagine there should be no need to bring in such a Bill because all farmers should have learned that the need to have first class stock is essential.  Even in times when cattle are dear there is never any difficulty in disposing of good stock.  For that reason it is amazing that there is a need to bring in such a Bill.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that all farming organisations have welcomed this Bill.  Perhaps few people will be affected by it.  I mean by that that in recent days and weeks the Minister has bent over backwards to help the people who were crying loudest about the way this Bill might affect them, the small single suckler herds.  I agree, that some of these people were concerned.  I can understand that because there are always problems in the single suckler herd or any suckler herd.  Heat detection is one of the greatest problems.  There are also problems in small herds where people believe that the cost of a bull can be from £800 to £1,200.  The Minister has allayed their fears by showing mercy for the first three years at least and allowing them to keep a bull for herds of less than 20 cows.  He has bent over backwards to help them in this respect.</P>
      <P>A national breeding programme for cattle is essential.  Nobody will dispute that.  It is in the nation's interests that the Bill should receive the full support of the House.  Agriculture accounts for 25 per cent of our total exports.  I do not have to remind Members that we are a net exporting country and our cattle exports represent 19 per cent of the total of agricultural exports.  It is in our interest to ensure that the quality of the cattle we produce meets the demands of the market and rewards the producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this Bill will be to repeal the Live Stock Breeding Act, 1925 under which 700 bulls were visually inspected annually.  In the past years we have seen a change in the demands of the industry which was reflected in the type of bulls such as the Charolais and the Simmental. <Col N="1502" /> The number of pedigree bulls for licence and the need to breed specific products for a specific market were recognised. The continental cattle were producing the leaner type carcase.  Naturally people go to the factory these days with Simmental or continental breeds because the kill out in the factory is encouraging for anybody breeding these cattle.  This meant more money in their pockets than with some of the other types.  They are well rewarded for doing this.  The leaner calf is in at this stage.  The Hereford has been run down in recent years but this has been redressed recently.</P>
    <P>Under the 1925 Act two rounds of visual inspection were carried out annually &mdash; with two possible appeal rounds &mdash; before a certain date at 400 different centres.  That, together with the annual comb-out of unlicensed bulls was a very expensive system with a net cost to the Exchequer of between £100,000 and £170,000 annually.  In 1982 the Government decided to drop the scheme and cease the licensing of bulls.  That was a mistake as I think most people agree.  It was a long term economy measure of the worst type with no restriction from then on in the use of bulls.  We are now witnessing the result with a rapid decline in quality.  That can be seen to some extent in marts, especially in the spring time when they look much worse than at any other time.  Bearing this in mind, when 80 per cent of our beef output is exported the disastrous economic consequences are obvious.</P>
    <P>To be competitive in this market we must use the best material available and continue to select the most superior bulls to breed.  That is what the Bill is all about. It will not be without its problems which I mentioned earlier for certain sections of the farming community, even though it is in the greater interest of everybody. The heat detection in suckler herds for the AI service presents some difficulties. Most people with suckler herds would consider using AI if it were possible to detect the cows in heat at a certain time, but their heat is of a much shorter duration than that of cows that are milking, and it is much more difficult to detect <Col N="1503" /> them.  Possibly for other reasons they are not seen as often as milch cows.  It is more difficult and I think everybody involved knows that.</P>
    <P>It causes real problems for the small suckler herd owner.  The large suckler herd owner can more easily justify the economics of a pedigree bull to run his herd.  This argument is made by many people at the moment.  Perhaps they are thinking of the higher price bull from the £800 to £1,200.  At present the small suckler herds have unlicensed bulls ranging in type from the reasonable to good combination cross breed to the scrub.  I am not quite sure where the name originated. However, I have seen some quite good scrub bulls in my time.  It is a pity to call them such a name.  In fact, some of them were better than the pedigree.  I am talking about a minority no doubt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that.  These farmers will need help initially in relation to the purchase of a pedigree bull.  These bulls are freely available from £800 upwards. I suppose the prices quoted reflect the top prices and bear little relationship to the average price.  I am sure bulls can be bought for as low as £400 and £500.  The bull can be sold at the end of the season and I suppose no money is tied up for an undue length of time.  Most people feel they should dispose of the bull when the cows are in calf because they do not want to have to feed him over a whole winter to the following year.  Even though they lose some money by doing this, most people feel they should sell the bull at that time.  Strangely enough many people, especially those with small children, are scared of keeping a bull and they keep him for as short a time as possible. I know many people who use AI at the moment would prefer to keep a bull but, because there are children around the house, they are scared to do so.  For that reason they sell off their bulls rather early, perhaps when they get all the cows in calf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any farmer in any part of the country <Col N="1504" /> experiences difficulties in this regard the breeding societies have offered to help find a bull at reasonable cost and of good conformation.  The economics of having a bull are sound even for small suckler herd owners even though initially they may be sceptical.  A good bull with a small suckler herd will increase the profitability and decrease the necessity for subsidy. It is in everybody's interest to ensure a smooth transition from the present situation to that envisaged in the Bill.  Traditionally, the value of a pedigree bull for crossing for commercial cattle was equivalent to the price of three bullocks.  Now, it is the equivalent to the price of one bullock.  With the super-levy we should see further specialisation in dairy farms.</P>
    <P>The Holstein has a role to play in herds of 1,200 gallons per cow and upwards only.  Its conformation from the beef point of view, many people would say, is disastrous.  We are unique in this country in that 80 per cent of our beef is produced from our dairy herds.  We have no specialisation. It is vital to encourage more suckler beef production and to ensure that it can be done economically, unlike the situation obtaining.  It is proposed now to subsidise to the tune of £70 per suckler cow in disadvantaged areas.  Serious consideration must be given to extending this scheme to the whole country, based on the theory that an increase in the quality of the product, namely beef, will give a greater return to the producer which, in turn, will allow for an overall decrease in subsidisation on account of the independent viability of the operation.  The surplus liquid milk in the community must be used to increase our beef herd and to maximise the benefits therefrom.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that our national herd numbers will be increased.  Our cattle population has gone up marginally since 1983.  There are 70 per cent of beef cow herds allocated in the disadvantaged areas.  These farmers are enjoying the £70 subsidy which I would like to see spread over the rest of the country because it would encourage people to go into beef production.  With milk mountains and butter mountains at the moment we <Col N="1505" /> should be trying to do something to encourage people in this direction.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the AI subsidy is to be regretted.  This together with the super-levy will cause a decline in the usage of AI.  Apart altogether from the visual examination of herd bull status, AI bulls are all progeny-tested.  The milk board arrange the insemination of one-third of the cows in the country.  The regulation of the usage of quality half-bred bulls or three-quarter bred bulls is impossible.  The breeding societies have no responsibility or function, nor would the Department of Agriculture have any regulatory role to play in any case.</P>
    <P>I suppose we can never justify the suggestion that we should not increase the genetic material any further in view of the vital economic importance of the cattle industry.  If we want to maximise profits from the beef industry for the economy, the farmers must be rewarded for production of quality in the future.  They will have to be rewarded for producing a specific product for what is mainly an export market.  The product must be produced from our meat processing industry. There is much talk from time to time about the amount of cattle exported on the hoof.  There is tremendous room for improvement in the value-added area with further packing and beef processing generally and, indeed, small products. Anything we can do to encourage the production of the right product for this industry must be done.  This Bill does that.</P>
    <P>Third World countries are valuable clients of this industry as instanced by the announcement recently of a contract for our cattle.  I suppose all organisations support the Bill for that reason.  When we talk about cattle exports to third countries some people are inclined to think that any type of cattle will do.  Nothing could be further from the truth because these people certainly will not take any type of cattle.  They are quite choosy about the type of cattle they want.  Anybody who thinks otherwise is greatly mistaken.</P>
    <P>The second objective of producing high quality stores and beef forms the basis of <Col N="1506" /> this Bill.  The overall economic good is served by the provisions of the Bill.  There is no doubt whatever that problems will be encountered, particularly in the case of the five to ten suckler cow herd.  I am grateful to the Minister for his decision to facilitate these people even for three years.  Three years is quite a long time in this industry.  I compliment the Minister. He has taken account of the wishes of certain pressure groups.  Certainly there was some pressure from some groups. They said they should be allowed to keep these bulls at least where they had a small suckler herd.  In fairness to the Minister he has responded to the call.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cattle industry at the moment and the suckler breed, which most of us talk about, and most people talked about it when this Bill was being brought before the House, it is fair to say that the amount of profit at the moment is very low.  The complaints coming from some of these small groups at the outset was &mdash; and especially some of these groups with five to ten cows or even a little more &mdash; that they had to buy a bull at £800 or £1,000 and that they just could not survive.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious to improve the quality of our livestock.  I was on the ACOT board some years ago and I remember the late Jimmie O'Keeffe talking about the dairy man in the south of Ireland. Many calves from the south of Ireland come to our part of the country.  The Minister knows that.  Many people go down to the south and take up some of the stock.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will not mind if I say that some of the stock from the south is not great.  You could describe them as just live stock.  Others would be happier if they were dead stock.  You would not be proud of them.  I heard the late Jimmie O'Keeffe saying that most milk producers in the south were just concerned about the cow having a calf. They were not concerned about what type of calf she had.  In fact, he said, if some of the cows were to be in calf to some of the continental breeds like Charolais and Simmental that there would be a loss in milk yields of £60 or £70.  That <Col N="1507" /> was the estimate he put on it.  Others felt they were as well off with a bad calf as a good one.  That was a poor outlook to say the least of it because they should remember that they are customers as well.  People are really fed up with these types of calves.  They are bought simply because they appear to be a little cheaper than the better calf.  At the end of the day they are probably dearer.  Some of these calves are coming from high milk strain bulls.  As somebody said, if you bought some of them you would never be without a calf.</P>
    <P>I heard a joke recently which I thought was quite amusing.  I met two farmers at a sale.  A dealing man came over to one of them then and said, &ldquo;How did your calves do, the six I sold you last year?&rdquo;  He answered, &ldquo;Three did badly and three did very well&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Oh, God&rdquo;, said the dealer &ldquo;what happened, did three die&rdquo;?  The man replied, &ldquo;They were the three that did well; it was the three that lived that robbed me&rdquo;.  There is a lot of sense in that.  It might sound very funny but there is a lot of sense in it.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I think there is an onus on all of us, throughout the length and breadth of the country, to look after our customers.  We talk about the Libyan trade but we should be making an appeal &mdash; I know the Minister will be doing that, coming from that neck of the woods also &mdash; that when we talk about the thousands of calves that come from the south to quite good customers in the north and the midlands we should be asking them to improve their livestock as well, although in recent times it is fair to say when people in the dairy industry have their sufficient number of heifers they tend to send out the remainder of the cows to some of the continentals or perhaps to some of the Whiteheads.</P>
    <P>I notice in recent times that the Hereford at most sales has really tended to take over.  Again, perhaps the right cross of the Whitehead and the Hereford can be very good.  It would be true to say that some years ago some of them did not grow at all.  If you got them to reach a half tonne weight you could never get <Col N="1508" /> them any higher.  We are not separate in this, we are together in this because it is in all of our interests at this moment, in a time when there is cloud over the whole issue of cattle prices.  Nobody is quite sure exactly what the autumn prices will be.  Some people are quite scared about it at this moment.  I always believe &mdash; perhaps many people will agree with me on this &mdash; that if the stock is good, even though there may be a fall in price, you are still going to be reasonably well paid.</P>
    <P>Anybody going to sales in recent years &mdash; I am talking about the past four, five or six years and again I am coming back to the dairy man where he may or may not be making mistakes &mdash; will see some of the continental type calves making as much as £260, £270, £280 and often £300. The Minister will agree that they have made that much.  In fact I was at a sale last Friday and a one week old continental type calf was sold for £280.  I am not suggesting that that is right.  The Minister is shaking his head, as if to say it is daft. The point I am making is that the good contintental bull calf is making in most cases, far more than he is worth.  They are really well paid for having good stock. It is coming back to the real purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>One can only welcome a Bill which is going to improve the cattle stock for all of us.  We cannot afford to wait any longer. Anybody in his sane senses would have to welcome this Bill.  Nobody could condemn such a Bill.  Perhaps it is not too late.  Some people would say that we have a tremendous amount of inferior stock around.  I do not think it is as bad as all that.  You do find some.  They are more noticeable in the spring when they have suffered as a result of insufficient feeding or bad housing.  Perhaps at certain times of the year they may be more noticeable than at other times.  For that reason, I can only say that the Bill can do nothing but good.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently covered the complaint that has been made regularly over the past number of weeks in relation to the small suckler herds.  He has bent over backwards to meet that case.  For that reason, I compliment the Minister. <Col N="1509" /> I do not think one should hold up the Bill any longer at this moment.  I compliment the Minister for grasping the nettle and for taking the action which is welcomed by every farming group in this country.  I give it my full support.</P>

      <P>I intend, in the few minutes available to me, to relate my remarks not alone to what is in the Bill but also to what has happened to this Bill and to what has happened to the intent behind it since it was first published at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>I regret &mdash; I want to put this on record &mdash; that a combination of interests, in both the political field and in the agricultural field, have combined to the point where they have succeeded in doing damage to the intent and to the purpose of this Bill. I welcomed this measure when it was first introduced in its original form because I accepted that it was aimed at achieving the right thing and it was going in the right direction.  The aim and purpose of the Bill is to bring about a higher level of quality in the livestock industry of this country.  I recognise fully the Minister's commitment to the question of quality in agriculture, whether it is in animals, in cereals, potatoes or any aspect of the industry.  He has had a lifelong commitment to the improvement of standards and the improvement of quality.  I have no doubt that he set out with this particular purpose in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the interests to which I referred have succeeded in getting an amendment to this Bill which will, to some extent for a number of years to come, damage strongly the purpose for which it was intended.  I want to name these interests.  I want to say that they are both from the political and from the agricultural sectors.  We have had pressure from Government backbenchers; we have had pressure for the amendment from the Fianna Fáil backbenchers; we have had it from a most unusual source, the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, a publication that has always expressed itself as being committed to the promotion of higher standards in Irish agriculture.  We have had it from certain groups within the <Col N="1510" /> agricultural scene.</P>
    <P>I notice that Senator Ellis has arrived in the Chamber since I began to speak.  I listened to his address here last week.  As I said to him afterwards, I wanted to compliment him on the points he made. My only regret is that the views he expressed, the views I am expressing now, did not find a sufficient echo of support within the backbenchers of both our parties.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the amendment which has been introduced.  I want to express the fears I have in relation to it.  As I understand it, the effect of the amendment will be to allow a continuation of the existing position for the next three years in herd sizes of up to 20 cows. If we take the average herd size in the country as six and a half cows we are talking of a very substantial number of herds coming under that umbrealla.</P>
    <P>If we allow the present system to continue for a period of three years, the calves and the cattle that will result over three years will still be with us in five or six years time.  In my view the responsibility for this amendment rests with farming organisations, with people like our own back benchers, and with publications like the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal.</i>  If we continue to produce rubbish on many of our farms over the next three to five years, we will know where the responsibility belongs.  That mentality which was expressed in the earlier part of this year is damaging to agriculture.  It is the mentality that ensured that mountain ewes were sold on the Paris lamb market as Irish lamb resulting in considerable damage to the lamb trade.</P>
    <P>I have had long personal experience with farm organisations.  I have been involved with them.  I have never hesitated to defend the legitimate interest of the farmers or the agricultural industry. There is a noticable reluctance on the part of some of our farmers to produce a quality product.  That can be seen in the livestock we are producing, in bad husbandry in certain cases and in the type of vegetables and potatoes we produce.  In fact, very good products are ruined because the good are mixed with the bad. In relation to that mentality again it took <Col N="1511" /> penal measures within the dairy industry to ensure the production of quality milk. Ten years ago when the fruits of the EC began to flow into our farms they were whittled away continuously by the wrong options being chosen.  The money and the finance given to promote quality products and quality production were buried in concrete and machinery.  We have reached the stage now where &mdash; certainly in the European market &mdash; quality, and quality alone, will count.  Whatever measure of responsibility those of us privileged to be legislators have, we must recognise that slipshod methods are out where agriculture is concerned.  In the marketplace there is no room for laggards in any circumstances.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Bill &mdash; and I hope it can be realised &mdash; is to improve the quality of our livestock.  In 1984 the value of meat exports was £890 million.  That represents 10 per cent of our total exports.  Every other export &mdash; the remaining 90 per cent &mdash; comes from industries and sectors whose primary consideration is the promotion of higher and better standards and the manufacture and sale and export of a still higher quality product.  There are interests in the agricultural industry at present who feel that for some reason they are privileged to go against all that knowledge and belief.  The Department of Agriculture in their EC Carcase Classification Scheme have shown quite clearly that there is a deterioration in carcase quality.  Any of us who stand in cattle markets and try to buy cattle there can only be conscious of the deteriorating standards in our cattle.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell too long on this mysterious article called the three-quarter bred bull.  There is no such thing and other Senators have amply disposed of that.  None of us can stand over the type of farming in some holdings which are looking for permission to use this three-quarter bred bull.  To me that request is simply a cover for people who are lackadaisical in their approach to their profession, people who are not concerned about quality and who wish to continue to produce mongrels for which <Col N="1512" /> there is only a declining and continuously restricting market.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to the value of third country markets.  Their value has been a mixed one.  They have paid for inferior quality cattle the same prices virtually as are being paid for the quality elements.  In other words, they have been taking the rubbish from our farms.  For as long as these markets were open there was an opportunity, or an excuse, to produce the type of animals that fitted into that category.  These markets are declining.  We are finding ourselves being steadily forced back onto the European scene.  In these markets we will sell on quality, and on quality alone.  The objective of going for quality on a market that demands quality and at the same time permitting the use of inferior bulls on our farms is the direct opposite to what every expert in the field has indicated to us is required.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that nothing in my remarks is directed at the Minister. The pressure was there.  It was on us here.  It was on the people over there.  It was in the Fine Gael Árd-Fheis in Cork. It came from quite a number of quarters. It came from <i>The Farmers' Journal.</i>  We will see the results in the years ahead.  In conclusion &mdash; I am requesting the Minister to ensure that whatever regulations are made in relation to the inspection of these non-pedigree bulls for use in certain herds will be as tight as possible.  Perhaps the Department could make certain leasing arrangements for people who say they cannot afford a pedigree bull.  Special term schemes which existed in the past could be brought in again.  Premiums could be considered.  Certainly, in the suckler herds perhaps the Minister could extend the grant system to ensure that a pedigree bull would be eligible for a grant.  These are all alternatives which would have the effect, I believe, of ensuring that the quality of this industry would be developed, and the product would be available in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I regret that I had to make these remarks but I believe it would be entirely wrong to ignore the fact that groups <Col N="1513" /> whose responsibility it was to act otherwise have acted in an irresponsible manner.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Members for their contributions. It is clear from the debate that there is general agreement with the intent and purpose of the Bill.  Indeed, I presupposed that coming here because on the Adjournment debate in this House on bull licensing on 14 July 1983 the reintroduction of controls on bulls for breeding was advocated and, indeed, advocated quite strongly in this House and getting rid of the 1925 Livestock Breeding Act was regretted.</P>
      <P>Very briefly, on a few specifics.  Senator T. Hussey referred to the Irish dairying situation as compared with Denmark.  My view on the matter is that we should place the emphasis on the overall efficiency of the dairying operation rather on yield per cow.  As we all know very well, high yields per cow do not necessarily mean high profits.  However, I accept that we have room for a substantial increase in yield and breeding has a place in this but, of course, so also has better grassland utilisation and better management of health generally.  As far as dairying is concerned, especially with an eye to beef, we have enough good genetic materials here at home.  The demand for Holstein is certainly something that we should look at very carefully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot exactly do that.  I certainly share the view that, especially looking ahead to a time when group proposals may be taboo, the fewer Holstein we have the better.  But we are fortunate that, because of restrictions, we have managed to keep down the level of Holstein blood in the Friesian breed. Talking about milk, I should like to mention the work being done by the Irish Dairy Records Co-Op and Slimline. That, certainly, is helping a lot towards pointing out to farmers where they are <Col N="1514" /> going right and, indeed, where they are going wrong.  Now that we have tied it in with the UK, it is a very comprehensive service indeed and one that is being availed of and subsidised by our own Department.</P>
      <P>Senator Hourigan raised the question of the use of the Garda Síochána in administering this proposed legislation.  I can assure him and the House that the gardaí would be used only in very extreme cases.  In fact, that inclusion of the gardaí is standard in legislation of this kind.</P>
      <P>Senator M. O'Toole referred to the problems of isolated areas.  The stated intention is to allow, as I said already, the use of non-pedigree bulls &mdash; I did not refer to the three quarter, half, or seven eighths.  What I am talking about are non-pedigree bulls in small beef cow herds. That should cater for the problems of isolated areas.  If such problems need to be catered for on a continuing basis, the Minister of the day can do so.  Senator O'Toole also referred to the licensing of bulls in Scotland.  The problem, as I see it there, is not so much one of licensing. The problem is more in relation to the rules of the breed societies in the UK than to any official controls.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald raised the question of the severity of the penalties laid down in the Bill.  I would like to stress that these are maximum penalties and that the level of penalty in any individual case will be decided by the courts.  All I am saying is that in this Bill, for a given offence, the penalty cannot exceed a certain figure.  Senator McDonald also drew attention to the serving of notices under section 7 of the Bill.  He referred in particular to the service of notices to a person of 16 years of age where the owner of the bull is not known.  As regards the service of a notice to a 16 year old, this is the same as what was provided for in section 13 of the old 1925 Act, which we are now repealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the service of a notice to the owner of a bull when the identity of the owner is not known, this phraseology, peculiar as it may sound, is standard in about 20 different Acts and is taken from <Col N="1515" /> the Town Planning Act.  In practice, what it means is that the notice can be addressed to the owner of the bull, care of the owner of the land on which the bull is kept.  Section 13 of the 1925 Act also includes this in its provisions.  It establishes that the letter was posted and the service of the notice is proven in this way, Senator McDonald also felt that the period of 14 days in section 6 (3) is too short.  I consider this period is quite adequate since the owner will already have had at least 28 days notice under section 6(1), that he must either castrate or slaughter the bull.  A letter to the Minister or to the Department is all that is needed to constitute a formal appeal.</P>
    <P>Senator Ellis spoke about the need for the Department to provide money for the purchase of top class bulls.  The Department have in their leasing scheme a limited number of quality bulls of the Hereford and Angus breeds which have been located on lease under the scheme with pedigree breeders and with AI stations.  The intention is to ensure that top quality bulls which might otherwise be lost to the breeding sector are retained for breeding and the strategic use of funds.</P>
    <P>Senator Ellis also referred to the age of 15 months.  That was an interesting point.  I checked that out myself.  The Bill does provide that a bull over the age of nine months will be illegal unless it is a pedigree or covered by a permit.  The 15 months relates to the type of documentation which will be acceptable as proof of a bull being in the herd book sector. When a breed society are notified of the birth of a bull calf, they issue a certificate acknowledging notification of the birth. This certificate is evidence of eligibility for entry in the herd book.  When the animal is approved for entry in the herd book a certificate of registration is issued by the society.  If this certificate is not issued by the time the bull reaches 15 months, he becomes an illegal bull for the purpose of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely raised the question of a particular bull.  We have a system with regard to bulls that a certain amount of <Col N="1516" /> semen is allowed and some tests are carried out.  He will be glad to know that I would favourably consider a formal application from him.  It is time we allowed some more in from that animal. He also made the point about the scarcity of good stock.  That is probably one of our biggest problems in the price of calves.  The price of calves was referred to by nearly every speaker as being too high.  For instance, one day this year at trials somewhere in the UK and in Bandon, calves from the UK were making about £90 sterling in the UK and they were making IR£199 here.  If that animal ends up in the same market, quite obviously, our beef man is at a big disadvantage from the point of view of competing. One of the reasons why good calves are so dear is that they are scarce.  There are too many inferior calves on offer.  The advice with regard to the use of continental bulls also makes a point for the breeders. There was a genuine fear of continental bulls and the difficulties in calving.  The breed societies spent a lot of money on both continental and Herefords. They have developed a strain of bull calf that does not have calving problems, or at least you will know the one that has.  That is one of the good things about breeding.  You know where you are with the indifferent type animal.  You do not know what is going to happen at calving time.</P>
    <P>Senator Lennon mentioned the pressure groups and the low profits in suckling. It is a fact that people came from both sides of the House.  It was not really pressure. They said that this would, if I implemented it as I intended to, cause great hardship in certain areas where you had small suckler herds, that people would be put out of business or be at a disadvantage. Very reluctantly we gave this concession on the basis that if they had a good quality non-pedigree bull in small suckler herds of 20 cows or under we would allow for that bull to be inspected by an inspector of our Department and that the inspection would be paid for by the farmer himself.  It is not written into the Bill but will be by way of regulation and it is for a three year period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> That will give people time to gear themselves up for legislation and also it will eventually show them the folly of their ways.  A suckler man of all people should be the very last man to keep a bad bull because he is stuck with the product of whatever type of animals he has.  It might be different for a dairy man, if he can get rid of that calf, and if he has a different type of calf well then somebody else is going to have that problem.  But the suckler man is going to have that animal for a long time and surely it is in his own interest to ensure that where possible he would use AI or, indeed, that he would use a good quality bull.  Indeed, the information coming back to me is that quite a lot of the suckler people, even the small suckler people, in spite of the difficulties of identifying even they are using the AI and, indeed, are using pure bred bulls even though the clause is there whereby they may do otherwise.  I am not saying to them that they should.  I am quite sure many of them will be guided by their own superior knowledge of the industry and of what will sell well and we will do what the main thrust of the Bill is trying to set out to do, that is to improve the quality of our animals.  Certainly, the only way to do that is through legislation. I share the disappointment of the Senators from both sides of the House with regard to the sort of journalistic tactics that went on in regard to this.  I do not know what was behind it but certainly it did cause some problems.  The amendment is a small one and it cannot cause that much hassle.</P>
    <P>I do not share this pessimism with regard to the regulation, that it can do that much damage, for the reasons that I have outlined.  While there is an out there for some people, that is, for people with small suckler herds, the suckler herd would be about one-sixth of the entire cattle trade.  Even of that one-sixth, my information from people in my Department is that a substantial amount of them will do the right thing anyway.  I would hope that the others, when they see how their neighbours are getting on, will follow suit.</P>
    <P>As Senators rightly pointed out, we are <Col N="1518" /> in a very tight competitive scene.  We have always aimed at the top of the market.  If we are to have a future, I think the future of our cattle will be, as has been in the past, in the German butchers and, indeed, in the British supermarkets and developing down into the Middle East.  There, again, in the Middle East they are looking for better quality, for high quality vac-packed.  The people who carry out the processing of meat tell me that for a good quality product you need a good quality animal and, certainly, there is no room at all for poor quality nor, indeed, is there any need for it.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we have more than enough genetic material here as far as our dairy herd is concerned.  We have a superior type of Friesian cow and, indeed, some very nice Shorthorns coming up that with proper management will provide us with our milk requirements. The dairy farmer should give a little bit more attention to the beef man who is working on much smaller margins. The beef farmer is working on very slim margins, even at best.  If he does not get the right product, he will not be there at all.</P>

      <P>In relation to section 1 &mdash; the Minister has partly referred to this in his reply &mdash; there is the question of the 15 months bull.  I agree with Senator Ellis that that should be nine months.  &ldquo;Certificate in relation to a bull means a certificate issued by an approved organisation certifying that the bull has been entered in a herd book of that organisation, or if the bull is under the age of 15 months, is eligible to be entered in that herd book.&rdquo; I think that should read nine months rather than 15 months.  The Minister could easily change that at this stage.  It <Col N="1519" /> would be better for everybody if it were changed just now.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not feel that most of the breed societies at the moment issue their certificates within the space of a couple of months of registration? I feel, and I think the other Members of the House feel as well, that nine months is the maximum that should be allowed in view of the fact that there was an old loophole which was used in the 1925 Act where a farmer applied for a licence for a non-pedigree bull, which meant that he could keep him over the summer without being in any danger of prosecution.  I feel that this is going to mean that the inferior stock of the breed societies which they may want culled will be allowed under Acts of this Parliament to remain in use for one season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can amend any legislation himself.  While we have no amendment submitted, we are querying the section and I want to support previous speakers on the nine to 15 months.  I know from my experience in breeding societies that you can have a bull for a considerable length of time and it is hard to identify the age of an animal up to six months.  You can have an animal that at two months will look as good as another animal at six months.  When an inspector from the breeding societies or from the Department comes to inspect the animal you can give the date of birth but is may not be authentic.  It is happening regularly in breeding societies.  It is very difficult to identify this irregularity until the animal starts to put up its two permanent teeth. <Col N="1521" /> It is only at that stage that it will be seen that a wrong age was given at the outset.</P>
      <P>What the Minister is doing now is that if you add on four, five or six months at that given time it is very hard to identify the age of an animal at suckler stage.  If you are given an additional four months or five, as happened in many breeding societies, you could end up with a bull that was ineligible and not registered up to 15 months.  A wider scope is given and that animal could be in active service long before he would even be deemed at 15 months to be licensed or ineligible.  There is a loophole in that system that would give plenty of producers the option of producing a bull that may not have an authentic age and be registered and will not be identified until he puts his two permanent teeth up.  That can vary between 13 months to 18 months.  There can be a big variation in that regard.</P>
      <P>I support Senators Hussey, Kiely and Ellis in that regard.  Increasing the limit from nine months to 15 months will give greater latitude to that type of person who will not be giving the exact date of birth either to the breeding society or to the Department of Agriculture inspectors. It is very hard to identify a suck calf. If he is a good one he could give the impression of being six months old.  That is widely known among the farming community. You are giving an additional hidden four months in addition to the 15 months so that you could have a 19 months old calf eligible under this Bill. That is why we would like a reduction in the limit to nine months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  My experience of progressive breeding societies is that they like to have quality standards and I think they should be allowed time to implement these standards. That is based on from 12 months to 15 months.  The Bill provides that a bull over the age of nine months will be illegal under this pedigree not covered by a permit.  The 15 months relates to the type of documentation which will be acceptable as proof of a bull being in the herd book sector.  When a breeding <Col N="1522" /> society are notified of the birth of a bull calf, he should get a certificate acknowledging notification of the birth.  This certificate is evidence of the eligibility for entry into the herd book.  When the animal is approved for entry into the herd book, a certificate of registration will be issued by the society.  If this certificate is not issued by the time the bull reaches 15 months, he becomes illegal.</P>

You do get confirmation that you have notified the society of the birth of the animal.  In due course the inspections are carried out.  Inspections in my own part of Clare during the past week were carried out by an official of the Department of Agriculture on behalf of the breeding societies.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to ask the same questions.  I do not know whether the prescribed fee is a fee for the inspection or whether it is a fee to hold a non-licensed bull.  The Minister in his Second Stage speech conceded that under section 3 he would allow certain people, owners of 20 suckling cow herds or fewer, to hold a non-registered animal provided that it met the standard of quality which was set down by his Department and on the payment of a fee.  He has now said that he would be charging also for the inspection of the animals.  While what the Bill is trying to achieve is important we must also legislate for the people in that smaller section of breeding, particularly in the area of suckling animals, so that pedigree would not be vital for smaller animals, particularly in the west and disadvantaged areas.  What is the total fee involved?  Will there be two separate fees?  I welcome the fact that the Minister is allowing certain people to hold non-registered animals under this section which meets a lot of the objections we had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is geared to accommodate small herd owners and people in the disadvantaged areas who because of the expense involved and the remoteness from pedigree bulls would not be in a position to have the service of those bulls without great expense.  I believe this section will defeat the purpose of the Bill.  It would be far better to subsidise those people in the disadvantaged areas and the small herd owners who cannot afford the service of pedigree bulls.  I do not know what the subsidy <Col N="1527" /> would cost but it would be better to provide it for the overall good of our national herd so that we can have a good, solid foundation of stock.  The west supplies a very large percentage of the store trade to the rest of the country.  It is from those areas that the store cattle will be coming. They will be sold to the people in the midlands for fattening.  It would be better to subsidise those people and make sure that they have the service of a pedigree bull, as herd owners in the rest of the country have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I submit it is important that there is a fee but it is also important that the fee should be reasonable so that it would not make the matter prohibitive for many small-holders. I urge the Minister in finalising the fee level not to work it out totally on the basis of the cost of inspection, because the cost of inspection could be significant, particularly in remote country areas.  I anticipate that the inspection fee will be a flat rate across the board, whether the bull is being inspected in Kildare, Sneem, or wherever.  I urge the Minister that the fee should be of a reasonable, modest nature and perhaps not on a level to take full account of all the costs involved in the inspection process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The fee was discussed at length in the Dáil.  Initially, I thought it would be as high as £50 but I am informed by my Department that where we can &mdash; and that would be in most areas &mdash; make arrangements covering all the sanitary problems the bulls could be brought to certain marts and we could probably do <Col N="1528" /> it for much less.  I could envisage a fee of £25 being charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Diseases of Animals Act those animals cannot be brought to marts unless they have been tested under the TB and brucellosis regulations, in view of the fact that they are intended for breeding.  Therefore, we are talking in terms of imposing on the farmer another £20-odd to have the test carried out.  So we are still charging him £50.  If we are going to have inspections they should be carried out on the farms rather than indirectly imposing a £50 charge. Not alone that, but we are also taking up the farmer's time in taking them to an inspection centre.  As suggested by other Senators and myself, would it not be much better if we deleted section 3 entirely from the Bill and replaced it by a section which would make available a small subsidy to farmers to purchase a pedigree bull?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the Senator on this because if we discourage people from applying for permits by making the price prohibitive then we will not get the number of people required to make the scheme effective. As Senator Hussey said, it would be better to subsidise the pedigree bull in these areas rather than make this provision prohibitive.  If we have this type of levy plus the cost of testing and bringing them to a centre, we will encourage the use of non-pedigree bulls.  I do not like to call them scrub bulls, but that will be the position and we will encourage that type of thing if we have this permanent prohibitive provision involving registration and an exorbitant fee.  We will harrass the farmer to get his bull registered and he will then use the other bull because it will be much easier for him.  I would go along with Senator Hussey in having a subsidy for a full pedigree bull and there are plenty of pedigree bulls available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go down <Col N="1529" /> that road at all; I think it would be inoperable. Suddenly everyone would be looking for a subsidised bull and in the interests of everybody it would not be possible to have subsidisation of pure bred bulls.  If we did, there would be no point in having the scheme at all because we could tell everybody their bulls would be subsidised.  Otherwise we would have a two-tier system of bull licensing.</P>
      <P>Senator Ellis is correct in saying that you cannot move animals, particularly animals for breeding, without complying with the tuberculosis and brucellosis regulations.  Farmers in this category, and there will not be many of them in this category, should be offered the option of bringing bulls to a centre provided they comply with the regulations, or the bulls could be inspected on the farm &mdash; which is the proper place to have the inspection &mdash; for a prescribed fee.  The fee should not be too high; it should not be a disincentive for people to properly register their bulls.  The fee of £25 or £30 as stated by the Minister sounds reasonable.  If that is compared with the price of a bull it is still cheap and will probably meet the requirements of the breeder, especially in small herds of 20 cows or under.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not go along with Senator Ferris in suggesting that if you give subsidies more than those entitled to them would be getting the subsidies.  The same thing could apply to the licensing of these non-pedigree bulls.  You might have more bulls being licensed than the 20 acre owners' bulls, more such bulls than is desirable for the improvement of the livestock trade.  How will the Department decide on people with under 20 cows?  Are they to go on the statistics they have in the TB offices or what? There can be a danger here.  More people than is intended could be licensing bulls at a fee which definitely would not be in the interests of producing better livestock when we should be giving a subsidy to enable them to buy pedigree bulls which would definitely be going in the right direction in improving our livestock. <Col N="1530" /> Also, if there is licensing, will the inspectors come from the Department or will they be temporary inspectors such as we had before, farmers who are familiar with cattle, conformation and so on?  Whilst I am not completely against the Department to ensure that proper bulls will be used the inspections should be carried out by inspectors who would be familiar with the breeding of cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to reaffirm what was stated by a few other Senators and as I said myself a few moments ago, that if the fee is of a reasonable level on the lines the Minister has indicated and the inspections are carried out on the farms involved, this should prove satisfactory. Basically, my concern in this was and is that there should be no question of having to recoup the actual costs of inspection because, if we were to go into that area, we would be talking on a different line.  Any subsidy would totally and utterly confuse this sort of situation. The level of cost the Minister has mentioned, coupled with the fact that the animal can be inspected on the farmer's premises, would meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Senator's information we are talking about exempted areas only, not about abuses right across the board.  Nearly all of our bulls are registered pedigree bulls, only in the areas outlined here, and as the Minister said on the islands off the coast. That is the type of area we are talking about.  We are totally against non-pedigree animals.  We must do something about making it attractive to farmers to get the bull that is going to be inspected by the Department.  This is all we are looking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>When I made the suggestion I stated quite categorically that it would be confined to the disadvantaged areas and we have already established that in order to register this bull and to get the permit for this bull in the disadvantaged areas it is going to cost something in the region of £50 anyway, between inspection fees and if he has <Col N="1531" /> to be tested under the bovine TB and brucellosis schemes as well.  You are already saddled with a fee of £50 and I think if the Minister were prepared to give a further £50 as a subsidy &mdash; make it a £100 subsidy on each bull in those areas &mdash; it would not cost a lot of money and it would be better for the overall good of the national herd, which is our main aim under this Bill.  As I said previously, the bulk of the store cattle for the rest of the country is coming from that area.  For that reason it is important that they would be treated in the same way as the rest of the country; that they would have the service of the same type of bull as in the rest of the country.  In the long run it would be better if the purchase of the bull in that area were subsidised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my Second Stage speech we are trying to keep the cost of this as low as possible.  I do not want to make it too attractive and that is why I am saying that if somebody decides to have the inspection on the farm then of course you would be talking about £50. But remember that we are talking about the exception not the rule and I hope that it would be a very, very small exception. We are talking about foothills.  The word &ldquo;commonages&rdquo; frightens me because I would hate to delve into what happens in commonages.  The actual fee is not decided and it is not being written into regulations.  My intention is to keep it as low as possible and as I say, the on-farm inspection which was my own idea because, as was rightly pointed out, you have to add your 30 day testing and all this adds up.  On-farm inspection would be £50.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, the cost to the Department in many cases of having those inspections carried out will be at least twice to three times the amount they will receive through the inspection fee. Some of those livestock inspectors will have to travel up to 100 miles from their various offices to carry out the inspection and if you multiply that by two, you see the cost to the Department.  I believe &mdash; and I think that this proves the case for what we were saying earlier &mdash; that it would be much more beneficial to pay farmers in the disadvantaged areas a premium as such for the keeping of a pedigree bull.  There is a very easy way of offsetting this, I believe, for the Department; if they were to pay those farmers the maximum headage on those bulls' as permitted under the EC regulations, they would be making quite a considerable contribution towards it.  It could, in the long term, save the Department money.</P>

      <P>I understood that once he had a permit he could not sell the bull, that he would have to keep the bull for breeding purposes because there is a great danger that if he can sell the bull the bull could end up in farms larger than 20-cow farms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the point I was going to make.  The permit is given to a person initially.  The quality of the animal is taken into account and the type of business that the person is carrying on &mdash; in other words 20-cows or fewer &mdash; will be taken into account in the granting of it.  If the man wants to sell it to somebody else, the purchaser must also qualify under both headings.  The bull will have qualified under the quality condition because the bull has achieved a certain standard of quality, but the person who is buying the bull must also be in the same category of breeder and for the same purpose as the original owner.  Otherwise the whole scheme would be ludicrous.  I <Col N="1534" /> think Senator Kiely has put his finger on it.</P>

      <P>We still see the loophole in the Bill which means that he can move. There is nothing in the Bill which states that he cannot move from farmer A to farmer B if farmer B comes within the category.  This is going to mean that you are going to have a trade developed in non-pedigree bulls which will mean that many farmers, rather than go to buy a pedigree animal, will buy a registered bull, as he will be known after this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily.  I thought I made this quite clear.  Those items and details have not been dealt with.  My view is that if the bull is sold, then the new owner would need to get a permit.  First of all, somebody having that sort of animal will have to be vetted to see whether or not he is in the 20-cow bracket, whether or not he is supplying milk to a creamery.</P>

The Minister is shaking his head as if this will not now be the position.  Can we take it that there will be a maximum length of time between somebody's application to have one registered and the inspection being carried out?</P>

      <P>To see the Munster people rowing in behind each other from both sides of the House indicates that the west is getting the thin end of the wedge here.  I know the Minister does not like commonages but I will cite a commonage where a number of farmers have grazing, which is normal practice in the west.  A farmer applies for a permit and gets it and he lets his bull onto the commonage with his ten or 15 cows.  All the other farmers' cows are on the same commonage. There are no fences.</P>

In the event of this legislation not coming &mdash; I do not think it will come now &mdash; if a number of cows from another herd are served with that permitted bull and the farmer presents them for a headage inspection the following year, is that farmer eligible for headage in this case? There are loopholes by the dozen in that commonage.  The west is full of commonages, as the Minister is aware.  Commonages are grazed over all the summer period.  Whatever may be said about the eradication of TB and brucellosis, this is the position in the west.  Is the farmer who has his cows served by this permitted bull, who is a neighbour of the farmer on the commonage, eligible for a headage grant under the headage scheme?</P>

      <P>In section 3 (3) the Minister has power at any time to revoke or suspend a permit.  If somebody is abusing the permit there is nothing to stop the Minister from revoking it.  You cannot legislate for every situation.  If you did it would be highly dangerous in this area.</P>
      <P>I cannot let this opportunity pass without expressing my amazement at the grazing of commonages in the west.  I am deeply perturbed by this as a member of the Animal Health Council.  I will have to bring this matter to the attention of the council.  There is no way that millions of pounds can be poured into a disease eradication programme if the owners of animals are still grazing them on commonages. This is ludicrous.  I hope what the Senator has said is not true.  If it is true, the Senator has an obligation to advise the Department where it is happening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to what Senator Ferris has said, it is important that he should see the form produced for cattle headage annually in the disadvantaged <Col N="1537" /> areas which states that commonage is included in the amount of land which a farmer can use to make up the necessary acreage to be paid as grants.  It has always been the tradition.  We, as legislators, cannot deprive those farmers of the rights which they have had over the years without compensating them.  It has not been brought to the notice of the Minister or his Department at any stage that an outbreak of TB was caused by the use of commonage.  It is caused by people who do not obey the regulations.  It is very unwise of Senator Ferris to express his concern about what has been the practice down the years and will continue to be the practice.</P>
      <P>The Minister is leaving the gate wide open in section 3 for the abuse of the permit system.  Could he tell the House now what means he intends to use to close the loophole which exists, which means that the animal can be reinspected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply to what Senator Ferris said about being alarmed.  I am a member of the Animal Health Council also.  The lowest incidence of TB and brucellosis is in County Mayo where commonages exist.  For the Senator's information, an animal is not supposed to be tested for TB inside 45 days.  This has been the cardinal rule and it has been handed down through the years.  It is a 30-day test but you cannot test a TB animal inside 45 days.  I should like to inform the Minister and Senator Ferris that the Department of Agriculture have tested in much less than 20 days in County Mayo.  That is news for the Minister.  The incidence of TB and brucellosis in the commonages is the lowest. There is no need for the Senator to be alarmed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Ellis, I regret the option is there.  I came up with a sensible solution.  My first reaction would be that castration of the animal would solve that one.  I do not think we should be facilitating that type of programme.  If it would make it more <Col N="1538" /> difficult it would suit me.  That would be in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is facilitating the very poor people whom he does not want to facilitate.  With regard to the application for registration, will there be any court of appeal for those who are rejected as there was under the old bull licensing scheme?  The Minister does not specify in this Bill that there will be no court of appeal for any bull which may be rejected by an inspector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has possibly answered my question when he says that the farmer is open to appeal to the Minister within 14 days.  If he is to appeal to the Minister will the Minister be the arbitrator or will a senior official of his Department be the arbitrator?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>That proves my point.  In this case there will be a court of appeal made up of senior inspectors which will mean that our famous bull will get a further lease of active duty while this appeal is in progress.  This means that the regulation as proposed will be unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Much as it would give the bull a lot of pleasure in that moonlight period, section 3 says you can only have a bull for that purpose if the Minister so <Col N="1539" /> wishes to give you a permit.  There is no question of giving you a permit and looking at the situation afterwards to see whether the bull comes up to certain standards. The Senator is reading a lot of problems into the section.  This is an important section for small breeders.  I am not sure if there are 100 of them in the country.</P>
      <P>We are making an impossible task out of it with the number of people who are likely to qualify in 20-cow herds or fewer who are suckling and not sending milk to the creamery.  If the Minister has any statistics about the number of people involved in this we should like to have them.  The number of representations made to all of us from Sneem and disadvantaged areas indicates that in those areas it is an important section to have in the Bill.  Now that we have agreed to have it included and as workable as possible we hope it will not be abused.  If they start abusing this category they are only codding themselves because they are leaving themselves open to prosecution, or going against the spirit of the Bill which tried to include a section that would facilitate small breeders in an area which could not afford a pure-bred animal and for which a pure-bred animal was unnecessary for the breeding of beef.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister earlier was it proposed to have the animals, which have been inspected and passed, tattood with some type of ear tattoo.  I do not think the Minister replied.  The number of farmers who would qualify under the regulation as amended of under 20 cows with an average herd size of 5.6 would be in the thousands rather than in the hundreds as suggested by Senator Ferris.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>There has to be some sort of indelible mark placed on those animals because the same one could appear at 50 different places.  There is no way you can control it unless there is some sort of indelible mark, let it be by means of a tattoo or otherwise.  Using ear tags makes a laugh of it.  We all know that the percentage of animals which lose ear tags is very high due to the type of tag being used, the tamper-proof tag.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it is a major problem. If the Minister is not prepared to do as was previously done under the 1925 Act, where those which passed had a shamrock tattood on their ear and those which failed had a larger R implanted on their ear, we are doing a disservice to the Department officials who will carry out the inspection because the animal which they inspect may not be the animal which is released with the livestock concerned. There is nothing to stop a farmer saying that the animal, as passed by the inspector, is this animal which has lost its tag and he may replace it with anything.  We must close this loophole if we are to go anywhere as far as the regulation is concerned. The only way of closing it is by means of the tattoo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it from the Minister that he will use the tattooing system rather than the freeze-branding system?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think section 4 states anything about a veterinary surgeon being brought to examine the animal. The reason I state that is that you could take a prosecution against a farmer and take him into court and the farmer might take in his veterinary surgeon who might possibly have dealt with the animal one day prior to the inspector having arrived, and take the inspector for a walk, to put it mildly.  If there is to be any query with regard to whether the animal has been castrated it is necessary that the inspector carrying out the inspection of those animals should be accompanied by a veterinary surgeon.</P>

If the farmer denies that he has an animal that fits this description and that he has not a permit &mdash; of course the Department will know if he <Col N="1544" /> has a permit &mdash; the Minister has confirmed that the inspector has the power to actually send for a veterinary officer of the Department.  It would be an obligation on the person having charge of the animal to make the animal available if there was any doubt in the inspector's mind.  No inspector will turn up at the farm of a person the Department know has an animal which is included in his herd test and they will know if the farmer has an exemption certificate for the animal.  It is only in the event of information being received by the Department to the contrary, that this section will come into play.  It is a most reasonable section.  Somebody has the right to walk in and ask if the farmer has a permit, the same as somebody can arrive and ask if you have a television licence.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Ferris that anybody can come in and ask.  We talked earlier about what Senator O'Toole mentioned about commonage. Who will then be responsible for the rounding up of the animal?  The farmer can make the animal available to the Department's inspector anywhere on his land.  It does not specify that the farmer must round up the animal.  In many cases these animals could be very dangerous.</P>

It is also an EC requirement as I understand it.  I was even dubious about its operability but the fact is that there is legislation there already which allows a member of the Garda Síochána or, indeed, a Department inspector to enter onto land or houses used for livestock at any time, that is, the Protection of Animals Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason I asked the question, I knew it was seven days when I was asking the question.  But 28 days seems an unusually long time to allow an unauthorised bull to roam the country.  I felt that the period of seven days as specified in the 1925 Act was much more reasonable than what is being proposed here.  While some people may say that seven days is a bit harsh, an acceptable length of time might be 14 days.  This section allows the farmer 28 days before he takes any action.  He gets away under this section because he has 28 days to deal with this problem without being penalised.  That is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Hussey does not mind if I make another comment, on legislation you try to make a comment to the best of your ability and from your knowledge of what has happened.  If the Senator has forgotten the Act that is all right, but I remembered that it was there <Col N="1548" /> and allowed people to enter onto premises.</P>
      <P>I do not know if my colleagues on the other side of the House have come to grips with the new scheme for arranging testing on animals.  It is fairly complicated and was a subject of controversy for some time between the Department and the veterinary profession.  There is no problem if somebody decides to castrate the animal but he may decide to have the animal slaughtered.  He may arrange to send the animal to a factory &mdash; unless he wants to send it in on permit &mdash; and perhaps he would get a better market for it if it was TB tested.  You must give at least two weeks' notice to a veterinary surgeon before you can arrange testing, so you would need almost three weeks notice before you could arrange a test and have the results of the test read, and then some number of days to get the animal to the factory of your choice. Make it a very short period and you will make it a penal situation.</P>
      <P>If somebody has an unregistered bull on his property he either agrees to castrate it or slaughter it, or he is liable to be fined.  You can legislate in as penal a way as you like in this area but taking into account the trading situation now with animals going to a factory some reasonable period should be allowed to comply with the new regulations.  When the 1925 Act was in force there was no tuberculosis eradication scheme.  There was no requirement.  You could just decide to move your animal to any factory you liked or sell it, castrated or otherwise, to your neighbour down the road.  In this situation, it is entirely different. If we are to give the owner of the animal the opportunity to get it to the best place possible and to get the greatest amount of money for it, we cannot be unreasonable.  I know the Senator's concern and I share it.  The Minister does not want this unregistered animal to be available for all sorts of pleasurable activities in the meantime.  I presume by the time we detected it, it had done a certain amount of damage anyway and one more cow was in calf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with 28 days. We cannot be too harsh on this one because, for the reasons given, you have to have the detection date.  The animal can be castrated any day after that detection date when he gets noticed.  Then it is up to the farmer to use the 28 days.  A veterinary surgeon will be available for castration and on to the factory.  That is all right, but where an animal has to be castrated and then offered for sale it is different.  It is not necessary to offer it for sale even though you do castrate it. It is not eligible and will not be penalised. I spoke about commonages.  It takes a number of days to get animals back to the place where you can deal with them. By the time the farmer gets a veterinary surgeon, that will require 28 days.  It will also give the Department official time for an inspection.  Possibly the bull will be castrated in seven days in most cases but 28 days are necessary.  What is in the Bill is reasonable.</P>

You can take an animal <Col N="1550" /> direct from a farm to a factory for immediate slaughter provided you have a card for him and that the animal's tag is correct. You do not need to have it tested before you take it.  I am surprised that somebody who is a member of the Animal Health Council is not aware of that.  Getting away from that, I am inclined to agree with Senator Kiely on 28 days as the number of days suggested. How many days after the 28 days will it be before the inspector will call again to the farm to see if the animal has been dealt with?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">

      <P>For the edification of Senator Kiely and Senator Ellis, I wanted to ensure that the number of days was correct and would allow a person to have the animal castrated and sold if necessary in a mart under a test.  There is nothing wrong with that.  I am sorry Senator Kiely misrepresented what I was saying, but he <Col N="1551" /> said I was talking about selling bulls in the mart.  He said I was now suggesting that.  I want a farmer to have the constitutional right to sell his animal if it passes a test in a mart or is castrated.  This allows him to have him castrated and/or slaughtered. The other question of sending an animal direct to the factory is a well-known requirement in the scheme anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point that has been overlooked as regards to the 28 days.  It is aligned to what has been said here.  The question that has been asked by our colleagues across the House is, &ldquo;Why should a person want to kill an animal within 28 days or sell it at a livestock mart?&rdquo;  The answer is very clear. First, the animal may not be fit for selling to a factory.  Secondly, he has to go through the testing process etc., to get to a sale situation in a livestock market.  One may say that once the animal has been castrated why does he want to sell him? Ordinary husbandry would dictate that a man who has suckler cows and other female animals does not want this sort of one-time bull floating around.  Those persons across the House that understand livestock quite well would understand that clearly also.  Quite frankly, I believe that this 28 days coupled with what has been discussed now, are very closely aligned. They work not to an unduly favourable degree in favour of the client but are equitably and fairly designed to give every opportunity to the person to dispose of his animal, with options available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is right at all.  The time is for castrating or slaughtering an animal.  Who wants an animal that is castrated?  They have all the time in the world to get him tested.  I think that an animal should be castrated or slaughtered straightaway, and 28 days is too long to get a farmer to do that.  It gives him liberty to use the bull.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why Senator <Col N="1554" /> Kiely adopts that attitude in this case because, as Senator Hourigan has said, normal management of the herd would indicate that even if you had the animal castrated it might be in the herd owner's interest to sell him.  It is not the kind of animal that he would like to have around the place, especially if he was a recently castrated animal.  The important thing also is that this is an option in the section. The person can, in fact, apply if he is detected as having a non-registered or a non-permitted animal.  The Senator should read the section so that he will know what he is talking about.  To have him registered is one of the options.  The other options are to castrate him, sell him or slaughter him.  The Minister has the power to do either if the farmer is not cooperative. I think this is a reasonable section.</P>

      <P>We know the 28 days are there.  It is clear from the Minister that they are going to be there.  But suppose on the 28th day the farmer concerned makes an application to the Department for a permit for this animal, how long more &mdash; and I raised this earlier &mdash; will it be until the inspection is carried out on that animal by a Department official? Are we going to see a case of where, like the adjournment of the court which is often used as the method of preventing the evil day in certain cases, the farmer here can have a number of adjournments by means of using the Bill as it stands?</P>

      <P>You have the 28 day incubation period before the Department would go to seek to see whether or not the animal has been dealt with.  Allowing for the normal course of events, it could take anything from seven to 14 days for the Department inspector to call allowing a situation where this animal has been allowed to roam in excess of 40 odd days.  In the most extraordinary situation that has been envisaged you will have a problem of a delay but, thanks be to goodness, you will not have that many people in jail, I hope, nor will you have that many people with their houses unattended.

      <P>Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935 (Part II) (No. 11) Regulations, 1985, and</P>
      <P>Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930 (Exporters Licences) (Fees) Regulations, 1985,</P>
      <P>copies of which were laid in draft before the Seanad on the 26th day of June, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>These regulations would reduce from £1.10 to 75p fees payable in respect of pigs presented for veterinary inspection under the Fresh Meat Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts. With the approval of this House it is intended to have the remission of these fees made effective from 1 April 1985. The regulations were approved in draft form by Dáil Éireann on 2 July 1985.</P>
      <P>On 1 January 1984 the existing veterinary inspection fee of £1.10 per pig was introduced.  Since May 1982, however, the bacon curers have been refusing to pay veterinary inspection fees on pigs. Their refusal to pay was largely on the grounds that they held there was an anomaly between themselves and local pork slaughterers who did not have to observe the same hygiene standards and costs in relation to their premises and products.</P>
      <P>The Government, therefore, authorised, in December last, the drafting of a Bill which would provide for standards of veterinary control and hygiene at slaughtering premises catering solely for the home market to be brought into line with those applying at export premises, and for veterinary inspection fees to be correspondingly brought into line.  This legislation is now well advanced and I hope it will be brought before the Dáil as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as complaining of the anomaly <i>vis-a-vis</i> local pork slaughterers, the bacon curers also claimed that the level <Col N="1561" /> of veterinary inspection fee being charged was too high, particularly when compared with the fees which our main competitors on export markets were charging.  There was, therefore, a case for the level of the fee to be reduced in order to improve the industry's competitiveness on export markets, especially in the light of the difficulties the industry has experienced in recent times.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, decided, for all of these reasons, to reduce the current level of inspection fees and to make an arrangement in respect of the arrears of fees due.</P>
    <P>Following lengthy negotiations, an agreement was reached recently with the industry whereby, effective from 1 April 1985 payment of veterinary inspection fees for pigs would be resumed at the reduced rate of 75p.  Furthermore, a sum of 15p per pig will be payable towards arrears when the legislation harmonising inspection standards and costs between bacon curers and local pork slaughterers is enacted and implemented.  These financial arrangements will, of course, be subject to review on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the revenue from these arrangements will fall short of what was estimated would have been received had current fees been paid.  I am also aware, however, that if we had to go along the road of full recovery of fees this could result in serious difficulties in the industry.  Many factories could have been faced with intolerable bills, which in addition to the other problems now being faced by the industry, may have proved much too high and might have resulted in closures.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the industry should now organise itself to meet the challenges that lie ahead on both the export and home markets.  If we are to continue to have an export industry it is essential that we have improved efficiency in both marketing and processing.  On the home market we are soon to be faced with the challenge presented by the removal under EC law of our import derogations.  It is vital that the industry can compete with possible imports.  A much greater emphasis will <Col N="1562" /> have to be placed on product quality and product diversification.  Plant modernisation is an integral part of this.  Significant amounts of both national and EC aid have been made available for this purpose and are available to suitable applicants.</P>
    <P>I trust that all sides of the House will give support to the proposed regulations now before it in draft form and that Senators will join me in urging the pigmeat industry to begin the job of overcoming the challenges it now faces.  A readiness has been shown by us to assist the industry in overcoming its difficulties and we will, of course, continue to help whenever possible.</P>

Anything that we can do at this time of serious competitiveness in any of our industries, be it agricultural or otherwise, has to be welcomed.  The Minister and his Department are to be complimented for bringing in this regulation which will streamline and improve the whole area of hygiene, marketing and processing.  Above all, it will bring an element of greater harmony and greater efficiency consequently into the whole area of pig production, processing and marketing in the industry.

      <P>I welcome the reduction in fees from £1.10 to 75p.  I do not think that this legislation is all that fair because about one-third of pigs being slaughtered at present are being slaughtered in unlicensed premises.  We were promised legislation for the last 12 months in respect of pork butchers' premises.  I would like the Minister to have this speeded up. It will be the pig producers who have to pay this in the final analysis.  If the producers of one-third of the pigs being killed are not paying the levy of 75p, it is very unfair to the producers.  Pig producers are at an unfair advantage in this <Col N="1563" /> country.  The levy inspection fee in Northern Ireland is only about 2p or 4p per pig.  As pig processors and exporters, we cannot be competitive if we are paying more than our competitors in the North of Ireland.  The only point I would like to make is to have the Minister speed up this legislation as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming here this evening and I am sorry that I had to disturb him to bring such a matter as this, which is quite unusual, before the Seanad.  This matter has caused great concern and great complications to the community involved with this group water scheme, the Anbally group water scheme in Cummer, County Galway.  It is as simple as that and as straight as that.  They made an application some time ago to form a group water scheme and they went through the necessary formalities in the normal way to do it and, after the first judgment on the scheme, it was suggested to them that their costs were so high that there should be a review and a reappraisal of the full scheme, which they did.  They had quite a substantial saving.  They did that by way of taking the source of supply, the distribution portion of the supply of <Col N="1564" /> the scheme, by way of waylays across people's land and they saved the State and themselves an enormous amount of money in so doing.  At the same time, they also saved the Galway County Council quite an abnormal amount of money in regard to the restoration of roads etc.  The scheme progressed and was completed last April.  The new appraisal was submitted to Galway County Council and to the Department. Everything seemed to be absolutely perfect. The headworks cost of the scheme at that time was, and still is, £16,000.</P>
      <P>That is more or less a general synopsis of the history of the scheme.  Recently they received a letter from the Department telling them that the Department now refused to sanction the headworks grant of £16,000, the reason being that it would be far better for them to wait for the source, known as the mid-Galway regional group water supply scheme, to come on tap.  That is three years away but, that apart, when one examines the cost of the headworks, £16,000, which is the grant-in-aid by the Department of the Environment to the scheme and when one values the cost of the connection of the Anbally group water scheme to the nearest point of the proposed mid-Galway regional scheme, the minimum mileage on that would be approximately five miles.  A four-inch pipe or a three-inch pipe at the minimum would have to be taken from the Ballinacregg distribution source, which is an adjoining group water scheme, or it would have to be taken from the Bullaun group source which is the next adjoining point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand, and neither can the people of the Anbally scheme or, indeed, the people in Galway understand how the Department could estimate that there would be a saving &mdash; that is the phrase used &mdash; in waiting for the mid-Galway scheme when they would have to take their main supply five miles along a main arterial road, in one instance, and along a very busy county road on the other hand.  The cost of taking that source from Ballinacregg or from Bullaun would, in my opinion, cost five times <Col N="1565" /> more than the £16,000 for an adequate supply which they already had.</P>
    <P>I have contacted the engineering staff who deal with group water schemes in Galway and they said that there is no logic to it.  I made several efforts to contact the local inspector from the Department to see if he could produce some logic to this decision.  I could not locate him &mdash; I do not know for what reason.  He may have been out.  When he telephoned me back on one occasion, I was not at home but in any event I did hear rumours that he could not understand the logic of this either.  The group scheme had been informed by some hierarchy in the Department in Dublin that this was the thesis by which they proposed to do the examination of the scheme.</P>
    <P>There is no logic to it.  There is no mathematical logic to it and I bring the matter up here this evening because I feel that the Minister will be kind enough in his examination of the report on this scheme to see that a reasonable solution is brought to it.  The only reasonable solution is the original one, the £16,000 headworks grant-in-aid, be sanctioned so that we can start immediately on this scheme.  If the Minister does that, I think he will eliminate the belief that there is either a shortage of cash in the Department to pay for the scheme, which seems to be the rumour most rife in the district, or that there has been a new policy &mdash; this is beginning to creep in around County Galway &mdash; of a &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; policy in the Department concerning group water schemes.</P>
    <P>I must say that in all honesty I have not seen either, but the decision to stop the headworks grant-in-aid of £16,000 to let this scheme get into operation raises a certain doubt in my mind.  I was a bit shocked.  The people have suffered a lot over the years in being in a part of the county which geographically is very dry. They have this horrendous situation of cannisters of all types and descriptions shooting up and down the main arterial road going into Galway.  Those people are left in a terrible position for water.  It is imperative that sanction for the original headworks is granted by the Minister <Col N="1566" /> because the people will be unable to continue the business in which they are involved, especially farming.  There are farmers with large herds of cows awaiting the sanction of this scheme.  There are businesses, bed and breakfast and different kinds of rural business in dire need and dire straits awaiting sanction for the scheme.  As I said, there is no logic to not sanctioning it.  I am raising the matter this evening because I want the Minister's comment on it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the mid-Galway Group Water Scheme.  The sanction for that regional scheme was welcomed by Galway County Council and, indeed, by the community who were dependent on it but it was a bit horrifying that a Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture who represents another part of the constituency of Galway saw fit to have letters sent three and four at a time from the staff of the Department of Agriculture notifying people that he had been responsible for the sanction of the mid-Galway Group Water Scheme.  I do not know whether he was or was not, but it was absolutely unnecessary for him to circulate letters in areas he did not know.  In fact, they were posted to houses which are not and never have been and never will be dependent on the mid-Galway Regional Group Water Scheme.  It is a sad reflection these days on politics if people try to reach out at times to the public through these devious means not even knowing the facts as to who is or is not dependent on such matters.  It certainly is not very nice for any Minister of State to do that in such a fashion.  An apology is due by that Minister to the people of the community.  On many occasions he insulted their intelligence.  I say that as an aside.  It is far better for a person making representations on such intricate matters, as I am doing here this evening about a smaller scheme, to speak in public about them.  I believe that writing to the Department nowadays might not be the best thing to do.  Hence the reason why I feel that in such matters where there is political interference of the nature I described it is far better for me to use the public platform of this <Col N="1567" /> House to highlight them for the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Chair found it odd that such an item should be raised on the Adjournment.  That is the reason.  Our representations on such matters, particularly in regard to group water schemes should be made in a public manner like this.  I have used the facilities of this house to do it.  I desire the Minister to ask his Department to sanction the headworks on this scheme for the reasons I have clearly outlined, and which are undeniable. I look forward to the Minister's reply and I hope it will be of a satisfactory nature.</P>

      <P>I listened to Senator Killilea's contribution to this debate with interest and will take his comments into account when deciding on the group's latest proposals.  I would like to assure the House that I am aware of the problems being faced by the householders and the farmers in Anbally arising from the lack of an adequate water supply in the area.  This scheme has been on the stocks for a long time particularly because of the death of a contractor originally selected to supply the scheme.  A determined effort has been made by my Department to help in working out a scheme which will overcome the difficulties inherent in this group's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group's proposals to take a water supply from the existing Corrandulla group water scheme must be viewed in the context of Galway County Council's proposals to provide a water supply throughout the entire mid-Galway region including Anbally from the excellent source at Dereen.  A total of £1½ million has already been spent on bringing this water supply to two reservoirs about five miles from Anbally.  I have recently approved proposals by Galway County Council and the mid-Galway group which will bring the supply within two miles of Anbally over the next couple of years. My Department are currently examining the position with regard to bringing the <Col N="1568" /> mid-Galway supply the remaining distance to Anbally when these mains have been laid.</P>
    <P>The Anbally group have applied for a special contribution to make a scheme based on the supply from Corrandulla viable for group participants.  Essentially this would involve the county council and my Department in paying capital money, towards headworks for this scheme which would be rendered obsolete when the mid-Galway supply becomes available to the group within a few years.  There can be no justification for approving a special contribution in such circumstances.  I had no alternative but to refuse the group's request as was done in May 1985.  In doing so I asked that the possibility should be examined of finding an alternative source which would give the group a water supply acceptable as a temporary measure until the mid-Galway supply becomes available.  I would also be prepared to approved a special contribution towards such a scheme, provided the headworks would in time form an integral part of the mid-Galway supply network.  This possibility is still under examination in my Department and I hope to make a decision on the matter at a very early date.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the group have submitted revised costings for the scheme, based on the laying of mains in the fields instead of along the public road.  This would result in a considerable saving to the group.  These costings are being examined in the Department as a matter of urgency but I can assure the House that I will approve grants for this amended scheme provided it is acceptable to the council and the group can meet the net cost of the work from their own resources including the special contribution to pay for county council requirements.</P>
    <P>There are three points I should like to make about the group's revised proposals. First, they are dependent on the council's agreement to water mains being laid through fields instead of along roads. The council have not agreed to this in the past but if this change in the design makes the scheme financially viable for the group, I am prepared to take the matter up with the council in this case.  The <Col N="1569" /> second point I must emphasise is that the group will now qualify for the increase in the grant maxima recently approved for new schemes.  A group in County Galway can now receive State grants of £1,200 for every farmer in the scheme which takes both domestic and farm supply from the group.  This is £200 more than if the scheme had commenced by the end of last month.</P>
    <P>The final point about the revised proposals relates to the amount of the contribution which the group members are willing to pay to make the scheme a reality.  The group have said that they are not prepared to pay more than £500 per house towards the scheme.  Although the revised costings have not yet been fully examined, it would appear that the group will have to pay more than that if the scheme is to proceed.  While a contribution in excess of £500 may appear high for an individual, it is not, in fact.  Group members in other parts of the country, including some of the poorer agricultural lands, have been prepared to pay contributions as high as £800 in order to obtain a good, piped water supply.  When one considers that the State has also agreed to increase its grant for every farmer in the scheme by £200 it is reasonable to expect that local group members, who are the direct beneficiaries of the scheme, should meet any remaining shortfall in financing the works.</P>
    <P>I must reiterate that I cannot agree to pay capital moneys towards headworks which would become obsolete within a few years.  I will endeavour to finalise quickly the examination of the group's revised costings for a scheme based on the Corrandulla group scheme and the possibility of an alternative supply being utilised by the group until they can obtain a long-term supply from mid-Galway. That is a reasonable and sensible <Col N="1570" /> approach.</P>
    <P>Senator Killilea mentioned that there is talk in Galway that special contributions are not forthcoming.  There is no basis for such talk.  Special contributions amounting to £100,000 were approved for Galway schemes last year.  This represents 8 per cent of the total of special contributions approved for all counties in 1984 and, in the current year, a special contribution of £400,000 has been approved to enable the nearby mid-Galway group scheme to proceed.  This is the largest special contribution ever approved. These new figures illustrate that Galway has, at least, a large share of the total funds available for special contributions and I can assure the House that adequate funds will continue to be made available for capital works with long term benefits for groups in the overall water supply network.</P>
    <P>Our approach is right.  We are looking at new costings and new proposals.  We will get this examination done as quickly as possible.  I understand the problem. Obviously we are anxious to get water supply to people as quickly as possible, but we also have to take the longer term view with the mid-Galway scheme on which the council are committed to spend a lot of money with State aid.  It seems sensible to us that we should proceed along those lines and I think in the long term we will be proved right.  That is not disputing the case that we should try in the short term to do something for the people in this area and we will endeavour to do that as quickly and as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 10 July 1985.</P>
