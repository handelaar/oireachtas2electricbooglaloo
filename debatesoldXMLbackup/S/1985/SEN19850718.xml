      <P>I have notice from Senator John Ellis that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The delay in processing applications by unemployed school leavers for unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Flor O'Mahony of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To seek clarification of the method of funding of the financial deficit of ICI.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Katharine Bulbulia of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The dangers to road users presented by parking of unlit skips.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Michael D. Higgins of the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the concern of parents and the local community, the need to clarify the present position of the necessary repairs and future staffing of Tullykyne school, County Galway.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Patrick Durcan of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health <Col N="1980" /> to direct the Western Health Board to regulate the general medical services card system in a manner which will ensure that applicants for general medical service cards will be made aware of the basis of their assessment to eligibility or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator Ellis, O'Mahony, Bulbulia and Higgins as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I regret that I have to rule that the matter rasied by Senator Durcan is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground of lack of ministerial responsibility.  I have selected Senator Ellis's motion for today's Adjournment and it will be taken at 5 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.  Senators O'Mahony, Bulbulia and Higgins may give notice for another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.  No. 1 is the Nurses Bill and the Minister for Health is anxious that the Second Stage debate on this Bill, which we have had with us for some months, should at least be launched before the recess.  It is proposed that there should be one speech from each side of the House and then the Second Stage debate would be adjourned until September or October.  Also it is proposed to take No. 2, the Combat Poverty Agency Bill on Report, on which there are Ministerial amendments, some of them meeting amendments brought forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the last few months or so, a number of undertakings were given by the Deputy Leader of the House and myself in regard to the discussion of matters before the recess.  These included the report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown, the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill and the question of a fuller debate on developments in the European Communities.  There is some difficulty with all three of these on hand, but it was indicated to me by Senators who had expressed an interest that No. <Col N="1981" /> 5, developments in the European Communities, should be left until the autumn. I think we should discuss the other two matters today.  I put them down in the order in which they have been for some time but I have no strong views about the order in which Nos. 3 and 4 should be debated, and if the House wishes to debate them in the reverse order I have no objection.</P>

      <P>Let me follow on from the Leader of the House and suggest that there is no reasonable logic to suggest that we should deal with legislation as a unit.  Also, since my Homeless Persons Bill has been around for some time and since the debate is coming towards the end of its Second Stage at least, let me request the House that the Order of Business should be 1, 2, 4 and 3, in other words that the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill be taken before we resume the debate on marital breakdown.  I propose that formally as an amendment to the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to accept that amendment, so we will debate Nos. 1 and 2, then take up No. 4 and then, assuming that that debate finishes before 5 p.m., go on to No. 3.  In regard to No. 25, it is not customary in the last sitting days of a term to take Private Members' Business, but I think this motion, since it is a cross-party motion, might well be taken by agreement as the first motion of the new session before we settle down to our rotation system.  Accordingly, I see no reason why it should not be taken when we resume on 25 September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the reason that Senator Brendan Ryan's Homeless Persons Bill has not been taken <Col N="1982" /> and has been shelved for so long is that a Government Homeless Persons Bill is on the way.  Either the Leader or Deputy Leader of the House indicated to us here that it was at the draft stage and would be on the Order Paper inside the next few weeks.  We will have to straighten this out.  It is not fair to Senator Ryan if he is not going to get in with his Bill and we will be having another Homeless Persons Bill in the autumn brought in by the Government.  We want some clarification on whether the Homeless Persons Bill which the Government intend to bring in will be with us in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point of clarification, as I reported to the House, a Bill has been drafted and that Bill is before Government.  I understand that the Government have to give it final consideration before it is published.  I do not think it would be appropriate for this House to adjourn without dealing with this Private Members' Bill that has been on our Order Paper for a considerable time.  If the Second Stage of the Private Members' Bill is completed today, I would be proposing that the Committee Stage be postponed until, say, early November, by which time there is no reason why the Government Bill should not have been published and discussed in the public arena.</P>

    <Title>Nurses Bill, 1984: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Pattison) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Pattison)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>The registration and regulation of nurses in this country <Col N="1983" /> is at present governed by the Nurses Act, 1950, as amended by the Nurses Act, 1961.  An Bord Altranais, as they now exist, were established under the 1950 Act to replace the former General Nursing Council.  The Central Midwives Board established under the Midwives Act, 1944, were also dissolved under the 1950 Act and their functions were taken over by the Midwives Committee established under Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>Thirty-five years on, it is obvious that the present legislation is not sufficiently comprehensive to keep pace with the developments in nursing that began in the sixties and which have been growing constantly ever since.  Nurses have clearly demonstrated over these years that they will not relax and content themselves with routine nursing skills once they have obtained their basic qualifications.  They are, as professionals, eager to improve their knowledge and skills on an on-going basis.  We might expect to find an eagerness among our nurses to keep abreast of developments in their particular areas of practice &mdash; be it in the clinical, teaching or administrative fields.  We do not necessarily expect to find that eagerness channelled into, for example, a desire for further education at university level.  Yet, increasingly, Irish nurses are taking time away from the practice of their profession to pursue third level degree courses &mdash; many of them at their own expense.  The most popular areas of study are education, sociology and psychology.  These highly-motivated nurses, together with their colleagues among the leaders of the profession, are aiming to prepare nurses for the challenges that face them in this modern age of high-powered medical and technological science.  They will not be hidebound by outmoded concepts about education, training and practice limitations deemed appropriate in the past for nurses.  They see that nurses need a broader approach to nursing and a deeper appreciation of the contribution potential of their profession in contemporary society.  There is a new era for nursing opening up and today's nurses want to ensure that their profession is ready to play a full part in its shaping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1984" /> We can support these laudable ideals by creating the framework most conducive to the future development of nursing, both as a profession and as an essential component of an efficient health service.  I believe that the enactment of this Bill will be the greatest service we, as legislators, can give to Irish nurses. Through enactment of the Bill, we will pave the way for the establishment of a nursing board with the composition, the powers and the authority they will need to give effective leadership to the profession.</P>
    <P>It is impossible, of course, to foresee every eventuality; every new development; every ideological or practical change that may come about.  But it is possible to plan for change and I am satisfied that this Bill has sufficient provision for flexibility built into it to allow for adjustment to suit changing needs and circumstances in nursing as they may develop.  To give one example of flexibility, I have provided in section 9 (3) for the power to vary by regulations the composition of the membership of Bord Altranais.  Senators will appreciate that this is not a power that would be used lightly or frequently but it is, I believe, an essential power to have in view of the rapid rate of development we may expect to see in nursing as we come in sight of the twenty-first century.  This board must be in a position to lead, to guide and to respond, as appropriate and as the profession requires.  This provision, then, will help to ensure that the board will always be composed of members whose particular skills and expertise will be in keeping with the needs of the day.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is essentially the same Bill that came before the Dáil in June 1984.  The Bill generated great interest and was the subject of lengthy debate in that House.  There were quite a few amendments made to it on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil.  In making my own amendments to the Bill, I was guided by those which were made to the Dentists Bill on its passage through Seanad Éireann.  The constructive and lively debate which the Dentists Bill engendered in this House was most helpful <Col N="1985" /> to me on this Bill which resembles the Dentists Bill very closely.  The outcome, therefore, of a thorough debate, and the inclusion of a number of constructive amendments in the Dáil, is a Bill which, I believe, is much stronger and better than the original and is, indeed, a very solid piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I will now give the House a brief outline of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I contains the normal preliminary and general provisions.</P>
    <P>Part II provides for the dissolution of the present Bord Altranais and its replacement by the new board.  The new board in numbers and composition will differ greatly from the present board. Section 9 provides for a membership of 17 elected nurses representing the areas of nurse teaching, nursing administration and clinical practice.  There will also be at least one nurse and, conceivably, three among the appointed members.  This means that of the total membership of 29, up to 20 (and at least 18) members will be nurses.  I might add that in deference to the wishes of many nurses I am currently considering the possibility of providing in the regulations, which I must make for the election of members of the first board, that the election will be conducted on a system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with registration &mdash; the primary function of the board.  Section 30 is an enabling provision for the registration of persons in a profession or calling ancillary to nursing.  There was a similar provision in the 1950 Act but the section in its present form is much improved on the original in that it makes it absolutely clear that a register entirely separate to the register of nurses is to be established if this power is invoked.</P>
    <P>Part IV sets out the functions of the board in relation to the education and training of nurses.  The functions are for the most part similar to those that apply at present under the 1950 Act.  There are, however, some noteworthy additions that I would like to comment on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1986" /> Section 35 is completely new and contains two important provisions.  The first is the power given to the board to determine minimum educational requirements for entry to nurse training.  I would expect that in exercising this function, the board would be guided by the recommendations of the Working Party on General Nursing. The working party recommended a standard of pass level leaving certificate with honours in two subjects as a basic educational requirement.  Traditionally, a pass leaving certificate is required but subjects and grades vary from one nurse training school to another, making for considerable lack of uniformity in selection procedures.  The board will have the task of structuring entry levels and procedures so as to achieve the right balance between the educational and vocational requirements necessary for caring, effective nurses.</P>
    <P>The remainder of section 35 is concerned with giving the power to Bord Altranais to establish, if they so decide, a central applications system to process applications from people who wish to undertake nurse training.  This is another provision in the Bill that stems directly from a recommendation made by the working party on general nursing.  Senators will be aware that this is one of the two areas in the Bill which has given rise to concern and some opposition.</P>
    <P>The other area concerns function of the board in relation to matters of ethical conduct and behaviour and I will come to that later.</P>
    <P>In relation to the central applications bureau, I have found total commitment to and acceptance of the concept of a central depot for the receipt of applications from candidates.  This is as might be expected.  There could be no opposition to a system which would relieve young people of the tedium and expense of making numerous applications to the different training schools.  However, the system envisaged by the working party and clearly spelled out in their report is more than a simple sorting office procedure.  It is a comprehensive selection process in which the <Col N="1987" /> training schools would be heavily involved. The factor that gives rise to concern is that, at the end of the day, the individual training schools would no longer personally select their own candidates for nurse training.  I can understand that any progressive step, in whatever field, is always accompanied by some misgivings about the effect of change.  However, I cannot accept, in this instance, that those misgivings should lead to unwillingness even to consider change.  To include this provision in the Bill is to give the board the opportunity and the authority they need to pursue the feasibility of establishing a central applications bureau.  It leaves the way open for the training schools to give their views on the operation of such a bureau.  To exclude this provision from the Bill, or to limit it in any way, would be to close the door firmly on any possibility of change in selection procedures for the foreseeable future. That, I submit, would be an unfortunate and retrograde step.  I must stress that the working party in recommending the introduction of a central applications bureau considered the following stipulations &ldquo;most important&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>that training schools should be involved in a meaningful way in the selection of students through the CAB which would act as an agency on behalf of all participating schools; that the CAB should be as representative as possible of all nurse training schools and of other bodies interested in recruitment and training of nurses.  The committee of the CAB should have approximately twenty members appointed by An Bord Altranais, fifteen of whom should be appointed by the Board on the nomination of the Schools.</P>
    <P>The working party also envisaged a specific role for hospital authorities to pursue the question of character and health references and to conduct their own assessments/interviews with a view to determining suitability for employment.</P>
    <P>It would indeed be a pity if this dynamic <Col N="1988" /> concept were to fail because of any reluctance on the part of the training schools to modify the selection process.  It would be an even greater pity if the opportunity to test the system were to be denied by the exclusion or dilution of this provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill is concerned with fitness to practise.  I am providing in this part for considerable improvements on the existing, inadequate controls.  The present board are empowered only to remove a nurse's name from the register as a disciplinary measure.  The grounds for removal are prescribed by the board under their rules.  They are: infamous or professional misconduct; conviction of treason, felony or misdemeanour; or, conviction of an offence under the 1950 Act.</P>
    <P>In my view, neither these grounds for sanction nor the sanction itself &mdash; removal from the register &mdash; are appropriate for every case of unfitness to practise. I decided, accordingly, to provide comprehensive statutory controls in the areas of discipline and fitness to practise. The board will be obliged under section 13 (2) to establish a fitness to practise committee.  The committee will have functions of investigation and of recommending sanctions similar to those that already obtain for the medical and dental professions.</P>
    <P>An important feature, in the interests both of public safety and professional integrity, is the inclusion of a provision for erasure or suspension from the register for unfitness to practise due to physical or mental disability as well as for professional misconduct.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions which, albeit important in themselves, would not be expected to engender much comment. However, section 51 (2) has proved to be one of the most contentious provisions in the Bill.  The subsection provides that:</P>
    <P>it shall be a function of the Board to give guidance to the nursing profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour.</P>
    <P>The provision is exactly the same as that <Col N="1989" /> contained in the legislation governing the medical and dental professions.  I was genuinely surprised to find that there could be any objection to the proposal that the board should be empowered to give guidance to nurses on matters of ethical conduct and behaviour.  If the board can penalise nurses for professional misconduct, they must also have the power to set guidelines generally for the practice of nursing.  The main cause of concern expressed in relation to this provision is that it would interfere with the rights of hospitals to establish and enforce their own ethical codes for their employees.  I gave assurances to the Members of the Dáil and to the nurse representatives who approached me on this issue that there is no reason to fear on that account.  A precedent already established in relation to the common contract for medical consultants provides a practical and relevant example of how any potential conflict can be overcome. In accepting the common contract, consultants acknowledge that the ethical code of contract-holding body will take precedence over their own ethical principles.</P>
    <P>In April this year, the present board published a &ldquo;Code for Nurses&rdquo;.  Their purpose is &ldquo;to provide a framework to assist the nurse to make professional decisions, to carry out his/her responsibilities and to promote high standards of professional conduct&rdquo;&mdash; The board stress that the code provides guidelines.  Specific issues will be considered as they may arise.  I am satisfied that there is absolutely nothing in the code likely to cause confusion for nurses or their employing authorities. On the contrary, I believe it will prove to be a very useful document for everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>The nursing profession is anxiously awaiting the enactment of this Bill.  Since it was first published in May 1984 there has been a consistently high level of interest in all aspects of it among the profession generally.  The Minister for Health met personally with representatives of all the main nurse representative bodies and he received and considered innumerable written submissions &mdash; many of them <Col N="1990" /> from individual nurses.  The Bill as it now appears before you is the product of co-operation and, indeed, compromise following widespread consultation and lengthy debate in Dáil Éireann.  I would remind the House that it is now well over a year since it first appeared and I would appreciate your co-operation in facilitating its speedy passage through this House.</P>

      <P>Before I call Senator Fallon, it has been agreed that there be only one speaker from the Opposition and nobody from the Government side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, that was agreed but it is for other people to change it.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill we welcome with reservations, which I will go into in greater detail on Committee Stage in September.  Over the years the nursing profession have given the highest standard of care to their patients.  Many of us have been patients in hospitals and it is only right and proper that we pay a tribute to the nursing profession for their personal attention, expertise and skill, and for the care, compassion and genuine concern they show their patients at all times.  Whether Irish nurses are in the mission field, involved in community work or in our hospitals, large or small, city or town, we can be proud of their talents and their efforts.  I congratulate them and thank them for their work.</P>
      <P>The nursing profession are the largest care-giving profession in the health service area.  While we accept the praise afforded to them and admire their motivation and skill, we cannot allow them to rest on their laurels.  We must work &mdash; and this is what the Bill purports to do &mdash; to keep their standards high and to improve the situation.  It should always be the aim of the nursing profession to attract the most suitable people into the profession and to give them the very highest standard of training so that they in turn can continue to give the highest level of care to the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the dissolution of the former An Bord Altranais, and it is only right and proper that we should pay <Col N="1991" /> tribute to them for their work over the years.  As the Minister said, there have been some amendments to this Bill since it was introduced in the Dáil last June. Section 9 deals with membership of the board.  I am pleased that the size of the board has been increased from 27 to 29. We all know that the nurses were very anxious for increased representation. The Minister has conceded this and now we have 17 nurses and possibly three others among the 12 appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As this is a Nurses Bill, the dominant force of membership should be nurses. The fact that the nurses will elect their own representatives is obviously very important.  All disciplines of the nursing profession are recognised and will be represented on the board.  The change in section 9 (c) means that there will be two representatives who are engaged in the clinical practice of general nursing &mdash; this is understandable having regard to the fact that the greatest number of nurses are in this particular discipline &mdash; and the psychiatric nurses will have two representatives. That is very important.  It is disappointing that student trainee nurses are not represented.  The Minister might consider this when he is naming his representatives. I welcome the fact that the general public will be represented on the board.  This was mentioned when we were discussing the Dentists Bill, and it is important that this should be so.</P>
    <P>Under section 25 nurses will have to pay a retention fee, the medical profession do.  I think there is some disappointment among the nursing profession about this because many of them tell me they believe that once registered they are registered for life and that a fee should not be important.  Whilst a fee is not mentioned in any section of the Bill I hope it will be a nominal fee because work done by nurses differs greatly from that done by dentists or doctors.  We all know that, unfortunately, many of them work part time while others are unemployed.  The retention fee should not be the criterion for being on the nurses register.</P>
    <P>A worrying feature of the Bill is the <Col N="1992" /> number of times the Minister gives himself excessive powers.  I accept that it is necessary in some cases, but it seems to be very much a feature of this Bill.  Far too many sections operate with the consent of the Minister.  This is unnecessary and will not be good for the morale and confidence generally of this new board.</P>
    <P>In section 17 (4) the Minister is taking unto himself very far-reaching power and in the area of the right to approve training schools it is extraordinary that he should take such power even where the board express the view that the school is not acceptable.  It is a power that should not be part of the Bill.  All of this Ministerial intervention I find quite damaging.  I would hope to be proved totally wrong here, but certainly there are areas where it will be damaging.  As I said what the new board need are trust and confidence and they require these from the very start.  That the Minister's consent is required to so many items in the Bill will affect this confidence and trust.</P>
    <P>Again, we go on to section 30 of the Bill.  This gives power to the board to maintain a register for persons engaged in ancillary nursing.  The question I would have to ask here is, is this section necessary. I was led to believe that at the beginning the reason for this grade was that we had not enough nurses and a form of shortterm training was given.  The explanatory memorandum makes the point &ldquo;It is envisaged that this provision could be invoked in the event of a development of such profession or calling in the future.&rdquo;  Again, as I said earlier, having regard to the fact that there are so many parttime and unemployed nurses, I just wonder if this section is at all necessary. To me, it is not.</P>
    <P>The working party did not recommend another grade of nursing.  This was their recommendation in 1980 and I am sure they have no reason to change their minds five years later.  This is a section that could easily be deleted.  It is one that I am sure we will discuss at length on Committee Stage.  Again, in this section we have the dangers in the power which the Minister gives to himself and which, <Col N="1993" /> effectively, gives him control of the register. Indeed he could register, one could argue, anyone he likes.</P>
    <P>The Minister this morning has expressed surprise in some way at the establishment of a Central Applications Bureau. This is one of the areas in which quite a degree of concern has been shown. Nurses and hospital staff generally have expressed concern about this matter.  As far as the Central Applications Bureau is concerned, I see very little wrong with it. First, it is certainly going to eliminate thousands of potential trainee nurses having to apply all over the country to various training schools and getting back negative or no replies, causing the amount of annoyance and frustration that we know exists.  Secondly, it would ensure that applicants are qualified, under the section which gives the board the power to determine the minimum educational requirements which are necessary for entry to training as nurses.</P>
    <P>The present method I would regard as unsatisfactory for the reasons I have given.  I accept the importance of a Central Applications Bureau, but there I stop.  I do not think such a bureau for nurses can operate, as it were, in the same way as it would in the university context, because a student attending at a university is totaly different from a nurse training.  In nursing we are dealing, as we all know, with an employer employee situation.  The student nurse, as we all know, would become an employee at the hospital involved and the hospital, as employer, must be given the same right as any employer.  They must have an input into the choice of person they select.  The training schools must be allowed to have a real say in the choice of trainee nurses.  Nurses should not be, as it were, imposed on any training school.  The selection of trainee nurses is important, too, for any hospital because of the fact that the character and ethos of the hospital are in some way involved.</P>
    <P>The role that the training school plays in its choice of the trainee nurse has helped the nursing profession over the years.  It has helped to create the great ethics that are involved, that are part and <Col N="1994" /> parcel of our nursing profession.  Unless these schools are given a say in the selection of trainee nurses this situation will change drastically.  Perhaps the Minister has been criticised a little unfairly because, in fairness, he is on record somewhere as saying that he has no full preconditions but, nonetheless, this is part and parcel of the Bill and the board will be mindful.  I would imagine, that the Minister would be anxious that it be implemented.</P>
    <P>Another section of the Bill that I would like to comment on is section 51 (2) to which the Minister referred, and which provides that it shall be the function of the board to give guidance to the nursing profession generally on all matters relating to ethical conduct and behaviour. There is some doubt &mdash; and I think it has to be expressed &mdash; that it should not be the function of the board to give this guidance.  This concern has been put to me many, many times.  More importantly, we have to consider the role of the hospital.  The ethics of a hospital, for many reasons, may change and the hospital will play, and always has played, a major role in the character and in the ethics of the nursing profession in that particular hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the code for nurses.  I have letters from nursing people who have expressed some concern, in particular over section 1 (11) page 6 of the code for nurses, but, having said that, I would make the point that on this new board that we are setting up nurses will become very much the dominant force.  Obviously, they can and should work for what they regard as an absolutely suitable code for nurses &mdash; that is, if some of them are not happy with the present code.</P>
    <P>Section 34 is a section that would worry many people.  Section 34 (5) states:</P>
    <P>A hospital or an institution of which the Board has refused to approve may apply to the Minister to direct the Board to approve of it and if the Minister, after consideration of the facts of the case, gives the direction, the Board <Col N="1995" /> shall approve of the hospital or institution.</P>
    <P>This is an area where an appeal &mdash; if there should be an appeal &mdash; should be to the High Court, not to the Minister.  It is important that where the nursing board decide to close a training school that the training school should have the right of appeal to the High Court rather than to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with fitness to practise and I welcome this part of the Bill.  An updating and an extension of power to the board in regard to discipline is necessary.  The power of the board at present only provides for the striking off of a nurse's name from the register. There is an extension here to suspend registration of a nurse's name and an updating and an extension of powers in this area is something that would be welcomed.</P>
    <P>One of the sections in Part VI provides for the imposition of a fine and/or a term of imprisonment on a person found to be guilty of falsely representing himself or herself to be a nurse or a midwife as defined in the Bill.  This is important. Only yesterday I read of a case in England where a commercial traveller had suddenly become a doctor and had sucessfully performed something like 17 operations.  He admitted not having one iota of medical training.  That section is important, too.</P>
    <P>There will be much discussion on Committee Stage.  We must accept the principle of the Bill and the need for an up-to-date Nurses Bill.  It is right that such important matters as education, training, registration, fitness to practise and all the matters we have referred to this morning should be brought up-to-date.  While there are aspects of the Bill with which we do not agree, we have to give genuine approval to the main thrust of the Bill. The Minister made the point that because we are in a new age of technology we should prepare our nurses for the challenges that face them in this era of high-powered medical and technological science.  This Bill should be in the best <Col N="1996" /> interests of the nursing profession and, indeed, of the general public and I welcome it.  There are some areas we will have to discuss later but generally it is a Bill to which we will have to give our approval.</P>

      <P>Before we proceed with the amendments I wish to bring to the attention of the House a printed error which occurs in amendment No. 4 where the indefinite article &ldquo;a&rdquo; should appear before the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; in the fourth line.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 25 to 29 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Agency shall, at such times as, and in respect of every period to which, subsection (2) of this section relates, draw up and submit to the Minister for his approval, given by him after consultation with the Minister for Finance, a programme outlining the Agency's projected activities (in this section referred to as a `strategic plan').&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment before the House arises from the discussion on Committee Stage of this section of the Bill.  A number of Senators were concerned that the process of submission of strategic plans and the consideration of these plans by the Minister concerned could hold up the work of the agency.  During the debate on Committee Stage I endeavoured to explain the reasons underlining this section.  I pointed out that the Ministers concerned could not be required to approve the agency's plans within certain time limits and, furthermore, if the plans were not approved the work of the agency would <Col N="1997" /> not come to a standstill but would continue to carry out their functions within the limits of the resources available to them.  I was satisfied, therefore, with the general principles underlined in the section, including the provision for ministerial approval.</P>
      <P>However, I agree with one point which was raised by Senator O'Leary concerning the role of the Department of Finance with regard to the approval of the agency's plans.  Senator O'Leary pointed out that the section as it stands appears to envisage the Minister for Finance, who already under section 9, would exercise financial control on the agency, getting involved in the detail of the agency's programme and having to go through it in detail before approving it.  This &mdash; Senator O'Leary felt &mdash; would result in excessive involvement of that Department, in unnecessary interdepartmental correspondence and in consequent delays in approving the strategic plans.  The general point raised by Senator O'Leary is a good one.  Accordingly it is proposed that section 5 be amended to remove the provision for approval of strategic plans by the Minister for Finance and insert instead a provision for approval by the Minister for Social Welfare, subject to consultation with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The strategic plan for the agency will undoubtedly contain, expressly or by implication, a commitment to expenditure by the Exchequer.  It is appropriate that the Minister for Social Welfare would consult with the Minister for Finance with regard to the plan, while the approval of the plan would in the ultimate be a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.  That Minister would then have to ensure that the necessary resources were made available to enable the plan, as approved, to be put into effect.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for acceding to the points that were made not only by myself but on which I was supported by Members on all sides on the last occasion.  I think it is refreshing that the Minister has accepted our points of view in that regard.  It draws an essential <Col N="1998" /> difference between imposing on the Minister for Finance the obligation of going through this on a line-by-line basis and giving his general approval and the general duty of consultation which is now imposed on the Minister under whose control this agency will operate.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Robinson proposed amendments on Committee Stage, the effect of which would be that members or employees of the agency would not, as proposed in the Bill, have to cease membership or be seconded from employment as the case may be when nominated as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Parliament.  The amendments were withdrawn when I indicated that the Government accepted the principle of the amendments proposed and that the appropriate amendments would be brought forward on Report Stage after consultation with the parliamentary draftsman.  This has now been done and the amendments have been circulated. The amendment to section 15(1) (b) provides: that a member of the agency shall cease membership when elected to either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Parliament rather than when nominated as a candidate, as originally in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment to section 15 (2) (b) makes similar provision with regard to the secondment of employees.  The <Col N="1999" /> amendment to section 15 (2) (c) makes the consequential provision that payment of remuneration or allowances to an employee will cease only in respect of the period beginning on nomination as a Member of the Seanad or on election to either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament as the case may be and ending when he ceases to be a member of the body concerned.</P>
    <P>The amendment to subsection (4) is necessitated by the new format of subsection (2) (c) and makes no substantive change.  As there was a great deal of support for these amendments in the form in which they were first proposed I have no doubt that they will now be agreed without further debate and I commend them to the House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator Robinson, who expressed a lot of our views in this regard, I thank the Minister of State for having conceded this amendment on Report Stage.  This is the second piece of legislation on which the Members of this House have managed to convince the parliamentary draftsman and, indeed, the Minister, in regard to the automatic preclusion of people who are nominated for public office but who are not necessarily elected from being members of an agency such as this or of the dentists board, for instance.  This is an important and fundamental piece of amending legislation to which the Members of the House have addressed themselves.  First, it defends that right of people to be nominated, particularly in view of the fact that there are certain nominating procedures over which the nominated person has no control.  A person could be nominated without his knowledge and thereby be automatically disqualified from membership of this agency.  The Minister in conceding this amendment now agrees that such preclusion will not occur until a person has been elected to either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Assembly.  This is the second piece of legislation in which we have had to amend the parliamentary draftsman's first draft of a Bill and we <Col N="2000" /> hope that in future the necessity for an amendment will not take place.  I can assure the parliamentary draftsmen that if they continue to include sections like this we will continue to amend them, with the support of the Minister, I hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Before leaving Report Stage, I wish to mention three sections that I thought the Minister indicated he would give consideration to.  On Committee Stage, points were raised and the Minister indicated at that time, if the notes which I have on my copy of the Bill are correct, that he would consider three other matters.  We have not heard anything of them so presumably the Minister has decided not to make the amendments. I would like to hear what the Minister's views are on those matters. One was in relation to section 4 (5).  It deals with the agency being required to perform their functions in accordance with directions issued from time to time by the Minister.  The second point relates to section 5 (3) (a).  The issue there was a proper timetable which would ensure that the matter would be considered within a reasonable length of time.  The third matter was that the Minister would consider these matters before Report Stage.  I would like to have the benefit of his consideration of the matter on section 7 (4) which provides that:</P>
      <P>The Minister when appointing a member shall fix such member's period of membership which shall not exceed three years and, subject to this section, membership shall be on such terms as the Minister determines.</P>
      <P>That was the point highlighted in the debate.  Does that mean the Minister can say one could only attend half the functions?  The Minister indicated he would have a look at that matter as well. Would the Minister like to share the consideration that he has no doubt given to these points and which have given rise to the situation where he has decided not to amend the Bill at this stage?  I think it is right that we should get a response to committments given like that.  It is important also from the point of view of the other House that there should be some consideration of these matters at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Senator had to battle that hard.  On the points referred to by Senator O'Leary and which I dealt with at some length on Committee Stage, I agree that when we had dealt with them he appeared not to be 100 per cent satisfied and wanted to refer to them again on this Stage.  On section 4, which Senator O'Leary has referred to, it was generally agreed that the outline of the agency's functions in section 4 is fairly comprehensive and that under the powers given in the section the agency will be enabled to carry out their role effectively.</P>
      <P>Concern was expressed by Senator Robinson on the Second Stage regarding the ability of the new agency to promote projects on the ground which would continue and expand the work developed in the pilot projects under the former combat proverty programme and engender local community self-help and so on. I agree that it is important to build on the experience of the last programme and I am satisfied that the powers given in section 4 and in particular in subsections (1) (b) and (2) (d), are adequate to enable the agency to assist in carrying out the work done by the pilot projects under that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson was also concerned about what she saw as the lack of a clear commitment to develop a national forum which would enable poor people to speak on their behalf.  The sentiment behind this idea, namely, to give poor people more of a say in the decisions which affect their own lives was one of the motives underlying the establishment of the agency.  Section 4 (2) (c) gives the agency the function of acting as a resource centre for community development as a means of overcoming proverty and the fostering and encouraging of community development particularly in areas with a high concentration of poverty where there has been no tradition of community development <Col N="2003" /> activity.  That will be a very important aspect of the agency's work.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary repeated his concern today that the new agency should have maximum freedom to operate and this brings us to what was the nub of the debate on section 4 on Commitee Stage and in particular subsection (5) which provides that the agency shall, in the performance of its functions, comply with such directions as may from time to time be given to it by the Minister.  I have carefuly considered what has previously been said about subsection (5).  The subsection was put in as a standard provision. It previously appeared in the National Community Development Agency Act, 1982, and in the National Social Service Board Act, 1984, both of which dealt with agencies similar to the Combat Proverty Agency and was not seen as a threat to the effective functioning of those bodies. The first point in relation to this is that the Minister and the Government of the day have the overriding responsibility in all matter of public policy.  The establishment of a new agency, as Senator Robinson said, will not in itself solve the problem of poverty.  It will have a central role in identifying the causes and extent of poverty in Ireland and initiating measures to overcome it.  But without a commitment by the Government to put into effect in their economic and social policies the measures necessary to address the needs of the poor, the work of the agency will have little effect.</P>
    <P>We must assume that the Minister shares with the agency a concern to tackle the problem of poverty.  For the effective operation of the agency there must be a degree of harmony between the agency and the Government, not necessarily total agreement.  Some Senators appear to envisage a situation where the Minister and the agency are at loggerheads.  That situation is unlikely where the parties involved are sincerely concerned to work for a common aim, but if it arose it would obviously have to be dealt with by either or both sides and might conceivably result in resignations or removals without having to resort to the ultimate power <Col N="2004" /> which the Minister would have under the Bill, that is to remove members of the agency from office.  It could be argued that in recent times too little rather than too much ministerial control has led to failure in several areas of the public sector.  It is hoped that the need to exercise the powers in section 4 (5) would rarely if ever arise.  However, the Government have considered in the present case that the Minister has need of power to intervene, regardless of whether it will ever be exercised.  This is something which will largely depend on the experience of the agency's operation. Therefore, the power to issue directions under section 4 (5) is in no way a radical measure and is not likely to be used in the event of any fundamental difference of opinion between the Minister and the agency, should that arise.  The power to direct is limited very specifically to directions as to the performance of the agency's functions.  It has been drafted clearly to exclude any power to prevent the actual exercise of any of the functions laid down in the Act, including the important freedom to publish the agency's reports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>May I raise a point which in turn was raised by Senator O'Leary on Committee Stage.  It relates to whether the agency will be liable to income tax or corporation tax in respect of their income.  Secondly, it is intended that gifts given to the agency should be liable for capital gains tax, or how is the taxation element of that gift to be dealt with?  The Minister has not actually addressed himself to that, even though he said that he would return to this point on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of social research the contributions which are covenanted enjoy considerable tax benefits from the Revenue Commissioners.  Whatever about the liability of the agency in respect of taxation, I would make a plea to the Minister that the tax benefits associated with social research should be extended to donations given to the agency.  In other words, that there would be a tax benefit to the donor of funds to the agency.  I would urge also <Col N="2005" /> that where contributions are made by individuals or organisations to combat the pressing problem of poverty at local level, such people should enjoy tax benefits especially, where the agency are not able to fund a poverty need at a particular time.</P>
    <P>As I can speak only once on Report Stage, I should like to add that in relation to research I welcome the provision in the Bill, at section 4 (c), that the agency will have the function of examining the nature, causes and extent of poverty in the State and for that purpose the promotion, commission and interpretation of research.  I can understand the impatience of some people who say that funds pumped into research into the poverty problem are not all that necessary, that what needs to be done is to address the problem and get on with the job.  I view research, however, as being of fundamental importance to an understanding of the problem and therefore I welcome this provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul make a very valuable contribution to addressing and relieving the poverty problem, but that organisation through their first hand experience of the problem of old people undertook a systematic study of the major needs of old people and produced a publication entitled <i>Old and Alone</i> which I understand was of considerable importance and value in the formulation of policy at official level.  So a practical organisation such as they who do such valuable work recognise the need for more fundamental research in addition to coping with the problems on a day to day basis.  They undertook a systematic study to enable them to better address the problem of poverty and indeed to give the policy makers that much greater insight when formulating policy.  Very often in the poverty field, as in so many other fields, we have impressions that there are particular problems; but a clear and systematic study of problems can lead to results, like the publication to which I have referred, which facilitate an objective assessment by policy makers.</P>
    <P>In regard to action research, the same organisation &mdash; they are one of a number <Col N="2006" /> of organisations coping with the poverty problem &mdash; launched a special residential care project in the north inner city of Dublin.  Having established a house in the community for deprived and delinquent children, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul established a three year fellowship to which a person from the Department of Social Science in UCD was appointed to evaluate this project in the inner city of Dublin during the experimental period. The resulting report should, when published, enable them to improve the experiment where necessary and should also raise a number of important pointers for similar development elsewhere.  I wanted to give two practical examples of the value of research, both of the action-orientated variety and also of fundamental research initiated by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
    <P>I would very much welcome the Minister's response to the suggestion I have made about the extension of tax benefits under covenants in respect of donations made to the agency and not alone that, but to individuals and organisations who may contribute financially to help solve local, poverty problems so that they, too, will enjoy the tax benefits now associated with covenanted social research.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hillery referred to the point raised by Senator O'Leary on Committee Stage regarding the question whether gifts made to the agency would be taxable.  This matter appears to be governed by the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, as amended.  There is a provision in this Act that a gift or an inheritance which is taken for public or charitable purposes shall to the extent that the commissioners are satisfied that it has been or will be applied to public or charitable purposes be exempt from tax. Any gifts received by the agency would be expected to be applied for public purposes and therefore, they should be exempt from tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question asked by Senator Hillery in regard to covenants etc. is a matter which I am not competent to deal with. They are questions for the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners. <Col N="2007" /> We will certainly try to get that information for the Senator.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary referred to subsection (3) (a) of section 5.  I dealt with this point on Committee Stage when I referred to a question raised by Senator Robinson.  Senator Robinson was also concerned that no time scale was set for the preparation of the reviews.  As I pointed out then, the legislation is designed to allow flexibility to the Minister in determining the period of the reviews and the time at which the reviews should be done.  It seems logical that a review would cover the same period as the agency's strategic plan.  This need not necessarily be the most desirable approach.  The Minister might consider a longer period to be more appropriate.  As far as setting the time at which reviews should be carried out is concerned, it is considered that this should remain at the discretion of the Minister.  The agency may also be constrained by the availability of the professional expertise necessary for the purpose of the review.</P>
    <P>The other main point raised by Senator O'Leary was in relation to subsection (4) of section 7.  This subsection provides that subject to the section as a whole, membership of the agency shall be in such terms as the Minister determines.  Senator O'Leary and other Senators expressed concern that this subsection might be used to circumscribe freedom of action of people appointed to the new agency. To avert this possibility, Senator O'Leary suggested that the power to set terms of appointment might be made specifically subject to the provisions of the Act as a whole rather than to the provisions of this section.  I would have no objection to this if it has any legal effect but I am advised that an amendment along these lines would not materially affect the situation and I do not propose, therefore, to amend the section in this way.  The section already outlines certain of the terms under which the members would be appointed, notably the length of the period of membership, powers of removal by the Minister and rights of members to resign.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2008" /> In addition, section 8 contains provisions relating to payment of expenses.  It is considered that the Minister should also be given the power to fix other terms of appointment to meet some situations which may arise.  Such a power would be useful where, for example, the Minister wanted to appoint a person to represent a particular interest group or a geographical area, a rural area for example, whose appointment to the agency might only be for as long as he remained attached to that group or resided in that geographical area.  The fears expressed by Senator O'Leary about the subsection are not justified.  Any special terms of membership in any individual case would have to be expressed in the instrument of appointment and would be known to the agency as a whole.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary gave the example of a situation in which a Minister wanted to appoint a person on condition that he acted in a certain way or took a particular line in the agency's discussions.  One would hope that this situation would not arise but if an individual Minister wished to act in this way he would not need any special legal provision to enable him to do so, nor would the absence of a legal provision inhibit him.  In all legislation there is a general underlying presumption that the Minister responsible will act reasonably.  We can accept this principle here without apprehension.  Having reconsidered the matter fully and having sought legal advice I am of the the opinion that the extra powers in the section are useful and necessary and that the words in question should remain in the section.</P>
    <P>I trust that what I have said will answer all the principal points raised by Senators both on Committee Stage and Report Stages.</P>

      <Col N="2010" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I can speak about anything that is in the Bill on this Stage but unfortunately I cannot speak about what is not in the Bill.  I thank the Minister for the courteous way in which he considered the various matters which are in the Bill. It is to his considerable credit that he has treated the House in this respectful and proper fashion.  I thank him for that.</P>
      <P>There are a number of points which remain to be considered and it is as well that they would remain to be considered because the Bill has yet to be considered in the Dail.  I am sure the Minister will receive representations from Members of that House about what is now in the Bill. I support the Bill in general.  It is a good Bill.  It establishes an agency which will have a useful function to perform.  I do not know whether the agency will perform the function, but at least the framework has been established, which is useful.  The Minister is to be congratulated on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of matters remaining in the Bill with which I am not 100 per cent satisfied.  I draw the Minister's attention briefly to those points.  The matters in the Bill that I am not completely happy with are the general powers which the Minister has to influence, in a very strong way, if he wants to, the deliberations of the agency.  The long debate which we had on Committee Stage on section 4 (5) does gives a good example of what can arise.  Generally speaking, the Minister has the right to dismiss anybody whom he believes is not acting properly. It is only right and proper that he should have that power.  In addition to that he has an unnecessary strong power to influence the decision at a time when he is unwilling to dismiss people by issuing directions under section 4 (5), directions which I think are inappropriate.  It may well be that the Minister will say in reply that the directions are standard in other legislation of this type.  We have shown on Committee Stage and on Report Stage of this Bill that standard insertions into legislation tend to outlive <Col N="2011" /> their usefulness.  It is our job to examine them with a fresh mind every time they come before us.  I hope the Minister will look at this section when it goes to the other House and give the matter some further consideration.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters in the Bill which leave something to be desired. Section 5 (3) (a) does not adequately lay down a definite timetable and the laying of reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas could be unnecessarily delayed by the Minister.  It could be delayed because he could delay the length of time which the strategic plan relates or he could take an indefinite length of time to consider the strategic plan before actually laying it before the House of the Oireachtas. Section 5 (3) (a) would be better if it was worded in slightly different form.  The points the Minister made regarding membership are reasonable enough.  He gave a reasonable example when he spoke about living in an area or representing a particular interest.  This could be done in a much more restrictive fashion if the Bill was amended appropriately.  It is a defective piece of drafting.</P>
    <P>One thing that has been shown by the Report Stage discussion of this Bill is that Members of this House who wish to have matters considered on Report Stage should put down amendments themselves and not depend on the Minister to come back.  I appreciate the Leas-Chathaoirleach's point of view, but Members are put in an impossible position if they can only speak once.  What does that refer to really?  If a Senator puts down an amendment everybody understands that he can speak on it.  At the end of it there is another amendment and you can speak on the other amendment.  It is a lesson for us all.  If we think of something on Committee Stage which requires attention, we should put down as many amendments on Report Stage as will give us an opportunity to discuss the matter. I appreciate the difficulty the rules of the House necessarily impose on us.</P>
    <P>Subject to all these minor matters, I welcome the Bill and the Minister's presentation of it.  I wish him success in seeing <Col N="2012" /> it through the other House.  I hope it gets as diligent a consideration in the other House as it got here and that, having done that, it will be successful legislation which will deal with this very important problem which faces us.  It might be interesting to see the cross-section of Members who actually discussed this Bill on Committee and Report Stages and to compare them with the public's perception of Members who might be expected to contribute to this debate.  I think the public would get a salutary lesson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already congratulated the people who thought up the idea of an agency to combat poverty in Ireland.  I do so again and say that it is indicative of a caring and compassionate society.  We need not be ashamed of the position that we occupy in international affairs as regards, the question of social welfare, education and health.  We rank among the best in Europe.  Having said that, there still is the problem of poverty to be combated.  I have already made my views known on the deep psychological wound that is caused by poverty, the shunning by society of the people impoverished, the impoverishment of the mind and the body and a new impoverished class.  What I want to do today is ask the Minister to clarify what is meant by the wording &mdash; I am reading from the Order Paper of 13 March 1985: &ldquo;to advise the Minister for Social Welfare on all aspects of economic and social planning in relaton to poverty in the State&rdquo;, and to go on then to initiate measures aimed at overcoming it.</P>
      <P>This phraseology is grandiose.  Will we have a central planning agency set up by the Combat Poverty Agency?  Will we have co-ordinationed planning on a regional basis from the centre out?  That is what economic planning means to me. The social consequences are bound to be fruitful.  I suggest seriously that there is no concept of economic planning in this State.  It is only in the real left-wing socialist countries that you apply the doctrine of economic planning and the social fruits which flow from it.</P>

      <P>I am sticking to the wording in the Bill.  I accept your ruling, of course, but I must insist that I am speaking on the question of how to plan the economy to alleviate poverty when you can only plan the economy to produce full employment.  Full employment is one of the methods of eliminating poverty.  The other method is to give an enhanced dole, increase the dole.  If your only consideration is material as distinct from the psychological wound and its effects, how do you plan the economy for full employment in relation to poverty? Do you plan the economy for full employment? That language I can understand. It is a nonsense to talk about planning the economy in relation to poverty.  It makes sense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The words referred to by Senator McGonagle can be understood as outlining the policy role of the new agency.  An anti-poverty programme cannot be drawn up in isolation from economic and social planning as a whole but must concentrate on the broader aims of national policy, that is, on a more just distribution of wealth, a more just distribution of income and power, in line with the Government's programme.  The agency must be seen as not just a source of support and funding for localised action by individual communities and groups but must be capable of having an input into policy making at national level.  The detailed policies and programmes which are adopted at any time in pursuit of the objective of combatting poverty will depend on the situation, but the rule of the agency in this area, with their expertise and direct involvement in combatting poverty, will be of considerable benefit in terms of helping to define policy and determine priorities for effective action.</P>

    <Title>Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>On 8 May last, when we were previously dealing with the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, I dealt with the question of people who were sleeping rough and I indicated that one could not force people who had made it their way of life to sleep rough to start applying for housing if the facilities were there for them to do so.  Also at the conclusion of that part of the debate I suggested that when provisions would be laid down in <Col N="2015" /> the Minister's Bill allowing them to apply to be placed on the housing list priority would be given to the more feeble of those who have to sleep rough.  This is not easy because it is difficult to get people who sleep rough to start reporting to doctors on a regular basis.  For example, you cannot get them to get someone to bring them into the chief medical officer to see if they can get more points etc.  That will have to be taken care of when the Minister brings in the Bill.  A priority look must be taken at the weaker of those people with a view to finding some means of assessing who is the weakest in the health sense so that priority can be given accordingly.</P>
      <P>One problem of the need to house the homeless is not so much that nobody wants to do it &mdash; though I lay the charge that nobody seemed overwilling to do it down through the years irrespective of what Government were in power &mdash; but they never got down to the point of involving the appropriate caring organisations, associations, co-operatives, etc. in dealing with this question of housing the homeless.  That must be tackled now. It is not fair to the homeless to say that eventually we will be bringing in a Bill which will provide the opportunity for them to apply; but, having applied, they may then have to sleep rough for another five, six or seven years depending on what the housing situation has to offer.  After all, availability of the housing stock has been affected by people acquiring the right to purchase houses, etc.  Therefore, it is necessary to think about involving these caring organisations such as the St. Vincent De Paul Society, co-operatives, etc., to see if, instead of just having the homeless provided for by being able to apply, they will get something running alongside that whereby some sort of housing can be developed along co-operative lines to assist them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot repeat often enough after passing the Combat Poverty Agency Bill, that we cannot talk about poverty or anything else of that nature without including the homeless.  Even though the Bill may not be specific in that area, I have no <Col N="2016" /> doubt that some form of recommendation coming from the agency will also include views on the question of people who are downtrodden and homeless. Therefore, it is right and proper that we continue to indicate our feelings towards people who are homeless and to continue to agitate for provision of shelter for them.  It is also right and proper to talk about another kind of homeless people, homeless in the sense of lack of community.</P>
    <P>I refer to the people who are lonely and destitute, who but for the Willie Berminghams of this society would never get a visit, people who live in holes and have no toilet facilities and in some cases their surroundings are rat-infested.  They get but a few scraps of food.  That sounds strange.  Many people in this city will tell you that nobody is hungry or lonely, but the evidence is there if anyone is prepared to read it.  Not only in this city of Dublin, but in other Irish cities people have to face loneliness, cold, hunger and depression. As Willie Bermingham says people are alone in misery and often sentenced to death.</P>
    <P>Maybe it will be argued that the cruel conditions of the cities' tenements 65 years ago to which I referred do not now exist.  Perhaps they do not, but the scale of the problem is relative to the affluence that has grown up and therefore relevant in the sense that we should have been paying more attention to it.  The situation should not be at the level it is now.  There is chronic isolation and people are abandoned and forgotten.</P>
    <P>We have not had an opportunity to debate this problem since 1977 or 1978. Investigations then revealed great squalor in the city centre area where the buildings had leaking roofs and dirty rooms, no ventilation, outside taps, rats' excrement on the stairs and landings etc. That is what the report stated in 1977 and 1978.  It must be admitted that Dublin Corporation are doing a great job in the inner city, but they are not getting much help from the private builders to supplement that.  That is a pity.  It is not a condemnation of the corporation to say that these were the facts.  While many <Col N="2017" /> improvements have taken place, there is room for a great deal more improvement. We are very anxious to see that this is continually agitated for until finally we get a Bill that is acceptable, and we can put our hands to our hearts and say that the homeless have been really catered for, not just in the sense of being put on a housing list, which by its very procedures and demands might necessarily leave them on the streets for five or six more years.</P>
    <P>The position may have improved a bit, but I am not so sure about that.  It is probably arguable as to whether it has worsened or not.  I see the Minister indicating that it has not worsened and I am glad about that.  With the problem of population increase we have to keep our eye on it.  Obviously if the population grows there is a danger of the problem of homelessness being aggravated.  We are in the area now of a further population explosion.  Therefore, it is more important that we see that there is no further aggravation of the problem and that there will not be much more delay before the Minister comes into the House with a Bill that is acceptable.  In the meantime the Labour Party Senators, if no Government Bill arrives, will be supporting this Bill of Senator Ryan's.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his Second Stage speech said that Senator Ryan's Bill as it stands will not offer a solution to the problem of homelessness.  I would ask the Minister in the friendliest possible terms, &ldquo;When does any Bill offer a final solution?&rdquo; Legislation makes the problem less acute; then it has to be policed.  Subsequently it has to be reviewed.  There will not be any final solution to the problem of homelessness unless it gets the same attention as every other problem in society and is continually examined.  The means by which people can be housed should be reviewed.  We should see if co-operatives and charitable organisations can be helped to solve the problem of dealing with the homeless. They should be helped to a much greater extent than at present.</P>
    <P>There was an experience some time ago &mdash; I do not think many of the homeless <Col N="2018" /> will be able to take advantage of it &mdash; when Father Scully built some lovely flats around Gardiner Street and very poor people were able to be facilitated there.  They were subscribing a certain amount per week over a number of years before they would go in and finally some other arrangement was made.  If people like Father Scully could make that kind of effort for the poorer people in this society &mdash; it was a large effort in caring, but it was small in housing numbers &mdash; it is possible for the charitable organisations, who provide facilities for people and go out of their way to get them off the streets, to do something in that area.</P>
    <P>The main onus is on the Government. At the moment the onus to house people who are homeless falls on the special interest groups.  The onus is also on them to watch for the slip backs.  Diligence has ben displayed by them rather than by Governments down through the years &mdash; it is not a problem only of today or yesterday. I am very pleased that Senator Ryan brought this Bill into the house.  It is sad in a way that it was not debated much earlier, but it is not something that the Labour Party overlooked.  Anybody who reads the Labour Party document published about 1973 on combating poverty in Ireland will see that it was a very detailed document which covered a very broad range, the question of redistribution etc., including the provision of housing for those who could not provide houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any excuse for homelessness in a society that has progressed, relatively speaking, compared to the rest of the world.  There is no justification for saying that people who are homeless or who have not got adequate shelter shall continue to be left in that way.  All that has been missing down the years is the will to tackle the problem.  We are told now that this Bill does not provide sufficient scope.  Let us hope when the new Bill comes in that the scope will be there and the political will to take people off the streets and put them into homes will be displayed through that Bill.</P>
    <P>There have been for a long time the <Col N="2019" /> ways and means of dealing with people who are homeless and hungry.  I am not going into the whole question of the stock-piling of food mountains while people starve in Ethiopia.  The wealth of the nation has been growing and yet we go our way and turn our faces against what is not very palatable, thinking that the problem will go away.  Let us be blunt about it, without people such as Senator Ryan who focus attention on the many social evils that run through our system of society, a lot would be overlooked.  It may be an irritant to the Government when the question of inequality and redistribution of wealth etc., is raised but we can come to terms with the issues by discussing them.  For that reason I am very pleased that Senator Brendan Ryan introduced the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to become too emotional but unless we ensure that the system is kept under constant surveillance resulting in modifications we are inviting more criticism and a greater tendency towards disorder which grow out of the way in which society is structured and how different sections are dealt with.  I will never apologise, as a member of the Labour Party, for speaking out when the redistribution of wealth is not carried out correctly and as a result of which people are left homeless.  There is a weakness in the social order, avarice is rampant and we are not encouraged to listen to the voice of anger on behalf of these people.  We should not neglect them because that invites the social disorder to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I made a comment earlier about my own experience in the Dublin tenements. The charity of the people at that time was highlighted by the fact that everybody who lived in a tenement made sure that people were taken off the streets and given shelter.  They slept in hallways and lobbies and were provided with sheets made from flour sacks which had been stitched together.  They were provided with patchwork quilts, mugs of tea and bread.  I am talking about the late twenties and early thirties and it was going on long before that.  In 1985 people are <Col N="2020" /> sleeping out with sheets of paper over and under them.  It is sad to have to be so critical of Governments in this way.  I say that having regard to what took place between 1973 and 1977 during the Coalition period.  I am not making a political point of this although it was a very good period.  There was a social commitment particularly in their first 18 months of office.  Expenditure on social services, health and education rose dramatically in comparison with other periods.  It was in the region of 70 per cent, which was very substantial.</P>
    <P>About 25,000 houses were provided through local authorities and reform of the taxation system began.  In 1973 to 1977 we were actually coming to terms with the whole question of the social needs of the population and the redistribution of wealth among the underprivileged. That was a great trend. Unfortunately, other events have taken over and homeless people are forgotten.</P>
    <P>We hope the Minister will introduce a Bill which will be comprehensive enough to give the people on the streets an opportunity to get warm and dry accommodation. I trust that when the Minister introduces the Bill it will make provision for the homeless to look forward to getting into the position where they will have a reasonable opportunity of being housed in line with every other person who has a similar right.</P>
    <P>It would be sad if a Bill established a points system.  It is sad that somebody who is weak, hungry, cold and perhaps suffering from some type of sickness, does not go to a doctor and can die on the street.  I include in that the people whom I mentioned earlier, those to whom Mr. Bermingham addressed his efforts, the chronically lonely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us involved in politics, maybe not at this level but at county council or corporation level, will know of the frustrations felt by people <Col N="2021" /> looking for homes.  It is one of the very difficult situations we get into when people come looking for assistance.  No matter how you assure them that the houses will be given on merit and under the system each county devises, they still hope that by using a little political influence they will get a badly needed house.  It is very difficult to explain that the house was given to somebody who was in a worse position.  Everybody needs a place to stay and to have the comforts of home.  While sleeping in the open air may have been reasonably enjoyable last summer, nobody wants to sleep outside this summer, not to mention the winter.</P>
      <P>The question of homelessness is very serious.  We have the utmost sympathy for anybody who is trying to get reasonable shelter.  Most councils are building good houses.  Speaking for my own county, we have built many quality houses.  The latest housing scheme had all the hallmarks of a scheme that was well thought out.  It had mature trees, the houses were lovely and the people who went into them were extremely happy about everything.</P>
      <P>I do not know how we can get over the problem of the homeless, because I do not know how we can compel a government or a body to comply with section 3, which says &ldquo;...it shall be the duty of a housing authority to provide accommodation of reasonable standard and suitable type&rdquo;.  &ldquo;I am not trying to give examples because you can keep giving examples forever of persons in need of such accommodation who are homeless or threatened with homelessness either through emergency or because of their social conditions...&rdquo;. I am saying that at the beginning of my contribution because as a politician who meets married couples with children who are waiting a year, two years or three years for housing accommodation, it would be almost impossible for me to agree to a Bill to make it a statutory regulation that a council must provide accommodation for the homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of that section says &ldquo;threatened with homelessness&rdquo;.  I am sure Senator Ryan has his own interpretation <Col N="2022" /> of that, but it could be almost impossible to ensure that people did not abuse that situation.  We had a discussion in the Seanad sometime ago on homelessness in Carlow and I tried to explain the position as best I could.  I was rather disappointed that a wonderful organisation like the Simon Community should treat me in one of its publications as a kind of buffoon who did not know what I was talking about in the Seanad.  I got a letter from their very secretary, I think, outlining the position after the discussion and I had outlined to him my experience. At that time Senator Ryan was worried about the Sacred Heart Home.  I explained that while it was not public, I had taken in one of these people who had left the Sacred Heart Home.  He had spent a lot of time at our place and he got so fond of us that my wife was given his shirts to iron.  He had left the Sacred Heart Home because of rowdyism; he would not stay there.  I knew a lot of what was going on and I did not appreciate being more or less pilloried for making the gems of contribution as if I did not know anything about what was happening in Carlow at that time.</P>
    <P>Regarding homelessness in Carlow the doorbell rang one night last year when I was sleeping and the person at the door said he had been just thrown out of his flat, with all his goods and chattels, in the rain.  He gave me a telephone number to ring a relative of his who would convey a message.  I went to the council to see had they a mobile home for him.  At the time there was not, but I rang the relation to tell him what I had done.  He told me that I had not much to do, wasting my time, that what the fellow wanted was a kick on a certain part of his anatomy which he named.  He had been in a house with his brother and had walked out over some disagreement about payment of expenses.</P>
    <P>Certainly, I do not want in the slightest to take from the wonderful work that is being done by the Simon Community, the St. Vincent De Paul Society and the Salvation Army.  All these organisations do so much for the homeless in the city and it is a completely different world, I <Col N="2023" /> accept completely, from what can happen down the country.  The homeless down the country sometimes more or less opt for it.  It is very difficult to define why people opt out of any form of normal behaviour or out of society.  Some have not got homes.  To compel a county councillor or any housing authority to give homes to people who are threatened with homelessness would worry me.  What do you do if a couple are living with their parents and the house is overcrowded, as is the case in many places?  If they are threatened with being thrown out if they do not get a house soon, would they come under cover?</P>
    <P>I would hate to be in a situation down in Carlow in which people could come to me on the basis that they were thrown out or were threatened with being thrown out and take priority over the normal list of people waiting for a house.  Apart from that, I fully support the whole concept of housing people.  We cannot build houses fast enough.  As it is, we may not have a big waiting list, but we are in a society where people get married almost on a whim.  You have teenagers getting married, immediately looking for a house and you have to house three people.  Unmarried mothers are another problem for us. With the waiting list, you are invariably dealing with two people.  They are outnumbered each time by a husband, wife and one child, so how do you give these housing when they will not be given a three bedroomed house?  Even when you build two bedroomed houses or limited accommodation dwellings, it is very difficult to get people on the priority list unless they are living in very bad conditions, when they can be given limited accommodation dwellings, even though these are invariably for those who are advanced in years.</P>
    <P>On one occasion when we managed to get an unmarried mother into one of these limited accommodation dwellings, the manager did not sign the order afterwards even though it had been agreed, because he felt that these small dwellings were for older people who could be given a very handy kind of house where they <Col N="2024" /> could end their days.  The turnover would be much quicker dealing with old people, rather than giving it to a young girl who would spend maybe 50 years there, if she so decided.  We would find it very difficult to deal with this kind of problem because there is this continuing demand for houses, no matter what houses.  There will be 86 houses available shortly in Carlow and 68 were completed earlier in the summer.  You come down almost to the end of the line where you think that everyone is housed, but we have an ongoing cycle and people are getting married without any great preparation.  We prepare for many things but marriage seems to be the one thing for which we do not prepare.  People are getting married at a younger age and as a result we have many more marriages and we have a much greater demand for houses.</P>
    <P>I would welcome anything that can be done on a voluntary basis any help that can be given in the way of speeding up houses and extra grants.  Many things have been done that will speed up the building of houses.  I would support the Bill all the way and so would my party if that statutory part were not in it.  It would be impossible to defend.  I would like to compliment all the people who have worked so hard, many of them private people.  This is a thing that the public bodies would want to be careful about and I am talking about public charitable bodies.</P>
    <P>They are not the only ones that are doing a lot of work quietly.  While they are publicly doing marvellous work and we appreciate it, there are other people who are in their own quiet way helping people to get along as best they can and, deep down, last Saturday proved that charity, kindness and generosity is a trait that we have still, despite all the trouble we have in our country.  So many people are willing to help out, and if this Bill is amended we will have a Bill that will be able to help the people who are in difficulty and at the same time will not put those who are on legitimate housing lists in difficulty and put us in local authorities in difficulty as a result.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene just to let the House know the up-to-date position and I am glad to be afforded the opportunity of saying a few words here today.  First, I would like to thank the House for the way they have dealt with this subject.  It has been a very constructive debate on the homeless and it is important that this matter be examined in all aspects.  When the Minister spoke last May, he informed the House that he had received the Government's approval to the draft Housing Bill which would meet many of the objectives of Senator Ryan's Bill.  Since then, the Minister has put the text of the Bill to Government, prior to circulation, the Bill, I regret, has been to some extent a victim of the sheer volume of Government business in recent weeks.  I want to say here that a decision on the Bill is imminent.  As I say, the Bill is ready.  It is just a question of getting Government approval.  Therefore, it is appropriate to have this debate in advance of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Government have made it quite clear throughout this debate that we are concerned with the position of the homeless persons in our society and are committed to improving their position through access to local authority housing and all other schemes as well.  I do not think we should just look at the whole question of the homeless on the basis of local authorities tackling the problem, because we are all aware of the many things that are happening.  Indeed, my Department now give grants of up to £16,000 per unit for voluntary bodies who wish to go into the area of housing people, particularly those who are homeless. I am always one who supports voluntary organisations and voluntary bodies because if we ignored them society would be very much the poorer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are fortunate to have so many people in our society who are prepared to work for and to help those who are less well off.  We had an example of the type of spirit that permeates our society. Only last weekend, when we had pop groups of the world putting on shows both in the States and in England we <Col N="2026" /> saw the way this country rose to that magnificent occasion.  That is something we should not stifle.  That is something we should encourage as far as we can.  I know that is the spirit of Senator Ryan who put forward this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the whole area of homelessness it is well to remember that there are various types of people who require different types of accommodation. Some require local authority accommodation and others require accommodation of a communal nature where they would feel more at home living with others in hostels that are well run and have a high standard of living.  There are other people who require more intensive attention, people who, for various reasons, find it difficult to mix socially with others.  We cannot look at the problem of the homeless on a one-tier basis.  We have to look at all aspects to ensure that we are catering for people right across the board.</P>
    <P>The travellers are one such example. Some of them want halting sites, others want group housing and others want housing within the community.  This is a typical example of what you have to contend with.  One cannot just draft legislation and make laws and expect people to respond.  What we have to do in any legislation is to be responsive to the needs of the various types of homeless people. I have no doubt that is what we will do when our legislation comes before both Houses in the next session.  We have the spirit and will to implement that legislation. It will solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The one thing we can be reasonably proud of is our housing programmes, and particuarly our local authority housing programmes.  When one reflects back, say, 50 to 60 years ago in our large cities, and particuarly in Dublin, there were probably the worst slums in Europe which have all been replaced by very good housing.  I was told only recently that in one particular part of the greater Dublin area they are finding it difficult to get people on their lists to occupy houses that were finished.  That is a very useful step.  The £5,000 grant for people who move out of local authority housing will <Col N="2027" /> also make more accommodation available and that is important.  In other words, we have to provide and make available accommodation and that is being done.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area a couple of years ago housing applicants had to go on the list and wait for a period before they could be housed.  Recently I have come across a few cases myself, where people who were homeless were housed immediately. I know of a lady of 78 years who returned from England and was housed immediately.  These people had not to go through the rigours of going on a list and waiting and that is heartening.  It is not the perfect solution but there is progress in this area.  We have to work towards developing the kind of housing structures in the various areas so that when there is a need we will be able to fill it.  It is my view that we should involve the various bodies who are at present working in the area of housing.  There are various trusts such as the Iveagh Trust involved in this. We should consider if we can making the communal areas more comfortable so that people can call them their home.  For many people the hostel is their home and has been their home for years.  That is their form of life.  We should improve that accommodation with the grants being made available.</P>
    <P>Our Bill is imminent.  It will be circulated shortly and I have no doubt it will meet the needs of people.  It is important that we do not upset the balance of the existing lists.  We must ensure that we do not encourage people to make themselves homeless in order to jump the queue.  Nobody would agree with that. There is a sense of fairness in us all and we will have to ensure that whatever legislation emerges it will not happen and will not be allowed to happen.  Obviously, much will depend basically on the housing authority in the particular area dealing with this because they will be the judges.  We will have to leave it to some degree like this.  I know that Dublin Corporation at one stage when people were <Col N="2028" /> to be evicted through no fault of their own used to house them in good accommodation prior to their eviction.  Unfortunately, people found it profitable to make themselves homeless to get the kind of housing they might not have got had they remained where they were and the corporation then had to take a different view.  You have to take these things into account without getting away from the spirit of wanting to ensure that those who are genuinely homeless and who require accommodation will be accommodated to suit their needs.</P>
    <P>I accept the spirit of the Bill but there are points in it that I would not accept. We will be bringing the Government's legislation before both Houses of the Oireachtas in the next session.  I have no doubt it will be well received and that it will meet the needs of people.  Most Senators in their contributions indicated the need and desires of these people. The Bill will enshrine the feelings of the Members and I hope it will rid us of the problem of people being homeless.  We are not necessarily waiting for legislation. We have asked the Dublin Corporation to house homeless people and they have housed over 100 people in housing units. The local authority should be given credit for that and I hope it will be repeated across the country.  All of this will achieve what we want, namely, the homeless to be housed quickly and adequately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at length but I feel the occasion should not be allowed to pass without making a number of comments on Second Stage both on the Bill itself and on what it contains and what it omits.  It is also reasonable to speak on the climate which has given rise to the situation where we are discussing this Bill on the last day of this parliamentary session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, the Bill should be welcomed. It is as well that the Legislature should address this problem, which is a very serious one and try to resolve it within the legislative framework which will take into account the rights of people who are looking for accommodation under the various guises in which people look for <Col N="2029" /> accommodation.  Some people look for accommodation because they have nowhere to live, they are sleeping rough. Other people look for accommodation because they are in accommodation which is inconvenient, unsafe, overcrowded or otherwise unsuitable.  All these people have their rights and privileges. The balancing of those rights is really what the question of providing houses in the public sector is about.  The Government are to be congratulated on the various initiatives which they have taken in the public housing sector.  In particular they are to be congratulated on the initiative which has encouraged the vacation by people of local authority houses for private houses, taking advantage of the generous grants now available, thus releasing additional housing stock for people in genuine need of houses.</P>
    <P>One has to recognise that housing is something which is cyclical in nature.  In other words, a person's housing needs in their twenties, thirties and forties and when they are in their sixties are entirely different.  There has been a natural reluctance to recognise this in public housing authority terms.  The house which is suitable for a family with young children is not necessarily suitable when those persons get older.  The difficulty of insisting on moving to different sized accommodation, with the reduction in the size of family, the disruption which would take place there, is something which would be alien to our way of life and would be more suitable for, shall we say, the Soviet way of life.  It is as well to point out that in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics it is a common feature of their housing policy that, when a person sets up residence in an area with a particular size of family that enforced leaving of that housing, as the family reduces in size later, is a feature of their housing policy.  That is something we have to consider because it all has an effect on availability of accommodation.</P>
    <P>In our case the overwhelming majority of people would say that people resident in particular accommodation acquire a right to that accommodation, a right to reside there, even though their family <Col N="2030" /> circumstances might have changed. These are things we have to take into account in deciding our priorities.  The Government have made a good start on that aspect by encouraging mobility but while encouraging mobility we should not insist on it; it leads to totalitarian excesses quite unacceptable to our people.</P>
    <P>While the Government are to be congratulated on that &mdash; the Minister will recognise that if somebody starts off by congratulating the Government they always end up by saying &ldquo;but&rdquo;&mdash; the way the Government have treated this Bill is nothing short of disgraceful.  To have a fourth Minister come in to make a contribution on the Second Stage of this Bill is nothing short of scandalous.  It is true to say that the contributions have been excellent.  I have agreed with the thrust of their arguments.  I agree with the Government policy in the matter.  This Bill is riddled with inconsistencies, represents a philosophy with which I certainly do not agree, and with which I do not think either party in Government agree. But that is not the same thing as saying that the Government should send in a succession of speakers, one more intellectually convincing than the other.  They are all saying the same thing &mdash; that the idea is good, it is a good Bill, but that the details are unacceptable.  I do not think it is acceptable that any Minister in charge of a Department should allow two years to elapse in an area like this without taking some action to remedy such a defect.  Perhaps it was the Government view at one stage that it was not possible to remedy this defect.  Then they should have said that; they should have said &ldquo;We cannot produce a Bill&rdquo;.  But they have been saying for two years that they are producing a Bill and they have not done so.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should be depending on the embarrassment which a vote at the end of the Second Stage of this Bill might cause those of us who believe in housing the homeless.  Obviously we would have to consider the principle which we accept should be established on the one hand and, on the other hand, we would have to consider the obvious <Col N="2031" /> defects in this Bill.  We would have to balance those and decide which way we are going to vote on it.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that the Government should leave us in that position over a period of two years and have a series of pingpong matches between the Leader of this House and Senator Brendan Ryan as to when the Second Stage was going to conclude.  I have the greatest sympathy for both participants in that long-running saga because they both had a legitimate point of view.  It is reasonable that the Government should produce legislation at this stage.  I do not think the Minister seriously considered at an early enough stage &mdash; no doubt he is doing it now &mdash; the implications of this Bill or what alternatives should be put to the Houses of the Oireachtas for their consideration.</P>
    <P>That having been said, the Bill is an appalling piece of nonsense.  It has been produced by having taken the corresponding legislation in Britain which is the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act, 1977 omitting large sections of it, taking large sections of it and copying it slavishly without any consideration being given to the overall policy implications of the passing of the Bill.  I recognise that Senator Brendan Ryan is an open man, he will accept amendments on Committee Stage.  I suppose it would be unreasonable to expect him to produce a Bill which was not capable of being amended.  I am not really talking of amendments of the kind that we make from time to time to Bills here a comma here, a full stop there or an additional clause here.  I am talking about the fundamental philosophy in the Bill and the fundamental philosophy in this bill is nonsense and should be shown to be nonsense.  The fundamental philosophy appears to be that everybody is entitled to a house at any time no matter what his circumstances, no matter what the circumstances which gave rise to his present condition, or no matter how many times he has got a house in the past, left it or abused it or not paid rent for it, or done anything else.  One cannot <Col N="2032" /> run a society like that.  Anybody who thinks one can run a society like that is living in cloud-cuckooland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Ryan's interpretation of cloud-cuckooland is Seanad Éireann it may well be that he is right. A measure of the cloud-cuckooland in which we are living, or which this Seanad represents, is in the fact that we have taken over two years to come to terms with what is a poor piece of draft legislation. I agree with him in that regard. We should have had the courage initially either to accept it in principle on Second Stage for the purpose of going on with it and amending it very fundamentally or, alternatively, voting it down.  I would not rally mind which as long as I was sure that there was going to be amending legislation in the event of us voting it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a most extraordinary measure and in order to explain how extraordinary it is it would be necessary for me to explain what is actually the situation in Britain.  Under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act, 1977 in Britain the same concepts are considered the same problem is addressed as is attempted to be addressed by Senator Ryan in this Bill. First of all, a definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; is arrived at.  That definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; is then applied and is taken as the basis for a series of administrative actions which are necessary as a result of a determination to that effect. Leaving aside the question of who is homeless, the actual definition, it is very interesting to see what is supposed to happen in the United Kingdom if somebody is taken to be homeless, on who is threatened with homelessness.  The British Act says that inquiries shall be made; it does not say you give them a house automatically and that is what our Bill says.  Our Bill states that basically no matter what the circumstances you give them a house or dwelling.  Under the British Act they first of all make inquiries to establish what they call a priority need. &ldquo;Priority need&rdquo; would essentially mean people with dependent children, people who are threatened with homelessness as <Col N="2033" /> a result of an emergency, such as flood, fire or other disaster, or a person who is vulnerable with respect to old age, mental incapacity physical handicap or something like that.  These are priority cases.  An additional fact is that pregnant woman is also a priority case.  They are all reasonable priority needs.</P>
    <P>The second question that needs to be asked is: has that person become homeless or threatened with homelessness intentionally?  That is the kernel of the British Bill: you have to establish whether a person has become homeless intentionally. According to the answers to those questions various administrative actions are required to be taken.  But only in the case where a person has a priority need, and when a person has not become pregant, is not homeless or threatened with homelessness intentionally are they entitled to permanent accommodation from a local authority.  They must meet those criteria.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of subsidiary sections in the British Act but the basic thrust of the United Kingdom legislation is that one gets a house if one has a priority need and if one is not intentionally homeless or threatened with homelessness. That appears to be a very sensible compromise and it seems to work reasonably well.  There are problems with the United Kingdom legislation.  Quite a number of judicial interpretations have been necessary as a result of it.  I have had the opportunity of reading quite a number of them.  By and large the judicial interpretations have confirmed the overal thrust of the legislation and have confirmed the fact that it can work.</P>
    <P>There is an additional criterion which is interesting, that is, the actual allocation of responsibility for the individual between local authorities.  That is basically to ensure that a person cannot just go to to a different part of the country and pick and choose from any local authority in the country without any reference to his previous history just because he happens to be homeless and he or she has a priority need.  Obviously that would not be a sensible arrangement.  But in the legislation which is before us today that <Col N="2034" /> will be the situation.  If a person in Dublin was homeless they could decide to apply to Kerry County Council and Kerry County Council would be under statutory obligation to provide them with a dwelling. It is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>If the defects in Senator B. Ryan's Bill were as a result of accidental oversight on his part and were such as could be remedied on Committee Stage, I would accept them and probably would not even comment on them or do so in an offhand way.  But these are the result of policy decisions by Senator Ryan in introducing this Bill.  These policy decisions are the result of very confused thinking.  For example, in the Irish context, there is a definition of homelessness in section 4(1) (a) which states:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be regarded as homeless and in need of accommodation when the housing authority is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  he or any person who might reasonably be expected to reside with him (i) has no accommodation and is vulnerable as a result of old age, mental illness, handicap or physical disability, pregnancy, or other special reason and/or (ii) has no fixed abode and/or (iii) is usually resident in common lodging houses, refuges, night shelters or hostels....</P>
    <P>and then subsection (c) states:</P>
    <P>(c)  his accommodation consists of a movable structure, vehicle or vessel designed or adapted for human habitation and there is no place where he is entitled or permitted both to place it and to reside in it.</P>
    <P>That is a nice way of saying that these are travelling people of one kind or another, in addition to people who are living in temporary accommodation or vehicles of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to such people having a statutory right to have houses. They should be considered under exactly the same criteria as anybody else and, <Col N="2035" /> if they have children, they should get priority.  But a 35-year old man living on his own in a caravan with a substantial amount of money would be perfectly entitled to demand a house from a local authority under the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who is not in a position to buy a house for themselves could still have a substantial sum of money while living on the side of the road.  In my opinion that person would be entitled to accommodation under this Bill.  What is the right about which we are speaking?  My definition of the right about which we are speaking is the right to accommodation, the right to a dwelling. But, like all rights, it is not an absolute one.  What Senator Ryan is seeking to establish is that it is for all practical purposes an absolute right.  The right to accommodation is a right which like most of our rights, must be subject to a number of conditions; even the right to life itself is subject to conditions.  One of the conditions it must be subject to is how the person behaves.  Under this Bill &mdash; Senator Ryan may feel perfectly free to interrupt me if I am wrong &mdash; if a person who is in need of accommodation is housed by a local authority, after a period leaves that dwelling and, as a result of leaving that dwelling, becomes homeless again, he or she is entitled to be housed a second <Col N="2036" /> time.  If they leave a second time they are entitled to be housed a third time, and if they leave a third time they are entitied to be housed a fourth time.  Not only are they entitled to be housed but they are entitled to be housed by a local authority of their choice.  For example, if they are not satisfied with Dublin Corporation they can go to Kildare County Council and they can go the third, fourth, fifth, sixth time.  That does not make any sense at all.</P>

      <P>The reality of what I said remains.  People are entitled to have their applications considered regardless of whether or not they have paid or have been in any way responsible for their present situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2038" /> The Bill as drafted contains an interesting section, section 9.  It gives power to a local authority to make a reasonable charge for the accommodation which they propose to allocate.  That is fair enough.  It does not say what will happen to the person if he does not pay the charge.  It just permits the local authority to make the charge.  If the person refuses to pay the charge and as a result is put out of a dwelling, it does not say that he or she is not entitled to other accommodation. So it gives the power to charge, but it is a toothless power because people can ignore it.</P>
    <P>The defects in this measure are fundamental. It is defective in so far as it fails to take into account the circumstances which gave rise to the homelessness or the threatened homelessness in determining either a person's entitlement or a person's priority for housing.  That is very serious.  I will give a practical application of it.  Most Senators will be aware that local authorities have lists of people who require housing.  The local authorities have different priorities.  In some places they have a points system and in other places it is not the points system.  For example, people in overcrowded conditions have a certain priority and over a certain period they become eligible for housing and are housed.</P>
    <P>It happens very often that people are inadequately financed on the occasion of their marriage, they live with their father and mother, children come along in the normal course of events and as a result of that the house or dwelling becomes overcrowded.  In due course, because they are overcrowded and because of a combination of the overcrowding and the length of time they have applied, they become entitled to be considered for public authority housing.  No matter how long these people are on the housing list they will be put below every person who could be categorised under this Bill as being homeless or being threatened with homelessness irrespective of the fact that people might have had a quite adequate house provided by a local authority and might have left it either because they did not pay their rent or went on a six months <Col N="2039" /> holiday somewhere else.  When these people come back, genuinely homeless, irrespective of fault they would have priority over the people who had stayed for the whole time and who were <i>bona fide</i> applicants on the basis of overcrowding for rehousing by the local authority. That does not make sense.  That is encouraging those unfortunate people who were there in the first place to make themselves homeless so that they can jump the queue.  That is why I agree with what successive Ministers have been saying when they have come in here.  That is the point they have been making and I agree with them.  It makes no sense at all.</P>
    <P>Ordinary persons looking for a local authority house and who are not willing to go to the extreme length of making themselves homeless, will have no opportunity of getting accommodation or will only get accommodation when there is an absolute surplus of accommodation on the market.  People should realise that it is very difficult to have a surplus of houses, because the demand increases to fill the available spaces.  There are family units that are very happy living together but if additional accommodation becomes available they might apply for it.  The way in which the relative merits of people in different categories are judged at present and the way in which they are given appropriate weight will be turned head over heels if a Bill such as this becomes law.</P>
    <P>I am not against homeless people being accommodated.  I am not against people who are sleeping rough being accommodated. I am not against people who are sleeping in hostels being accommodated. I am in favour of all that and I am in favour of there being a duty on the local authority to house them, but I am not in favour of expressing that duty in such absolute terms that it can be abused and can be used as a mechanism for overcoming the legitimate priority schemes which are an integral part of the duty of the housing authority.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper that we should have a Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill. I am in favour of the principle of the Bill <Col N="2040" /> and I am happy to support the Bill on Second Stage but as far as I am concerned, I could not support the further processing of this measure without the most fundamental amendment to it.  It is necessary to establish a proper scheme of priorities which will take into account the conflicting rights of those who are homeless through no fault of their own and those who are homeless through their own fault and those who are living in unsuitable accommodation but are not homeless.  These are the priorities that will have to be established.  This Bill totally fails to tackle this problem.  It seeks to give additional unfettered rights to one group of people but it fails to recognise that in doing that it is taking substantial rights from people who already have them and in doing so it is doing a great disservice to that section of the community. I am quite happy to have the Second Stage of this Bill taken and I certainly will not oppose it, but I will not support the Committee Stage of the Bill without the most fundamental change being made to it.  A fundamental change is necessary in order to preserve the proper balance between the rights of those people who need houses but who are not homeless and those people who are homeless either through no fault of their own or are homeless because of some action or series of actions for which they must themselves accept ultimate responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator O'Leary for at least injecting a little life into the debate if nothing else.  Whether he injected any sense into it I will deal with in a moment.</P>
      <P>It is so long since we started that I do not know whether I should go back to December 1983 &mdash; or was it November 1983?  &mdash; to the original introduction of the Bill.  Since this is quite likely to be the only chance in my career as a Senator, if not in my career in politics, in which I will reply to the Second Stage of a Bill which I introduced, I will probably indulge myself a little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very grateful for the amount of wisdom that many Members of this <Col N="2041" /> House, particularly members of local authorities, have contributed to the debate.  I am very sorry if something that the organisation I am associated with said gave offence to Senator Browne.  I cannot remember the publication so I cannot say if I agree or disagree with it.  I am sorry he felt offended by it.  I will check it up and I will tell him privately or publicly whether I thought he was unfairly treated or not.</P>
    <P>I listened to almost all of the debate.  I was absent for some of it because I was on a committee which was making decisions. There were different emphases on different things.  I will come back to the general principles of the concern.  It was an interesting and an educational experience for me to hear members of local authorities in particular talk about many of the problems that they had encountered and many of the fears they had about this legislation as it stands.  Many of the more rational objections that Senator O'Leary had were reflected, perhaps less colourfully and less articulately, by many Members of the House.  I do not think anybody else would have thought of some of the objections he articulated.  He raised questions about a number of aspects of the Bill which are not as fundamental as he said they were.</P>
    <P>The original intention of the Government was to move an amendment to have the Bill rejected on Second Stage but, thanks to the strong feelings expressed by Labour Party and Fine Gael Party and indeed thanks to the support that Fianna Fáil Senators expressed for the principle of the Bill, the first achievement of this Bill was to get the Government to change their mind and to decide not to, at least in principle, oppose the taking of the Bill. A large number of very effective and very vocal voluntary organisations added their support outside this House to the need to have this Bill taken at least in a positive spirit, if not accepted in full.  We had a couple of very interesting days in which a considerable number of promises were made to me privately by members of the Government most of which have subsequently <Col N="2042" /> been broken if not in spirit at least in terms of time.</P>
    <P>I will come later to the most flattering of experiences &mdash; the four Ministers who spoke on the Bill and their various comments. I will deal with their remarks later because most of what they had to say &mdash; I do not mean to say this in any offensive way &mdash; was quite similar.  They emphasised their support in principle but asked many questions about the Bill.  I will deal with them later.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole was quite rightly concerned about the costings on this.  I will deal later with some of the figures, not ones that I produced but which the Minister for Labour produced about the possible costs.  Senator Howard made the very interesting comment that the voluntary section in this whole area would have to be protected and not be swamped by a fairly overwhelming State involvement. Given the nature of State involvement I do not think there is any fear of the voluntary organisations being overwhelmed or swamped in the near future.  I suppose this is as good a time as any for me to compliment the Government on the couple of initiatives they have taken in the area of housing recently, particularly the new scheme of assistance for voluntary organisations, which is very welcome.  I suggest that the ceiling of £16,000 is a little bit too low for many voluntary organisations; I do not think it would cost a lot more money to give a ceiling which would make the objectives of the Government's provisions more feasible.</P>
    <P>Senator John Robb gave us a very colourful and moving account of his experience of the problem of homelessness.  We had the experience all through this debate of Senators moving from expressions of great compassion to stories and indeed perceptions of the homeless which seemed almost to give the lie to the compassion they were displaying in the way they generally addressed the problem. They attributed attitudes to homeless people, to their families and to their children, which in many cases were close to being subhuman.  The idea of people putting their children out on the side of <Col N="2043" /> the road in order to improve their housing is quite blatantly offensive to many people I know.  I do not know of many people who are prepared to take the risk of sleeping on the side of the road unless they have a serious drink or other problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner repeated the Minister's assertion that the Bill was so defective as to be unworkable.  A number of such assertions were made.  Senator Fitzsimons supported the Bill in principle.  He was a bit offended about some remarks I made about Meath County Council.  I would point out that I simply quoted the results of a written communication received by somebody else from Meath County Council.  Senator Bulbulia placed great emphasis on the provision of hostels.  I would like to make it perfectly clear that a hostel is not, cannot and will never be a home no matter how brightly lit, how well provided, attractive, modern or up to date it is.  A hostel lacks certain characteristics.  There was quite an important court case in Britain in which it was asserted, in terms of an interpretation of the Homeless Persons Act in Britain, that a hostel could never be interpretated as a home and that anybody living in a hostel or night shelter was by definition homeless.  While I fully agree that hostels should be bright, cheery, comfortable, warm and welcoming places, they should not be and should never be seen to be an alternative to a home.  They are not a home.  They are shelter from the night, from the cold and from the elements, but they are not homes.  There is a very fundamental difference involved.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness was, as I have come to expect, very positive and very supportive of the Bill.  Senator Deenihan raised the very important question of youth homelessness.  When we debated the Costello report on services for young people the Minister of State responsible, Deputy George Birmingham, referred to the issue of young homelessness and promised there and then to confront the problem head on.  I await the confrontation with some interest.  So far I have not <Col N="2044" /> seen any signs of it.  The problem of homeless young people as distinct from the problem of homeless children, which is a separate issue, is an increasing problem and one that needs to be dealt with firmly and creatively.  It is not the same as the problem of homeless middle aged and older people.  We are talking about the category of young people aged between 18 and 30 years.  Whether some Senators like it or not there are many homeless young people.  They are homeless largely because of the extraordinary non-integration of various areas of the State services.  For example, there is the inadequacy of the supplementary welfare rent allowance provisions; the fact that a young unemployed person living at home in many circumstances does not qualify for unemployment assistance, or for very little, and, as Senator Lanigan mentioned, is often pressurised into leaving home in order to qualify for unemployment assistance, and then discovers that unemployment assistance is not enough to rent any sort of accommodation in the private sector.  He goes looking for a rent allowance and discovers an unwilling, unsympathetic or in some cases uninterested community welfare officer who begrudingly gives the official maximum which is £5 and forgets to tell him that it simply takes a telephone call to the Department of Social Welfare to increase that allowance to £15 or £20.  Therefore, a category of young homelessness is created with a series of consequential problems for Irish society caused by homelessness.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris said that it is difficult to come to grips with the core of the Bill and that there was, as a number of Senators have said, the question of how to give priorities to some groups without pushing other groups further down the list.  A number of questions can be asked about that, many of which relate to whether our present provision for housing, given the fundamental role of housing in alleviating a whole range of social problems, is adequate.  Decent housing is a provision which can alleviate a number of social problems from marital breakdown through drink and drug-related <Col N="2045" /> problems to problems of crime etc. Therefore, if you are to become involved and if there is a problem about priorities, it needs to be addressed in the context of whether we are spending enough money on housing generally as a people and whether we have really our national priorities right.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris and a number of other Senators raised the question of whether families would be refused priority, and the mobile nature of many homeless people.  Later I will refer to some British statistics on that matter.  A number of Senators, including Senator Ferris, identified the important fact that there is almost a difference in kind between rural homelessness and urban homelessness, that two different kinds of people are very often involved and that there is a new and growing problem of urban homelessness, not just in this country but in Western Europe and particularly, scandalously so, in North America where the number of homeless is estimated to be a million people.  Even with a far more restricted definition of the term than that contained in my Bill, there are estimated to be a million homeless people in the US, most of them a product of the present benevolent administration's policies.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris promised last May that the Government legislation was pretty imminent.  That was his best information then.  I do not blame either Senator Ferris or Senator Dooge for their promises about Government legislation or for their understanding.  I know they reported what was promised to them.  The thing about which I agree with Senator O'Leary most was, of course, his castigation of the Government's delays.  It was a very painful experience.  Senator Ferris, generally speaking, referred to the defects of the Bill as identified by various Ministers.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan mentioned Cork.  I think I am quoting him correctly as follows: &ldquo;I am reliably informed that any person who seeks long term accommodation and is investigated will be provided with accommodation within four to six months in Cork&rdquo;.  Nevertheless, I would be interested to know how many people <Col N="2046" /> under 50 have been accommodated by Cork Corporation if that is the case.  If you define the problem sufficiently precisely by, for instance, imposing a 55 years lower age limit on those who can be accommodated, then possibly it is true. If you define the problem in terms of families you can be restricted further, but the basic question arising in Irish society is of an increasing group of homeless people who are not old in the sense of being over 55 and who are becoming to some extent chronically homeless because of the extraordinarily high rents in the private sector and because very often they are excluded from local authority housing.  Some of them are becoming victims of the most appalling private rented accommodation imaginable.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan raised the issue of why we cannot put people into the private sector and subsidise them.  It is an interesting issue and I will come back to it.  I am not a great enthusiast for privatisation but it seems to make a great deal of economic sense if you can put somebody into a private flat and pay a subsidy of £15 or £20 a week.  The alternative is to put somebody into local authority accommodation and provide a subsidy of £40 a week, particularly in the category of the single homeless who usually do not need much more than a good, comfortable, properly equipped bedsitter.  Senator Cregan quite legitimately contrasted the supplementary welfare subsidies which are officially at a maximum of £5 a week with the subsidies that are available to people who come under what was once the rent controlled sector where the subsidies can be as high as £30 a week.  One of the anomalies is that because of yet a further constitutional assertion of the vast rights of private property in the State, one sector gets subsidies of up to £30 a week and many other sectors are limited to a maximum of £5 a week.  It is quite extraordinary.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald complimented the Minister of State on the progress that had been made.  That was in December 1984. I wonder if Senator McDonald will still be handing out compliments to the Minister <Col N="2047" /> of State when we are into July 1985 and no further progress is reported.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald raised a characteristically Irish problem regarding a very important document, the report of the <i>ad hoc</i> committe on homelessness, which one would have thought would have been almost compulsory reading for everybody speaking in this debate.  He found it almost impossible to get his hands on a copy and initially had to rely on my copy which I lent to him, and then after a two months delay the Department of Health finally surfaced with a copy of the report. It seems still that the report, which contains policy recommendations for local authorities and health boards, is virtually unavailable and very difficult to access.  I do not know if there is even a copy in the Library of the House.  It is quite extraordinary because this is quite a good report.  It is very conservative, very cautious.  It reflects the preoccupations of its authors who are mostly administrators and public servants working in the area and it is understandable that they would be very cautious in their proposals. Nevertheless, it represents a clear analysis of some of the problems and a clear attempt to respond to them.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald also raised the question of the private rented sector and what could be done in that area, first of all, to protect those who depend on it and also to deal with the problems of people who are homeless and how they could be related to the private rented sector.  He asserted that the Eastern Health Board provide considerable subsidies to hostels in Dublin.  The only one I know about is the Dublin Simon Community who get less than 3 per cent of their running expenses from the EHB.  There may be some hostels which get more from Bruce Springsteen than they get from the State but there may be other hostels which may be more generously subsidised.</P>
    <P>I liked very much, when I read if I did not hear it, Senator McGonagle's speech which reflected his experience in local administration in Northern Ireland.  He made a point which is the best reply I can give to a number of criticisms.  It was that <Col N="2048" /> anybody who is homeless must be treated as being in the category of an emergency because of the damage that homelessness can do and does to people, and if people who are homeless are in the category of emergencies then they should have the right to immediate accommodation.  I emphasise that accommodation is not necessarily, exclusively or primarily local authority accommodation.  It is simply a question of the right speedily to accommodation of a reasonable standard.  It does not have to be a local authority flat or a local authority house.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan, understandably given that he is the Opposition Leader here, addressed himself to what he saw as the humbug of discussing a Bill which would never be passed and the humbug about the Government apparently using this debate to postpone any action on their own part.  He mentioned something I mentioned already, which is the dreadful position of young people under the social welfare code which virtually pressurises many of them to become close to homeless in order to qualify for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I liked Senator Harte's and Senator John Browne's remarks.  I have already referred to things that hurt Senator Browne.  I am glad that he acknowledges the question of homelessness as a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>For Senator O'Leary's information, I regard him as part of that class in Irish society who benefit from the way society is organised in terms of having access to wealth and to power as distinct from that class in society who have access to neither.  Basically Irish society, and indeed the Houses of the Oireachtas, operate to look after the interests of those who have wealth and power.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan will continue anyway.  I expressed my view.  We can discuss it perhaps later, publicly or privately.  Senator O'Leary said that the Bill was appalling nonsense and he used the words &ldquo;cloud cuckooland&rdquo;.  He seemed to think that the Bill would give a statutory right to virtually everyone to be housed.  I do not know what Bill he was reading because he definitely was not reading mine.  There are a number of provisions in the Bill, but the one which has been so often ignored, both by Senator O'Leary and by three Ministers, is the reference to people whose means are inadequate to provide such accommodation for themselves.  I cannot make it clearer than that.  There is not as it stands an obligation on local authorities to use income as a measure of priority for housing. There is not an absolute requirement on local authorities to have a means test for the provision of local authority housing. My Bill specifically suggests that there should be a means test for local authority housing.  The means of the individual must be inadequate to provide such accommodation for himself.  It cannot be any clearer than that.  If people can afford to provide accommodation for <Col N="2050" /> themselves they are not covered by the provisions of this Bill.  That was quite clear from the beginning in my mind and it is still quite clear.  I am sorry that people went on to read sections 4, 5 and others without reading section 3 properly and understanding that the basic obligation to provide housing or accommodation for people who are homeless is subject to the very important qualification that their means must not be sufficient.</P>
      <P>That immediately gets away from Senator O'Leary's rather sweeping assertions. The Senator said that the Bill gives a person a house automatically.  I emphasise again that it does make it obligatory on the local authority to provide people with &ldquo;accommodation of a reasonable standard&rdquo;.  That need not necessarily, exclusively or primarily be a local authority house.  It is accommodation.  It might be no more than an arrangement a local authority would have with a certain number of reputable landlords whereby a number of rented dwellings would be available to deal with this problem at a fixed rent, a proportion of which would be subsidised by the local authority.  The basic obligation here is to provide accommodation. There are various ways of doing it.</P>
      <P>I have had discussions with a number of people from areas of expertise like An Foras Forbartha who have made the point that because this country has a housing problem people assume that to solve that problem we must have a building programme.  An enormous amount of work could be done in providing people with homes and accommodation without building more but by making sure that existing stock is used efficiently and properly. The most obvious step, and one which has been taken by this Government, is the encouragement to local authority tenants to buy their own houses using the £5,000 grant.  It is a provision that I welcome enthusiastically and I compliment them on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot more that can be done. There is the whole area of rentals in the private rented sector and the fact that people cannot get access to private rented accommodation &mdash; not so much because <Col N="2051" /> of the rent but because of a tradition that has built up that one has to pay four weeks rent in advance, which can amount to £200.  Often a £100 deposit has to be paid to the Electricity Supply Board or the gas company.  This may result in someone who is unemployed or is on long term welfare of one form or another &mdash; if they are single, getting £30 or £40 a week; if they are a married couple, maybe £60 or £70 &mdash; having to produce £200 or possibly £250 in order to get access to private rented accommodation. That is not an insuperable hurdle.  It is not an impossible hurdle for a local authority to deal with, but it is impossible for somebody on £30 or £40 a week. At present the way the supplementary welfare service operates makes it almost impossible for people like that to get that type of support.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of thing I am thinking about in terms of dealing with the problem of homelessness &mdash; making provision to ensure that if somebody is homeless such obstacles are taken out of the way and he is provided by right with the means to get access to accommodation of a reasonable standard, which need not necessarily be local authority housing. The right should be that people should not have to live on the streets, having only the option of living in hostels.  Hostels are not homes.  Hostels break up families; hostels break up people.  People are damaged by living in hostels.  I do not want to go into a long, emotional speech about it, but I have seen too many people too badly damaged by hostels to want to hear people talking about hostels as a solution to problems.</P>
    <P>It is accepted by all of us that there are some people who need support and who would not want to live in local authority housing, just as there are many members of the travelling community who do not want to be settled.  We have to accept that.  There are people in hostels and night shelters who cannot ever be expected to support themselves.  That does not get us away from the issue that hostels are not homes.  They may be the only thing that some people can handle, <Col N="2052" /> but they are not homes.  They are different from homes.</P>
    <P>If we are to deal with the problem of the homeless they have to have somewhere to go.  Hostels are not the solution. The solution is decent accommodation. In order to ensure that their priorities and their needs are not squeezed out by the much more vocal demands of the large groups who are in need of local authority housing, they have to be given statutory protection.  I have no great objection &mdash; in spite of what Senator O'Leary might think &mdash; to some qualification which defines the local authorities' obligations in some more precise terms, but I have an absolute aversion to leaving it to the discretion of local authorities to deal with the homeless people as they see fit.  I have watched for too long how local authorities deal with many marginal groups as they see fit.  The way they see fit is long-fingering, age qualifications, the hint that because one is single one might as well forget about it, because they have no provision for single people. They expect that by about 2050 they might have dealt with the backlog of other groups and then they could begin to talk about the single homeless under 55.  That is assuming that the only housing function that local authorities will have is to provide local authority housing.  There are a number of other ways of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary quite rightly identified the British Bill as, first of all, having a definition of being homeless, then imposing a statutory obligation to make inquiries about the reasons, and then about identifying priority groups.  To my recollection his list was correct.  He put great emphasis on the intentionality clause in the British legislation.  I do not know if he is right about the inquiries being so different from the provisions of my Bill.  It is fairly obvious that a local authority would have to satisfy themselves that the person referred to is homeless within the meaning of the Act before they could take action under the legislation. Therefore, the necessary inquiry would have to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Every voluntary organisation in Britain <Col N="2053" /> dealing with the homeless have taken exception to the restricted nature of the priorities listed in the British Homeless Persons Act.  All the bodies &mdash; and they are not all as politically militant or as politically active as me &mdash; agree that the major omission from the British legislation is the category of the single homeless and in particular the one person unit and their exclusion from the priorities and from all other provisions of the Bill except the provision to give advice to people about where they might find housing. Therefore, I would not accept priorities as a way of restricting the application of this Bill.  I am prepared to consider with interest, alternative definitions of the responsibilities of local authorities but it must be made clear that they have a statutory responsibility towards the homeless which goes well beyond advice, assistance and so on and reaches into the area of provision.</P>
    <P>Various people, particularly local authority members, have talked at length about the problems of the wording of the Bill.  That need not necessarily be the only way to word it but it must be a statutory responsibility to make provision for people who are homeless.  The definition of homeless must be sufficiently generous to exclude any question of hostels being the provisions; it must be decent accommodation of a reasonable standard.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary raised the question of whether a person, as the Bill stands, who is homeless in Dublin could apply to Kerry County Council for accommodation. He may well have a point.  I doubt if it is as fundamental a defect in the Bill as he made it out to be.  It is an issue which could be dealt with fairly simply. Nevertheless, I am not enthusiastic about strict residency, particularly of the two year variety qualifications, for people to be provided with accommodation because they are homeless.  However, it would be easy to write into the Bill &ldquo;a person living in the area of jurisdiction of a housing authority&rdquo; if that objection of Senator O'Leary has validity.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary then went on to an objection which I found very offensive, <Col N="2054" /> that people could leave and return and leave and return.  The vast majority of the homeless people that I know and I am sure Senator O'Leary knows want a home.  The last thing any of them will consider is leaving that home and looking for another.  There are exceptions and I can give the figures of the Glasgow authorities who took hundreds of people out of hospital who had been there all their lives, and put them into local authority houses.  They did not all leave and cause the problems to which Senator O'Leary referred.  Homeless people have the same needs, the same feelings and the same values that we have and one of the most fundamental feelings is the need for a home.  If a home is provided before people are damaged beyond repair or beyond cure by their homelessness they will be happy to have a home.  The evidence is overwhelming in that regard from my experience.  One can always pick up ludicrous and extreme possibilities and say that these make the whole thing impossible.  If legislation were to be drafted in terms that deal with ludicrous extreme possibilities, an enormous list of excuses could be provided for individuals and local authorities who may be unwilling to interpret the spirit of legislation generously.  If exclusion clauses are provided for all the possible ludicrous exceptions, then people will have an enormous obstacle race to go through before they qualify under any legislation to be dealt with as homeless.  I do not think the sort of scenario Senator O'Leary talks about is the least bit likely or realistic any more than I believe that people will make themselves deliberately homeless in order to jump the queue.  I do not know anybody in this House who would ever consider putting their children on the side of the road to achieve some improvement in their living standards.  Yet we assume apparently that people will do this if they happen to be in this sub-group of the homeless or those in need of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>It is true and has been asserted that many people use and get the medical profession to help them to abuse the whole process of medical certification in <Col N="2055" /> order to qualify for local authority housing. There is a fundamental difference between getting a doctor to certify that one has a medical need to housing and putting oneself on the side of the road either temporarily or permanently in the hope of being accommodated.  One difference is that the first course does not do any harm to oneself and the other fundamentally threatens one's own wellbeing and welfare.</P>
    <P>As regards the clause &ldquo;threatened with homelessness&rdquo; it would be ludicrous to talk about making provision for the homeless and not to make provision for people who are likely to become homeless, to omit that and to wait until they are out on the street before they qualified. We can argue forever about whether the wording is sufficiently restrictive and elaborate.  One could elaborate on a series of cases, people who are threatened with eviction or bona fides with eviction and so on.  That is not the issue.</P>
    <P>To suggest that provisions cannot be made for people who are threatened with homelessness in legislation to deal with the problem of homelessness is ludicrous in the extreme.  It means one is saying that people must suffer this appalling deprivation of being left on the side of the road or having their families divided as they live in hostels before they can qualify for immediate concern by local authorities.  That is not the issue.  The issue is not whether my wording &ldquo;threatened with homelessness&rdquo; is precisely correct and sufficiently closely written to meet some of the circumstances about which prople worry.  The issue is that it would be ludicrous to talk about dealing with the problem of homelessness and not to make provision to try to avert it in a sane, organised and rational manner within the legislation.  Some provision to prevent people who are about to become homeless going through that experience will have to be contained in any sort of compassionate legislation to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I have no idea where Senator O'Leary <Col N="2056" /> gets the idea that people should be examined as to whether they are responsible for their homelessness.  I have not met many people in the last 14 years who were homeless through their own fault. They are homeless because of circumstances of one kind or another.  It is not possible to say with any certainty that this person is homeless through his own fault, through some other person's fault or through circumstances beyond his control &mdash; there are so many circumstances involved in people's lives.  People do not choose to be homeless, to live in hostels or on the side of the road.  They are forced into that sometimes by personal circumstances like a drink problem.  Is an alcoholic homeless through his own fault? I do not think so although some people do.</P>
    <P>That is why I referred to one category which already has priority with local authorities, single mothers.  If an unmarried girl is expecting a child do we now have to cross-question her as to whether it is her own fault that she is pregnant? We do not.  Single mothers are entitled to compassion and concern irrespective of the circumstances which brought them there.  It is similarly true of people who are homeless.  Homelessness is a most dreadful experience.  It damages people in every dimension of human life.  It damages themselves, their families, their self respect, their health and their emotional and mental stability.  Therefore, it is sufficiently serious to merit intervention without getting involved in whether people did it deliberately, through their own fault or were 51 per cent or 49 per cent responsible.  I do not think it is an issue and it should not be pursued.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Senator O'Leary's remark that he was in favour of the principle of the Bill.  He did not explain which principle he was in favour of, because as far as I can see, he was against all the principles of the Bill that I would identify. I thought he might add to our interest this evening by calling for a vote on Second Stage, but apparently he will not.  I thank him nevertheless for the intensity of his contribution.  It livened up my afternoon <Col N="2057" /> enormously.  Some of his earlier points had validity, but I think a number of the others were based on a misunderstanding of what fundamentally people want from life.</P>
    <P>I covered many of the objections Senators raised.  In particular I want to look at the areas the Ministers mentioned.  I feel very flattered that I have had four Ministers speaking on this Bill.  Whether that has to do with the delays or with the level of ministerial interest in the issue of homelessness I am not sure.  Most of them said the same thing, because I presume they were all reflecting the official position. They identified a number of areas, some of which I have dealt with, but they all took exception to the statutory duty. I think they misinterpreted it; they extended it beyond the clear provisions of the Bill.  Many, although the Minister of State, Deputy O'Brien, did not mention this, seemed entirely to miss the point that people's means are referred to before they can qualify.  As regards the form of words for a statutory duty, that is not the issue.  The issue is the absolute need to ensure the nobody in our society should be homeless because of a lack of official provision.  There is no argument, even in terms of limitations of resources or in terms of overall policy, to justify anybody having to be on the side of the road because he or she cannot afford to provide accommodation for himself or herself.</P>
    <P>The second area that bothered Ministers was the breadth of the definition of &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo;.  I do not know how people want to define the homeless.  The Minister for Labour's definition of homelessness is much broader.  I do not have the Seanad Official Report so I cannot give the precise reference but he said that many families who are on local authority waiting lists will come within the terms of this Bill.  He said that, for example, a family that is vulnerable as a result of living in unfit accommodation or unhealthy or overcrowded conditions could well be covered.  This was the first ministerial contribution and he emphasised vulnerability.  I have no idea why he <Col N="2058" /> came to that conclusion because section 4 says:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be regarded as homeless and in need of accommodation when the housing authority is satisfied that</P>
    <P>(a) he or any perons who might reasonable be expected to reside with him</P>
    <P>(i) has no accommodation and is vulnerable as a result of old age, mental illness,...</P>
    <P>That is the reference to being vulnerable: it is somebody who has no accommodation and is vulnerable.  It is quite extraordinary to have a Minister coming here with a script written by his officials in which it appears section 4 was totally misunderstood by him.  I never intended to put in something as broad as vulnerability as a definition of homelessness.  I said people who had no accommodation and were vulnerable.  I never suggested, and would never intend, that the question of vulnerability alone, which is quite a vague term, would ever be regarded as a qualification for local authority housing of one form or another.  It is very disappointing to get that level of response.</P>
    <P>The other point that came up because of the breadth of the definition was that a husband who was barred by a barring order would automatically be entitled to local authority housing.  There are two things there.  First, if a person is barred that should not necessarily exclude him from the provision of housing by the State.  I do not think barring should necessarily equal homelessness.  However unpopular people who are barred from their homes may be with us generally, that is not the same as saying that we want to create yet another problem by making them homeless.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the need for people's means to be inadequate before they would qualify as the Bill stands.  That is a very different interpretation from the one that various Ministers mentioned. Many people have taken exception to the question of being threatened with homelessness.  I have already referred to <Col N="2059" /> it so there is no need to pursue it any further.</P>
    <P>A number of other points came up. The Minister of State, Deputy Pattison, produced some statistics.  I was very interested in one of them.  He mentioned the numbers of people who were housed by local authorities in 1983.  He said that in 1983, local authorities made 363 lettings to homeless persons, or over 4 per cent of all lettings.  I have failed to get, and I have asked for it on a few occasions, a definition of &ldquo;homeless persons&rdquo; as the Department of the Environment defined them in terms of their own statistics.  I know Minister do not like the definition in my Bill but they have produced statistics about the numbers of homeless people they have housed and yet they have not given a definition of what they mean by being homeless.  Have they left it to local authorities to decide what &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; means?  I do not want to reread the entirety of my Second Stage speech but I think I have produced enough evidence to show that local authorities have their own peculiar interpretation of the concept of homelessness. We must get a clear definition of what homelessness means to the Department of the Environment because at present it means whatever each local authority chooses it to mean and we cannot draw any conclusions in regard to it.  I would like to know how the Department of the Environment define &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo;.  Is it people living on the side of the road or what?  If they do not like the definition in my Bill then the least they could do is give their own definition.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already the question of intentional homelessness but I want to refer to some British statistics on this subject.  The most successful housing authority in these islands is in Glasgow. They have done more to accommodate the homeless than virtually any other housing authority.  I had the very interesting experience of watching officials from Glasgow Corporation and officials from Dublin Corporation arguing very bitterly about homeless people, their motives, their values, whether you could trust <Col N="2060" /> them and whether they would cod the system if they got half a chance.  It was very interesting that the officials in Glasgow, a city one would hardly regard as a city of innocence and virtue, could say that the homeless there did not abuse the system, that they did not try to create problems for themselves, or that they did not try to make themselves homeless in order to jump local authority queues. They did not do any of the things we are told are liable to happen if my Bill goes through as it is.  Glasgow Corporation ignore entirely the intentionality clause in the British Homeless Persons Act. They do not use it, they do not implement it and they never implemented it.  They just ignore it completely.  They assert that they have had no problems by using that philosophy and that policy.  When they asserted that they were told by officials from Dublin Corporation that they were quite mad.  Nevertheless, the facts are that they do not use it and they do not have problems.</P>
    <P>If people are really worried about people becoming intentionally homeless, then let us have an amendment to that effect, but the amendment must be drafted in terms that do not allow malevolent local authority officials deliberately to frustrate the intentions of legislation to deal with the homeless. That has been the experience in Britain. It is extraordinary that the percentage of homeless people who have been refused accommodation by local authorities in Britain on the basis of their being intentionally homeless has varied quite&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Harte) Acting Chairman (Mr. Harte)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Harte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind you that the expression &ldquo;malevolent&rdquo; is not acceptable when speaking about officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I happily withdraw the remark.  It was a word that came into my mind.  I am sorry, I withdraw it immediately. Perhaps I can say refused by officials who are less than willing to implement legislation with which they do not agree. In Britain the percentage of people who have been refused accommodation on the basis of being intentionally homeless has <Col N="2061" /> varied from 5 per cent in some local authority areas to 55 per cent in other local authority areas.  I do not believe that you can take one part of Britain and say that all chancers are there and therefore half of them are making themselves deliberately homeless and that in another part of Britain they are very good and only 5 per cent are making themselves deliberately homeless.</P>
      <P>I think what it means is that some local authorities are interpreting the clause of intentionality far more rigidly than others.  I know that one British housing authority had an application from a homeless mother with three children who had left home because her husband was continually beating her and the local authority decided that she was intentionally homeless and, therefore, she was not eligible for housing under the Homeless Persons Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the problem about putting in a clause which refers to people being intentionally homeless.  If it is not precisely written in such terms that it cannot be flexibly interpreted by local authorites you will have those local authorities, who perhaps have a smaller housing problem, interpreting it generously and those who have a larger housing problem will interpret it much less generously.  If somebody wants to produce a reference to intentional homelessness, it must first of all be precisely written to avoid misuse and abuse not by the side who are continuously threatened or accused of being willing to abuse, misuse and queue-jump but by the officials themselves and by housing authorities generally.  They also can deliberately misinterpret legislation. They also can jump queues of their own creation and therefore if you are going to have references to intentionality, they must be written in such a way that the people involved cannot be made victims of individual bureaucratic decisions.  It is interesting, too, that in Britain the rate of refusals of accommodation on the basis of people being intentionally homeless has gone up from year to year as expenditure on housing in Britain has gone down from year to year.  This suggests that the interpretation of being intentionally <Col N="2062" /> homeless depends very much on the money available for the provision of housing.  That does not seem to be a very satisfactory way of dealing with people who are virtually living on the side of the street.</P>
    <P>The only thing that really upset me about Ministers' comments, by and large &mdash; not this Minister but Ministers generally &mdash; was a number of what I thought were almost patronising comments about homelessness and the problems of the homeless and so on.  I find it a bit much to have the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, tell me that he knew more about the problems of individual homeless people than all the organisations that support me and support this Bill because of the needs they have identified, and tell me that in fact many of the people in hospitals are either not covered by this legislation or, indeed, would suffer from it because of the way they would be out-manipulated by other people perhaps more assertive than themselves.  That is a matter on which I can make my own judgment.  I think he is wrong, that he misunderstands the problem considerably.</P>
    <P>I like to quote American statistics because nobody can accuse them, particularly in the present environment, of being of bastion of liberal social policy. A study done by the University of California suggested that:</P>
    <P>... homelessness appears to be a socio-economic condition which may be less the manifestation of individual shortcomings of homeless individuals, and more the result of a troubled economy which is characterised by structural unemployment, deindustrialisation and the lack of low-income housing.</P>
    <P>That is an extract from a survey &ldquo;Who are the Homeless?  An Empirical Assessment&rdquo; by Richard Ropers, Ph.D., and Marjorie Robertson, Ph. D., from the School of Public Health in the University of California, Los Angeles.  That is as good a definition as possible of the real nature of the population or community of the homeless &mdash; far less to do with health and with any inherent faults and far more to do with structures of society. <Col N="2063" /> It is interesting that it comes from the United States.</P>
    <P>Finally, one of the things that everybody in this House has accepted is that the need is obvious.  The <i>ad hoc</i> committee recognised that and made reference to the need for clear legislative provisions to ensure that the homeless were looked after properly.  Other countries have enormous programmes for dealing with the problem of homelessness. What seems to be happening in the United States is that the central Government reduced funding for low income housing &mdash; there has been a 98 per cent reduction in federal provision for housing in the United States in the last six years. The individual states are having to take up the burden according to the policy document from the Human Resources Administration of New York City.  They will in the fiscal year 1985 spend a total of $103 million for operating their programmes for the homeless in New York city and in the next three fiscal years will spend $313 million on providing provisions for the homeless.</P>
    <P>Even if you proportion that figure to Dublin's relative population size and reduce it in terms of our relative wealth, or lack of it, you still end up with a need for a place like Dublin to be spending about £4 million or £5 million a year &mdash; well, £3 million a year &mdash; on accommodation for the homeless in Dublin city. There is nothing like that being spent at present in Dublin city on accommodation for the homeless, that is assuming that because they are wealthier and because they are bigger they spend a lot more money.  We are just not making the provision because we choose not to do so.</P>
    <P>I have about 14 different files here of legislation giving statutory rights to shelter to homeless people in many states in the United States.  There is a statutory obligation on the city of New York to provide shelter for every homeless person and the shelter must be of a standard defined by the courts in terms of space in terms of the quality of accommodation, in terms of privacy, in terms of access to <Col N="2064" /> things like telephones, hot water, washing facilities, etc.  All of this has been defined by the courts in the face of the most extraordinary resistance by the city authorities, but they have had to do it and there is now a statutory right to shelter in New York city and, indeed, in many other areas of the United States.  This is being done in spite of the vehement opposition of the federal authorities.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise again something that I think has been lacking from many Irish housing policies, that housing is not the same as building, housing does not necessarily mean putting people into local authority housing.  There are many other ways of housing, in particular, people who are not in the traditionial family unit.  I am talking in particular about the single homeless.  Some of the things that were said during the debate stigmatised homeless people unnecessarily and unfairly and almost to the point where they seemed to reflect prejudice as much as personal experience on the part of the individuals.  The homeless, as I have said, are victims of society as it is organised.  They are victims, as has been identified in the United States, of the structural changes in the American economy, in the absence of low income housing and in the structural unemployment.</P>
    <P>Too much has been made of the question of cost.  I do not want to be scoring cheap points but it does need to be mentioned that when the Minister, Deputy Quinn, was Minister of State, he put the figure at £20 million a year to house the homeless.  That was ludicrously high. Even looking at his figure, we spent £20 million on renovating the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham, which is a fine and beautiful piece of work.  However, I am not sure that Irish society would necessarily accept that if we are arguing that we have to leave people living on the streets because of cost concerns, we should really do things like that.  Actually we can afford to do both.  That is what I am suggesting we could afford to do, to do both, but until such time as we do the basic job of providing housing for the homeless Irish society will remain unconvinced that we should be doing these <Col N="2065" /> other jobs.  The expenditure of multiple millions of pounds on planning prisons that will never be built is also very difficult to explain to people when they are told that we cannot afford to provide housing for homeless people.  I emphasise again that, in this whole area of people living on the streets, living in bad accommodation the streets, living in bad accommodation and living in the hostels and night shelters homelessness is the basic problem.  The other psychological, psychiatric, medical and physical problems are symptoms of homelessness and not the other way around.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contributions of all the Members.  I have indicated my willingness to listen to a number of serious reservations that Members of the House have had about this Bill and I look forward with great interest to the Minister's promised publication of the Government's Bill.  I think he said it would be within days: does that mean less than a week or within 365 days?  We accept the promise that Minister Birmingham made at the conference on youth homelessness in St. Patrick's, Drumcondra, that the Bill will be published by the end of July.  I look forward to the publication of the Government's Bill.  What happens to my Bill will obviously depend, first, on the goodwill of this House, and also very much on what is in the Government legislation and how it finally emerges from both Houses.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there might be a good case for introducing that Bill in this House since the Members of this House, because of the debate on this Bill, have given a considerable amount of thought to the issue of homelessness and the general problems of housing in the past two years.  Therefore, it would be an appropriate place to introduce it. It would give rise to a very informed debate, not by myself but by many other people who have taken a great interest in this question over the past two years. Therefore, I have pleasure in moving the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Report of Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>On Thursday, 27 June 1985, the following motion was moved by Senator Dooge:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I delivered a considerable part of the main thrust of my contribution on the last occasion on 27 June.  I will resume by making a passing reference to some of the matters I mentioned on that occasion.  It is generally conceded that from a party political point of view this subject is, metaphorically speaking, a hot potato.  I realise that there is a situation where fools rush in where angels fear to tread.  The advice might well be that of the popular song of the Clancy Brothers &ldquo;Whatever you say, say nothing&rdquo;. There is the temptation to be bland, but I believe that the contributions that have been made so far have been very positive and I have no doubt that those to come will be equally positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2067" /> The biggest contribution undoubtedly will be from those who are members of this committee.  Professor Dooge said that in his contribution when he said we would be relying on those members of the Joint Commitee on Marriage Breakdown to make greater contributions so that they could bring into the debate in this House many matters that are not part of the report and which are not available in the public domain.  This widens the debate to a very great extent and it is important that it should be widened to that extent.  I recall that when we dealt with the first report of the Select Committee on Women's Rights it was pointed out that in the Library in this House there were copies of the papers and all the matters that had been heard by the committee. I made inquiries in the Library and reports to this committee do not seem to be available.</P>
    <P>My input will be neither unduly long &mdash; nor of any great consequence.  Senator Dooge also had some interesting things to say about how we should deal with reports of this kind.  When we were dealing with the report <i>Irish Women &mdash; Agenda for Practical Action</i> Senator Dooge thought that there were various ways we could treat it.  We could emphasise different sections or we could take a global look at the whole report.  I would have made some contribution to that motion but to a large extent the two motions are parallel.  By and large, what was treated in one is covered to some extent in the other.  They are major reports.  The one entitled <i>Irish Women &mdash; Agenda for Practical Action</i> has 392 pages: I estimate this runs to about 170,000 words.  It costs £10.50.  The report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown has 176 pages, I estimate about 60,000 words, and it costs £8.50.</P>
    <P>There are many people outside who will be interested in reading those reports but there may be many who could not afford to pay such considerable sums of money for the reports.  I suggest that those reports &mdash; and indeed all reports of committees and joint committes &mdash; be <Col N="2068" /> made available to public libraries at no cost.</P>
    <P>I will deal in my contribution with some aspects of the report.  As I said before, this committee has been termed the &ldquo;divorce committee&rdquo;, for what reason I am not sure because divorce is not in the terms of reference.  These are to consider the protection of marriage and the family life and to examine the problems which follow the breakdown of marriage.  If it were intended that divorce should be specifically considered it should have been added there &ldquo;including consideration of divorce&rdquo; but this was not done.  However, divorce in this context would have to be considered in some depth.  The matter is considered from pages 71 to 91, which amounts to over 16 per cent of the total report.</P>
    <P>Those who have different views on this subject get different labels in the media. Those who are looking for divorce, either campaigning for it or in a marriage that has broken down and where they require divorce are really taking a conservative stance.  If they were radical they would be looking to eliminate marriage altogether, but those people accept the contract of marriage.  People whose marriages have broken down want divorce to get married again in most instances so that by and large they take a conservative stance. Senator Dooge also referred to the structure of the book.  In some ways it could be faulted in this respect but nevertheless the contents of the report are more important than the structure.  This is an important report and, like any matter we are discussing, it is easy to criticise though there are many areas in this where we can criticise.  Overall, the Committee having got 700 written submissions and oral evidence from 24 different people, the report is a major work and one that will be consulted for many years to come. Reports such as this should be available in abbreviated form for the convenience of those who have not time to go through an entire report.</P>
    <P>Any analysis of marriage must be considered primarily from the point of view of the husband and the wife.  There is overwhelming evidence of the beneficial <Col N="2069" /> effect of marriage on men but the opposite applies in the case of women.  It is agreed by sociologists that women start out with an initial advantage which marriage reverses.  I remember reading in one of Harold Robbins' books that a woman changes completely when she gets a ring on her finger, that from being a docile, dependent and obedient person, she becomes independent.  I am sure criticism of this nature could be levelled at men as well but no matter what criticism may be levelled at women, they are by nature designed to fulfil a very difficult role and one with which we must have the greatest sympathy.</P>
    <P>The growth in the rate of marital breakdown reflects the changing norms and values.  In our society marriage is increasingly valued.  More is expected from it.  People want more from a marriage relationship.  Some sociologists go so far as to claim that a rise in the divorce rate may indicate paradoxically a higher rather than a lower standard of marriage in society.  This is something with which we might all agree.</P>
    <P>Another contradiction I see is that some people who are opposed to divorce would welcome an early referendum on the matter.  It is generally conceded that at some stage we will have a referendum and that the longer it is delayed, the more chance there is of success.  I believe that nobody would object to a referendum at the appropriate time and by the appropriate time I do not mean the consideration of party political expediency but at a time when most people would be aware of the benefits of divorce and also of the problems that the introduction of divorce would bring about, and at a time when the Government would be in a position to make a determined, positive step to achieve this purpose.  I do not think there is any point in holding a referendum without a commitment from the Government on those lines.</P>
    <P>In the introductory chapter on page 1, the committee state that the majority of marriages which are contracted in the State are and remain viable and stable. This is something which I would not challenge but it is a very vague statement.  It <Col N="2070" /> may be 51 per cent of marriages that are referred to or it may be a much greater number but in this situation a general statement of this kind is not much use without statistics.  The committee went on to state that much of their deliberations consequently focused on the protection of marriage and family life.  This was precisely in response to their terms of reference.  The committee recognise that the number of people who marry has not increased at the same rate at which the number of persons of marriageable age has increased and has not been matched by the number of people who have married.  The number of marriages taking place has decreased and this, the committee say, gives cause for concern. There are tables on page 132 of the report which give the marriage rates from the years 1971 to 1983.  These show a reduction from 7.4 per 1,000 population in 1971 to 5.5 in 1983.</P>
    <P>Since then, to emphasise the matter further we have the statistics for 1984 and the marriage rate has gone down to 5.2 per 1,000.</P>
    <P>I do not like to introduce religion into this subject except in a broad sense to say that according to Matthew, chapter 19, Jesus condemned divorce.  We are told his disciples said to Him that if this is the way it is between a man and his wife it is better not to marry.  His followers were saying that if marriage imposes such strict obligations and if there is no question of divorce it is better not to marry.  We know what His reply was.  It is strange that almost 2,000 years later there are many people, some of them good and decent Christians, also saying precisely the same thing &mdash; that if marriage has such pitfalls out of which it may not be possible to extricate oneself, is it not better to remain unmarried.  I believe that in marriage the important factor is the contract between two people, commitment for life.</P>
    <P>The committee acknowledged that the present law does not provide adequate protection for those persons whose marriages do not remain viable and this in itself is a threat to marriage.  Some details should be included there as to what precisely <Col N="2071" /> the committee are referring to.  A table of some kind should be included to indicate what the committee considered was desirable and what was possible under the Constitution.  That is what was done in the case of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Building Land, which committee worked precisely within the terms of the Constitution and advanced suggestions that could be implemented within the terms of the Constitution. Having made that statement to which I referred it is a pity there was no followup by way of saying what should and could have been done.  In chapter 2, paragraph 2.9, the committee on marriage breakdown had this to say:</P>
    <P>Submissions received by the committee refer to extra-marital unions which are occurring in the State.  Single persons living together, married people who have separated and are living with single persons or with other separated persons, persons who have had their marriages annulled by the Ecclesiastical Courts and who have &ldquo;remarried&rdquo; within the Church, persons who have obtained divorces abroad which are not recognised by the State and have purported to remarry, are all, in varying degrees, living in extra-legal unions, enjoying only limited legal recognition and protection.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that statistics be furnished here.  We are all aware of those matters even without such submissions having been made.  The important thing is to know the level of the problem in all those areas and without statistics that cannot be ascertained.</P>
    <P>In chapter 3 under the title &ldquo;The Protection of Marriage and Family Life&rdquo; in the introduction there appear the following remarks:</P>
    <P>In addition, in considering how best the State can lead the way towards protecting marriage and family life, the committee is conscious of the disturbing economic and social pressures which add to the interpersonal pressures which can arise in the course of a marriage.  The Committee does not <Col N="2072" /> have the resources to engage in a detailed examination of these pressures and agreed that to do so would require research of a kind not envisaged in the Orders of Reference of the committee....</P>
    <P>I am not too sure whether that is so.  Even if it had been necessary to have a further extension of time, that should have been done.  The committee urges that in-depth studies be undertaken as a matter of urgency by the appropriate bodies.  That is not sufficiently positive; it leaves the matter hanging in the air.  It may be done, but on the other hand it may never be done.  If there had been a suggestion that within a certain timescale something should be done, that would have been more acceptable.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the subject of education in chapter 3 paragraph 3.1.1 the report states:</P>
    <P>Throughout the deliberations of the committee, there was a constant emphasis on the importance of being prepared for marriage.</P>
    <P>We all agree on the importance of education. Later, in paragraph 3.1.4, it states:</P>
    <P>The committee, aware of the constitutional provisions relating to the protection of the family, is of the view that the State has a specific responsibility to promote a system of education for marriage.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anybody who would disagree about the importance of education. But, much as we should like to believe otherwise, education also has a negative effect because many of the people living with these problems are educated people.  Possibly because they are educated, they expect more and are searching for more.  I am not saying that a solution to the problem would be not to educate people &mdash; I am not saying that. I agree wholeheartedly with the views of the committee but there should be consideration given to the fact that education <i>per se</i> will also have negative effects.  In that chapter on education there is a plea for relationships to form an essential part of education in schools. <Col N="2073" /> That is very important.  Our schools should be geared to educate, not just for a job or for marriage, but for life, and to the extent that they do not do so they are a failure.  I believe that there is now general agreement that schools should be of mixed sexes rather than single sex schools.  As has been said before in this House, that suggestion involves some minimal problems, but it is very important in educating for life.  As far as relationships are concerned, I believe that people must be trained to have consideration for others, to make sacrifices.  There is no way that training can achieve any purpose if people are not prepared to be committed, dedicated and make sacrifices.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of &ldquo;Counselling,&rdquo; at paragraph 3.2.5, the report had this to say:</P>
    <P>The Committee is of the opinion that:</P>
    <P>(a)  the State is obliged to ensure that the education system provides a means to educate persons for marriage; and</P>
    <P>(b)  the State is obliged to ensure that there is an easily accessible and effective counselling service available to married persons.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging the proviso that education should be for life it is a mistake to specifically state there that it should be for marriage, although I believe that a counselling service is most important.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appropriate age for marriage nobody would disagree that it is not just a question of puberty, that there must be fitness for marriage.  For example, in religious life, in the religious orders, for a considerable time past I believe there have been strict tests to ascertain whether entrants are mentally and physically fitted for that way of life. Furthermore, on account of such tests, I believe that many seemingly suitable people have been rejected.  I wonder whether such suitability tests should be applied to people intending to marry when perhaps because of some personality trait, some other problems or for one <Col N="2074" /> reason or another some people might be rejected.  I simply pose that question because I believe that maturity is the most important consideration.  In the course of the report it was said that the committee received many submissions which stressed that marriages involving young persons are more likely to break down than marriages between persons of more mature years.  That is a view widely held by social commentators.  Indeed, all the textbooks on sociology in any country come to that conclusion: that the greatest breakdown of marriages occurs in the case of young people.  In chapter 10, &ldquo;Summary of Opinions of Committee&rdquo;, it is said:</P>
    <P>That the minimum age for marriage should be raised from 16 years to 18 years.  Marriage of persons between 16 years and 18 years should be permitted if the prior consent of any guardian or guardians and the prior consent of the court is obtained.  Any marriage of a person under 18 years, without the necessary consent, should be considered null and void.</P>
    <P>That is another conclusion with which I fully agree.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Environmental Factors&rdquo;, chapter 4, is an area in which many questions can be posed.  At 4.3.2 it states:</P>
    <P>The development of birth regulation is increasingly playing a large and important part in the fabric of family life.</P>
    <P>That is an important and very positive statement.  I take it to mean that it is playing an important part for the good of the family situation.  There are many ways we could look at this and indeed we could examine it from the point of view of the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1985, which was introduced here some time ago.  I am quite conscious that in that context it may have a very good effect.  I also believe that it can have a detrimental effect.  I know the perception of sex.  Attitudes towards it have changed.  By and large in the Roman Catholic Church there has been no change from the overall view <Col N="2075" /> that sex outside of marriage is wrong and if there are changes I would like to have seen them referred to in this report.  One could make the case, for example, that the Health (Family Planning) Act could encourage promiscuity because sex between consenting unmarried couples is not unlawful and the the availability of artificial contraceptives will inhibit people less and lead to promiscuity and that at the lowest level marriage is a licence for sexual indulgence.  Sex is as important to marriage as a wheel is to the motor car.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the development of birth regulation is playing an increasingly important part in family life but I would have liked to have seen that developed further.  There are always a choice regarding the size of the family.  Even hardened socialists agree that love plays a very important part in marriage and love is very difficult to define.  Corinthians, chapter 13 says:</P>
    <P>Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous, or conceited, or proud; love is not ill-mannered, or selfish or irritable; love does not keep a record of wrongs; love is not happy with evil, but is happy with the truth.  Love never gives up: its faith, hope, and patience never fail. Love is eternal.</P>
    <P>In Ephesians 5 there is a sentence:</P>
    <P>A man who loves his wife loves himself.</P>
    <P>All these things are very important.  Perhaps romantic love is jealous and is a bit selfish but by and large the views expressed are my views of love.  In the old days Father Peyton and his Rosary Crusade pleaded that the family that prays together stays together and I am sure that is so.  I am sure also that in other religions these concepts are very important.  Religion is simply a way to God, and there are many ways.  I recall the love songs and love poems of the Irish.  These played a very big part in life. As a young boy I recall my father singing song after song.  These songs are basically <Col N="2076" /> patriotic songs, rebel songs and songs of love and hope.  When we grew up we had this simple concept that people fell in love, got a job, married and lived happily ever after, but life teaches us that this is not so.  Many educated people have worked to try to have a happy family life but have failed.  I pity them and I would ask is it fair that these people should be left without hope.  Many marriages have also failed because there have been insufficient sacrifice or commitment or communication.  We all have a different concept of happiness and happiness must come into a marriage.</P>
    <P>It is important to have a general notion of the history of marriage in Ireland. Young marriages were a feature of our society.  A paragraph from the <i>Population of Ireland 1750-1845</i>, by K.H. Connell says:</P>
    <P>Marriages, [the rector said] are contracted, in most instances, without any regard to love, affection, or any of the finer feelings, and are concluded between the friends of the young people, without any reference to their choice or judgment; and it frequently happens, that the bride is dragged to the Hymeneal altar, bathed in tears, and compelled to take a companion for life, who is chosen by her parents from prudential motives.  The chief time for marriage is from Christmas until Lent, being the season of the year when people have most leisure for settling such business.</P>
    <P>In Kerry, on Wakefield's authority, &ldquo;the match is frequently settled by the parents, without the knowledge of the intended bride and bridgroom.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That applies to other areas of the country as well.  On page 51 of the same book in relation to young marriages it states:</P>
    <P>Table 17, in Chapter II shows that in 1839 (after some years during which it had become increasingly difficult over much of the country for a couple to find a settlement) 70 per cent of the brides in first marriages in the rural districts were under twenty-six.  That only nine years before, 76.5 per cent <Col N="2077" /> were so young suggests that in the previous half century, when subdivision, the extension of arable and other agencies which we shall discuss in later chapters, provided settlements almost for all who want them, marriage took place even earlier.  There is no dispute in contemporary comment that early marriage was an outstanding feature of Irish social life.</P>
    <P>We know that many young girls of 12 and 13 years of age were married.  There are references to that in all these books.  As far back at 1623, advertisements for Ireland pointed out that the Irish generally, be they ever so poor, married timely or else kept one unmarried and cohabited with her as their reputed wife.</P>
    <P>At present the income tax regulations favour people who are married rather than two people living together.  That is proper.  I do not say that from any moral point of view.  I want to make that clear as there was an objection recently to the concept of morality as far as the State is concerned.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Social Welfare (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1984 which was passed here a few weeks ago, the Minister told us that a married couple fared worse than an unmarried couple. Each of two unmarried people, the Minister told us, living together could be entitled to a personal rate of unemployment assistance, giving them a higher household income than a married couple. This is wrong, not from a moral point of view but from the point of view of encouraging people to live together in a permanent state which is what I regard matrimony to be.  It is wrong that the State seems to be encouraging people to live together unmarried.</P>
    <P>Religion, too, plays an important part and it should not be underestimated.  In a book which was published last week <i>Women &amp; Work in Ireland: A Social Psychological Perspective</i> the analysis and write up was carried out by Dr. Margret Fine-Davis, Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Psychology in Trinity College, Dublin.  I quote a short paragraph from pages 16 and 18:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2078" /> As Table 3 shows, there are meaningful patterns among various attitudes and beliefs.  For example, <i>Religiosity</i> (as measured by frequency of mass attendance and the importance to the respondent of prayer and religion generally) is strongly correlated with a negative <i>Attitude to Maternal Employment.</i> ...as well as to opposition to the Legislation of Contraception and Divorce...  It also tends to be associated &mdash; although more weakly &mdash; to a Traditional Sex-Role Orientation with Perception of Female Inferiority. These relationships are not that surprising, since the Church has reinforced a traditional role for women and has also opposed contraception and divorce.  Nevertheless, the findings illustrate the strong influence the Church has on social attitudes and thus indirectly on social policy.</P>
    <P>It is important to take that into consideration.</P>
    <P>On page 25 it is stated that:</P>
    <P>Another important factor is the impact of Catholicism with its emphasis on the permanency of the marriage bond.</P>
    <P>There are other points in that marvellous book which I could quote.  It is a pity it took so long to have it published.  It is not so much the actual doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church or any particular religion that matter but the influence of religious beliefs.  In many instances, those beliefs and values are declining.  I stated that on the last occasion that industrialisation plays a very important part in marriage because, by and large, in countries which are heavily industrialised there is a high percentage of divorce.  In this country many people might think that the reason for the comparatively low marriage breakdown rate is really not attributable to religion but to the fact that we do not have heavy industrialisation.</P>
    <P>On page 26 of the report there are two short paragraphs which refer to alcohol, and Professor Dooge commented on those.  As far as I can recall he said he <Col N="2079" /> was mildly critical of the conclusion of the committee in this respect.  He stated at column 1146 of the Official Report of 27 June:</P>
    <P>It appears that the committee attempted to say here that drunkenness and alcholism do not always lead to marriage breakdown and when they do, they are not the single determining factor but in trying to emphasise that point they have gone a little too far the other way.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Professor Dooge.  I totally reject the conclusions here as being weak, insipid and not related to reality.  Alcholism is the curse of this country.  I have said that before.  I am not against drink.  I enjoy a drink myself.  I know marriages which have broken down as a result of alcholism.  There are very few marriages where a husband, for example, can afford to go out and enjoy himself drinking.  I have seen homes broken up through alcohol.  I have see careers ruined.  I am sure other Members of the House could recall similar instances. I know many cases where alcohol has not caused complete marital breakdown simply because the wife was content to put up with anything.  Far too much money is spent on alcohol.  Young people at discos seemingly cannot enjoy them without alcohol.  Treatment of the subject of alcohol would have merited a chapter on its own.  I believe that the committee have failed to come to grips with reality in relation to alcohol.  They have pinpointed nothing except in a general sense.  People win in an event and they must celebrate with alcohol; if they lose they have to drown their sorrows in alcohol.  Song and story tell us of the benefits and wonders of alcohol, about the &ldquo;bould Thady Quill&rdquo; type of person.  The bould Thady Quill may indeed be worth writing a song about, but the life of many a wife was ruined by that type of individual through drink, and there are no songs and poems about that.  I have said previously in this House that I believe that, generally speaking, alcohol cures no problems but creates many including marriage breakdown. <Col N="2080" /> I do not agree with the conclusions of the committee on this.  It seems that with regard to alcohol in particular people are not prepared to make a sacrifice.  I emphasise that I am not trying to encourage people to become total abstinence pioneers but I believe that people who control their drinking and do not over-indulge are bordering on the patriotic.  I have had many requests from different groups of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, as I am sure other Senators have, urging the Government not to proceed with the extension of the opening hours.  I support that plea because in the context of what we are considering here it can only do untold harm.</P>
    <P>Other areas could have been included in the chapter on marriage breakdown. It does not go sufficiently into the problem of unemployment.  That must be a major factor because I am led to understand by people who work on housing schemes that first indication is that they notice quite a number of houses being put up for sale over a period of time.  The first indication is that maybe a husband and wife are working and have two cars at the house.  Suddenly there is only one car and very shortly the other car is gone and then the sign is up that the house is for sale.  In such a situation people are working to pay a mortgage which can be anything from £50 per week; indeed, most mortgages would be £100 plus per week.  That must be a very serious problem, and I would have liked the committee to go further into it. Remember the novel <i>Love on the Dole.</i> A programme recently on television showed the grave and serious problems of people on the dole, and that situation could have been highlighted in the report.</P>
    <P>The problem of boredom arises in many instances and can also be very serious.  There is the matter of job satisfaction. How many people achieve job satisfaction?  It is worth pointing out that the publication <i>Women and Work in Ireland</i> which I have mentioned seems to suggest that many women would welcome part time employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2081" /> What is the problem regarding gambling in the area of marriage breakdown? I would have liked the committee to go into this subject but they did not do so. Let me say that on 9 July in this House the Minister when he spoke on Second Stage of the Designated Investment Funds Bill stated, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I believe that an unnecessary mystique has been cultivated, perhaps intentionally, about share ownership.  I believe also that most people, given a little time and with the right type of information, could develop the expertise to buy and sell shares sensibly and profitably.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I know nothing about stocks and shares, but I believe that this is a gamble.  It seems strange to me to encourage gambling in this House because I know, as I am sure many Members in this House know, of many instances where homes have been broken and houses and land had to be sold because of gambling.  We know of the numbers who attend horse racing.  We hear of the colossal sums gambled at small meetings.  A State lottery is to commence. Should money be spent in this way?  I am not pleading for the elimination of gambling.  I am not opposed to enjoyment but I am opposed to money being spent on gambling which should not be so spent and I believe that is what happens.</P>
    <P>The committee did not go into the problem of housing as far as I can see. In what way is this related to marriage breakdown problems?  I know of one case where housing was the cause of the breakdown in marriage.  What about the good time type of individual?  To what extent is he or she a problem in marriage?  In the old days we read about the importance of the mother in the home and with regard to priests it was stated that the best seminary in the world was an Irish mother's knee.  That may well have been so, but many sons have been spoiled by their mothers perhaps to the extent that they are not able to maintain a proper marriage. <Col N="2082" /> The committee should have considered those matters.</P>
    <P>To what extent has progress been the cause of marital breakdown?  We know that in the old days people married very young, in their early teens and some times even before that, and there is no great record of marital breakdown at that time. In primitive societies people marry young for protection.  Therefore, progress to my way of thinking is a factor which could have been taken into account by the committee.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned people living on low incomes such as the dole and the poverty line.  That is a problem, but it seems that affluence must be a problem also as these problems have increased as we have become better off.  Has equality for women been a problem?  I am totally committed to equality for women.  Many women are prepared to take life as they meet it and they are not treated very well. Equality is their right but if they have to forego work in order to achieve what they want that work should be taken up by the men.  To what extent is unreasonable expectation a problem?  The most important quality in life is common sense, but it is something we do not have in abundance.</P>
    <P>I would strongly criticise the views on drinking expressed by the religious.  I recall my parish priest condemning from the pulpit people who broke the Sabbath by working in the bog, yet other people were drinking to excess in public houses. The implication seemed to be that the latter were not doing wrong but the former were.</P>
    <P>On page 27 of the report it is stated:</P>
    <P>With an increase in mobility and a greater emphasis on personal autonomy, the concept of exclusive commitment to another person for life may not be as attractive at the present time as it was in the past.  Making personal sacrifices is often thought of as foolish, where once it was thought to be heroic.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be any follow-on from that important statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a submission from &ldquo;Life Education and Research Network&rdquo;, quoted in this report.  I do not claim that the statement was made by the committee, but I believe that such an important statement should have been developed.  It has important consequences in regard to a commitment for life and personal sacrifice.  Lots of personal sacrifices might be considered foolish. The committee should have made some statement in relation to this part of the submission since they felt it worthwhile to reproduce it in their report.  I am not objecting to its inclusion because this must cross the mind of any thinking person who considers the subject.  The committee should have made some response.</P>
      <P>The report also states:</P>
      <P>The Committee recognises that an increasing number of couples are separating ...the Committee acknowledges that there are many thousands of couples who find themselves in a legal limbo &mdash; tied into a legal marriage that in social reality no longer exists.</P>
      <P>That is what sociologists refer to as the &ldquo;empty shell&rdquo; marriage.  These statements would be more important if we had statistics of some kind.  The report further states:</P>
      <P>The absence of any real legal protection for persons involved in second relationships has not deterred people from entering into them.</P>
      <P>Those people who want divorce in order to remarry have their case weakened by the many young people who are living together as a family unit and remain unmarried, although there is no legal impediment to their marriage.  Their partners and offspring are in the same legal limbo, or worse, because of youth and the consequent relationship failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> Nullity is considered in the chapter on legal remedies, but I will not go into the matter in any detail.  I agree that nullity would not be considered an adequate or suitable substitute for divorce.  Nevertheless, a person getting married presumes in the partner a normal mental and psychological development and is entitled to do so.  In the Roman Catholic Church this point is taken into consideration when there is a question of an annulment. While it is specifically stated that those who want divorce would not be satisfied with the extension of nullity, it appears to me that this is something which should be given serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Page 49 of the report states:</P>
    <P>A matrimonial breakdown is the failure of a relationship between spouses. Both spouses are responsible to various degrees.</P>
    <P>I would question whether that is always the case.  I am sure that in most instances a certain amount of blame could be attributed to each of the partners.  There are situations where one spouse would be blameless, although it is difficult to know the full details.  Where one of the spouses always submits, there is no question of marriage breakdown.  But that is not happiness nor what people expect or want in marriage.  Further on, page 49 deals with the legal remedies.  Senator Dooge paid tribute to the committee for listing those legal remedies and I am not going to disagree with him but at the same time it seems that they are close to the reasons in some countries that would be considered cause for divorce.  Mental cruelty should have been included in the list on page 50. The report states that the interests of the children should be paramount during their minority, and I agree with this.  In a marriage the children should come first.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to barring orders and it has been stated that there is crudity in that regard and that refinement is necessary. When a marriage breaks down, where the wife is the offender, the husband who has to leave home is discriminated against.  This should get greater consideration.</P>
    <P>Anyone considering the section on <Col N="2085" /> divorce would have to take into account the sacredness, the history and ethos of marriage but also the 36,000 people whose marriages have broken down. Indeed one report states that the figure could be 70,000 although this is the lowest in Europe.  It has been stated that if divorce is introduced, marriage as a lifelong relationship is legally obsolete but for marriages which have broken down it is factually ended.  It has been suggested that divorce would open the floodgates and cause a multiplication of the problem.  If that is so, there must be people who believe that if so many more problems came up out of the floor boards the problem is much greater than we realise.  The causes of breakdown have been discussed by Members already. They include the decline of the closeknit extended kinship pattern and consequent privatisation of family life, looseknit ties and the social inhibition which results and changing sex division of labour and industrialisation. As I said before the very high divorce rate in other European countries has been attributed to heavy industrialisation. We have been spared that in Ireland and also influenced by religious belief and education.</P>
    <P>We must ask if divorce laws in other countries helped the problem of marital breakdown.  The answer seems to suggest that they did not because, the submission made to the committee by the Family Life Research Centre regarding divorce and the effects on the children stated:</P>
    <P>The average length of marriage before divorce in the US is now 6.6 years which means that very many young children are affected by divorce. In England over 100,000 children were in care in 1981.  One million families are one parent families.  In the USA one out of every three children lives in a one parent home, two out of every five children born in this decade will live in a single parent home for at least part of their lives.  In 1980 18.2 million children under 18 years lived in homes headed by a single parent.  One out of every four children has divorced <Col N="2086" /> parents.  In 1973 there were one million runaway teenagers in the US.</P>
    <P>That submission does not make a case for divorce, it makes one against it.  In coming to a conclusion we should consider the history of marriage in this country, something on the lines of the synopsis in the Dutch catechism.  I know that many people whose marriages have broken down say that historical reasons are irrelevant and mean nothing to them, but history is important and should be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>I have raised the problem of the delay in the processing of applications for unemployment assistance by school leavers and students because many of them find that it is taking up to eight to ten weeks to have their applications processed for unemployment assistance. The economic hardship which this is bringing on themselves and their families is very serious.  A ten week delay on a person's unemployment assistance claim before they receive notification of either payment or disqualification should not be tolerated by the people concerned or their families nor by the Minister of State. Most of the people who are making an application for unemployment assistance are genuinely unemployed and the number of school leavers who have been able to pick up summer jobs this year is very small.  The net result is that their families, who are being forced to keep them, find that the extra financial burden <Col N="2087" /> laid upon them cannot be met from the resources of the family.</P>
      <P>The provision where the income of other members of the family would be taken into account in assessing board and lodgings is, in my opinion, totally irrelevant. In many cases the family budget is already overstretched due to the fact that they may have been providing the necessary funds to keep these young people either at school or at university. It is terrible that university grants are also being assessed against them when it comes to having their means assessed for these purposes.  The fact that some of those students are receiving amounts as low as £2 per week, even though they are genuinely unemployed, in my opinion cannot be tolerated.  There is no way that a family on an ordinary family income, can afford to subsidise an 18-year old whose commitments, socially and otherwise, are much greater than those of a person of 12 or 14 years of age.</P>
      <P>The Department issue nice coloured leaflets.  One of them states that if a person is 18 years or over and wants unemployment assistance, he should apply at his nearest employment exchange or office on the first day of unemployment, otherwise he may lose payment.  That is grand, but as far as those school leavers are concerned, they take it from that that once they apply their applications will be processed reasonably quickly.  Yet, they find it takes anything up to ten weeks to have their applications processed, and sometimes, even after ten weeks, their allowances are as low as £2 to £5.  The assessment taken against them with regard to living at home is wrong because they automatically become a burden on the family who have to provide food, clothing and so on, for them.  Yet, if they were to move out of their own home and into a caravan next door they would not have board or lodging assessed against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will realise, from his constituency work, the number of young people who are seeking this type of assistance to try to maintain themselves rather <Col N="2088" /> than becoming a burden on their families. It is imperative that we provide the necessary staff, if it is a staff problem.  I am told it is mainly a staff problem because the social welfare officers available to do this type of work are already overburdened with the regular work even before the applications of these school-leavers come on their desks.  I am aware of a case in my own constituency where an applicant's file was sent to the social welfare officer on 23 May and as yet the local office has not received a reply.  This is something that cannot be tolerated.  I do not blame the social welfare officer because he has more work to do in a week than is possible.  At present he is doing what was originally the work of two social welfare officers.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to see what can be done to have claims processed within a reasonable time rather than allowing them to drag on and on with the result that many students borrow from other members of their family on the strength of the payments they hope to receive and then they find they do not receive any payment.  This can lead to strained family relations because they are unable to repay the money borrowed. The Minister should be in a position to ask that the files of first time social welfare applicants for unemployment assistance receive priority treatment.  If an investigation to see if an old aged pensioner had increased his capital since he was previously assessed was involved it would be done very quickly, but when young people apply for assistance their applications are delayed.  This leads to a lack of confidence in the system.  If their claims are unattended for two months, no doubt they will become disgruntled with the system.  This can often lead to graver problems and to people becoming involved in crime through a lack of money.  If this unemployment assistance was given to them reasonably quickly it could help to prevent them becoming involved in activities which would not be in the best interests of either themselves or the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also examine the possibility of making an initial payment <Col N="2089" /> immediately they apply if he is not in a position to have their applications processed immediately and to make available a sum of £20 per week to each claimant until such time as the applications are processed.  The reason I say that is that families can no longer afford to carry this burden of an extra adult in the household as well as providing pocket money.  If we are to do anything for these young people and give them some independence in society, it is necessary that this small token sum be paid as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say.  I could go on and on, but no doubt the Minister of State is prepared to examine the position to see what he can have done to have these claims processed more quickly.  I hope he will give us a commitment this evening to have them processed within a given length of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is as well at the outset to outline briefly the procedure which is followed in dealing with applications for unemployment assistance.  First, the person concerned must apply at his local employment exchange for a qualification certificate which is essentially a statement of his means and which he must have in order to determine his entitlement.  The investigation of means is carried out by the local social welfare officer who reports back to the employment exchange. Generally speaking, the employment exchange then refers the papers to headquarters &mdash; section EB 13 &mdash; where a deciding officer determines the level of the person's means.  If the means do not exceed the limit in his case and he fulfils the age and other conditions for receipt of unemployment assistance a qualification certificate is issued for him.  This certificate is sent to the local employment exchange where another deciding officer calculates the weekly amount of unemployment assistance payable to the person.  On his next visit to the employment exchange the person is informed of the amount of means assessed and payment of unemployment assistance at <Col N="2090" /> the rate authorised plus any arrears due commences from that date.</P>
      <P>An applicant for unemployment assistance must be 18 years of age and as school leavers reach this age they may make their application.  A very considerable number of claims are made in the June-July period when school terms end and this can obviously lead to delay in getting claims processed and into payment.  As an illustration of this, the number of new claims received over recent weeks has increased from around 550 in the first week in June to over 1,200 in the week ending 12 July.</P>
      <P>In general, the average length of time normally taken to process applications for unemployment assistance is six to eight weeks, depending on the circumstances and whether the application is straightforward or otherwise.  Because of the large influx of claims at this time of the year, however, the waiting time will inevitably be somewhat longer.  Priority is given at all times to processing fresh claims as opposed to other work and new claims are dealt with as speedily as possible, given the necessity for the means investigations which must be carried out. I should point out also that during the period when an application for unemployment assistance is being processed it is open to people to apply for supplementary welfare allowance where they are in need of immediate financial help.  This would not be the case generally for school leavers who continue to live at home, but it is well to be aware that the scheme is there where it is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The carrying out of the means assessment for unemployment assistance purposes is inevitably a source of some delay and, depending on the particular situation, this delay can be protracted. Where a person already has a qualification certificate arising from an earlier claim it will usually be possible, unless the earlier claim was made a long time previously, to put his claim into payment without the need for a further investigation. Generally speaking, however, a school-leaver would not already have a qualification certificate and his means would have to be investigated.  The extent <Col N="2091" /> of the inquiries which must be made will vary with each case but, for example, in the assessment of the value of board and lodging, which is the most common source of means in the case of school-leavers, it is often necessary to obtain evidence of the parents' income and experience has shown that in many cases investigations are held up for some time awaiting this information.</P>
    <P>The delays which are experienced in dealing with unemployment assistance claims, however, must also be seen in the context of the overall increase in the number of applications for unemployment benefit and assistance during recent years.  Unemployment payments have increased by about 50 per cent since mid-1981 and while some additional staff have been provided it has not been possible to match fully the additional workload because of Government policy in relation to the restriction of numbers in the public service.  This has put a considerable strain on areas such as unemployment assistance which involve means testing.</P>
    <P>Within the constraints under which the Department must work, every effort is made to speed up the process of deciding claims.  In the unemployment payments area an important feature is trying to ensure that claims are dealt with to the greatest extent possible at local level.  The bulk of applications are now decided at headquarters &mdash; a procedure which was designed to ensure that the decisions made would be reasonably consistent and also enable claims to be registered in one central location.  This procedure can, however, in itself cause delays and, in order to avoid this, the policy is to devolve decision-making to local employment exchanges to the greatest possible extent.  Where this has been done it has proved very successful but, unfortunately, staffing constraints serve to limit the speed with which this policy can be implemented.  The movement of papers between local employment exchanges and their branch offices can also be a source of delay and this is also being minimised as far as possible, consistent <Col N="2092" /> with the exchanges being able to exercise sufficient control on claims being dealt with efficiently and being able to know the up to date position on claims at any particular time.</P>
    <P>The fact that the unemployment payments system is a paper based system limits the extent to which radical changes can be made in the administration of the scheme.  In the longer term, computerisation will make significant improvements in the system.  An intensive programme of review and reorganisation has been under way in the Department for some time and is already contributing significantly to efficiency and productivity.  This programme encompasses nearly all of the major areas in the Department but will take several years to complete.  As far as the unemployment payments area specifically is concerned, a modified computer assisted system will shortly be introduced in the biggest Dublin exchanges and this will alleviate the work situation and thereby help to speed up claim processing.  Further developments in this area will be introduced as quickly as possible, subject to the availability of resources for this purpose and the needs of other areas of the Department.</P>
    <P>I have tried to put into perspective the problems which exist in the area of applications for unemployment assistance whether for school-leavers or any other applicants.  As far as school-leavers, in particular, are concerned they have the same right as any other applicants to have their claims dealt with speedily and efficiently.  I am not happy, any more than anybody else is, with the delays which occur, but I am aware of the difficulties and constraints which exist in trying to bring improvements in the situation.  There are particular difficulties at present, arising from the influx of claims from school leavers during recent weeks.  The ability of the Department to absorb this influx quickly has to be seen in the context of the already enormous administrative pressure on the employment exchanges, outdoor inspection staff and the headquarters sections involved in administering the unemployment <Col N="2093" /> payment schemes.  Administrative practices are being adapted as far as possible to cope with the increasing workload and every effort is being made to ensure that applications from any source are dealt with as speedily as resources allow.</P>
    <P>A point was raised by Senator Ellis in relation to a leaflet.  The Senator is aware that this leaflet was issued.  Its purpose was to ensure that all school-leavers would be aware of their entitlements. The leaflet helps to remove some of the mystery surrounding the application process for unemployment assistance.  I would not like the House to get the impression that arrangements could be made to effect immediate payments of unemployment assistance for school-leavers or, indeed, for any other applicants following on their applications and before any investigation as to means was carried out.</P>
    <P>The ideal position would be the abolition of the means test, but that is not <Col N="2094" /> possible, certainly at present.  Similarly, I do not think it would be possible, administratively or any other way, to bring in a scheme whereby immediate payment could be made, because there is a fallback. If an individual is in hardship and in need of urgent assistance there is the other scheme &mdash; the supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; to cater for that eventuality. That does not, as I said, cover the situation where a student is living at home.  However, if the household circumstances are very bad, the parents can qualify for the supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I assure Senators that every effort will continue to be made to process these claims as quickly as possible, having regard to all the difficulties that I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 25 September 1985.</P>
