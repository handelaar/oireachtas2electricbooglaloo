      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 together, 6 and 7, to be taken in that order.  It is proposed to take all Stages of No. 2, the Irish Steel Limited (Amendment) Bill today, but if Senators wish for an opportunity to put down amendments or to consider contributions for the Committee Stage I would suggest that this could be accommodated by taking No. 3 at the conclusion of the Second Stage and when No. 3 is disposed of going back to the Committee Stage of No. 2.  As in the prior part of the debate, Nos. 4 and 5, which both deal with tourism, will be taken together.</P>
      <P>Since this is the last full sitting day of the Seanad for this year I take this opportunity of thanking all Members of the Seanad, the officials of the House, those belonging to the joint staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the press and others who have contributed to the work of this House during the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators may be interested to know that the number of sitting days this year surpassed last year's number of sitting days, which was itself the second highest on record.  While the Seanad, which is precluded from dealing with such matters as Estimates and treaties, does not have <Col N="1072" /> the same workload as the Dáil, nevertheless the Seanad during the past year has shown an eagerness somewhat more than that of the Dáil, since the Seanad sat in more weeks.  The Seanad sat in 32 weeks of this year compared with 27 weeks for the Dáil.  There was an initial reluctance on the part of some Members to meet that frequently.  I, as Leader of the House, thank them for complying and, indeed, for their contributions throughout the year.</P>
    <P>It is interesting also that the Seanad has now a regularity in its business that is quite remarkable.  For a very long time the Seanad met intermittently and its customary method of ending its business was to adjourn <i>sine die</i> with complete uncertainty as to when business would come from the Dáil.  The question of uncertainty in regard to when business comes from the Dáil is not at an end, as we all know from time to time; but the Seanad has managed, partly through the manner in which it is discussing reports of joint committees, to establish the regularity. It is rather interesting that it is over two years since the Seanad adjourned <i>sine die.</i> In what we have done during the past year and in the way we have done it, this House can take some degree of pride. Perhaps we should congratulate ourselves because it is unlikely that anyone else will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with everything the Leader of the House has said.  I am a Member of the Seanad for 24 years, as is Senator Dooge. I do not think we ever had as many sittings as we had this year, especially since last September, because we met two weeks or so before the Dáil met.  There was only one week when we did not sit. The person responsible for this is Senator Dooge.  For years we have been trying to streamline things here in the Seanad, but we did not get anywhere with Fianna Fáil or the Opposition when they were in Government.  People are always trying to find excuses for not attending the Seanad. Ministers are somewhat to blame for that because they often shelve Bills and delay them coming into the Seanad.  Senator <Col N="1073" /> Dooge has rectified all this.  There might be another Leader before next year ends&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot wish Senator Dooge well as far as that is concerned, but he has done a great deal to improve the status of this House.  As Deputy Leader, I have worked extremely well with him.  He was most helpful and courteous to this side of the House.  A week never went by without Senator Dooge ringing me at home to tell me of any slight change in the Order of Business. Every Member on this side of the House will agree with me that Senator Dooge was a very good and courteous leader during his time in that office.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I want to join with the Leader in his compliments to everybody concerned for the record number of sittings involved in the Seanad this year, and to join with him in the tribute to all the staff associated with the running of this House.  I could not speak too highly of them for the manner in which they assist us in trying to ensure that our business is run efficiently, effectively and within the rules.  I pay special tribute in that regard to the Clerk, Mr. Jack Tobin and the Clerk-Assistant, Mr. Ciaran Coughlan who both do their utmost to explain to us how things should be done correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud to see that the House has taken upon itself the importance it deserves.  The amount of legislation it has <Col N="1074" /> initiated is proof positive that this House can play a major role in the area of legislation. I hope that the public will realise that no legislation is complete without the consideration and approval of the Seanad, with some few exceptions.  We have initiated legislation here and we are eager to initiate more legislation.  I call on the Government to note that we could usefully be disposing of important Bills which are printed and left sitting in the Dáil for some time awaiting the Deputies perusal.  All the legislation we have already initiated has passed, unamended, in the other House, which is an indication of the thoroughness which the Members of this House devote to their job as legislators.</P>
    <P>I join with the Leader in his compliments to the other Members of the House.  While I was acting as Deputy Leader in the Leader's absence I found he was an extremely busy man.  I join with Senator Willie Ryan in my personal compliments to the Leader of the House. While he is an extremely busy man, he is also a very courteous man and is easy to get on with in spite of the problems which arise from time to time.  I want to pay tribute to Senator Willie Ryan and his Leader, Senator Lanigan, for the way in which I, when acting as leader, am able to deal with them when difficulties arise and for co-operation which is forthcoming from the Opposition in the smooth running of this House.  That does not take from anybody the right to object or amend or put down motions or whatever is required of an Opposition, which is a very important role in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In dealing with somebody on the other side of the House it is nice to have neighbours &mdash; Senator Willie Ryan is a neighbour of mine &mdash; and to have a friend as Senator Lanigan is.  A special &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to you, a Chathaoirligh, and to your gorgeous Leas-Chathaoirleach, who is also a neighbour of mine: I refer to her as &ldquo;the darling girl from Clare&rdquo;, as I come from Tipperary. She has an extra-special quality that makes Christmas what it is all about &mdash; a season of goodwill.  Christmas will not <Col N="1075" /> mean anything to her, if she has something to say.  She has a genuine commitment to the job she holds.  She is an extra-special person.  I wish a happy Christmas to everybody else in the House.</P>

    <Title>Courts Bill, 1985: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather mysterious wording indicating, that it shall cease to have effect after a certain date.  Perhaps the Minister could give us more information as to why the section was worded in this way and whether there was any particular purpose in appointing a judge for a short period like that and whether there was a particular function for him.  I would also like to have an assurance from the Minister that when this judge is appointed he will have the necessary facilities, because on a number of occasions in recent years the problem in the courts was not a lack of judges but, for one period, a lack of court rooms and in another period a lack of registrars. Whereas appointing an extra judge may be, in its own way, a help in getting the business through, unless these other facilities are available it will not serve any real purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question I would like to put to the Minister is, in estimating the business over the next years and the necessity for an extra judge, and in making this decision, whether the question of juries was in the minds of the Minister and the Department?  Is this on the basis that <Col N="1076" /> juries will not continue to be used or whether juries will be still in existence during that period?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> First, the question of juries was not specifically taken into account but there is advice that trials will be shortened somewhat by a move from juries to a judge making the decision.  It is difficult to quantify that, but it was not taken into account in the calculations here.</P>
      <P>The second point raised was the question of ancillary staff.  These appointments were made with the sanction of the Minister for the Public Service to provide the normal ancillary staff that accompanies either a High Court judge or a Circuit Court judge.  The reason for the curious wording in subsection 1 is that at the moment there is a backlog, especially on the civil side of some of our courts.  It is running at about 10 months in Dundalk, which is the shortest one.  It is 12 months on average, but in Cork there is still a backlog of perhaps 22 months.  The President of the High Court says that during 1986 he expects that backlog to be down to about 18 months.  We are aiming at a situation where we can reduce the waiting period from the time of setdown to the time of hearing to about 10 months right across the country.  We feel it would be virtually impossible to get it below that, because it would not be possible to assess injury on the basis of full medical reports once they have recuperated beyond that point.  Even though we have this backlog, the High Court is dealing with more cases than are actually being set down.  Last year it dealt with an enormous number of cases.  The present complement of judges is adequate to deal with the number of cases being now set down.  If we could clear the backlog then we would not need the extra judge for a very long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are doing a number of other things also.  As I said yesterday, we have provided extra accommodation both in the High Court in the Four Courts in Dublin for jury courts, and also in Cork.  One of the major problems with backlogs was <Col N="1077" /> the lack of accommodation, where the judges could sit rather than the unavailability of judges.  Secondly, I said yesterday we are preparing a Bill to increase the role of the Master of the High Court. That will help somewhat.  We feel that the extra judge will not be necessary as a permanent appointment to complement the existing number of judges.  The reason for fixing 2 April 1987 as the operative date is that a judge is due to retire from the Bench on 3 April, having reached the retirement age, so whoever we appoint after January will obviously continue as a permanent judge.  There will be one person fewer in the complement of judges once we pass 1987.  If I or some other Minister reviewing the situation in 1987 decides that we still need an extra judge there is nothing to stop a Minister coming in and looking for the permission of both Houses to increase the complement of judges again.  There are 14 judges, including the President, at the moment.  This will make their number 15, with the President, up to 2 April 1987. Then it will revert to 14 after that point. It is specifically geared to clear the backlog on the civil side in the High Court.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 2, I mentioned in the Second Stage debate yesterday the question of the number of Circuit Court judges designated for the Cork area.  I can well understand the desire of the President of the Circuit Court to keep maximum flexibility in that regard.  It is a matter of statute that the number of judges allocated to the Dublin area was previously five.  It is being varied to six here as a result of this subsection.  The <Col N="1078" /> same section in the original Act lays down that the number of judges in the Cork area shall be one.  As I pointed out, bearing in mind the population of the Cork area, two judges are proportionately needed in the Cork circuit on a permanent basis.  I wonder would the Minister, in considering section 2, consider increasing the permanent number of Circuit Court judges, either by dividing the circuit or by doing it on the same system as they have in Dublin, by appointing more than one to the individual circuit?  While the help which has been given to the Cork Circuit by appointing from time to time an additional judge is welcome, we must face up to the reality of the situation that in a circuit of that size, consisting as it does of more than 12 per cent of the population of the country, the kind of amendment envisaged in section 2 in respect of the Dublin area is something which would be very worth while in Cork as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court was increased some years ago, and increased very substantially, it was anticipated that this would result in a great deal of the High Court work being transferred to the Circuit Court.  If that anticipation had been realised I think one would expect that today perhaps the Minister would be proposing the appointment of perhaps two or three extra Circuit Court judges and not any extra judge in the High Court. Can the Minister give us any idea in regard to the volume of work in the Circuit Court since the jurisdiction was increased?  Has it had the effect of transferring, as far as one can see, business from the High Court to the Circuit Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a point yesterday in the course of my Second Stage speech that the enactment of section 2 will not in any way alleviate the delays which are occurring in relation to certain types of work on rural circuits.  There are considerable delays in dealing with certain types of work.  I made the point yesterday to the Minister that litigants are forced <Col N="1079" /> back into Circuit Courts four times a year, sometimes for a year and a half and two years, before their cases are brought to hearing.  It would appear to me that section 2 does nothing whatsoever to alleviate that situation.  I would like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied, even with the enactment of section 2, if we will have enough Circuit Court judges to deal with the backlog which exists in some rural areas.  Would he see justification for perhaps appointing another Circuit Court judge or two, purely for the purpose of acting as relief judges for overworked and very hard pressed Circuit Court judges who are unable to finalise their lists?</P>
      <P>The point was made yesterday &mdash; and the point has been made by the Minister in recent months &mdash; about the cost of litigation in this Circuit Court.  I submit to the Minister that one of the reasons for this is that ordinary witnesses and professional witnesses are brought back again and again on many days to Circuit Courts, when they are unsure as to whether their cases will be dealt with or not.  Ultimately, this builds up the costs of the litigant.  I believe that that problem could be cured if a number of relief judges to relieve the permanently-assigned Circuit Court judges were available to deal with this backlog.  I can certainly provide the Minister with evidence in regard to certain parts of the western circuit where cases have been listed for six and seven hearing dates.  That is by no means any fault of the Circuit Court judge who works extremely hard and works, to my mind, unacceptably long hours.  It is the fault of the system which does not give him or make available to him the relief that is necessary to give speedy justice to litigants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> First of all, as Senator O'Leary pointed out, there is particular difficulty in Cork.  There has been an increase in the number of criminal and civil cases of 50 per cent and 35 per cent respectively between 1979 and 1984.  During the legal year 1983-84 and of 1984-85 a second Circuit Court judge <Col N="1080" /> sat in Cork for a total of 64 days and 70 days respectively.  I understand it is the intention of the President of the Circuit Court to do what Senator O'Leary requested and to appoint a second Circuit Court judge permanently to Cork.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Eoin Ryan as to the volume of business, certainly there is evidence of a transfer from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  There are delays in the Circuit Court.  Some of them result from this, but not all of them.  For example, my information tells me that in Dublin there is up to 11 months' delay in the hearing of criminal cases, but that there is not a delay on the civil side in the Circuit Court.  In the Cork situation there are delays there, as I have said, both on the criminal and on the civil side.  In the rest of the country I have been told that there is no significant delay, but the position is being constantly monitored.</P>
      <P>I am not familiar with what Senator Durcan is saying about the western circuit. My information is that there are not delays which can be cured by providing extra judicial manpower.  There may be delays for other reasons, but not directly related to the number of judges.  I am prepared to keep the matter under review.  People should have ready access to court and there should be no undue delays.  If we need to appoint extra Circuit Court judges I will come back again and look for the permission of both Houses to do so.  At the moment I believe that the increases being requested in this Bill should be sufficient to clear the arrears both in the High Court and the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to follow up the point I made in relation to the western circuit, I wish to say that there are delays.  I can furnish the Minister with documentary evidence.  I keep the court lists and I have them for years back.  They prove that cases are actually in the lists five, six and seven times.  It is an entirely unsatisfactory situation so far as litigants are concerned. It is by no means the fault of the judges or the court officers, who work <Col N="1081" /> extremely hard, but it is caused by the fact that there is not sufficient judicial manpower to deal with equity cases, which take a considerable amount of time and of which there are a considerable number in that part of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is not in line with my information.  I accept that there are delays in other circuits. Delays can occur for a variety of reasons and they are not all related to the availability of judges.  My information is that there are not delays occurring elsewhere in the country, apart from Cork and Dublin, which can be directly attributed to lack of judges.  Certainly there are delays.  I made the point previously that there are other ways in which these delays can be shortened.</P>

    <Title>Irish Steel Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1985: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July this year the Government decided to provide up to £6 million to Irish Steel in the period to December 1985 on condition that the company's employees accepted the board's proposals for a rationalisation package to reduce the company's operating costs.  The rationalisation package involved: a pay freeze to the end of 1986; a redundancy scheme which would have the effect of reducing the company's labour costs by at least 10 per cent and the elimination of restrictive practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government deferred a decision until the end of the year on whether to <Col N="1082" /> invest the balance of the £24 million for which the approval of the European Commission had been sought.</P>
    <P>Despite the very obvious difficulties which the rationalisation measures and, in particular the redundancies, posed for the company's employees, I am pleased that they were accepted.  117 redundancies were subsequently identified by the company and nearly all of these have now been effected.  The realism and co-operation displayed by the employees in accepting the measures put forward by the board augur well for the future of the company.  This is not to say that the company's problems have been solved once and for all.  Indeed, one could say that the first major step has been taken. However, in order to ensure its long term future, Irish Steel will have to continue to improve its efficiency and productivity and to reduce its costs.</P>
    <P>Following the acceptance by the workforce of the rationalisation package, the Government invested £6 million in Irish Steel in the period September-November 1985, £1m by way of share capital under the Irish Steel Limited Acts, 1960-1984, and £5 million by way of grant, paid from a Supplementary Estimate passed by Dáil Éireann on 10 July 1985.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is: (i) to increase the authorised share capital of Irish Steel Limited from £120 million to £125 million; (ii) to provide, as a consequence, a similar increase in the value of the shares which the Minister for Finance may take up; (iii) to reduce the limit to which the Minister may guarantee borrowings by Irish Steel from £100 million to £32 million; and (iv) to enable the Minister for Finance to advance up to £18 million to the company from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that under Community rules governing State aid to steel undertakings, no operating or investment aid may be paid after 1985.  I must make it clear that this precludes the guaranteeing by member states of any future borrowings.  There must be no misunderstanding about the position.  After this year Irish Steel will have to operate without any further financial assistance <Col N="1083" /> from the Government.  Accordingly, the statutory limit to which the Minister may guarantee borrowings by Irish Steel will be reduced to bring it into line with existing guaranteed borrowings.  I should explain that £68 million of the £89 million aid package invested in 1984 was used to reduce the company's borrowings.  This accounts for the proposed reduction, from £100 million to £32 million in the level of guaranteed borrowings.</P>
    <P>The additional £18 million will be provided to Irish Steel in the form of an advance from the Central Fund.  Certain conditions are being attached to this advance which could not be done if the investment was by way of additional equity.  For instance, the Exchequer will be able to recoup all or part of these funds in due course.  I should stress that there is no set time for the repayment of the advance and that any demand for repayment will take account of the company's financial position at the time and its ability to make a repayment.  Given the vast investment which the Government has already made in the company, it is only reasonable that Irish Steel should repay part or all of the £18 million to the Exchequer when the company's financial position so permits.  As I indicated to the Dail, the £5 million already paid to Irish Steel under the Supplementary Estimate will be converted into share capital following the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The additional £18 million will be used by the company to repay one of its State guaranteed loans.  This will reduce the Exchequer's exposure.  The funds will also be used to meet the increased working capital requirements which will arise as the company continues to increase its level of output and to cover capital expenditure items.</P>
    <P>In taking its decision to invest a further £18 million in Irish Steel, the Government took into account several factors, including the acceptance by the Irish Steel employees of the company's rationalisation measures, a modest recovery in steel prices in 1985, a reduction in scrap prices since March, and the prospect that Irish Steel could secure its long term <Col N="1084" /> future and make some return over time on the Exchequer's investment in the company.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the House should be under no illusion about the harsh reality of the task ahead.  The Community steel market and, indeed, the world steel market, are still quite depressed and the outlook is not very encouraging.  The European Commission estimates that there is still approximately 25 million tonnes excess steel production capacity in the Community, notwithstanding the fact that production capacity was reduced by some 28 million tonnes between 1980 and mid-1985.  The crisis affecting the steel industry and the restructuring measures to deal with it are continuing to give rise to redundancies.  Between 1980 and mid-1985 the Community steel industry reduced its workforce by 163,000, that is a reduction of over 27 per cent.  In its document <i>General Objectives Steel 1990</i>, the Commission cautions that forecasting employment in the iron and steel industry in 1990 is hazardous owing to the many factors to be taken into consideration. Nevertheless, the Commission considers that employment in the steel industry in the five year period to 1990 will suffer further severe cutbacks.</P>
    <P>The recent redundancies in Irish Steel must be seen in this context.  They were essential for the survival of the company. In saying this I am not detracting in any way from the very real difficulties for the people concerned and their families.  I made a formal application to the Commission for ECSC funding to assist the redundant employees.  I am hopeful that the Commission will take a positive decision on the application in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Senators may be aware that the Council of the European Communities has accepted the need to return, as soon as possible and in an orderly manner, to a market situation in which steel undertakings compete freely.  This will involve the gradual dismantling of the production and delivery quota system.  As a first step, it has been decided to remove the reinforcing bar, which is one of Irish Steel's products, and coated sheet from the <Col N="1085" /> quota system with effect from 1 January 1986.  Depending on the market situation, the Commission intends to put forward other proposals before the end of 1986 for the further liberalisation of the quota system.  The effect on the market of the removal of products from the quota system will be monitored on an ongoing basis and quotas may be reintroduced if the market becomes disrupted.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated to the Dáil that scrap prices in the Community rose sharply in 1984 and in early 1985.  This of course was bad for Irish Steel.  This was due largely to a rise in the value of the US dollar and increased exports from the Community to third countries.  As scrap accounts for a substantial portion of the cost of finished steel, any major development in the price of this basic raw material impacts quite significantly on Irish Steel's financial results.  The price of scrap has an effect on some steel plants but not on all.  Irish Steel is what is known as a mini-mill and is using scrap as its raw material.  There are other continuous rolling mills which are using essentially iron generated within the same complex. They are buying iron on the home market and they are insulated against fluctuations in scrap prices, whereas Irish Steel is very sensitive to it as are other minimills. This is the relevance of these developments. Between March and November 1985, however, the scrap composite price, which is fixed in US currency, fell by about US $18 per tonne, a reduction of almost 21 per cent, reversing the previous trend.  Scrap prices in other currencies have also declined significantly since March 1985.  Although recent trends in prices are encouraging, it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty how prices will develop in the future. What is certain, however, is that seasonal fluctuations will occur during the course of each year.  In an effort to reduce operating costs I understand that Irish Steel is examining ways and means of using scrap in the most efficient manner possible.</P>
    <P>For some months now the company's chairman and chief executive have had discussions, on my instructions, with potential joint venture partners.  I have <Col N="1086" /> asked the company's chairman to continue to search for a partner.  I would add that the Government's commitment to support Irish Steel with additional investment will improve the company's prospect of finding a potential partner.</P>
    <P>I will now digress from the script and stress that the finding of a joint venture partner is extremely important to Irish Steel.  The amount of equity that the Government is putting in at this stage is the maximum that is permitted under the European currency rules and it can put in no more.  However, even with all that equity going in Irish Steel has still got far too heavy a load of borrowing.  That means of course that they have far too heavy a load of interest which they have to meet at a regular period out of current revenue.  If Irish Steel is to get itself back into a situation where it is really able to compete effectively and have a good chance of survival, it makes sense to use every possible means to bring in other equity that will reduce the borrowing &mdash; substituting perhaps cash in hands for cash borrowed from the banks.</P>
    <P>That is why I have been encouraging Irish Steel to go out and get a venture partner.  It is not because I am keen to sell off shares in Irish Steel for some reason of political principle which might engender a lot of heated and not enlightening debate, but because I want to guarantee, as far as it is within my power to guarantee, the survival prospects of the plant.  The more equity we can get in the better is the chance that Irish Steel will not run into difficulties in the future.  If at any time in the future, let us say three or four years from now, Irish Steel were to get into financial difficulties &mdash; in other words, that the amount of their outgoings exceeded to an undue degree the amount of their incomings and the banks were not prepared to bridge the gap without the benefit of a State guarantee &mdash; there is precisely nothing that you in this House or we in the Dáil could do about it because we would be precluded by EC rules from giving them any aid and it would just have to close.  If, on the other hand, we could get equity from outside <Col N="1087" /> that would make it easier for the company to weather such a storm because it would be a company that would have a stronger equity base.  It is in that context that I have been asking the company to look for a joint venture partner.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to say that the chairman of the company in particular, Mr. Kevin McCourt, has devoted prodigious efforts to travelling all over the world to meet potential joint venture partners.  No negotiations have been opened up with any of them at this point.  The discussions are purely exploratory and the drafting of a negotiating brief or provision in legislation &mdash; if such were necessary, which it may not be &mdash; for shares to be transferred is something that is quite a distance down the road if it ever does occur.  We are taking preliminary steps to do everything possible to enable this company to survive on a viable footing.  It is an efficient mill in technical terms.  It is one of the most modern in Europe.  It is, as I said in an earlier interruption of my script, sensitive to variations in scrap prices in a fashion that some other mills are not. That is really the main point that I want to make in support of a joint venture: that a mill which is sensitive to external variables such as movements in scrap prices should have a stronger equity base to enable it to weather such storms than perhaps a mill which is relatively more impervious to outside variables.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate from what I have already said that the path ahead for Irish Steel will be far from easy.  The future is full of uncertainties and it would be unrealistic to expect a dramatic improvement in the steel market in the foreseeable future.  The surplus production capacity in Europe, combined with the liberalisation of the quota system, may well put a downward pressure on prices.  The behaviour of exchange rates and, in particular, changes in the dollar rate can have a substantial impact on results, either in a favourable or in an unfavourable way.  Irrespective of these and other uncertainties, Irish Steel will have to make significant efforts to <Col N="1088" /> increase its productivity and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I would also say that it is not in our interests &mdash; on the other hand, the quota system may keep prices up &mdash; or Irish Steel's interest to maintain a restrictive quota system because we are a small operator trying to break into the market. The tendency of the quota system would be to support the position of the large existing producers.  As long as Irish Steel's financial situation is sound &mdash; and that is the relevance of this equity &mdash; it is better off in a relatively free steel market where it can make additional efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>Progress has already been made in the area of more flexible working practices. In addition, other improved working methods and procedures have been identified and the board and management are examining ways of achieving potential savings in all areas of the company's operation. The measures already taken and those in train are a good start but much more remains to be done.  Maximum efficiency must be realised and costs must be cut to the minimum.  There are no substitutes for efficiency and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would make an earnest appeal to Irish Steel employees to give their total commitment and co-operation to the company so as to ensure that all the measures necessary to secure the future of Irish Steel are implemented without delay.  Irish Steel's employees should remember at all times that the Government has sustained the company over many years at considerable cost to the taxpayer.  The future of the company now rests with the board, the management and the workforce.  I am of the view that, if the essential commitment and co-operation are readily forthcoming, the company can indeed have a long term future.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Bill will commend itself to the Seanad and I recommend it for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can give a guarded welcome to this Bill.  I say welcome, because I think Irish Steel does <Col N="1089" /> deserve what amounts really to a last chance of establishing itself satisfactorily. On the one hand one cannot with any enthusiasm agree to investing further amounts of this kind into a State-sponsored body the future of which is very problematical indeed.  But on the other hand the amount that is proposed, although very large in its own way, is certainly limited now.  It is considerably less than we were asked to give in the past.  We know that there is not going to be any further funds to this company. Certainly it appears that this will be the last time we will be asked to give any funds to this body.  For these reasons we can give a guarded welcome to it and hope that this will ensure that the company will not only survive but in due course be very successful.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister telling us that every effort is being made to find some partner for Irish Steel.  That would be an excellent idea from the financial point of view and also excellent because that kind of partnership should strengthen the base of the company and establish contacts which should go a long way towards ensuring that the company would be successful in the future.  That is an aspect of the situation which makes me more willing to welcome the proposals before us because this may be a development which will take some of the pressure off Irish Steel which, even with the help of these additional funds, would be very intense indeed if there was not some other development of the kind mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Steel has gone through a great deal of vicissitudes and problems and I think that generally speaking it can be said that world conditions and the lack of demand for steel is the principal reason for its failure to make money up to now. While there were other problems of having too large a staff, work practices and so on, these have now nearly all been dealt with and a tremendous effort has been made to make Irish Steel a businesslike company.  The existing management have done a great deal to ensure that it is as efficient as possible.  On the other hand, great sacrifices have been made. <Col N="1090" /> Many people have been made redundant. Unions and workforce agreed to these redundancies.  This was a considerable sacrifice and tribute must be paid to them for making these sacrifices to enable the company to survive.  This is a very interesting case of a company which has been given a last chance.  The moment of truth has come for Irish Steel.  They are getting extra money.  They have very largely put their house in order and now they must in the years ahead show that they are capable of discharging their obligations successfully and of showing that the money which has been put into it up to now was in all the circumstances well spent.  It is, as I said, the moment of truth.  They have made every possible effort and the State has certainly given everything they could be expected to give from a financial point of view to ensure its success in the future.  At this stage all we can do is wish the company well.</P>

      <P>It is not so many months ago that the trauma of Irish Steel in relation to Cork was a very live issue.  On that occasion the pressure on the Government <Col N="1091" /> and on the various TDs and Senators in the Cork area was immense. The local newspapers took a view that the Minister was being bloodyminded on the one hand and, in fact, its editorial was changed from week to week.  One week you would be charged with financial rectitude of a very high order and the following week you were so uncaring and unthinking and did not give a damn about people when you would not give X number of million pounds to an industry. I sincerely hope the Minister's statement today and some of the contributions in this House will be reported by the same newspaper so that we achieve some balance in the Cork region.</P>
      <P>The employment level in Irish Steel a number of years ago was 1,100 people. It now stands at 535 and that includes management.  Sacrifices have been made right across the board by the workers and management to achieve savings in almost every area.  I understand that &mdash; perhaps the Minister would enlighten me &mdash; a consultant's report has been furnished to the Minister which looked into the effectiveness of the management structure and the purchasing and marketing strategy in Irish Steel, and I understand that that report is with the Minister.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be in keeping with the new spirit in Irish Steel if the contents of that report &mdash; bearing in mind the need for commercial confidentiality and so on, that is the information I received this morning, it may be erroneous &mdash; are still to arrive I am urging the Minister that such a report should be made available on a confidential basis to the trade union representatives.  It is usually very late in the day when management wishes to share a burden with the trade unions, it is usually at the 11th hour.  As I understand it, this report is either completed or in the course of completion and I urge the Minister to involve the trade unions in any examination of that report.  In that way we would guarantee that the spirit of realism and co-operation that exists in Irish Steel at the moment would be continued into the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> The current information on Irish Steel is that the production levels are up, the sales books for 1986 look exceedingly healthy and that they are hopeful that 1986 and onwards will be good enough to enable Irish Steel to remain.  I do not think anybody &mdash; certainly not the unions involved in Irish Steel &mdash; is under any illusion whatsoever in relation to what the Minister has said here this morning. They know full well it is the last throw of the dice.  My concern in the main is that <i>The Cork Examiner</i> made that point.  If the price of scrap, because of the value of the dollar, goes through the roof we will hear the same false cries applying pressure on us to spend taxpayers' money.  They will lacerate us for doing so the following week.  I hope that schizophrenic type of reporting by a powerful newspaper having almost a monopoly in the Cork area will be taken into account. All of the allegations made against the Minister personally at the time were not borne out by subsequent events and it is fair to say that.</P>
    <P>There was an attempt to divide both parties in Government on the basis of an ideological split between the Minister particularly and the Labour Party.  I think the Minister would be the last person to deny that we would not share every aspect of ideology on economic issues. That is not to say that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, does not share fully and comprehend fully the trauma of job losses in any industry whether they be in the State or private sector.  One of the main reasons I spoke here today was to point out the lack of balance in the reporting that occurred right throughout the whole Irish Steel saga in the last few months and to hope that the moneys that are being voted on here and the Minister's explanation with regard to the final throw of the dice will be understood.  The workers understand it because I have talked to their union officials.  I am quite sure the management understand it, but in a democracy it is vitally important that the media and the print medium in particular would play the game fairly by reporting accurately what the actual situation is instead of pandering to some of <Col N="1093" /> their customers in this case, which is what they were doing in the past.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Senator O'Leary felt compelled to take umbrage at the numbers game in the House.  I intended to be very brief.  I welcome the Bill.  I sincerely hope that ten years from now Irish Steel will be still repaying some of the money lent to them.  That is my wish for Christmas for the workers.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on all his efforts and on the Government's efforts to try to achieve a solution to what was a number of months ago, a crisis situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief indeed.  Like Senator Ryan, I, too, offer a guarded welcome to the Bill.  I am particularly involved in the area where steel is used in the building industry, which is very important.  Indeed I must be one of the few Members of the House who visited the Irish Steel works in Haulbowline on a number of occasions.  I was part of a design team on a reinforced concrete ordnance jetty in Haulbowline.  I saw at first hand, the works in progress there.  I know that in the building industry generally steel is very important.  The building industry, of course, is going through a bad patch at the moment.  In this area perhaps more use of steel could be made, for example in foundations, footings.  It could be considered mandatory to use reinforcement and indeed in modular-type buildings, which in the future will perhaps become more or less the norm, I am sure steel will become very important and therefore it is essential that we would have our own industry in this country.  As Members have said, nearly everything that could be done to rationalise Irish Steel has been done.  As Senator Magner has said this is the last throw of the dice and we all hope that it will be a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I simply want to welcome the Bill in so far as it may contribute to that success &mdash; and I believe that it will &mdash; and also to say to the Minister that perhaps promoting the wider use of steel might be considered by including in the standard specifications of the Department of the Environment and in all the Department specifications, a provision that the use of <Col N="1094" /> steel would be mandatory.  It would in the short term mean a small increase on each individual building, but in the long run I believe it would contribute to the success of Irish Steel.  I think it would be worth considering.  With those few words I once again welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. Within the last 18 months no other concern has got more approvals for extra moneys in this House than did Irish Steel. That has to be made clear.  Indeed might I take the opportunity as a Cork man to thank the Minister involved?  Over the last few months he personally got a lot of abuse about whether he was doing the right thing for Irish Steel.  We would have to commend, not the management on their ideas over the years in Irish Steel, but certainly the getting together of the employees and the management over the last few months and the putting of their act together, and showing for the first time in the months of October and November that things were looking some way better in Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>The Minister has come out very strongly with the idea that there is need for a joint venture in Irish Steel.  It is only right and proper to say that if a joint venture idea can be set up, it would only be to the delight of everybody, and of course, the taxpayers of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could I just repeat a point I brought up on the last occasion when we were discussing Irish Steel, the question of creating shares employees?  In view of all the money that has gone into Irish Steel from the taxpayer over the last few years &mdash; £89 million the first day, £12 million last year and £24 million again this year &mdash; could we not now be saying, that if we are seen to be putting our act together and if the employees, management and trade unions and everybody involved are now agreeing that there is a future for Irish Steel, they should put their money where their mouth is?  The State perhaps should say that for the first time ever we are prepared to recognise the importance of the employees and indeed management, and suggest that a percentage of pay per week be asked from the <Col N="1095" /> employees and staff.  It is unfortunate that we must distinguish between the staff and employees.</P>
    <P>Is it possible or realistic to think that we now can be asking that shares be allocated to employees if they wish to purchase?  You could put the argument to wives of employees, that in actual fact if you had shares in the company you work for, there might be a more realistic view taken by the husbands.  Unfortunately, over the last few years, we did not have the greatest co-operation or the greatest thinking by work forces throughout the country.  There is an opportunity now to prove what can be done if the State is prepared to give the opportunity to the employees of investing in their own company and emphasising in a short statement what is envisaged.  As an example, if you have 500 employees in Irish Steel and you get an average of £10 per week from each employee, you are talking about £50,000 per week.  You are talking about a lot of money in the end of the year to put against the interest.  If that is pointed out and what it means over the years to the company it might be a life-saver.  If you are trying to create a joint venture idea between somebody in the private sector and the State as regards Irish Steel, you have a better argument to make if all the employees, or the vast majority of them, hold shares in the company. It is quite obvious it is going to work.</P>
    <P>I have seen this work in the Cork area with other private companies.  The employees of that company were offered the shares on a very small basis for a minimum amount per week &mdash; the shares were worth much more &mdash; and the company found that to have their employees involved in managing the company produces better results for everybody concerned. When one listens to the employees &mdash; and they are the people I would mostly be listening to &mdash; one finds that for a worker to have a share in his work and have an interest in it, creates a lot of extra dedication.</P>
    <P>Now Irish Steel more than ever want this interest by all.  For far too long &mdash; I <Col N="1096" /> have already mentioned this &mdash; arguments and fighting were carried on by different groups down there for their own particular gain or indeed for individual gain.  Only in the last few weeks, there was a situation there in which, even though the redundancies were agreed and the rationalisation plan was agreed, one person was going to stop the plant.  There was a picket going on because of one person.  How unrealistic can you be?  That is a fact of life.  I am glad to say it turned out otherwise, because of pressure put on by other unions and by other employees. That kind of thing must stop.  Share investment is an area where we might be seen to improve with joint venture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on this Bill.  As a Cork Senator I welcome the Bill which enables the Government to give further funding for the continuation of Irish Steel.  It would be devastating for the economic life of the Cork region if anything should go wrong with this company, particularly when we had so many closures in the Cork region during the past year.  Having said that, I understand the responsibility of the Minister for the proper utilisation of taxpayers' money and I believe that the Government have always been very conscious of this.</P>
      <P>Under the new terms of reference laid down by the Minister for investment, I believe it is a good decision to invest a further £18 million, to increase the authorised share capital from £120 million to £125 million and to reduce the limit to which the Minister may guarantee borrowings by Irish Steel from £100 million to £32 million.  I congratulate the workforce of Irish Steel because basically the future of Irish Steel was solely in their hands and they were responsible enough to comply with the recommendations laid down by the Minister to enable him to make this investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are aware, there is a surplus of steel supplies and overproduction in the EC and a special case had to be made to Europe to allow this investment to be made.  The rationalisation programme had to be part of this package.  For that <Col N="1097" /> reason I welcome the decision taken by the workforce to reduce the staff by 117 people to enable Irish Steel to become competitive.  It was important that the reduction in the labour force took place. Also a pay freeze for 1986 had to be introduced.  It is hoped that the subsidy from EC funds for those made redundant will become available.  I am sure that the Minister will do everything in his power to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The threat of closure of Irish Steel has now gone, but it is worth remembering that the future will be difficult and will require a lot of commitment by management and workers to make a success of Irish Steel.  The Government have stated that this company must become financially viable in the immediate future.  The investment this year will now amount to £25 million, which is a sign that the Government have a commitment to Irish Steel and to the Cork region.  Obviously, they expect a good return on this investment. Irish Steel, for its part, must continue to increase its volume of sales, reduce production costs and obtain realistic prices for its products.  This will not be easy, particularly since the international steel market remains depressed and when many producers in the European Community are being compelled to reduce their production capacity because of the imbalance between supply and demand.</P>
    <P>There will not be any further funding from the Exchequer for Irish Steel and the company will have to finance operations from now onwards in the normal commercial manner.  Under EC rules no more money may be made available.  The success of the company now rests with the management and the workforce.  I believe that all concerned are fully aware of this and during the past year the volume of sales increased by 56 per cent and the value of exports is 64 per cent of total sales.  The year ahead, however, will be decisive.  There is a vital need to improve performance, to contain costs and in general to build on the progress achieved since the commissioning of the new plant in 1981.  I am satisfied that this can be achieved.  Irish Steel have the plant <Col N="1098" /> and the skills and have now been given the opportunity.  It will require a supreme, sustained effort to ensure its success.  In the end success or failure lies with the performance of the management, the board and the workforce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators for the welcome they have given to this legislation. I note the reservations that have been expressed on all sides of the House about giving more taxpayers' money to the company, given that it has already received a lot.  The only point I would make &mdash; and it may in some way assuage the worries of Senator Ryan and others &mdash; is that a good part of this money is being used to repay debts owed by Irish Steel which are guaranteed by the taxpayer anyway.  If Irish Steel where to close &mdash; God forbid &mdash; the money which we are now paying over would have to be paid over anyway.  In respect of a good portion of the money, what we are giving essentially is not the money, because that money is due from us in some form ultimately, but we are essentially taking over the interest charges on it whereas the company, if it does not get the money from us and it is merely a guaranteed debt, is paying the interest.  When we pay them equity we take over the interest and this has to be met out of the public sector borrowing requirement in respect of interest charges.  That is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to express strong agreement with the principle put forward by Senator Denis Cregan in regard to the notion of the workers in Irish Steel buying shares in the company on a basis that would be suitable, given their income situation.  Clearly, every possible avenue must be pursued to bring additional equity into the company.  There is no doubt that equity brought in in that way would have the benefit that it would improve further the working atmosphere of the company and would represent, as Senator Cregan suggested a valuable attraction for a joint venture partner.  In view of what Senator Cregan has said, I intend in the next few days to write to <Col N="1099" /> the company asking them to consider carefully, with my strong favourable recommendation, the suggestion made by Senator Cregan.  I think it is a valuable one and it certainly will, if it is successful, contribute to the future of the company. I thank the Senator for his suggestion.</P>
    <P>I took note of what Senator Fitzsimons, my county colleague, had to say about the greater use of steel in the construction industry.  I will, of course, discuss that with the Minister for the Environment.  However, I have to say that Irish Steel is not producing all the possible types of steel that are used in the construction industry.  It would be difficult, without being open to the accusation of discrimination, to prescribe steel solely in respect of those uses which Irish Steel could meet and not prescribe it in other uses in the industry.  In the final analysis anything which increases the cost of building unnecessarily is bad for the construction industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on the technical considerations.  To the extent that it would prolong the life of the building that would be valuable.

In that situation steel would not need to be specified.  I imagine it would tend to be used anyway without any incentive being provided because of the intrinsic merits of the materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome what Senator Magner had to say in my own regard and agree with <Col N="1100" /> him that there has been a tendency for schizophrenic comment to be made on this matter in certain media.  I would not intend to interfere with the board in regard to what they decide to do with any studies they have received.  It is a matter for them to decide if it is appropriate or not that certain consultancy material should be released to the workforce.  I have no doubt but that the board will be perusing this debate and will note Senator Magner's concern on this issue.  I thank Senator Kelleher also for his contribution. It is fair to say that he is in full support of what we are doing.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, I did not realise we had moved on to this item.  I apologise to the Chair.  I am a bit disappointed that levies are being retained for the next 12 months at the existing level especially at a time when farmers' incomes have dropped by 10 per cent. Most farmers expected them to be halved.  Considering the progress that has been made in testing and in the eradication of TB since the new scheme came into operation it is worth continuing with it no matter how painful it may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to continue with the 60-day test.  It is an advantage to have the period of sale extended.  Under the 30-day test farmers had only about three weeks in which they could sell cattle.  Seeing that levies are being retained I would appeal for more realistic compensation to be paid for reactors, especially for young animals.  There was <Col N="1102" /> more progress made in the sixties with TB testing when cattle were paid for at market value.  Farmers with young animals are not being adequately compensated because the profit from small animals is very little.  I am aware of this because I see small animals coming into factories and making as little as £30 or £40.  Some of those calves cost over £200.</P>
    <P>I appeal, especially in the case of younger animals, to go back to the system of buying at market value.  There must be some reason why there are loopholes in the scheme and why there are abuses. There are occasions when cattle have a valid 30 or 60-day test at some of the marts and when they are tested again in a herd test during that 30-day period those cattle turn up as reactors.  There must be some loophole that has not been checked out as thoroughly as it should be.  People are losing money on selling those reactors to the factories and not receiving adequate compensation.  With cattle prices falling they may come in line but when cattle are dear compensation is not adequate.  There should be more compensation for farmers who have reactors, especially young reactors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on the bovine eradication scheme because it is something that has widespread effects on the country.  We have two different angles on this.  Some people say it is costing far too much and we are spending far too much money on it.  For those who are directly affected by it, the farmers, it is quite a scourge.  We must forget about emotion and sensationalism and stop talking about people making money and abusing the system.  I simply ask the Minister to ensure that this scourge be wiped out as quickly as possible and that the best value for money be obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Senators for their fairly wide-ranging contributions. Of course we would agree, if we could afford it, to discontinue this in the morning but we believe, because we are moving so well, that it is worth this small penalty in order to see the end of this terrible scourge.  We hope that with this <Col N="1103" /> new drive TB eradication will not be an ongoing thing.</P>
      <P>Senator Smith referred to the increased incidence of bovine TB and he made the point that it may be as a result of more intensive testing.  I agree with him.  As indicated in the opening statement at the end of November the overall disease problem was 3.62 per cent which is 6,900 herds.  At the end of the last full round in 1983 the problem was 2.78. What this means is that this year's intensive testing programme is helping us to identify more precisely the extent of the disease problem.  It gives of a sound basis for making significant progress in 1986 and 1987.</P>
      <P>With regard to the double levies being retained the Minister explained this in the Dáil yesterday.  He said that in deciding to retain the levies at the current level the Government have had to take into account the overall budget proposals for 1986 and the fact that there has been a substantial fall in revenue in the year just ending.  I do not need to remind any of you how difficult a year 1985 was and, in fairness I have to remind the House of the range of measures introduced by the Government in recent months to try to alleviate the position of farmers who suffered the worst effects of the bad weather.  They were a help but many people are critical of them.  It was an indication of our sympathy with the scene.</P>
      <P>Various speakers referred to the 60-day test.  We have given an undertaking to review the situation at the end of March.  I feel that if co-operation is maintained we will be happy to look at this favourably.  One important point we have to keep in mind about disease eradication and about being seen to be serious about it is the fact that we have access to quite a lot of markets abroad and they are aware of the efforts we are making with regard to disease eradication and our general attitude towards meat and meat products.  We have a very high rating abroad.  That is the scenario we and, I am sure, everybody in this House would like to see continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> Some speakers referred to the controlled collection of animals.  We are doing this in some pilot areas at present. Basically the idea is that we would be looking to co-ops and people like that to pick up animals.  When we talk about badgers and all sorts of wildlife causing problems that may well be in certain areas and it is something we are monitoring very carefully.  There are some very suspicious areas indeed where badgers are concerned but we have to say that the spread of disease by and large is laterally from one farm to another and also by dealers picking up animals and these animals not ending up where they should. While the Department can do a certain amount of policing, the Department cannot watch every deal as closely as they would like.  I have made that point in the Dáil more than once.  Farmers as a body in a particular area must accept that they have a problem and face up to it themselves. They must be prepared to get together with the veterinary people, with the Department and admit that they have a disease problem in their herd and even put up a notice to that effect, in other words to warn people with clean herds to keep out and intensify hygiene standards where people are coming on to the farm.  Above all, they should arrange between themselves how the animals are to be brought into the factory.  We had that kind of co-operation in north Cork and several other areas and we have had dramatic results.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey asked if there were any changes contemplated in disease eradication as outlined.  The answer is no.  The programme is going well and already some 150,000 herds, almost 80 per cent of the national herd, have been tested. There is general support for the programme from all quarters and a high level of co-operation.  Senator Hussey also made the point about quick reactor removal.  We agree with him.  Under the new programme 10 days are allowed from the day of punching to removal of reactors. In nearly all cases this has been achieved and it is a big improvement from <Col N="1105" /> the former 20 or 30-day intervals.  Prosecutions are being stepped up in accordance with the commitment of the national plan.  All cases of detected breaches of the law and regulations relating to disease eradication are being vigorously pursued.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to research.  As the House is aware, we have set up research liaison between the veterinary college, the Department, the ordinary veterinarians and the AFT.  This is working well.</P>

    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the White Paper on Tourism Policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Senator McDonald is available.  I will make a few brief comments.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses I am pleased to participate in the debate on tourism, catering and leisure and on the White Paper on Tourism Policy, produced by the Minister last September.  In speaking about this industry we should realise that it is the third biggest industry in the country, preceded by manufacturing industry and agriculture. Up to now I must say it has been poorly treated in comparison with the other two by successive Governments in relation to the finance made available, the amount of staff allocation, etc.  However, at this point I believe there is now a firm commitment and a recognition of the vast potential tourism, if developed properly, can have for our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the White Paper, I have noted that in the introduction to it the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy John Bruton, said <Col N="1106" /> that this is the first time a Government in Ireland have published a White Paper on Tourism.  He said that this was important in itself because from now on tourism would be a central part of Government policy making.  This was, of course, one of the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee, that a White Paper should be produced and that tourism should be elevated to a special plane in Government priorities.  Ireland is fortunate in that a high percentage of the tourist industry is centred around areas which are not very suited to intensive industrial or agricultural development. Therefore, tourism is of major benefit to regional policy.</P>
    <P>The successful operation of tourism requires a co-ordinated policy in areas such as accommodation, catering, access transport, adequate car hire facilities, wet weather facilities, road sign posts, natural amenities, scenery and pollution control.  The inspectoral role for accommodation is exercised by Bord Fáilte for camping and caravan parks and for the physical and natural environment generally by the local authorities.  There is no known standard or inspectoral role carried out by anyone for access transport, the routes which most of the customers must use.</P>
    <P>Seasonality is a major problem for Irish tourism.  Some 56 per cent of our visitors arrive in the four months from June to September, inclusive, 35 per cent arrive during the peak months of July to August and 21 per cent arrive during the shoulder months of June and September.  This visitor pattern results in many tourist businesses operating at well below capacity for most of the year or indeed not operating at all.  Our wide seasonal fluctuations are a negative influence on business investment in tourism.  There is potential to spread the season, where achievements depend on careful planning and marketing with full co-operation between all tourism interests, including promotion, access and accommodation.</P>
    <P>Based on international tourism comparisons the committee recommend the following: a system of petrol coupons for tourists from overseas as in Italy; a <Col N="1107" /> scheme of holiday vouchers in respect of accommodation to encourage domestic holidays during the shoulder periods; a similar scheme operated jointly by the employers and unions which exists in France.</P>
    <P>Direct expenditure by Irish and foreign tourists on holidays in Ireland represented 6.4 per cent of GNP in 1983. Employment in the industry accounts for 59,000 directly employed and 40,000 seasonal or part-time workers.  For example, many shops in the larger cities and tourist areas derive a large amount of their income from tourists.  The extent of the benefit varies according to the location and time of the year but the relationship with employment is clear.  In the report the observation was made that tourism is handled, in the majority of cases, by small, labour-intensive businesses and that they are well dispersed throughout the country.  They are, in many cases, family owned.  It is well to point out that the Government saw fit to include job creation especially as a top priority for tourism because they believe that this is an area in which increases in permanent, temporary, or part time jobs can be achieved.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a very significant factor in the economy.  International tourism is increasing and, based on education and world trends, this increase will continue. Tourism is an expanding market and one in which this country, with the right policies, should get an increased share.  The first requirement would be to sell ourselves as a country giving good value for money.  We must, therefore, be competitive. Up to now we have not been seen to be competitive.  Principally due to our high rate of taxes Ireland has lost market competitiveness against other European countries in the field of tourism.  For example, in cumulative terms, since 1980 our competitiveness has declined by 16 per cent in Germany, 19 per cent in France and 15 per cent in Britain.  This situation has arisen due to high VAT and high taxation.  For example, car rental charges in Ireland are still among the highest in Europe in spite of the recent <Col N="1108" /> very welcome reduction in VAT from 18 per cent to 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>As outlined in the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> the Government are fully aware of the need to improve our international competitiveness.  Our inflation rate at the moment is being reduced in line with other European countries. Indirect taxation has had a damaging effect on our price competitiveness and increases in taxation on tourism goods and services should be avoided.</P>
    <P>In preparing our report we were very concerned at the high rate of VAT, 23 per cent, on meals.  We strongly recommended that this rate be reduced to 10 per cent.  I do not believe there would be any loss of revenue as a result, as the cheaper price would encourage more people to eat out, it would encourage more tourism to increase competitiveness and, therefore, it would result in greater employment in our hotels and restaurants. I welcome the reduction in the rate of VAT on hotel accommodation and caravans, boat and car hire from 23 per cent to 10 per cent and also the VAT rebate scheme for tourists exporting goods in their personal baggage.</P>
    <P>Unless Ireland is seen internationally as good value for money, from a tourism point of view, we are not going to succeed. We do not have guaranteed sunshine and unless we can offer other alternatives tourists will follow the sun. We do have nice scenery, good fishing and a pleasant and friendly people.  It is also an advantage for our two biggest markets, the UK and North America, that we are an English speaking country.</P>
    <P>A disadvantage, from a tourist point of view, is that access to Ireland is restricted to transport by air or by sea.  We are thus at a disadvantage with most European countries, where overland transport by road and rail plays a major role in tourism access.  Therefore, Ireland can be seen as a secondary destination.  Another disadvantage is the Northern Ireland situation. The consequences of nearly two decades of violence and instability in Northern Ireland have been severe setbacks for tourism in the Republic.  The greatest loss has been in the British <Col N="1109" /> market.  Expenditure in the Republic of Ireland by UK tourists accounted for 26 per cent of all UK tourist expenditure in Europe in 1969; in 1981 this was down to 11.5 per cent.  However, after the signing of the Anglo-Irish agreement I am satisfied that there will be an increase in cross-Channel visitors over the next few years.</P>
    <P>In relation to access to Ireland mentioned earlier the committee felt that the cost of getting here was particularly expensive.  The point was also made that 80 per cent of the people who come here for a holiday use a State company to transport them.  The views of Bord Fáilte were ascertained on this aspect of the costs involved and they estimated Ireland's competitive position with regard to access transport to Ireland from our main overseas market as follows:</P>
    <P>Air transport from Britain &mdash; not competitive.  Sea transport from Britain &mdash; marginally competitive.  Air transport from America &mdash; competitive. Air transport from Continental Europe &mdash; not competitive.  Sea transport from Continental Europe &mdash; competitive.</P>
    <P>The White Paper fully acknowledges the vital importance of access to tourism and the cost is one of the major elements contributing to the cost of holidays in this country.  The White Paper also provides for the development by tourist interests of an expanded programme of charter activity to Cork and Shannon from the UK and Europe.  Some sources in the tourism trade allege that there is a conflict between the commercial objective of the State carriers, particularly Aer Lingus, and access for tourists.</P>
    <P>The committee took oral evidence from Aer Lingus and B &amp; I, which it put in contrast with further oral evidence from Bord Fáilte and other tourism interests. The chief objections were that Aer Lingus were inhibiting the granting of licences for private air charter to Ireland and were uncompetitive on certain air routes.  They were more interested in transporting Irish holidaymakers abroad through their summer charters to Mediterranean <Col N="1110" /> destinations than in developing tours to Ireland.  Aer Lingus when challenged, however, hotly disputed these claims and maintained that their fares from the Republic of Ireland to London were very competitive.  They claimed that they carried seven out of ten visitors by air to Ireland including half a million tourists last year.  They also denied obstructing proposals for private charter to Ireland.  If any one of the charges against Aer Lingus were true it would be very damaging to our tourist industry.  A combination of any few of them would be very damaging to the promotion of tourism.  There is reason to be concerned at one of the allegations.  It states that Aer Lingus were more interested in transporting the holiday makers abroad to the 19 Mediterranean destinations than they were in promoting tours to Ireland.  If this were true it would be a very serious situation and would need urgent investigation.</P>
    <P>The committee also dealt with the question of sea transport.  They were concerned with the lack of consultation about operational charges by sea carriers which have an adverse effect on tourism business. The recent pooling arrangements on the Irish Sea between B &amp; I and Sea-link Ferries is evidence of this lack of consultation.  The committee on page 20 says that the committee are appalled that such decisions are implemented without any prior consultation with tourism interests and that these episodes together serve as topical and typical examples of the ineffectiveness of State policy for tourism and the incapacity of Bord Fáilte to respond to the needs of the industry.</P>
    <P>Marketing our tourism is one of the major ingredients for success in the industry. The committee were critical of Bord Fáilte in this area.  On page 23 of the report they state that Bord Fáilte tend to market Ireland as a whole and not to concentrate on subsectors which would yield a greater benefit and certainly be more quantifiable.  Again the marketing initiatives of Bord Fáilte should be modelled more on those of CTT which promotes exports of manufactured goods. These initiatives would include group <Col N="1111" /> marketing schemes, individual incentives for marketing executives and practical schemes to support tour operators.</P>
    <P>The committee acknowledge that Bord Fáilte operate schemes in these areas but they are felt to be inadequate and of limited scope.  However, Bord Fáilte are satisfied with their marketing strategy and are looking forward to a bumper year for tourism in 1986.  They state that the outlook for 1986 is relatively good despite a fall in the value of the US dollar.  The entry of the new US carriers will offer many opportunities for additional business. The growth in the non-ethnic holiday segment in Britain should continue. The ethnic market has traditionally been of importance for Irish tourism.  There are estimated to be over 50 million people living abroad who are of Irish descent.  It will take a lot of marketing and expertise to attract a percentage of these people to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Even in the minutest of terms this would give a massive boost to our industry. Statistics have shown that expenditure per person by North American tourists is more than twice as high as the average out of State tourists.  Therefore, these tourists are of vital importance to the hotel, coach and car hire sectors and, as I have already said, its contribution to the employment situation is vast.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry must strive to ensure that it offers a high quality product at a competitive price.  It must market that product effectivelly and take advantage of opportunities as they arise including favourable currency changes.  Total revenue from tourism in 1983 amounted to £808 million.  While CSO figures are not available for 1984 Bord Fáilte estimate that export tourism increased by more than 6 per cent.  The forecast for 1985 is for record tourism earnings &mdash; the best year yet since 1979.  This forecast has been given in the December issue of the Bord Fáilte magazine which states:</P>
    <P>Total revenue from overseas tourism is expected to be £475 million this year &mdash; £92 million or 17% in real terms better than in 1984, an all-time record <Col N="1112" /> for the industry.  The overall number of visitors from overseas increased by 3% to almost 1.9 million.  An estimate of earning from Northern Ireland boosts total out of State earnings to £712 million &mdash; which is £126 million more than in 1984.</P>
    <P>No figures were available for home holidays but because of the poor weather conditions this market was expected to show a decline.  While I welcome the increase in the earnings from tourism during the last three years as stated, I want to point out that Ireland had lost a lot of its market share prior to this. Statistics for the years 1972 to 1981 show that Ireland had real tourism growth of 35 per cent over that period.  The EC average was 47 per cent.  In terms of tourism growth Ireland rank eighth out of ten EC member states.  Recent improvements have been brought about mainly by the strength of the US dollar. Bord Fáilte will continue to market home holidays and will place emphasis on the different sectors of the industry to become more actively involved in promotion and marketing directed at the Irish holidaymaker.  One of the new ideas for 1986 is the introduction of a three year programme to extend the tourist season into April and May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break I was speaking about the introduction of a three-year programme to extend the season into April and May.  This would be marketed under the title of &ldquo;Springtime in Ireland&rdquo;.  It would be promoted in such a way as to ensure that it sells the overall image of Ireland so that Ireland as a destination gets the maximum spinoff for the year as a whole.  The committee in the preparation of this report covered a wide variety of related areas associated either directly or indirectly with tourism.  They received a number of submissions from interested parties, 15 in all, which were very important in the preparation of this report.  They also took <Col N="1113" /> oral evidence in public from Aer Lingus, B &amp; I, Bord Fáilte, CERT, Irish Caravans Co. Limited, Coach Tourism Council of Ireland, the Irish Hotels' Federation and the Licensed Vintners' Federation. Each of these bodies put forward their point of view as to how changes should be made in their respective areas with a view to improving their performance <i>vis-a-vis</i> the tourist trade.  Reference has been made by other Senators in connecton with most of these, so I will not dwell on these points.</P>
      <P>The committee dealt in detail with the licensing laws in so far as they affect tourism.  Senators Howard and Lynch have outlined their views on these points. I support them on trying to achieve their objectives, particularly in the area of the removal of the automatic endorsement of publicans' licences.  I agree with the proposed new closing time for public houses which states that they should be fixed on a seven-day basis at 11.30 p.m. all year around, with 30 minutes finishing up time, and until 1.30 a.m. on New Year's Eve and St. Patrick's Day.</P>
      <P>Proper grading of hotels is another requirement.  I agree with the setting up of the new consultative advisory group on hotel grading established this year by Bord Fáilte.  There should be a working party to develop grading criteria covering not only the physical aspects of hotels but also peoples' performance and standards.</P>
      <P>Finally, the two major achievements in product terms for tourism in 1985 was the reduction of VAT to 10 per cent on most tourism services and, secondly, the newly announced hotel and guesthouse reconstruction scheme.  This scheme announced by the Minister will encourage much-needed reinvestment.  The purposes of the scheme are to stimulate employment-intensive capital investment in export tourism, hotels and guesthouses, to improve overall standards and to encourage the provision of all-weather facilities to assist the extension of the tourist season.  The grant limit per premises shall be up to a maximum of £30,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude by paying special tribute to the chairman of the Oireachtas Joint <Col N="1114" /> Committee on Small Businesses, Deputy Ivan Yates, for the enormous amount of work he put into this report.  As he is getting married on Saturday next, I would like to wish him and his wife-to-be, Gillian, every success for the future.  I would also like to thank the clerk of the committee, Mr. McAuley, who provided much of the background material which made the report such a success.</P>

      <P>We have many industries in Ireland that depend on outside raw materials or technology.  Tourism is one of the consequences of the beautiful landscape we have in this country.  Anyone who has been down in the Minister's territory cannot but appreciate what beautiful natural scenery is all about.  The scenic areas of our country are certainly proof that there must be a good God who created such a lovely landscape.  Killarney and Wicklow are very well-known beauty spots, but I would not like anybody to think that there are no attractions inland. Anybody who is lucky enough to travel down the Barrow in a boat, to head towards Mount Leinster and to finish up near Graiguenamanagh, can enjoy beauty in nature at its very best.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that tourism is not being confined to areas around the coast, as used to be the case.  People came and drove around the coast.  They saw Ireland's coast by they missed a lot of the inland beauty.  It is important for our people that visitors can come and share this beauty.  From a very selfish point of view, we must say that by so doing they are bringing much-needed finance to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tourism is a natural amenity we have. We do not have to build artificial mountains, artificial hillocks or canals in order to make the place look nice.  Nature has provided this for us.  If we could be given a guarantee of the fine weather, such as we had two summers ago, Ireland would be a very appealing place.  People have a yearning to go to Europe.  The main attraction of Europe seems to be the guaranteed sunshine.  We could have the best of both worlds with fine weather and the lovely scenery.  We have to make sure <Col N="1115" /> that we do not discourage people from coming here because of prices.  We can certainly control prices.  The idea of fleecing tourists is disappearing.  It is a very short-sighted attitude to have.  One might make a lot of money one year, but tourism is an ongoing business and the more goodwill we generate by giving people good value the more we stand a chance of having people come back to visit us again.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about the positive side of Irish life and our natural beauty but I want to make reference to what we do not have.  Certainly, as a nation we do not seem to have a flair for tidiness and neatness.  When we go abroad we are impressed by how tidy places are.  When we come back to Ireland we see how untidy we are.  Much litter is thrown around the place.  Despite the best efforts of our county councils and town commissioners, we just seem to be untidy by nature.  Despite all efforts that are made in schools to make sure that children collect lunch papers and their garbage, there are cans everywhere, children are taught to be tidy at a very early age.  Nevertheless, for some strange reason, as adults &mdash; perhaps it is because of the bad example they see &mdash; we find that we forget all about tidiness.  One has only to be in a street in any town or city to see the way people throw papers away.  When driving behind a car one finds that a newspaper can be thrown from a window and block one's view.  It is unbelievable how, as a nation, we seem to think that the open spaces are for dumping things. Many of these fast food and take-away food places, and even the sweet shops, do not have litter facilities outside their premises where people can dump paper and wrappings.  We should put more emphasis on the provision of waste bins so that we can pressurise people into behaving a little better than heretofore. I am convinced, as I get older, that as a nation we are much more inclined to react to compulsion than to anything else. Litter wardens could do a lot to bring a bit of sanity into our attitude.  There can be appeals at local authority level and <Col N="1116" /> appeals on the paper but we would react much more to a fine of £5 if it were a £5 on-the-spot fine.  We owe it to ourselves, to the nation and, certainly, to the tourist business to try improve this dreadful law in our national characteristic.  Many people are extremely clean and tidy.  I do not know why, for some strange reason, the vast majority seem to throw stuff around so carelessly.</P>
    <P>Having talked about tidiness, I would now like to praise the Tidy Towns Competition which has done so much to bring pride to so many towns and villages.  It is marvellous to see these places that have won the Tidy Towns Competition. Rathvilly in County Carlow was one of the leading places for many years.  It is pleasant to see the amount of work that can be done and how tidy places can be. If enough people could visit the winning places, they would certainly see how we should behave.  Unfortunately, not enough people see these towns.</P>
    <P>Last year Kilkenny won the major award for a city.  That was a marvellous achievement.  It means that people there have a great sense of pride in their own town.  It is easy enough, perhaps, for a small village to be tidy if there is a good community with a sense of pride in themselves, perhaps through the local teams or the ICA.  It is probably easier for them to do a good neat job in keeping their little place clean and tidy.  It was a marvellous achievement for a big town like Kilkenny to win.  I want to congratulate them on their achievement.  I also want to congratulate the organising body on having so many places involved.  It helps immensely to bring a sense of pride into townspeople.  The more towns and villages that are involved the more hope we have of having a country that is neat and tidy and that impresses people.</P>
    <P>I was shocked in Carlow on one occasion when, during an exchange of students from France I asked the teacher who travelled with the students &ldquo;What are your impressions of Ireland so far?&rdquo; She replied, with gesticulations, &ldquo;Dirty&rdquo;. Of all the impressions we should give to a visitor, that is the one impression we should not give.  I hope that in the years <Col N="1117" /> to come Bord Fáilte will put more emphasis on tidiness and the tidying-up of litter. We cannot talk enough about it.  We cannot take enough action on it.  Litter will do us a lot of damage, but a lot of good will be done if we can eliminate it.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned by previous speakers, the troubles in the North of Ireland have caused us many problems. People are afraid to come here.  They say that one could not chance going up there. I suppose we have different ideas about other countries also.  Perhaps with the Anglo-Irish Agreement things may calm down a bit and people may feel confident that they can come and share the beauty of our country.  We would like to see them coming.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned previously, I welcome the grants to guesthouses of up to £30,000 to help people expand.  Some of these guesthouses have taken a knock especially last summer, which was so bad. They were geared for doing a lot of business this year because of the previous summer and the demand there was then. Irish people were very willing to stay at home and call to these places.  Many of these guesthouses have lovely facilities. They are a credit to the people themselves and to our country.  I hope that these grants will help many of them to improve the existing conditions.  The more they improve the more they will appeal to our visitors.  Many people are inclined to drive around the country, not booking in any place but spending a night here and there.  That is good for a country because it broadens the whole aspect. People may want to see the beautiful River Barrow with Mount Leinster in the background as they go along, whereas if they book into a hotel in one of our well-established tourist resorts they will see only that part of the country.  It reminds me of people who go to New York and who profess to know everything about America when they come back.  New York is as typical of America as any one spot in any country is typical of the entire country.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the committee on this report on tourism.  I hope that we will capitalise on our natural facilities and <Col N="1118" /> that we will live up to our standard of &ldquo;céad míle fáilte&rdquo; for our visitors in order to make them feel happy and to let them know that they are welcome to share the beautiful places we have in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome very much not only the White Paper on Tourism but also this third report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses.  I believe that the report is a milestone in tourist policy.  Hopefully, it will bring tourism back to a position of importance such as it enjoyed in the 1950s and 1960s.  In those years, perhaps, many would think one need not have paid so much attention to tourism because we had a great flow of tourists to this country immediately after the war.  I am old enough to remember that time.  Indeed, it was a great joy to see the tourists during those years.  Our standard of living may not have been as high as it is today but it was certainly a great joy to travel around the country, particularly in the west and around the Minister's own area in the south and south-west and to see so many foreign-registered cars travelling around our land enjoying the beauty and, indeed, enjoying meeting Irish people.</P>
      <P>I am afraid many of those foreign visitors who were here in those years have not been back here since.  If they came back they would see that a major change has taken place.  Much of it has been referred to by previous speakers here today, last week and the week before during this debate.  I will not repeat those complaints, but there are a few items which I feel strongly about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I continue, I wish to pay tribute to Deputy Ivan Yates, chairman of the Small Businesses Committee, who has put Trojan work into not only this report but earlier reports as well.  Indeed, he gave every member of that committee every opportunity of making their contribution. There was no hurry in dealing with the matter.  Indeed, much of the work we did on that committee was overtaken by Government action.  It was not that we were delaying but it was, I believe, that our chairman insisted on the thoroughness in bringing the report to be <Col N="1119" /> a worthwhile stage.  I also pay tribute to the vice-chairman of the committee who spoke at length here a couple of weeks ago on this report, Senator Michael Lynch.  All members of the committee worked hard on it and were anxious to have a worthwhile report put before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the relevant Minister hoping it would help the Minister in any future decisions, and many others who are engaged and interested in the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>There was quite an amount in the debate about the inadequacy of our communication system, both the telephone and transport systems.  I have received very many complaints from our visitors from abroad and, indeed, from our visitors from the country to the Dublin area. They have complained bitterly about the communication facilities which are lacking in many respects.  Although I noticed it myself when I was having difficulty in regard to the telephone system, it was only when some visitors drew my attention to it that I realised that it is practically impossible to get the number one dials on a Monday or a Friday in the Dublin area.  I had not noticed it before, but I had known that I was spending a lot more time at the telephone and getting little result on those days.  When I took note of it I made sure to cut down on my telephone calls during both those days.  It is probable that the telephone is used very much by industry on both Mondays and Fridays, with travellers reporting to their firms and firms giving instructions to their travellers.  There is an overload and the capacity does not seen to be there to carry the extra burden.  These are two prime days for tourists because tourists generally leave on a weekend and arrive on a weekend.  After arriving they want to make contact with those they have left behind or to make contact with other areas of the country which they may wish to visit.  That would account for some of the extra calls on Mondays and on Fridays.  When they are departing, they may want to make contact to thank those whom they have visited, either in the city or in parts of the country, and to notify <Col N="1120" /> their relatives at home, whether in Ireland or on any part of the Continent, that they are now about to depart on their return journeys.  I hope that the people responsible for the telephone communications will take into account the difficulty that is being experienced on those days.</P>
    <P>Another pet subject of mine &mdash; I have raised it at my local authority meetings on a number of occasions &mdash; is road signs. I believe they are totally inadequate. Even where they do not exist and where adequate road signs are erected, very often they are pointing in the wrong direction.  I have asked my local authority on a number of occasions if it was not possible to design a road sign that cannot be moved.  We are still depending on these poles that are erected at crossroads, but it is quite easy to move these road signs.  Indeed, there are some road signs in my own county which the local authority has to fix two, three and four times a year.  I do not think it would be a difficult thing to put a screw into the pole to ensure that that road sign, which laps around the pole at the base, could not be moved.  There is one road sign to which I have brought the local authority's attention.  Every time I pass it I notice it. People from the country who pass it often when visiting the city of Dublin to see relatives in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, are confused by this sign.  There is a road sign on the western road and I am sure many of the Senators who travel that road will notice, just after Ballyfermot, that if you were to follow the direction coming from the city to get to Crumlin, you would be sent into the city rather than across by Ballyfermot. Each time I look at it, it is inevitably turned in the wrong direction.  That is only one example.  There are thousands of signs throughout this country sending people in the wrong direction.  Of course, the locals know about it.  They do not even notice because they know the roads.</P>
    <P>It is quite noticeable, certainly to me, when crossing the Border into Northern Ireland that you can have a map in the car &mdash; I know it is not advisable to read maps when driving &mdash; and get to your <Col N="1121" /> destination without making one wrong turn, but that cannot be done in the Republic.  If you have any distance to travel, you will find one or many of the road signs facing in the wrong direction. It is to be regretted that we do not pay attention to this detail because strangers can be misled.  A visitor is only here for a day or a week and is gone and does not usually complain about it.  The local person does not mind because he does not even see it.  He knows the roads and he does not need a road sign.  I wish local authority personnel and engineers were more observant when travelling the roads and that they would take into consideration the purpose of the signs.  Their purpose is to direct the stranger, not the native or the local.</P>
    <P>I have watched in this city and when I drive outside it the difference in the pollution levels.  I am an person who has lived all but four years of my life in the Dublin area but I would have to admit that Dublin must rate as one of the dirtiest cities in Europe.  I am sorry to have to say that.  It is not an Irish problem as some people have attempted to point out in this debate.  I do not believe it is an Irish problem because I have gone to other parts of the country, such as the south-eastern coast where there ane many beautiful towns, but I do not find papers or cigarette cartons on the street, certainly in the summertime when I travelled those towns.  There are bad patches. However, there are many places that can keep their areas clean, but Dublin is not one of them.  I regret that I have to say it, because I have lived my life in Dublin and I have seen this situation deteriorate in my time.  In other words, Dublin was a much cleaner place when I was a younger man.</P>
    <P>Perhaps local authorities do not do all they should do or all they could do in this regard.  There are regulations there which are not enforced.  But certainly the people do not do all they could.  There is nothing more annoying to me when travelling behind a car than to see the window turned down and the chocolate wrapper or the cigarette carton thrown out the window or some other litter.  I go <Col N="1122" /> to the extent, sometimes to the embarrassment of those in the car with me, of hooting my horn at the people responsible for such behaviour.  Some local authorities, indeed Dublin County Council, issue litter bags for cars, which can be placed in the front of the car and sweet wrappings or cigarette cartons can be put in this bag.  It is a good idea, but I do not believe the local authorities push it enough.  These bags should be readily available in all filling stations, libraries and local authority offices throughout the country.  While I am saying that, I believe Dublin is the dirtiest &mdash; indeed I would go further and say it is the dirtiest city in Europe.  There should be a national campaign against this type of minor pollution. Everybody talks about the polluting of rivers, which is a very important matter, and other major pollution stories we heard about, but I believe we should start with small things &mdash; the single sweet wrapper thrown away, the plastic bag from the bag of crisps or the plastic bags coming from the sweet shops and supermarkets. If we were to educate our people that these are to be disposed of in a proper manner, then we would be going a long way to correcting the major pollution cases in the country.</P>
    <P>I am appalled at the amount of pilfering that takes place on the streets of this city. There are very many visitors to our town, and indeed these are the people who are spotted by those who are pilfering rather than the natives.  They have a method of doing it.  It is happening today, not too far from where we are.  It has been happening for the last four or five years on a major scale.  Youngsters, very often no older than ten years of age, operate in groups of two, three or four at a time. They approach you.  Normally it is a teenage girl with a shawl around her, pretending to have a baby in arms and begging. They put their hand against your chest and all your attention is then directed to this person, when it is the person behind you who is doing the damage.  We read an article in one of the evening newspapers recently where a purse had been taken from a lady's handbag in Henry Street or Grafton Street.  Many of you have read <Col N="1123" /> it.  Another person saw this happening and called the gardaí and had this young person apprehended.  When the gardaí apprehended the young person &mdash; he was 14 or 15 &mdash; he had £600 in his possession and it can fairly be said that that £600 did not belong to him.  It had come into his possession in the way in which I have described.</P>
    <P>I know of an Italian who, a couple of months ago, coming up College Green lost £250 in this way.  A 17 year old boy on O'Connell Bridge last Saturday lost £400 in this way.  It baffles me that the Garda cannot pull these wrongdoers in, have them charged or have them removed from the street in some way. You do not have to take my word for it.  If you were to go down there this afternoon, I am sure that you would see these young people operating.  They are mostly from the travelling community. Some of them come in from my own area. I spoke to them there.  They are operating in front of Trinity College.  They look for the tourist.  They look for the person least suspicious of their activities.  I cannot understand how this is allowed to continue. It has been written about in the foreign press.  I read about it in a newspaper from London, I have read about it in a German magazine.  Why can we not stop it?  Everybody knows they are there. Everybody knows who they are.  Why can we not move in and have them removed from the streets?  It is an embarrassment to us.  It is affecting our tourist trade because we are now getting bad publicity abroad by these happenings.</P>
    <P>The German magazine carried an article about the high rate of car thieving in Dublin.  Naturally, any German reading that would turn his attention to Spain, Switzerland or the Isle of Man or some other place where they would feel safer bringing their cars.  We have to clear up both the pollution in this city and this kind of petty thievery in the streets &mdash; petty perhaps when we think of the bank robberies or the post office robberies that have been taking place over the years. But it is not petty to that boy of 17 years who lost his £400 last Saturday and it was <Col N="1124" /> not petty to the Italian who lost his £250. I am quite sure it was not a petty crime to the person who lost the £600 that was found on the boy only last week on the streets of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have done a great job for tourism.  They have been battling against the tide over the last number of years because of many of the things that I have referred to, because of the troubles in the North that have affected our whole island and because of the bank robberies here. All those things affect our tourist trade because they get publicity abroad.  A few years ago the city street thieving would never have got this publicity abroad, but now the tourist operators in all countries are alive to what is happening in other countries.  Naturally, the tourists who spend some time here are affected by the theft of a car or the loss of their money and are going to report to the tourist people in their home country.  It is bound to affect us.  I believe something can be done about some of the things I have mentioned today.  There are simple things that could easily be handled by those in authority.</P>
    <P>I have envied on occasions the west and south getting massive grants for road building and all sorts of improvements to attract people to their areas.  I did not begrudge it to them, but when I return to my own part of the country I find poor roads which were there 30, 50 and 100 years ago.  I am very proud of what Bord Fáilte have done for the country over the years.  I believe a lot more could be done, not necessarily by Bord Fáilte but by many other agencies.  Many of us were complimentary of the booklet we received in recent days from the National Parks and Monuments Service showing ring forts, archaeological sites, court tombs and passage tombs throughout the country.  It is an excellent document.  It gives a taste of what is to be seen in our country.  It is entitled <i>Irish Field Monuments.</i> There are many people in Europe today deeply interested in exploring and learning about these tombs and forts.</P>
    <P>There are also many Irish people interested in it.  More publications and advertising like that will help people to make <Col N="1125" /> up their minds where they should go in this country and what is to be seen.  There are many people in many towns who could do a lot more in this regard because most towns in Ireland are steeped in history and have a lot to offer the wandering tourist.  They will have to do more in future to attract people into the towns. Every time we travel a road after a lapse of two or three years we find that there are by-passes, which are welcomed by all travellers, of one town or another. Because of road construction in many parts of the country many of these interesting towns, are going to be missed by the tourist from abroad or even our native tourists.  This is to be regretted.  It is up to the business people in these towns who benefit from tourists to wake up and work together to ensure that we get more and more simple pamphlets informing us of what is in the town, because the average tourist will not automatically go into that town now if he has a by-pass to take him on to the next area he wants to visit.  It is important that each town would keep an eye out when the engineers start to construct a by-pass.  Take one town in the west, Athenry.  I believe hundreds of thousands of people who, if they had known about it would have been delighted to visit and learn about Athenry and its walls &mdash; it is a town steeped in history &mdash; have by-passed it.  There are many examples throughout the length and breadth of the country where tourists could be attracted to the towns but are not simply because they are not aware of what the town has to offer.  It is up to the townspeople themselves to do something about it.</P>
    <P>We have an anomaly with regard to registered and unregistered premises. Much has been said about this subject over the years.  I am sure the Minister if he were here would be saying &mdash; at least in his mind &mdash;&ldquo;I have heard it all before&rdquo;. I think a lot of it is worth repeating. An anomaly exists regarding the bed and breakfast registered and unregistered premises.  In this town there are many registered bed and breakfast premises, small hotels with eight, ten or 15 bedrooms, <Col N="1126" /> doing a fair business but struggling to keep going.  Very often in the same street you can have an unregistered premises with the same number of bedrooms who do not have to comply with the same rules and regulations as the registered premises.  All premises of that size should be registered although perhaps not the private house which has two, three or four bedrooms where a family run bed and breakfast for part of the year or even for the full year.  Private houses mostly operate for only a few months when they can make extra money and give employment and bring visitors to their area.</P>
    <P>They do a very fine job.  But in the centre of the city we have an anomaly regarding registered and unregistered premises whereby the owners of unregistered premises do not have to pay rates, even though they may have 12 or 15 bedrooms, while his next door neighbour who is registred with Bord Fáilte must pay rates of perhaps £2,000 or £3,000. That is an extra burden on the registered premises to keep up with the person next door, who naturally can give a cheaper rate for bed and breakfast.  On top of local authority charges there is also VAT on turnover.  If a premises is registered, they are allowed to have a turnover of £12,000, without paying VAT, whereas the unregistered premises is allowed £48,000 &mdash; a handsome turnover and no requirement to pay VAT.  That is not the worst aspect of the anomaly regarding registered and unregistered premises. The worst aspect is that there are many complaints by visitors about the service they get in unregistered premises.  They may complain about meals or the conditions of unregistered premises, but no inspection can take place.</P>
    <P>Whatever about paying rates or VAT there is no excuse for the Minister not bringing in legislation requiring all bed and breakfast guesthouses, hotels, over a certain size, to be registered for at least inspection.  I do not see why they should not have to pay rates if the premises up the street is paying rates, doing the same business, the same amount of bedroom competing in the same area and depending <Col N="1127" /> on the same trade and customers.  If there is a complaint from that premises then there should be some agency authorised to carry out an inspection and have something done about it.  Nothing will do our tourist trade greater damage than to have low standards in hotels or guesthouses.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister &mdash; and I am sorry he is not here &mdash; to take steps to correct this anomaly and to ensure that whether business people would be required to pay rates or turnover tax at the same rate as those registered, there should be some kind of registration or agency.  The responsibility rests with the Minister to ensure that when a complaint is made regarding bad service, a poor breakfast, bedclothes, dirty conditions and so on in a guesthouse, there should be an agency to investigate that matter and to take corrective action.  Registered premises are subject to inspection and correction, if necessary.  An unregistered premises operating on the same street, with the same trade and customers is not subject to any inspection.  Bord Fáilte cannot interfere no matter how many complaints they get about unregistered premises.  This situation cannot be allowed to continue.  I appeal to the Minister to take steps in his time, perhaps before the tourist season begins next year, to ensure that that situation does not continue in this city or country.  It is more prevalent in Dublin City, particularly in the inner city areas because one does not get as large a guesthouse in other parts of the country and most of them of that size are registered as they are depending on Bord Fáilte to send visitors. But in Dublin City they are not depending on Bord Fáilte or any agency to send the business to them; all they have to do is put a sign up outside and the business flows in.  They are not subject to the same regulations regarding payment of rates, payment of VAT or inspection or where there is a complaint.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see so many people taking an interest in this report of the committee, of which I am a member, and also in the Government White Paper. <Col N="1128" /> This is the first White Paper on tourism policy.  It is a step in the right direction. I hope these documents will be taken seriously, considered and acted on quickly.  I hope the Minister will take into account all that has been said in this debate, all that is in those documents and that some action will be taken to get back to the situation of the 1960s, in bringing hundreds of thousands of foreigners here. Our need was never greater for more and more people to come here to see us and to spend their money.  They are only too willing to do that if we would only give them the opportunity and the encouragement. But first we have got to look to ourselves and make it worth their while to come here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that we are debating the White Paper on Tourism Policy.  It is appropriate that we should at the same time consider the Report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses, dealing with tourism, catering and leisure.  I compliment the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister of State for the amount of work and dedication put into the production of the White Paper.  As the previous speaker said, it is the first White Paper we have had on tourism policy.  It is the first indication that an Irish Government has given that they are examining what tourism is all about, examining where we have come from in terms of developing a State policy and determining a direction for the future.  I also compliment the chairman of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses, Deputy Yates, and the hard working members of that committee for the production of a very good third report by that commitee, dealing with tourism catering and leisure.  It is important to realise that we are talking about one of the most important of all our Irish industries.  We are talking about an industry within which we in this country have a vast natural resource and within which we have the raw material easily available to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important that we pause for a moment and ask ourselves the question, has the State in the past given sufficient <Col N="1129" /> indirect financial support to tourism?  The State may directly grant-aid Bord Fáilte. The State may directly grant-aid outlets which assist the tourist industry in one way or another.  But we must ask ourselves the question, is the State not, on the other hand, indirectly and unintentionally or perhaps due to lack of thought, taking steps which are actually inhibiting the development of tourism?  I believe that the State is so doing.  I would urge the Minister and the Minister of State to ensure that in the forthcoming budget the level of VAT payable in respect of various tourist services is examined.  The level of VAT payable in respect of meals provided by restaurants and in respect of certain other tourism activities is much too high.  One of the problems we are now facing is that the cost of spending a holiday here for the outsider and also for the Irish person is becoming unrealistically high.  To try to hide that fact is being unrealistic.  It is not the fault of this Governemt or their predecessor, but it is the cumulative fault of various decisions taken by successive Governments which are affecting the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon referred to the rates structure.  I agree with him that there are many inequities existing within the valuation and rating system.  One of the most obvious of these is the very high level of rates which small seasonal hotels have to pay and that is an example of the indirect taxation policy which affects the tourism industry.  It is totally unrealistic that hotels which are open for two or three months of the year, which experience a very short tourist season, are burdened with taxation that treats them as though they were open for 12 months of the year.  The sooner that problem is examined the better.  The Minister comes from the south-west coast.  I come from the west coast and both of our counties have within them a considerable number of outlets which are open for a very short period every year and which now find themselves increasingly threatened by virtue of a number of circumstances, but particularly by virtue of the very, very heavy rates burden which they have to <Col N="1130" /> bear.  The future of Irish tourism in great measure is dependent on the small family hotels and on the small seasonal outlets but, unfortunately, that type of outlet is in jeopardy at the moment.</P>
    <P>There are indirect aspects of taxation which affect the tourist industry but, at the same time, I should like to welcome the items contained in the recently published public capital programme for 1986 which benefit tourism.  I wish to compliment the Minister and the Minister of State on ensuring that the Government became aware of how they can assist the tourist industry.  I welcome in great measure the inclusion in the public capital programme of the caravan and camping grant scheme which provides that grants up to a maximum of 60 per cent may be made available.  In my own part of the country where we have two very excellent caravan and camping sites, namely, the Clew Bay Caravan Park owned by the Gill family and the Westport House Caravan Park owned by the Earl of Altamount, both of these have received certain assistance in the past.  The commitment by the Government to make further moneys available for this type of endeavour in the capital programme is a realistic decision.  The future of tourism to a great extent lies on the self-catering side.  Recent trends have indicated that there is a movement away from the hotel or guesthouse sector to the self-catering type of holiday.  It is evident that the number of foreigners, particularly from mainland Europe to Ireland are tending to enjoy our facilities within the confines of the caravan or camping site spectrum. Therefore, it is wise that the Government should assist this type of development.</P>
    <P>The public capital programme for 1986 also makes provision for the supplementary holiday accommodation scheme.  I am very glad that the special grant level of 66 per cent is maintained in respect of the non-Gaeltacht offshore islands in special development areas.  I should like to see the Minister's Department, Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations making the existence of these grants known to people who are fledglings <Col N="1131" /> in the tourist business but who are anxious to commence development in the special development areas and particularly in the offshore non-Gaeltacht islands.  The offshore islands, both Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht, have a lot to offer in terms of tourism.  Off the Mayo coast we have experienced the tremendous developments which have taken place on Clare Island, the development of an excellent hotel owned by the Grady family and the development of other ancillary activities which have developed around that hotel.  All of these have developed around the enterprise, enthusiasm and investment of one person.  It is only right that the State should make grant assistance available for this type of activity in the tourism area.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the public capital programme envisages making available something over £1 million to support various tourism development areas such as angling, inland cruising, waterways development, recreational facilities, sailing and equestrian facilities.  These are the facilities which attract the tourist to Ireland.  We must make them available in greater numbers.  These are the facilities which at the moment are being developed by individuals very frequently without the type of State support which is necessary, but nevertheless these are the facilities which encourage outsiders to come to Ireland.  I would like to see grants in this area being made available to people who wish to avail of them.  If that is done we can make a much better tourism substructure available.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the public capital programme provides additional aid to the ICC in respect of the provision of moneys for fixed asset investment.  It is extremely important that that kind of money be available to the ICC and also that the facts about the availability and the terms on which that type of money will be made available within the tourism sector are communicated to the people who might avail of it.  One of the problems is that very frequently the type of assistance which the State can offer, either directly <Col N="1132" /> through the Minister's Department, through Bord Fáilte, through the regional tourism organisations or indeed through local authorities is not made known to those people who might avail of it.</P>
    <P>The White Paper refers in a direct way in Chapter 17 to the institutional arrangements available within tourism.  By that I mean principally Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations.  I wish to express concern at the suggestions contained in paragraph 17.2 in regard to a diminution of the function of the regional tourism organisations.  It is somewhat ambiguous in this regard in that there are suggestions that on the one hand there will be a centralisation of functions while, on the other hand, there is a suggestion that certain functions currently carried out at central level will be decentralised. It may, of course, be a suggestion that there is simply going to be a swopping of roles, that Bord Fáilte will be conferring on the regional tourism organisations some of their functions while, at the sametime, taking back some of the functions which the regional tourism organisations possess.</P>
    <P>The problem is that there is concern on the ground about this statement. There is concern within the Mayo-Galway tourism regions about the future of Ireland-West tourism and I am quite sure there is concern in other regional tourism areas about their future.  It is extremely important that the Government make known at the earliest possible moment their commitment to regional tourism organisations and to Bord Fáilte. As long as this uncertainty continues the tourism industry can only be damaged.  I ask the Minister to make his position in that regard clear as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the regional tourism organisations for the work they have done.  I am currently the director of one company in my capacity as a member of Mayo County Council, namely, Louisburgh Holidays.  Another director is the director of the Ireland-West Regional Development Tourism Organisation.  I have become aware of the work which the regional tourism <Col N="1133" /> organisation are carrying out in a practical, on-the-ground way and they must be allowed to continue with that work.  I should like to get an assurance from the Minister that they will not be inhibited in doing that.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also refers to the fact that our tourist industry is essentially a seasonal industry.  It makes the point that there is a need to move away from the seasonality or rather to broaden the existing accepted tourist season.  I accept that. I think it is extremely important that we sell the advantages we have to the tourist outside the normal, accepted tourism season.  We have, within this country, many facilities which many people would like to avail of, facilities within the health care sector, facilities which can be availed of in autumn, winter and early spring.  I refer to our facilities for walking, our facilities for mountain climbing, our facilities for simply enjoying winter scenery. It is extremely important that facilities of that nature should be communicated to the public worldwide, to allow them to avail of what we have.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the White Paper to the possibility of developing the international conference tourism sector.  That should be done because we have the facilities in terms of raw materials.  Bord Fáilte should make substantial sums of money available to develop conference centres at suitable vantage points throughout the country to allow Ireland to avail of that tourism market.  If we are to do that then it is important that the whole broad tourism infrastructure should be properly developed.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator McMahon speak about the inadequate level of signposting.  Anybody who has had the experience of driving around the country in a Seanad campaign, as some of us have been condemned to do on occasion, will know that our signposting system is totally inadequate.  I remember on one occasion being in mid-Cork on a wintry morning and I asked a garda how to get to some place.  He asked me where I was coming from and I realised I did not quite know where I was coming from and when I indicated to him where I was going I <Col N="1134" /> was not quite sure where I was going to either.  The level of signposting is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>It would be a good idea if we were to develop one of the Department of Labour youth employment schemes for the purpose of examining the entire signposting system at the moment and consider ways of improving it.  I also heard Senator McMahon refer to town bypasses. I agree with him; many towns which are potential tourist attractions are now by-passed.  Certainly, where towns are by-passed special signs should be made available to indicate the attractiveness or the particular features which a tourist would find pleasurable in that by-passed town.</P>
    <P>We can do small things to make the country more attractive.  Why do CIE have to adopt the old drab, grey colour for their buildings?  Why is travelliing by CIE frequently so dismal by virtue of what you see?  There was a time when CIE organised station garden competitions. There was a prize every year for the best kept station garden.  That is all gone with the wind now.  Instead, CIE paint their stations in 19th century drab, mortuary grey.  They are a most unattractive type of building for anybody to even look at.  CIE should get out the paint brushes and paint pots and paint their stations in bright colours of greens and reds and purples, to make them look interesting and attractive.  The same applies to post offices and to various transport centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of tourism infrastructure which the Department should look at is the old question of a regional airport. We in Mayo have a small airport at Castlebar which is useful and we have a less small airport in Barnacuille bog.  The Government should have another look at the Connacht Regional Airport.  It has proved its worth and it has proved its worth in the sense that people have departed from there already this year but, sadly, we now read that there are financial difficulties arising.  In terms of assisting tourism in the west steps should be taken to try to ensure that that airport <Col N="1135" /> operates in a reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>Funds should also be made available to continue the excellent work recently commenced on the cleaning of our canals.  More funds should be made available to clean our rivers, our lakes and our small bays.  These are areas which are used within the tourism industry and they have fallen into neglect and decay.  Something should be done to try to restore them because they are all raw material for this great industry of ours.</P>
    <P>There is one other area I want refer to which was mentioned in the national plan but on which, for some reason, the Government have not taken any action. That is the urgently needed reform of the licensing laws.  At the time the suggestion was made that normal licensing hours would be extended.  There was some opposition from particular lobbies.  It is my belief, coming from a tourist area, that there is an urgent need to extend the normal licensing hours in the summer months.  The existing licensing hours, both for Sundays and week-days are inadequate and unsuitable, not merely from the point of view of the tourist industry but also from the point of view of the farming community who may be busy until dark in the summer months and they then find, when they can have a well-earned drink, that the public house is closed.  This Government should not run away from this problem.  There is worry on the part of certain people in certain Departments when it comes to amending certain laws.  If there is one voice raised they run and the promised legislation is not introduced.  The licensing hours should be extended, certainly in the summer months.  That should be done before next spring.  If that is not done, that is another commitment in the national plan which we in this Government will not have carried out and it will be another failure which neither the Minister nor I want to live with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get the Minister's assurance on that.  I also believe <Col N="1136" /> that the liquor licensing laws governing restaurants should be amended.  We have the ludicrous situation that somebody can go to a good restaurant and have a good meal and cannot be supplied with Irish drinks in terms of liqueurs or spirits or beer.  That is totally unacceptable and totally ludicrous and a situation which is very difficult to explain to the foreign tourist who comes to our land.  The position regarding the licensing of our restaurants should be somewhat similar to the licensing of hotels whereby for a hotel to obtain a licence to sell intoxicating liquor &mdash; albeit through a hatch &mdash; they must have the approval of Bord Fáilte Éireann.  The same standard should be applied to our restaurants.  I am not suggesting in any way that every fish and chip shop in the country should have an intoxicating liquor licence.  I would be appalled if that were the situation.  Outlets which reach a certain standard of acceptability in the books of Bord Fáilte should be entitled to obtain a licence.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to chapter 11 of the report which deals with tourism amenities and facilities.  I refer in particular to historic monuments and houses.  This is again an area where much can be done, indirectly, to assist owners of monuments which are attractive to the travelling public at large.  We had an example of this in last year's Finance Act when, following very strong representations made by my friend, Senator O'Connor of Roscommon and others, the Minister for Finance agreed to amend the Finance Act to ensure that a particular tax burden would not fall on the owners of Clonallis House, the seat of the ancient O'Connor family in County Roscommon.  By doing that the Minister ensured that this ancient estate, with its wonderful collection of historic books, documents and manuscripts, was retained intact and that its collection would be available to the public as it has been for some years. That was an indirect measure by the State which had a beneficial effect on tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as historic houses and gardens are concerned the State must do far more.  We had the appalling spectacle some years ago when the Earl of Ross <Col N="1137" /> had to sell a lot of the contents of Birr Castle.  Birr Castle is not open to the public but the gardens surrounding Birr Castle are open to the public.  We have the appalling position at present where Westport House, seat of the Marquis of Sligo, and one of the most historic Georgian mansions in Ireland, is no longer being publicised in literature from Bord Fáilte offices.  The reason it is no longer being publicised is that certain of the activities being carried out by the owners of Westport House Estate, namely one or two of their holiday homes, do not reach the standard of acceptability which is approved by Bord Fáilte.  For that reason alone Bord Fáilte now black Westport House in their literature.  No tourist office in Ireland will carry literature advertising the existence of Westport House or its contents.</P>
    <P>It is quite an appalling situation when at the moment we have in the National Gallery an exhibition of the paintings of James Arthur O'Connor, one of the most famous 18th-19th century Irish landscape painters while at the same time the best and most expensive private collection of his painting in the country, that in Westport House, is not publicised by our tourism office.  At the same time Bord Fáilte will publicise Westport House Caravan Park which is another activity operated by the same owner.  It is publicised but because other activities &mdash; private holiday homes on the Westport House Estate and elsewhere &mdash; do not reach sufficiently high standards, the historic mansion is blacked.  I regard that as a totally unacceptable situation.  I would ask the Minister to bring that up imediately with Bord Fáilte and to ensure satisfactory resolution of that impasse.</P>
    <P>Westport House is the tourism focus of the west of Ireland.  It is the focal point betwen Lissadel in Sligo and Connemara. It is the focal point that brings so many people into County Mayo and yet this house with its collection of paintings, documents, silver and furniture is not publicised by Bord Fáilte.  I have made representations to Bord Fáilte on this issue but I have received very unsatisfactory <Col N="1138" /> replies.  I believe that the time has come when a ministerial directive, if that is possible, should issue to the board to demand the carrying of literature dealing with Westport House.  Once that is done, if there are outstanding issues to be negotiated let them be negotiated.  Bord Fáilte is the national tourism agency and it should facilitate all reasonable tourism promoters.</P>
    <P>While I am speaking about heritage houses and gardens I pay tribute to the work done by An Taisce and the Irish Georgian Society in this regard.  If one examines the Darner House in Roscrea, Castletown House in Celbridge and indeed the contents of Castletown House which have been reassembled, as it were, over the past 20 years, one can appreciate the tremendous work being done by these two bodies, particularly by the Irish Georgian Society.  I think it is time, that these bodies got greater support from the State.  Their work should be given the type of aid that is necessary.  What they have achieved to date has been achieved through voluntary effort.  I think that the pious platitudes in the White Paper dealing with historic monuments and houses will remain just that until this State indicates a willingness to help in a positive way the owners or occupiers of them.</P>
    <P>I also commend the work of the national forest service in the development of parks and facilities of that nature. The development of the King-Harmon estate in Boyle and more recently the Connemara Forest Park are certainly living monuments to the tremendous work being done by this body.  I also think in this regard that the State should try to encourage local authorities to examine within their areas existing forest belts and existing clumps of trees worthy of preservation and which can be preserved and that steps should be taken to ease the making of preservation orders by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Chapter 9 of the report which is headed &ldquo;Environment&rdquo;. Chapter 9 (1), which I will read into the Official Report, sets the background fairly well.  It states:</P>
    <P>The environment is of primary <Col N="1139" /> importance to the overall tourism product.  The economic and employment benefits of tourism would be severely eroded if environmental conditions were permitted to decline. Careful management of the environment is therefore an economic necessity as well as a social issue.  The Irish environment is in many respects cleaner than that of the home countries of many of our visitors.  It is important that the image of a clean environment is preserved.  Indeed it makes sound economic sense to bolster this image by investing in environmental management and pollution control and in the preservation and development of amenities.</P>
    <P>I agree totally with that statement.  In this regard there are certain steps which could and should be taken.  Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations should have a much closer liaison with local authorities in connection with the revamping or the re-examination of town and county development plans.  If they do that, then the tourism interest can have a much greater input into the steps which local authorities take in terms of environmental protection.  Quite an amount can be done in that area.</P>
    <P>The regional tourist organisations should continue the interest they are showing in the Tidy Towns Competition. This is a most important competition in terms of improving the appearance of our villages and towns and indeed I was very impressed this year to see the operation in my own town of Westport of the various facilities available, the local authoritly working with the Chamber of Commerce and the Junior Chamber of Commerce and working with the aid of the social employment scheme under which we had 26 young workers cleaning up our environment and our town.  That has had the effect of improving our overall position in the Tidy Towns Competition. Unfortunately, many other towns did not avail of the social employment scheme for that purpose.  Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations should <Col N="1140" /> communicate with the local authorities, tell them what is available and encourage them to avail of the resources which are there to try to ensure that they can play a better and more constructive role in next year's Tidy Towns Competition.</P>
    <P>I would also commend the role of the Junior Chamber of Commerce nationwide in developing competitions like the Tidy Shop Fronts and Better Shop Fronts competitions.  It is amazing how shop fronts can make a town attractive or how shop fronts can make a town unattractive. The best example of that is to walk down the most glorious thoroughfare in this country, namely O'Connell Street, and one can see how what was a magnificent street has been devastated by the cheap and demeaning plastic burger signs of so many retail food outlets on that one street.  The presentation in terms of shop frontage is extremely important.  I am glad to see that many outlets are moving towards an improved type of shop front. I think that the Minister's Department, Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations can play their role to ensure-that there are overall improvements here.</P>
    <P>While I am speaking of Dublin I think it is a pity that there is not a national campaign for Dublin.  It is a pity to see this capital city deteriorating day by day. It was once a joy to walk through the streets of this city at night time to window shop.  Now you cannot do it.  The main streets are barricaded.  The windows are covered by steel grids.  One wonders about the adequacy of policing at night time along our central streets.  It is time that Bord Fáilte, principally as the national tourism organisation, communicated with the corporation of the city of Dublin to try and to get under way as speedily as possible a national campaign for Dublin to try to improve the city in terms of its overall appearance, to improve it as a walking-about zone for all the citizens and to improve the various historic sites and monuments, streets, squares and buildings in it.</P>
    <P>Also under the heading of environment, I would like to refer to one other area of legislation which I feel is not used <Col N="1141" /> sufficiently by local authorities and that is the derelict site legislation.  There is machinery there which my own urban district council in Westport use very effectively to clear derelict sites.  We have cleared many of our derelict sites.  We have done it in a way that has not affected the environment of our town.  Unfortunately, many local authorities are not using the machinery available under this legislation to clean up their areas.  The tourism bodies in this country should get in touch with the local authorities and encourage them to use the derelict site legislation.</P>
    <P>The final matter I want to raise under the heading of environment, and it relates to the town and county development plan, is the operation of the planning laws generally.  The tourism organisations must communicate with the local authorities and they must indicate their concern where there is concern at the inadequacies of planning or the manner in which the Planning Acts are carried out, monitored or controlled in particular local authority areas.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the whole question of our culture.  We have a lot to offer in terms of song, dance and language and in terms of the cultural environment which we have.  We have within or National Museum treasures which are unsurpassed.  Take for example, the Treasures of Ireland Exhibition, which was opened about two years ago in The Hague by the Minister for Education and which then moved to Berlin and to other cities of the world.  The effect of that exhibition was to promote Ireland, in the best sense possible.  There are many arte-facts and items worthy of being seen in the National Museum which have not seen the light of day for many years. There are other historic items in other bodies which have not seen the light of day for many years.  Perhaps the best example, since I am speaking in the Seanad Chamber, is the Seanad casket that is lying encased in its outer cage in the basement of the Royal Irish Academy, a most glorious item of the best Irish craftsmanship which until this House was removed from the constitutional scene by <Col N="1142" /> Mr. de Valera in 1936 was carried in here at the commencement of each Seanad hearing and placed on the Cathaoirleach's desk.  That magnificent casket is no longer available to sight, it is in the basement of the Royal Irish Academy. There is much in the basement of the building next door that we do not see.</P>
    <P>We must develop the idea of regional museums.  In this regard I was in touch with the Department of Education some time ago to see if a small grant could be given to allow the Earl of Altamont to make available his collection of historic documents in Westport House to the public in some safe way.  I was unsuccessful in my application.  I believe the State must encourage private individuals or State institutions who have items worthy of viewing to make available around the country places where these items can be seen.  I would ask the Minister to take positive steps in that regard.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that we are very privileged to have a White Paper on Tourism.  It gives us the opportunity to reflect on the importance of tourism to our overall economy.  It gives us the opportunity to reflect on where our tourism policy should go from here.  I would hope that the debate on this White Paper will continue in the other House.  I hope the Minister and his Department will encourage that debate to be carried through into every local authority, into every school, into every chamber of commerce and every junior chamber of commerce, into every body interested in tourism in Ireland.  I believe that, if we do that, at the end of the day we will be able to produce an overall tourism plan to guide us through into the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaMcAuliffeEnnis" hpid="Mrs. McAuliffe-Ennis Mrs. McAuliffe-Ennis">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McAuliffe-Ennis</NameTxt>
      <P>A short time ago I read with interest that the hotel, tourism and catering industry was classed by Manpower as the top employer in the country.  There are 62,500 people employed in the hotel and catering industry with definite potential for 2,000 new jobs by the end of this year.  Seventy three per cent of these jobs are full time and permanent, with the remainder being seasonal, and the main growth areas are <Col N="1143" /> forecast to be hotels, restaurants and in general catering areas.  This happy situation exists despite all the difficulties that the industry copes with, including the fact that less than one-third of all our managers are formally trained, and one wonders what the figures would be if all the difficulties with which the industry as a whole is faced were to be sorted out.  I have no doubt this industry is operating away below potential and that the prospects for expansion are massive.</P>
      <P>Over 80 per cent of the business associated with tourism is in the small business sector and, being concerned with the service industry, is labour intensive.  Benefits are spread right throughout the economy &mdash; food, accommodation, drink, transport, entertainment, crafts, clothes and so on.  Compared with areas like agriculture and industry, tourism is certainly the cinderella when it comes to back-up from official level.  For example, State funding to tourism was £28 million in 1984 compared with £255 million to agriculture in the same year.  A comparable figure in terms of export value would demand a minimum investment level of three times the amount in funding.  Given that tourism does not contribute to the black hole syndrome and that the return to the Exchequer is so great &mdash; some estimates say it is 68p in the pound &mdash; the discrepancies bear further examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourism branch of the Department of Industry has a staff of nine and is backed up in the areas of promotion and development by the statutory body, Bord Fáilte.  Tourist information is provided by the regional tourism organisations.  The total staff for tourism is approximately 490.  By comparison, the total staff for agriculture is approximately 7,500.  Other Departments which back up the tourism allocation include Fisheries and Forestry, Office of Public Works, SFADCo, Communications and Environment.  So, it is evident that this major sector of the economy is scattered across a plethora of Departments in a slapdash manner with no one Department committed to achieving order, stability and reasonable levels of uniformity in this sector.  This results <Col N="1144" /> in a peak season of short duration with little or no activity outside of that particular time.</P>
    <P>Tourism is the third highest generator of foreign earnings in Ireland.  It is also one of the most labour intensive, generating two jobs in other sectors &mdash; retail, entertainment, Irish goods, transport and so on &mdash; which, in turn, is largely spent back into the economy.</P>
    <P>Given the international tourism is increasing and that the growth is expected to be maintained, it is fair to say that Ireland should address itself to gaining an increased turnover.  This will not come about without a conscious effort to produce policies which are relevant to market requirements.  For example, if you examine the difficulties involved in actually getting to Ireland it is obvious that the transport agencies should co-operate fully in overcoming these difficulties.  Alas, this does not seem to be the case.  Aer Lingus are downright uncompetitive on certain routes &mdash; they have a monopoly and are often tardy in announcing fares &mdash; while in the sea transport area decisions on sailings seem to be taken without any consultation with tourism interests but purely as a matter relevant to the Department of Communications.</P>
    <P>Since tourism is the third largest generator of foreign earnings after agriculture and industry, one often wonders how it achieved this position given the somewhat haphazard approach which is exemplified in the while sea of planning and development and also in view of the obvious need for an integrated tourism policy. Let us examine different aspects of tourism and consider areas of major influence.  Bord Fáilte spent £10 million of its £25 million allocation in 1984 on marketing, to market Ireland as a whole and not in sub-sectors which would yield greater benefit.  For example, more money could be spent in aid to tour operators and on marketing executives and so on.  Furthermore, Bord Fáilte tend to employ Irish personnel abroad.  I question the wisdom of this and often wonder if local staff would not have a greater nose for the needs and requirements of <Col N="1145" /> their own countrymen and thereby devise packages and so on to cater for the many and varied tastes.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that Bord Fáilte apply a particular marketing strategy in relation to the United States.  I am speaking with particular reference to the American package market.  In 1984, 27 per cent of the total American trade to Ireland was package.  Of that, 90 per cent, who stayed for a while in Dublin, stayed in hotels like The Westbury, The Burlington and The Berkeley Court, while outside Dublin the main types of hotels used were The Great Southern and a few others. All other types of hotel were used by 8 per cent; farmhouses and guesthouses were used by 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I have to ask why.  The only answer I can find is that this is a deliberate marketing strategy.  This is the only type of package tour aimed at the American market. Is it any wonder then that we are perceived to be expensive?  If you or I go into any of these types of hotels we will pay £60 to £80 per night for a bed.  We will pay nearly £2 for a short and a mixer, £1.50 for a pint and roughly £5 for tea and sandwiches for two.</P>
    <P>I carried out a few tests of my own which revealed some very interesting information.  Some friends and I took turns to phone the Dublin Bord Fáilte office.  We outlined the situation whereby a group of friends planned to visit Ireland, to fly in from America in the spring.  We asked where would Bord Fáilte recommend that they stay.  The answer was always the same: The Westbury, The Burlington and the Berkeley Court.  This happened a number of times.  We mentioned Jurys and were told.  &ldquo;Yes, I suppose they could stay there, too&rdquo;.  What does this mean?  The next question we investigated was ownership of these hotels and we did not have to look too far.  As is well known, these hotels are all owned by the same person who holds a very lofty position indeed in Bord Fáilte.  I would just pose the question: if Deputy Dick Spring or Deputy Garret FitzGerald or Deputy Charlie Haughey was the person in question, <Col N="1146" /> would there or would there not be comment?  I suggest to Bord Fáilte, lest they be perceived to accommodate vested interests, that perhaps the position of this individual could be re-examined.</P>
    <P>It can easily be said that these hotels offer the accommodation and so on required.  In my view, they offer stereotype accommodation which is available anywhere in the world &mdash; the standard twin-bedded room with TV and mini-bar along with built-in cabaret, some of it stage Irishness at its worst.  Ireland, if we are to survive in the tourism stakes, has to offer more, given our bad weather and so on.  Surely the job of Bord Fáilte is to promote Ireland and specific aspects of Irish life across a range of places and activities &mdash; in farmhouses, small family country hotels and so on &mdash; in other words, to spread the benefits around.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that this business should cease, rather am I saying that this end of the package tour business seems to be well on its feet and it is now time to go into other areas of potential within the package tour field.  For example, why not promote a package which would encourage European and UK bound passengers to spend a few days meandering through Ireland?  In 1984, two million Americans travelled direct to London and altogether six million travelled to Europe.  I assume the Irish figure of 344,000 American tourists is included in the eight million.  Do Bord Fáilte actively and aggressively tap into this potential? Given the mass exodus travelled for shopping and sightseeing, did Bord Fáilte actively promote our VAT-free favourable prices for cashmere, glass, arts and crafts to persuade these travellers to spend a few days?  I do not know, but I would be very interested to find out.</P>
    <P>One aspect of Irish life that Americans I have met admire is our pace of life, particularly in rural Ireland.  They are intrigued by the typical Irish kitchen, the bogs, the farmhouses and the country pubs.  I had 74 Americans in Westmeath this summer.  They were on a package tour and I invited them to Westmeath for a day.  We went to see the Royal Canal, both where it is restored and where works <Col N="1147" /> are in progress.  We went to see an old churchyard, a farm and then, of course, we finally adjourned to the local pub. They loved meeting the local characters who chatted and talked and, as we say in Westmeath, the crack was mighty.  I showed these very nice people a very real part of Ireland.  They saw what our reputation is built on &mdash; friendliness, easy pace and, despite the weather things which are uniquely Irish.  I know there is much criticism about accommodation outside the big type of hotels but we have a network of the finest and cheapest accommodation in the world in our registered B and Bs and farmhouses.  Let us promote them more.</P>
    <P>At local level in Westmeath I am particularly criticial of the tourist information set-up.  The tourist office is a mile from Mullingar town.  In effect, tourists come to Mullingar and are sent out of the town to go to see the Shannon and elsewhere &mdash; anywhere else but Mullingar. Can you just imagine that situation &mdash; a tourism promoting body a mile outside the county town?  It should be in the centre of the town with detailed information, as opposed to a few lines, about activities like fishing, places of interest, local historical and archaeological data, places to shop and eat and places of entertainment, sporting events and so on.  The list is endless.  I would like to see booklets entitled &ldquo;What to see in the Killucan area&rdquo;.  &ldquo;What to see in the Mullingar area&rdquo; etc.  Much of this data is readily available from historical, archaeological and other groups, but it is not documented and presented at the local tourist information outlets.</P>
    <P>I made an inquiry to the head office of Bord Fáilte about setting up a youth rambler hostel in the area and was told, quite rightly in current terms, that it would not be viable.</P>
    <P>The reason given was that our area is on the way to nowhere.  It is not on a main line.  Neither I would say, was the Ring of Kerry nor The Burren, but they are now.  This leads me to say that the impression I was given was that Killucan will remain a place to nowhere and that, <Col N="1148" /> without the type of marketing strategy which developed areas like the Ring of Kerry, Galway and so on, will remain within that category.  I detest this negative attitude from a marketing organisation and really feel that, while they are actually correct at the moment, the position can be and should be changed, even in the long term.</P>
    <P>Further afield in New York I visited the Bord Fáilte office on Fifth Avenue and I was not blown over by what I saw. It was just an ordinary office, nothing special, nothing different &mdash; just ordinary. I would like this office to reflect and show a little bit of Ireland.  For example, I want a decidedly Irish atmosphere in it as far as possible.  In other words, the office should reflect an aggressive promotion with all the promotional gimmicks, for want of a better word. Furthermore, I heard recently that Bord Fáilte are now in a position where they can no longer afford their Fifth Avenue ground floor office and are in the process of moving to Third Avenue on the nineteenth floor.  If this is true, I find it extraordinary that, instead of moving to a nineteenth floor on Third Avenue they would not combine with groups like Aer Lingus and other Irish bodies in the USA and open what could be called an Irish promotional centre.</P>
    <P>With regard to the United Kingdom market, the situation there is much different. The main factors in the decline of this market are the Northern troubles and, of course, our prices.  The Northern situation will be a factor until stability is restored.  The fact that we have lived with nearly two decades of violence in Northern Ireland has major consequences for the Republic in that continuous worldwide publicity has highlighted the situation.  The more serious effect indeed has been, as we all know, the decline in the numbers of British tourists travelling to Ireland.  As I said, the Northern issue has been the main one.</P>
    <P>Crime levels in Dublin have escalated, with obvious consequences for the tourist industry.  Prices and the cost of coming to Ireland are massive by any standard. Take the average person coming here <Col N="1149" /> from Britain.  He meets a stumbling block even before he leaves his own country. Access prices, which I have already referred to, are very high.  In fact, the London-Dublin air route is the most expensive in the world.  But hotel, travel, entertainment and food costs are outrageous, too, Car rental is another matter altogether.  For a typical family saloon prices vary between £560 amd £800 for two weeks rental.  Petrol at nearly £3 a gallon is prohibitive.  The cost of eating out and entertainment are a way above foreign levels.  There is much that can be done to alleviate the situation by all interests concerned.  I will outline these in more detail later on.</P>
    <P>The Government could certainly take steps by addressing the whole question of the cost of petrol.  A system would be, for example, to log passport numbers or drivers' licence numbers into a coupon book and take the mileage at entry and later at exit.  An average estimate of petrol used could be calculated on the basis of the excise duty content and a refund made.  I am simply saying that, if we apply our minds to the problem, some sort of system which will be of benefit to the tourists can be advised and ultimately will benefit the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The other area of Government intervention is the whole question of VAT and, in particular, the cooked food industry for the figure is now 23 per cent in sitdown areas.  This should be reduced to 10 per cent and could partly or wholly financed by a 10 per cent rate being imposed on take-away foods which currently have a zero rate.  It is ridiculous that one sector whose costs are considerably lower should be favoured over another sector of the cooked food industry. One restauranteur said to me: &ldquo;Ten per cent VAT was OK, 15 per cent was still not too bad, 18 per cent made us feel we had to do something, and at 23 per cent we have to fiddle&rdquo;.  That is the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>The whole question of standards greatly affects tourism.  Given that one third of our owner-managers had no formal training in the industry and that the return on investment in this sector has <Col N="1150" /> declined over the years, it is vital that high standards of management prevail in the areas of value for money, service, cleanliness, hygiene, accommodation and environment and, in my opinion, there is much room for improvement.</P>
    <P>In terms of value for money, it is very difficult to justify charges of 50p in hotels for local telephone calls or, indeed, 12½ per cent added on to your bill for service charge, regardless of whether you enjoyed your meal, or whether the service was good or indifferent, to charge for children who are sharing with parents in limited accommodation, or to charge £3.50 for children's menus which, in the main, offer junk food.  The hotels must take on board an active responsibility in these areas.  Hygiene across the board from pubs to hotels leaves much to be desired.  The toilet facilities in many &mdash; but I stress not all &mdash; are, to say the least, filthy and at best they do not even supply clean towels, hot water, soap and so on. Overall they are not up to standard which indicates that sufficient work is not being done to improve the situation.  Another aspect, of course, is that rarely &mdash; I have yet to see them in fact &mdash; are clean facilities provided for mothers who wish to feed young children and attend to their needs.</P>
    <P>When advertising for business, hotels often advertise babysitting facilities and what they comprise in my experience is a disgrace.  I have seen a room full of screaming children attended by one women.  This is a comprehensive babysitting facility.  It is misleading.  I have seen a crowded reception hall with the telephone off the hook.  This is frightful and is a common practice.  In no circumstances would I leave small children in a hotel bedroom with the telephone off the hook, which nobody can hear anyway.  Indeed, these children are often in danger because of windows which are easily opened and so on.  There is much that can be done here by the hoteliers and Bord Fáilte should take an active role in stamping out this type of false promotion and inaccurate and misleading information.</P>
    <P>The time has come possibly to set up <Col N="1151" /> an independent inspectorate.  I say &ldquo;independent&rdquo; because I know the practice of Bord Fáilte has been to notify establishments of their arrival in advance.  What happens we can all imagine.  The place is tidied up, the red carpet is out, the meal is ready, the wine is out.  The Bord Fáilte representative is looked after very well. There should be on the spot inspections with no notification in advance.  Indeed, the <i>Sunday World</i>, for all its faults, has actively pursued a policy of detection and their type of campaign could well be adopted.  Bord Fáilte claim they have difficulties in removing people from their approved lists because they are compiled on an annual basis.  I have seen places which have been below standard for years still in the tourist guide.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of tourism which has been virtually ignored is the weather factor.  Bord Fáilte seem to forget that we can have a summer like last summer. The people involved in the industry also seem to forget that.  God help mothers and fathers on holidays if, like this summer, day after day we have rain and more rain.  I will detail my own holiday this year.  We rented a house in Galway and away we went for two glorious weeks of peace and leisure, but down came the rain and washed out the holiday.  In fact, but for Leisureland swimming pool and a slide we might have gone home.  Galway is one of the better areas to go in that there are many activities for adults and all adult tastes are catered for in the entertainment field.  More could be done, not only in Galway but throughout the country to provide wet day activities for children and teenagers such as art, mime, drama, pantomime, dance, gymnastics and so on.  Families could be offered a day ticket which would include all costs and make their holiday all the more enjoyable.  Needless to say further development of summer day camps is required.  If you are in Ireland on a wet day, you are in trouble, or else you have to spend a fortune in the local fairground, chip shops and cinemas.</P>
    <P>I want to outline one major influence on the fortunes of the tourist industry <Col N="1152" /> which can be described as an outside influence and cannot be easily tackled: the commercial banks, they do not make life easier for the business person or for the tourist.  The tourist is charged 21p for cashing a traveller's cheque.  The banks open at ridiculous hours and the business person is subjected to all kinds of charges. For example, every cheque cashed for a customer in pubs, restaurants, hotels, etc., costs the publican a further 12p to lodge.  Every £100 of cash he lodges costs him 35p in charges.  Not only that, but you will also be charged 35p to withdraw £100 in cash &mdash; your own money &mdash; from the bank.</P>
    <P>This, is a scandal when you consider that between them last year the two major banks made £5 million more profit than the combined list of the next top 64 companies in this country.  Small businesses, which greatly comprise those in tourism, will now pay between £2,000 and £2,500 per annum in charges where previously they paid £200 to £300.  This cannot be seen as conducive to promoting and assisting our tourism, or any small business for that matter, given that large customers can negotiate their own charges.  The banks have a social responsibility to address themselves to a more pro-small business attitude particularly in the light of the fact that their security bill for transfer of their cash is picked up by the taxpayer.  I call on these institutions to be generous and respond to the need.</P>
    <P>I have called on all concerned to play their part.  The Government have responded in certain areas, for example, the new grants, but all should respond in co-operation for the potential is there. Let the unions help too with their expertise. Let the employers and employees not only respond in the areas of need but, most important of all, to the whole question of market demand.</P>
    <P>With reference to what Senator Durcan spoke about in the whole area of planning and the role of local authorities, a very deliberate policy of preservation of local shop fronts etc. is followed by my local council but we have found, much <Col N="1153" /> to our amazement, that insurance companies require these outside shutters which are in contravention of the planning laws and therefore people are left without insurance.  The next job of the small businesses committee will be to examine the whole area of insurance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief in my remarks on this very important subject of tourism.  A great deal has been stated at governmental level and, indeed, at Civil Service level to the effect that more attention, more personnel ought to be devoted to this very vital area which is a massive earner of currency for us and, indeed, an industry which has a potential that is vast and in a large measure unexploited at present.  The report from the Minister, Deputy Bruton, of June 30, was the first positive and definite report on tourism.  From that one would hope and believe that in the future it will play a more central part in the whole area of Government policy and consideration.</P>
      <P>Tourism, as I see it, is now being raised to a new plane of importance and, indeed, elevated to the level that it so urgently requires if we are to get the return from it that it is capable of giving.  We have at present approximately 59,000 to 60,000 persons employed full time in the industry and approximately 40,000 person engaged in it part time.  It is an industry which is handled in the main by small labour-intensive units.  Many of these are family operated units.  For that reason it spreads across a fairly large spectrum.  Indeed, I could not but be reminded of a major anomaly from listening to Senator McAuliffe-Ennis when she spoke about the position with regard to the bigger hotels as against what one might call the middle area hotel group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, indeed, absolutely correct to state that Americans and other tourists are directed towards the more expensive hotels, and restaurants.  They are charged excessive prices and may be charged above the odds on occasions.  We are not giving ourselves the best image.  We are not displaying the competitiveness which actually does exist.  Frankly, there are <Col N="1154" /> many top class hotels throughout the country which Americans and other tourists are never informed about unless they meet somebody quite accidently or are casually informed about.  They seem to be directed to certain hotels in the higher price echelon.  These are charged perhaps £100 a night for bed and breakfast.  Therefore they regard that as being the going rate in Ireland, whereas we all know that first-class accommodation can be obtained for significantly less than that.</P>
    <P>The whole area of guesthouses, farmhouse holidays and accommodation needs looking at.  That area offers enormous potential for development.  Unfortunately in the last ten years or so, while there has been a worldwide increase in the tourist trade of something like 130 per cent we have seen a decline in our return from tourism.  On a worldwide basis the tourist industry is showing a magificant upsurge.  There is obviously an increased movement of persons visiting different countries.  We must tackle that situation quickly.  We have top class attractions in this country for tourists coming from the traditional areas which have been the main support, tourist wise, to this country, such as the United Kingdom and North America.  Approximately 60 per cent of our total trade comes from the United Kingdom and other European countries.  We also have a sizeable percentage coming from North America. Other countries, too, in recent times are getting to know of Ireland as a place to visit.</P>
    <P>Regarding the questions of price, value for money &mdash; which is part and parcel of the price dimension &mdash; amenities, and our general approach to tourism, we take this criticism very seriously.  The potential for tourism could, apart from the extra revenue which it would bring to this country, have massive spin-off effects in the employment area and in the whole food consuming area, where we would by attracting a greater number of tourists effectively generate a large home market for our food and make us less reliant on exports for our dairy and meat products. Right across a wide spectrum, tourism, effectively and properly developed, has <Col N="1155" /> valuable potential.  I believe that it is now being tackled very seriously by the Government.  This is the first time that tourism, which indeed has been referred to as a Cinderella organisation, has been seriously examined.</P>
    <P>There are a number of positive factors that will make people come here.  I referred a moment ago to value for money.  I believe that at a time of world recession there is a scarcity of money and spending power.  This applies to those coming from the United Kingdom and other places too.  For that reason we must make sure that those people are convinced that they will get reasonable value for money.  We must also ensure that when people come here the amenities we provide and the general situation that obtains are attractive to them so that they will become, not alone potential tourists for next year and the years that follow, but also ambassadors for Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>There is no better way of promoting tourism than by having satisfied customers coming to Ireland, staying here and then going back home to their own countries and talking with their friends. I believe earnestly that this is far more effective than any endeavours of Bord Fáilte or other organisations.  In other words, a satisfied customer going home talking favourably about the situation in Ireland is the keynote to our having a greater upsurge in the number of tourists coming here.</P>
    <P>The weather, as we all know, is an uncertain factor.  We may get extremely beautiful summers, as we got in 1984 and 1983 or, indeed, we may get a disastrous summer, weatherwise, as we got this year.  In the tourism area, we must be prepared for all eventualities.  For that reason I submit that a great deal more emphasis must be laid on providing the sort of amenities that help to fill the gap for tourists who might otherwise be involved in scenic activity or visiting various historical places.  We must make sure that we have an alternative for people who are prevented, for weather reasons, from going out and viewing the fine scenery in Ireland and viewing the various <Col N="1156" /> historical places.  So far we do not have that.</P>
    <P>Comparing ourselves with European countries where they are prepared for eventualities like that, we just do not measure up.  We have not got enough alternatives.  People coming to Ireland are confined to scenic tours, whether those organised on a package holiday or those they engage in themselves.  There is little indoor activity laid on for them. That is the area we must consider.  That could be coupled very closely with whole question of seasonality of tourism.  If we were to develop the sort of amenities I am alluding to we would, in fact, hopefully attract tourists not only for part of the year but for the greater part of the year. That is a very important dimension as well.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we must have from Government soon a very definite and integrated policy on the whole tourist industry.  We must make sure that there is an application of legislation with regard to litter and pollution, which affect the whole fishing area.  We must apply the measures that exist to ensure that this vital industry does not suffer.  I believe that the commitment of the Government towards tourism is demonstrated in the publication in recent days of the public capital programme for 1986.  That document states that a provision of £3.960 million is being made available for Bord Fáilte in 1986.  Of this £3.960 million, £2.430 million is for development of holiday accommodation and hotel and guesthouse accommodation.  There is also money available for camping grants. Added to that there is definite provision, financial and otherwise, for hotel and guesthouse reconstruction development schemes.  There is a new grant of up to £30,000 which is worthy of mention. There is provision for the development of caravan and camping sites through grants which are being introduced.  There are various other measures.  The important thing to underline here is that there is a very definite commitment on the part of Government, at a time of scarcity of finance towards the tourist industry.  Such <Col N="1157" /> a level of commitment has not existed before.</P>
    <P>We have also, published in the same document &mdash; the public capital programme, 1986 &mdash; provision for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd &mdash; SFADCo.  The allocation is £0.11 million for SFADCo.  This will be spent on necessary maintenance and refurbishment work on the company's tourist traffic development facilities. The work will also continue on improvements to Bunratty Folk Park. This investment will encourge increased visitor use and enhance the folk park's revenue earning potential, thereby improving prospects for job maintenance and creation in the area.  That is an example of expenditure that is going to take place in the Shannon Airport Development Company area.</P>
    <P>I believe that our tourist industry has enormous potential.  It will not be developed overnight.  It will take a high level indepth consideration to make sure that the correct policies are evolved for it.  I am confident, however, that with the very positive approach of the Minister for Tourism and the Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan, there will be a change-about in the situation.  I also believe that, with the effective operation of the Anglo-Irish agreement recently introduced, more people from the United Kingdom will be attracted to this country.  It is important that Ireland is seen as a safe place to go and a place where people have harmony and freedom of movement.  For that reason I believe the Anglo-Irish agreement and its effective operation will also contribute to a greater tourist industry.</P>
    <P>Finally, nobody should say that some other sectors are getting too much and tourism is getting too little of investment. I would say positively that tourism requires more money, skills and people at various levels and, most important of all, it requires the appropriate people to direct this industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the <Col N="1158" /> opportunity to respond to what has been a very constructive debate on the tourism industry.  I have listened with interest to all the comments of the Senators who have contributed to this debate.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to say that the many and varied aspects of the discussion have been most useful.  It is always helpful, I think, to consider past and present policies when reviewing performance and looking ahead to the future.  During the debate I noted the many constructive suggestions made by a number of Senators and I can assure the House that these ideas will be considered seriously in the course of the further advancement of tourism promotion and development policies.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned in my comments at the beginning of this debate, the range and extent of the new marketing initiatives outlined in the White Paper will inject new life into our marketing drive.  Initiatives designed, for example, to get more commercial operators out selling the Irish tourism product in the market place; to assist the establishement of three hotel brand marketing groups, and to identify promotion of the shoulder and off-peak seasons, will, I am confident, ensure that this year's all-time record performance with regard to revenue from overseas tourism will be extended in 1986.  The more competitive climate created by the various initiatives taken by the Government, coupled with the new marketing strategies being implemented by Bord Fáilte, will, I have no doubt, pay real dividends next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will probably have seen reports in the media of Bord Fáilte's marketing plan for 1986.  This plan announced the week before last projects a real term increase of up to 4 per cent for overseas business next year.  I feel that given the initiatives taken by the Government in recent times this target is realistic and very much achievable.  My own view is that, with the full support of all involved in the export tourism drive &mdash; both in the State and commercial sectors &mdash; next year's target of a 4 per cent increase can be exceeded.  I would urge all concerned to grasp the very real <Col N="1159" /> opportunity for increased tourism now emerging in our main markets, particularly in North America and continental Europe, and encourage all sectors of the industry to get out into the market place in increased numbers in early 1986.</P>
    <P>My optimism about next year's prospects has been fuelled by the very extensive promotional and marketing plan unveiled by Bord Fáilte.  The entry of two new American air carriers onto the North Atlantic routes will offer opportunities for additional business and ensure a healthy element of competition between carriers. Bord Fáilte have planned a very comprehensive promotional and advertising campaign in this market.  Promotional workshops have been planned for a wide range of American cities to give the Irish trade the opportunity to make direct and personal contact with retailers in the market place.  Cities such as Atlanta and Dallas are included in the trade workshop programme for the first time.</P>
    <P>There are also encouraging signs in the British market.  A very helpful development will be the emergence early next year of Ryanair on the Dublin-Luton air route.  I was particularly pleased to learn that the Minister for Communications has recently approved, in principle, a very competitive fares regime for this route.  This must be good for our tourism and helpful to Bord Fáilte's efforts in the market place.  In Britain the Bord will again undertake a very extensive advertising and promotional campaign in conjunction with carriers and the Irish trade. I can assure Senators that angling promotions, which were mentioned by a number of speakers during the debate, will feature more prominently than ever in this campaign.</P>
    <P>The prospects for growth next year on the continental European market are particularly good.  A real growth rate of 6 per cent has been projected by Bord Fáilte.  Having examined the Bord's extensive promotional programme for Europe, I am convinced that a target of this order on top of the 1985 performance is achievable.  In this market also, the <Col N="1160" /> Bord will be embarking upon a comprehensive advertising and promotional programme incorporating both motivational and hardsell media campaigns.  In addition, of course, Bord Fáilte will be actively involved at many of the continent's main tourism fairs and will be organiaing workshops for the Irish trade at strategic locations.</P>
    <P>Angling promotions in Germany, France, Holland, and Belgium will also feature prominently in this programme. All in all, the scenario for Europe this year is most positive.</P>
    <P>While covering Bord Fáilte's programme for 1986 I should, of course, refer to developing markets such as the Middle East, Japan and Australia. Undoubtedly there are enormous possibilities for increased business in these markets.  At present, for example, almost half a million Japanese visit Europe each year and this traffic is expected to increase steadily.  I see no earthly reason why Ireland should not get a bigger and growing share of this business.  The White Paper clearly recognised this potential and at the Government's instigation Bord Fáilte are now directing their attention towards the development of these more distant but potentially lucrative sources of business.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to learn that next year for the first time ever Bord Fáilte will be holding a series of trade workshops in major cities in Australia. At these promotions the Irish trade will have the opportunity of selling direct to Australian tour operators and travel agents.  This, I feel, is a very significant development and will be of enormous benefit in generating new traffic from a market which has such strong ethnic ties with this country.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Government are committed to the introduction of legislation to enable bona fide restaurants to provide a full range of alcoholic drinks with meals.  I am pleased to say that work on the preparation of the necessary legislation is at an advanced stage and I am very hopeful that the legislation will be enacted in time for the 1986 tourist season.  I can assure Senators <Col N="1161" /> that the proposals now envisaged will ensure that only restaurants of the highest standards will be eligible for licences.  In effect the measures being proposed will restrict and tightly control the types of restaurant to which this facility will be extended.</P>
    <P>During the debate I took particular note of the Senators' concerns about the provision of grant assistance to Comhaltas Ceolteoirí Éireann, particularly those of Senators de Brún, Ferris and Durcan.  I am concerned that the discontinuance of grants could have disastrous implications for such an important national organisation.  I have, in fact, expressed this view in the past.  In the final analysis, of course, this is primarily a matter for the Arts Council and the Minister of State with responsibility for the Arts.  In the light of Senators' pleas, I have again taken this matter up with the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, to see what might be done to resolve this unsatisfactory state of affairs, and I can assure Senators of my continuing commitment to ensure that this aspect of our heritage must certainly remain as part of our major promotional field in giving the high level of satisfaction it has in the past and be continued in the future.</P>
    <P>I feel that I should again take the opportunity of stressing, from an overall tourism development aspect, the importance of the recently introduced grant scheme for hotel and guesthouse reconstruction. I would like to see all premises that are seriously concerned about overseas marketing availing of these grants. As I have already said, and I think it is worth repeating, the scheme is designed specifically to complement the White Paper's strategies aimed at encouraging more of our smaller hotels to undertake marketing overseas; combating the perennial problem of seasonality by helping to extend tourism into the shoulder and off-peak seasons and providing much needed all-weather facilities for our younger visitors.</P>
    <P>In speaking at the commencement of this debate I referred to the Government's firm commitment in the White Paper to giving priority to tourism in their <Col N="1162" /> efforts to tackle unemployment.  I have always taken the view that properly developed tourism and its related activities have enormous potential for job creation. I am convinced, therefore, that the new strategies and policies now being pursued will bring about the type of climate within which tourism jobs will be created.  In this regard I was particularly pleased to note the results of the recently published CERT-Manpower survey of the hotel and catering industry which attributes 46,000 permanent jobs to that sector.  This is more than had been anticipated and hopefully reflects a rising trend in this sector and in tourism generally.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, let me say that I look forward into 1986 with confidence.  I feel that, with the impetus of the Government's White Paper and the new policies that are now being implemented, the prospects for next year and, indeed, beyond that, are exceedingly good.  Success, of course, is dependent not just on the Government or Bord Fáilte but on the wholehearted efforts of all involved in tourism.  I have no doubt that this support will be forthcoming and that 1986 will see a greater presence of the industry's commercial operators at all our overseas marketing endeavours.  With such commitment from the industry I am confident that next year will record yet futher increases both in export revenue and in employment in tourism.</P>
    <P>I might also comment briefly on some points which have been raised and which I consider of importance.  Two or three Senators raised the importance of the creation of an air feeder service from our principal airports to the regional airports. This is of vital importance.  I have had discussions with various interests.  They feel that it would be a marvellous selling strategy to be able to offer to continental and American tourists air transport from their home base to their holiday destination. This has tremendous potential.  I am arranging for discussions with a number of interested parties.</P>
    <P>The matter of school holidays as it affects the home holiday situation is very important.  Many parents in the holiday situation are governed by the school holiday <Col N="1163" /> or the work holiday.  I have arranged for discussions with both the Departments of Labour and Education to see what success, if any, can be achieved in setting a holiday structure that might form a better pattern to cater for a wider number of Irish holiday parents.  This would be particularly true of the primary school holidays which are confined exclusively to July and August.  Outside these two months many parents, and possibly their families, would wish to have enjoyable holidays, possibly at less cost in so far as they would not be engaged in the peak season.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of discussions with the Minister for Education on the matter of children and parents opting for a holiday in the Gaeltacht area during the months of June or September and what relaxation would be provided for within the school regulations.  I believe there are many parents who would wish to go to the Gaeltacht &mdash; some of which are the primary holiday centres &mdash; during these months not only to have a relaxing holiday but also to have the facility to advance the national language in the case of their family.  The Minister has indicated quite clearly that it is the responsibility of the parents who desire to take their children on holiday in June or September and there is no departmental incumbrance.  The whole aspect of holidays would require to be looked at as an expanding basis for the shoulder period of the tourist season.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made about the utilisation of the larger rather than the smaller hotels.  The package dealing for the top hotels is organised at the behest of the Americans.  This is what they want.  We are lucky that we have these facilities for them.  This does not, in any way, militate against the opportunities which are there for the other promoters. Only last week we had the town and country homes representatives in the United States, who were there at Bord Fáilte well organised workshops, set up to sell their own and doing a magnificent <Col N="1164" /> job because they have a wonderful structure in accommodation, price and standard to sell.  We have to have a facility &mdash; if we are going to cater for the future of Irish tourism &mdash; to meet every budget. This means from the highest level of affluence down to the ordinary town and country homes, the ordinary farm guesthouses and the small family owned guesthouse. There is a structure, there is a facility, and there is a tourist for all.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in relation to the licensing laws.  The licensing laws are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice. He is undertaking an examination of the situation and has given an assurance that both the restaurant licences and the extended hours for licensing, will be law on a limited basis in 1986.  Senator Cassidy made the point that there were adequate facilities within the hotels.  Only 17 per cent of the tourists coming into Ireland stay in hotels; 83 per cent stay in the wide category of structures which are there.  Those people require the ordinary bar in the west as a facility and I believe some extensions are required.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking Senators and the members of the Oireachtas committee for their comprehensive report and discussion.  It is very important and it is proper that we should have it at the end of a year when we have had record numbers of overseas visitors and a record revenue to our economy from tourism.</P>

I would also like to refer to the fact that we have ordered both Nos. 6 and 7.  We have already commenced Item No. 6 and we should conclude before we adjourn this House until January.  On the other hand we have not yet commenced on Item No. 7.  Since we are now after 4.30 p.m., having commenced business over six hours ago, it might be preferable to leave Item No. 7 over so that the debate is not fragmented. I am asking the permission of the House to vary the Order of Business so that Item No. 7 is not taken today.  My suggestion is that we should now suspend the sitting for 15 minutes.  On resumption we should take Item No. 6 and discuss it to completion, <Col N="1166" /> which should occur before our normal adjournment time.

    <Title>Chester Beatty Library Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill on the last day we discussed it, I felt that it was opportune to examine something of the life and the collecting habits of Sir Alfred Chester Beatty because the Library is a monument to the life of this man.  The Library and the man are inextricably linked.  I had got to the twenties when I was discussing it the last time. Around that time the art collection of Chester Beatty expanded at a phenomenal rate.  Selection Trust likewise surged forward to become a group of companies with mining interests in many countries including Russia, Serbia, Cold Coast and Sierra Leone.  The greatest revenue was generated in Africa and specifically in Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, where Rhodesian Selection Trust controlled the huge copper belt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beatty helped to pioneer new methods of extracting copper from low grade ore. His business acumen was based on flair, courage, expertise and an ability to delegate responsibility.  He dared to explore and exploit the copper reserves of Africa when many fortunes had been lost in previous ventures and the geography and climate were generally considered impossible for successful mining.  However, <Col N="1167" /> using the new mining techniques and concentrating on housing and health care for his staff, Beatty was amply rewarded for his enterprise, becoming one of the wealthiest men in Great Britain. His profession acknowledged his achievement with many honours, including the gold medal of the Institute of Mining and Metallurgy in 1935.  Interestingly enough, Beatty was very modest about his success, but he was justifiably enthusiastic and proud of his art collections,. He was adamant and stated over and over that he was not a scholar but 50 years of careful study and the vetting of high quality art material allowed him to become very knowledgeable.  Like many other collectors he was proud of his eye for quality and wrote:</P>
    <P>It is no good keeping things that are not first class, they simply keep the collection down.</P>
    <P>That indicates that he was only interested in the very best.  It is that very best which is on display to all of us in the Chester Beatty Library.  It is very nice to hear that kind of standard quite unashamedly gone after and indeed stated.</P>
    <P>This kind of attitude is reflected in the Chester Beatty Library and is its hallmark today.  Its founder understood quality to mean, first and foremost, good condition and then other factors were considered; rarity, value, age, aesthetic or artistic merit.  Each item had to be in excellent condition and often he would reject material on the grounds that it was unhealthy or grubby.  He had his own system of notetaking while visiting a dealer's shop.  For example, if he did not wish to buy an item, he would write DCFI meaning &ldquo;Don't care for it&rdquo; or NFFC meaning &ldquo;Not fit for collection&rdquo;.  He categorised everything he bought as A, B or C.  He rarely bought &lsquo;C&rsquo; material and if he did he would sell it again immediately. Only exceptionally would he allow &lsquo;B&rsquo; material to remain in the collection.  The &lsquo;A&rsquo;s were graded as &lsquo;A+&rsquo;, &lsquo;A&rsquo; and &lsquo;A-&rsquo;. Beatty was a most discriminating buyer and rarely bought at random or in bulk. <Col N="1168" /> He spoke none of the many oriental languages which are represented in his collection and this encouraged the purchase of illustrated material, fine bindings, and an administration for beautiful calligraphy. It has been said that the Chester Beatty Library is a trinity; a library, a museum and a gallery, all in one.</P>
    <P>During the Second World War, 1939 to 1945, Beatty's mining expertise was of great benefit to the Allied war effort.  He served as vice-chairman of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation Limited established by the British Government to further war-time trade.  He was also a member of two government committees established by the Ministry of Supply, the Non Ferrous Metals Controls Board and the Diamond Dies Control Board.  He had become a naturalised British citizen in 1933 and retained a British passport until his death in 1968.  He first attracted public attention as a patron of the arts in Great Britain when in 1931 he gave material on loan to the International Exhibition of Persian Art held at Burlington House, London, and especially in November of that year when it was announced in <i>The Times</i> that he had acquired some biblical papyri which in the words of Sir Frederic Kenyon, retired director of the British Museum constituted, and I quote:</P>
    <P>...the most remarkable addition to the textual material of the Greek Bible which has been made for many a long day...</P>
    <P>Beatty's charitable activities were numerous and he showed special concern for the cause of cancer research, founding and financing the Chester Beatty Research Institute of the Royal Cancer Hospital, London.</P>
    <P>Interestingly enough, when researching material for this debate &mdash; and, indeed, I am grateful to the Chester Beatty Library personnel who were extremely helpful in that regard &mdash; I got a photocopy of an extract from <i>The Sunday Express</i> of 6 November, 1949.  This newspaper article notified Beatty's friends in Great Britain of his intention to leave that country and to move to the Republic <Col N="1169" /> of Ireland which, of course, caused something of a stir, as one can imagine because the British would have preferred it if he had bequeathed his treasures to them. This move was one which gave rise to great surprise and excitement in the art world.  The newspaper extract is headed &ldquo; 'Copper King' ships out £1 million Treasures&rdquo;.  It says:</P>
    <P>Art treasures and manuscripts said to be worth more than £1,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and this was in 1949&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;are being shipped to Éire from the London home of 74 year old Mr. Chester Beatty, the copper millionaire.</P>
    <P>They are being sent from Beroda House, in Kensington Palace Gardens to his new home, a 12-room £12,000 house in Ailesbury Road, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Mr. Beatty is believed to be in France.</P>
    <P>Friends and business associates in London cannot explain the move of this American-born magnate, who, when he became a naturalised Briton in 1933, said: &ldquo;I love England, and have taken root here&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He retired at the age of 35.  But at 40 he made another fortune.</P>
    <P>Most of his collection, including ancient manuscripts, Islamic pictures, and Indian and Persian miniatures, has been going over to Dublin during the past month.</P>
    <P>Mr. Beatty's mining activities in Rhodesia are said to have added £500 million of potential wealth to the Empire, and saved Britain 50,000,000 dollars a year.</P>
    <P>He has criticised Government policies of bulk buying and high taxation recently.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the stockholders of his Selection Trust he said that London was no longer the mining centre of the world.  The position would deteriorate, he said, while high taxation, unjust duties, and rigid controls stopped new mining projects being launched.</P>
    <P>Mr. Beatty has earned distinction as a collector of ancient manuscripts.  His <Col N="1170" /> collection includes Egyptian papyri 100 years older than the Codex, which have thrown new light on the Bible.</P>
    <P>So one can see that it certainly caused a stir at the time of his removal of his objects to Dublin.</P>
    <P>In 1945, of course, there was a general election in Great Britain and it clearly demonstrated the changes which the war had wrought because Churchill's Government was rejected in favour of the first majority Labour Party Government in British history.  Beatty considered Churchill to be a versatile man.  He described him as &ldquo;the greatest of our time, with the courage of a lion&rdquo;.  He also said that, but for Churchill, Britain would have been crushed.  But, of course, for someone of Beatty's wealth and background the new Labour Government was, in contrast, utterly distasteful and Beatty claimed that the Labour Party had institutionalised bureaucracy and he criticised regimentation and rules and high taxes and red tape.</P>
    <P>During the war he had been unable to take his annual vacation in Egypt and in 1946 he was distressed to find difficulty in acquiring currency to go abroad.  He found that a philosophy alien to him was taking over the country he had come to consider as his own.  This became particularly apparent when he began to have difficult relations with the British Museum.  He considered the British Museum to be the greatest museum in the world and always aimed to rival her collection of each class of material which interested him.  Beatty decided in 1950 at the age of 75 the time had come to retire as chairman of Selection Trust, a position which he handed over to his son, Alfred Chester, junior.  That certainly gives some idea of the thinking of the man and the reasons why he should decide to relocate.  Without commenting on his ideas of a Labour Government in Britain, I must say that we all here have cause indeed to be extremely grateful that that was his thinking at the time.</P>
    <P>Beatty had visited Dublin in 1930 and he enjoyed the antique shops and the atmosphere of the city &mdash; and, of course, <Col N="1171" /> one is tempted in an aside to recognise the fact that, while the antique shops are still in Dublin and indeed flourishing, the atmosphere of the city has changed a great deal from what it was in the time of Chester Beatty.  He was extremely pleased when his son bought a country estate in 1948 called Mount Armstrong at Donadea, County Kildare.  Indeed, Sir Alfred visited him there on a number of occasions.  So he decided that he would settle in Ireland and in May 1950 he moved to Dublin where he had bought this house that I spoke of in Ailesbury Road.  He wished for peaceful surroundings and he declared that &ldquo;Ireland is the best country in which to retire.  The country has atmosphere.  The people have so much charm &mdash; life goes on as it did elsewhere until 1939&rdquo;.  He proposed at that stage to establish a permanent library to house his collections.  He made preparations for the transportation to Dublin of 35 tons of art works.</P>
    <P>At first he thought of buying a building in the centre of Dublin, but he was discouraged by the danger of fire in Georgian terraced buildings.  So he then took a decision to build a library and he purchased a site at 20 Shrewsbury Road which was very near his residence in Ailesbury Road.  On 8 August 1953 the Chester Beatty Library was opened at a private garden party in the grounds.  The following year the Library was opened to the public each Wednesday and Beatty often came himself to meet the visitors.  He was simply delighted with the Library and he spoke fondly of what he called the &ldquo;little island site, beautifully protected and away from all noise and dirt&rdquo;.  An extension was opened on 24 August 1957 at a ceremony attended by many distinguished guests including the President of the Republic of Ireland, Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly and the then Taoiseach, Mr. Éamon de Valera.</P>
    <P>Beatty spent only about four months of each year in Dublin, from May to September, spending the rest of his time in the south of France at Nice and later in Monaco.  Despite retirement, the 1950s were a busy period for the Library as <Col N="1172" /> Beatty bought Japanese woodblock prints, Batak bark books from Sumatra, books about Jesuit missions to the Orient, and added to his other collections. He gradually formulated the method by which he hoped to guarantee the future of the Library after his death. He was very friendly with President O'Kelly and they often met at Saturday afternoon picnics in County Wicklow where they each owned a house.  He was also by now well acquainted with many leading Irish politicians and they appreciated his wish to bequeath his collections to the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>In Dublin Chester Beatty was a remarkable world figure who had known people like Winston Churchill, Herbert Hoover and General Eisenhower.  His conversation, as one can imagine, was fascinating, ranging from Wild West mining camps and Pinkerton detectives to how he acquired the biblical papyri and a magnificent Korans.  The Irish media wrote of Beatty in feature articles with headlines like &ldquo;Portrait of a Gentleman&rdquo; and &ldquo;Copper King with a Heart of Gold&rdquo;. The words most often used to describe Beatty was &ldquo;simple&rdquo;, &ldquo;uncomplicated&rdquo;, &ldquo;cultivated&rdquo;, &ldquo;generous&rdquo;, &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; and &ldquo;good humoured&rdquo;.  It is, therefore, hardly surprising that he was so well liked and so respected and indeed, that we should be talking about him here in 1985 in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>During the 1950s Beatty presented many gifts to the Irish nation, including paintings to the National Gallery of Ireland and oriental weapons and armour to the military museum at the Curragh Camp in County Kildare.  He granted material from his collections on loan to exhibitions and supported many charitable organisations, particularly favouring the Wireless for the Blind Fund. Indeed, that appeal is still going strong &mdash; one hears Patricia McLoughlin's voice every so often making that appeal.  Distinguished scholars came to study at the Chester Beatty Library and fine published catalogues helped to establish its importance.</P>
    <P>Ireland was not slow to acknowledge Beatty's great generosity and many other <Col N="1173" /> countries also honoured him during his long life.  He received four honorary doctorates from Columbia University, New York, in 1935; the University of Birmingham in 1939; Trinity College, Dublin, in 1951 and the National University of Ireland in 1951; the Grand Cordon of the Order of St. Sava in 1930 for work in developing Yugoslavia's mining resources; the Order of King Leopold II in 1932 for services in developing the Belgian Congo; a British Knighthood in 1954; Freeman of the City of Dublin in 1956 and first honorary Irish citizen in 1957.</P>
    <P>Chester Beatty died at the Princess Grace Clinic, Monte Carlo, on 19 January 1968, three weeks before his 93rd birthday and exactly 11 years after he was awarded honorary Irish citizenship.  He was given a State funeral to Glasnevin Cemetery and, indeed, his monument there, in contrast to the exotic collection he presented to the nation, is a very simple granite stone and very touching in its simplicity.  There was a service following his death in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and dignatories of Church and State attended, which evidenced his significance in the life of the State.</P>
    <P>He left his library buildings and their wonderful contents to a board of trustees to be administered by them on behalf of the Irish people.  Under the conditions of Beatty's will the Irish Government took over the administrative and maintenance costs of the Library, and the building constructed in 1956 was extended to house a modern gallery which was officially opened on 26 July 1975 by Mr. Cearbhaill Ó Dalaigh, then President of Ireland.  I think Chester Beatty's greatest legacy is, of course, that of his Library. It was an extraordinary gift which has provided the Irish people and, indeed, foreign visitors to our shores, with an opportunity to become acquainted with Eastern cultures, languages, religions, customs and traditions.  He opened the world to us at a time when it was closed and he allowed us to have a glimpse into the Orient which really was denied to most of us and, indeed, I suppose still is, but in those days it was particularly <Col N="1174" /> extraordinary and very much appreciated by people.  In that way you could say he definitely made a very marked contribution to the broadening of attitudes and to the expansion of horizons which, as an island nation on the periphery of Europe, we so badly needed and, I am tempted to say, we still need.</P>
    <P>The memory of Sir Chester Beatty and the success of his legacy will hopefully live and grow for a very long time to come and it is for all those reasons that I have pleasure in welcoming this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill also, not with as much enthusiasm as if we had a more comprehensive Bill before us because I feel this important Library deserves better.  This is stop-gap legislation. It is intended as such I realise and I welcome it as such.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago, in the questions section in <i>The Irish Press</i>, there was one question which asked what library in Dublin is famous for its oriental artefacts. I wondered at the time if many people knew the Chester Beatty Library.  I felt that not enough did and perhaps I was wrong, perhaps more know about it than I realise.  I came into contact with the Library in the late fifties in discussions with some of the preachers at the corner of Abbey Street, which was the nearest thing we had to the preacher's corner in Hyde Park.  Many of those preachers were experts or claimed to experts in biblical studies.  They referred to the Chester Beatty Library and the papyri that were in that Library.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia has given a very thorough and detailed account of Sir Chester Beatty and there is no point in going back on such a marvellous contribution.  But briefly, Sir Chester Beatty was born in New York city in 1875 of English, Irish and Scottish ancestry, and he came to live permanently in Ireland in 1950.  I believe he is one of the very few honorary Irish citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is topical that we should be discussing the Bill at this time because on Saturday, 7 December, there were reviews of two books on Sir Chester Beatty in <i>The Irish Times.</i>  One of them was &ldquo;The Life and <Col N="1175" /> Times of Sir Alfred Chester Beatty&rdquo; by A.J. Wilson, Cadogan Publications Limited, price £12 in the United Kingdom, and the second one was &ldquo;The Art of Surimono in the Chester Beatty Library&rdquo; by Robert Keyes, Sotheby Publications, in two volumes, price £150 in the UK. Unlike the English papers, these reviews do not give the number of pages in each book.  It is a pity.  I will quote a short extract from that review:</P>
    <P>Chester Beatty's life was so varied and lived on so many levels that ideally it would need a very widely knowledgeable biographer to describe it.  In the event, the choice has fallen on a specialist in mining and while this was of course the primary base of Beatty's life, concentrating on this means that the other, more generally interesting, aspects go for less than they are worth.</P>
    <P>Further on, it continued:</P>
    <P>The image of a benign and benevolent seigneur leafing through an old book which is nowadays the most familiar is very far from that of the young man with a gun in his boot who went out into the mining fields, sleeping rough, riding or tramping long miles, creeping down insecure mine shafts, initiating and organising mines and then controlling them, sometimes with the help of hired gunmen.</P>
    <P>That gives us another dimension to the picture which was given to us by Senator Bulbulia.</P>
    <P>I want to pay my tribute also to the memory of Sir Chester Beatty for such a marvellous gift to the nation.  I also understand that in the White Paper on Tourism the significance of the Chester Beatty Library is acknowledged under &ldquo;Cultural Matters&rdquo; on page 46 where it is stated:</P>
    <P>Positive action has already been taken to centralise responsibility for the various cultural agencies which are financed by the State.  Thus, the major cultural institutions and agencies, including the National Musuem, the National Gallery, Chester Beatty <Col N="1176" /> Library, National Concert Hall as well as the Arts Council are now under the responsibility of a Minister of State for Arts and Culture.</P>
    <P>I think this is an acknowledgment of the importance of the Chester Beatty Library.  It is also fitting that this Bill has been introduced in the Seanad.  I recall other Bills of a like nature, the National Archives Bill, and others, and I am grateful this is introduced in the Seanad.  It is a very short Bill.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to Mr. Lockwood, curator and his staff of 12 who, as Senator Bulbulia said, are all very helpful.  The Chester Beatty Library Act, 1968, was also a fairly short Act.  It was simply to provide for the appointment of persons as trustees from time to time by the President. Unfortunately, before the death of Sir Chester Beatty most of the western collection of manuscripts was sold.  It took three days to sell this marvellous collection in London.  This was unfortunate and some people might perhaps feel that the reason it was sold was that it was not appreciated sufficiently.  Perhaps there may have been financial reasons, but it is a pity that such a marvellous collection was reduced.  The space in the Library is the big problem.  I understand that at least twice and perhaps three times the present space there is needed.  With all the valuable items that are there, it would take three times the space to do justice to everything that is in that collection. For example, there is an Arabic collection and many people interested in this area come to examine the different items, and find that the collection is not on display.  This is a great pity.</P>
    <P>An area of special interest is the Western Collection which is only a remnant of the major collection which it once was. The Library owns a major collection of biblical papyri contining some of the oldest known witnesses to the New Testament and to the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament.  There are also ancient Egyptian and Coptic papyri as well as Mesopotamian clay tablets. From the Islamic world, the Islamic material consists of manuscripts and <Col N="1177" /> miniature paintings from Persia, India, Turkey and the Arab world.  The Turkish paintings are considered one of the best collections of Ottoman manuscript illustrations outside the libraries of Istanbul.</P>
    <P>The Library has an important collection of Our'ans from all over the Islamic world and some 3,000 Arabic manuscripts covering the full range of secular and religious literature.  From India and south-east Asia the Indian Moghul material, comprising manuscripts and album paintings, date from the great period of Moghul art, namely the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and includes some of the best known works of art in this field.  From Japan, the Japanese print collection is one of the most comprehensive in the world and represents the entire story of the wood block print from the seventeenth century down to the early 20th century.  From China, the Library has the world's largest collection of jade books and rhinocerous horn cups, as well as excellent examples of the Chinese snuff bottles made mostly of semi-precious stones.  There are, in addition, painted scrolls, albums, seals, textiles, furniture and other items &mdash; a marvellous collection.</P>
    <P>With all that material there should be space for permanent or semi-permanent collections.  The space is just not there. That is one of the reasons why I say we should have a far more comprehensive Bill before us.  I realise that at present finance is restricted but, even allowing for that, and having regard to the uniqueness of the collection, more should be done for it.  Also, from time to time there are topical collections.  At present there is the Angels collection on display because Christmas is so near.  We also have the Chinese collection on display.  The reason for this is the display in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham of the horses and figures.  They complement one another. There should be space for more of these collections.</P>
    <P>There are three different buildings. Just to refer to them very briefly, there is the old building dating from 1953, consisting of three rooms and the offices of the librarian and secretary.  Here non-oriental <Col N="1178" /> material is on display.  In the garden Library there is a permanent display of biblical papyri and Sumarian and Arcadian clay tablets.  In another room there are on display western manuscripts including the beautiful illustrated books of Hours and ornamental book bindings. There is also the Chinese room with its ornamental panelled ceiling, hanging lanterns and elegant Chinese furniture.  All this is in the old Library building.</P>
    <P>The new gallery, the building which dates from 1975, as Senator Bulbulia has said, consists of a lecture theatre and a gallery on the ground floor which displays items from the far-eastern collections. On the first floor there are exhibitions of material from the Islamic collections. This is a very big display area.  These exhibitions with their helpful descriptive labels are changed regularly.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, in the building known as the annex, there is a reference library and the curator's offices are also in this building.  I believe that in buildings of this kind air conditioning is essential to control the temperature and to control the humidity. I also believe that a single building is essential.  Unfortunately, the building completed in 1975 and 1976 was not designed as part of a large building.  In other words, provision was not made for extensions.  This was a terrible pity. Apparently it was designed as a one off building with no regard for future extension. This was a major blunder.</P>
    <P>The two other buildings have what I would regard as very primitive heating systems.  They have old electrical storage heaters.  There is no ceiling insulation. There is no double glazing.  There is no wall insulation and so there is no possibility of controlling the inside temperature, not to talk of the humidity.  In addition, moving items between buildings is a great source of danger, security-wise, also with regard to the weather. Items which are so valuable and so fragile should not have had to be carried out into the open between buildings.  At least some provision should be made for covered or enclosed connection between the various buildings.</P>
    <P>Security is a serious problem and I <Col N="1179" /> suppose this is an aspect it might be as well not to develop too much.  Obviously it is a major problem.  I assume that under this Bill the Office of Public Works will take over responsibility for all the buildings.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia referred to the value of this Library.  It is impossible to put a valuation on such a collection.  How do you put a value on the Book of Kells, for example?  How do you put a value on any of our ancient Irish manuscripts or artefacts, the Tara Brooch, or the Derrynaflan Chalice, any of those items which are priceless and irreplaceable?  I believe that the value would be in excess of £50 million.  That is an artificial value because in the normal way if something is destroyed it can be restored or it can be replaced.  That is not possible in this situation.</P>
    <P>Further acquisition will be necessary to complement the collection.  A reference is most important in any library and how to keep adding to the reference collection in this Library will be a major problem. I understand that space-wise they are getting towards the limit.  Overall, I believe this is a major national trasure.  Personally, I believe it is relatively little known. This is terribly unfortunate.  There are there, as Senator Bulbulia said, possibly the earliest known texts of some parts of the Bible on papyrus and also information on the early Church and other topics.  It is a collection from which you could illustrate the whole history of literacy, book production and illustration from the earliest times up to the present. All of the specimens are well preserved and only the best were accepted, as Senator Bulbulia has explained, and those in the best condition.</P>
    <P>The Library can be used as a very useful tourist attraction, as pointed out in the White Paper.  This is an area that we should concentrate on.  Schools should make more use of the Library and the Minister for Education might be able to help here.  It is unfortunate that more schools and people on educational courses do not make use of the Library. The Library is visited by about 50 scholars <Col N="1180" /> per annum, mainly from abroad.  The number of visitors in the current year is expected to be in the region of 10,000. Facilities for refreshments are needed, expecially as the premises are situated some distance from shops.  They would be particularly useful in catering for the various school parties, which in most cases come from outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>The literature provided by the Library states that only a small percentage of the Library's collections are on display at any one time and it is the aim of the trustees and its librarian to ensure that the Library should play a full part in the cultural and educational life of the country.  To do this they have set out to make known what the Library actually contains.  This is done in various ways by publishing catalogues and other means.  The primary and important way is to have the space for the display.  That is the reason why the Bill is not comprehensive enough.  The Minister, in his opening address, said that housing the collection poses many problems. He went on to state that, in order to ensure that many fragile and priceless objects do not depreciate, it is essential to maintain variations in temperature, humidity and light within strict limits.  I want to repeat that in buildings of this kind, which house priceless objects that are fragile and damaged easily, air conditioning is essential as it would provide very strict controls on the humidity.</P>
    <P>With regard to light, it is interesting to read a very brief part of the review I spoke of, where it said:</P>
    <P>It was surimono prints that were most likely to meet these criteria. Being originally produced in a small printing-run for a privileged circle they had been carefully maintained for the century and a half since their making, so that their freshness and delicacy is almost undiminished.  If this vital conservation is to be continued, then the prints can only be displayed very temporarily.</P>
    <P>For that reason catalogues are necessary and we welcome the publication of these. The point I am making is that, as the Minister <Col N="1181" /> has said, control of light is most important. We need a building which will provide controls in all those areas &mdash; temperature, humidity and light.  The present buildings, with the exception of the last building which was built in 1975, are not capable of providing control in any of those areas.  Control at present is clumsy at best.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in conclusion, that while I welcome this Bill my understanding of it is that it does not provide for new buildings, although in section 1 it refers to additions and in section 2 it refers to the maintenance, upkeep, repair, renovation and improvement of the premises. For that reason the Bill is very restricted. It is essential, if this nation is to put a proper value on this important collection, that we would be making provision for a building where all these items could be stored and displayed properly and where no damage would occur to them.  If any other country in the world had this collection proper provision would be made for such a building.  I realise it is easy to be critical and to make recommendations.  I know that the Minister is conscious of the great value of this collection, and I appeal to him to make some proposals in the not-too-distant future for the provision of a suitable building for this very important collection.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo.  Tá an-áthas orm go bhfuilim sa Seanad nuair atá an Bille á chuir ar aghaidh, mar taispeánann sé go bhfuilimid buíoch de Chester Beatty as ucht an bhronntanais iontaigh a thug sé dúinn.  I was lucky enough on the last occasion when this Bill was being discussed and introduced by Senator Bulbulia to hear her give a wonderful description of the life and times of Chester Beatty.  I have been in the chair on a few occasions, and that was one occasion when I did not find time dragging.  I want to compliment her on giving a marvellous description of the life of Chester Beatty and for filling us in on his background.  Senator Fitzsimons has done this as well, so, coming on to <Col N="1182" /> Christmas, I do not intend taking you on another free cruise to Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It would make very good reading.  I would not mind reading it again and absorbing more of it the next time. Senator Fitzsimons has dealt with the building.  I do not intend repeating what has been said.  I want, as a Senator in 1985, simply to express my appreciation of what Chester Beatty has done and to show by passing this Bill that we as a nation apreciate his kindness and generosity in bequeathing to us such a valuable collection.  We are often inclined to mix up wealth and ignorance and to feel that people who accumulate wealth have missed the standard of culture they should have.  Chester Beatty is obviously one of those people who managed to do what we might regard as a very difficult, dirty, and from what Senator Fitzsimons has said, at times a dangerous job looking after the mines and still he managed to have this wonderful standard of culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia mentioned that he started off very early on in life.  If I remember rightly, he started collecting rare Chinese pepper cannisters &mdash; I am not so sure what nowadays a young fellow should start off collecting.  Senator Bulbulia made the very valuable comment that we should be sure not to discourage young lads who start off collecting stamps.  I can see stamps as a very normal thing to start of with, but snuff bottles from China, India or some such place was setting such a standard that it is no wonder he reached the heights he did later on.  We are lucky to have such a collection of important items in Dublin. It is marvellous that people can come here to see them and that they can attract people to come.  I have the privilege of having in our parish at home in Carlow the Brownshill Dolmen which is the biggest dolmen in Europe.  I often think to myself that many local people are unaware of its existence not to mention its historical significance.  As I drive home from school in the evening, especially <Col N="1183" /> during the summer, I see queues of people with foreign registered cars going to see the dolmen.  That attracts tourists here.  The Chester Beatty Library can do the very same thing for us.  It is nice that we can hold our heads high when it comes to world culture and the collection of valuables.</P>
    <P>I am pleased also that the universities honoured Chester Beatty while he was alive.  It so often happens that people are dead for many years before they are given the honour they deserve and we show our appreciation for their generosity and kindness.  I am glad that while he was alive he realised that his generosity was appreciated in Ireland.  It was something he accepted and he could die peacefully knowing that we were not completely forgetting what he did.  This Bill adds further to our appreciation of what he did.  I am delighted to be in the Seanad for the passage of this Bill.  The least we might do is maintain a building which contains such a valuable collection. Senator Fitzsimons, as an architect, understands air conditioning and related problems.  If this is necessary we will not be found wanting in making sure that we treat our collection in the best possible way.  That is our way of saying to Chester Beatty, &ldquo;We appreciate what you have done and we will continue to keep this collection to be inspected and appreciated by future generations of Irish people and visitors&rdquo;.  I welcome the Bill and hope it will continue to enhance the collection of the Chester Beatty Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators I too welcome the fact that this Bill was introduced in the Seanad.  The quality of speeches and the manifest interest of Senators who have contributed shows that there is an appreciation in this House of the importance of the Chester Beatty Library and of the wealth of the legacy to the Irish people which was given by him.  Like other Senators who have visited the Library, I was at once astounded and amazed at the wealth of objects and historical civilisation that is so evidently there.  I was also astonished <Col N="1184" /> at the penury in which the collection is kept in.  The difficulty of providing the simplest things: new showcases, the kind of facilities for permanent exhibition and anything that would seem to be manifestly important when you have such a valuable collection.</P>
      <P>Senator Bulbulia and Senator Fitzsimons have adequately described the wealth of the collection.  I would like in my comments to address some of the issues which we can consider in the context of this Bill.  I will, in the same spirit as Senator Fitzsimons, urge the Minister not to stop with the type of expenditure which he envisages in introducing this Bill but to be aware from the welcome the Bill have received in the House that there is a political will to go further in relation to ensuring that the collection itself is properly maintained, secured and fully developed.  The thrust of my speech is going to be that the collection is underdeveloped at present, that the purpose of bestowing it to the Irish nation has not been fully realised and fulfilled.  It has been significantly and partly fulfilled but not fully achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth noting that less than 1 per cent of the collection is on exhibit at any point in time.  That is a low percentage for any similar body, museum or special collection.  It is particularly regrettable because of the sheer quality of this collection. That is one of its outstanding aspects.  There are no duds, there are no second rate objects.  Every item from whatever civilisation is of the highest quality that money can buy and of the highest expertise advising on that quality. The collection represents material of the utmost quality and interest.  Yet less than 1 per cent is on show.  As Senator Fitzsimons mentioned, there are enormous problems in relation to storage, the adequacy of the present provision for storage.  We must ask ourselves whether we are sure that this priceless collection is being maintained and will continue to be maintained in a fully satisfactory way. Have we ensured that the type of storage areas and, as Senator Fitzsimons has emphasised, the maintenance of the <Col N="1185" /> proper environment and climatic conditions within that storage are sufficient to ensure the perpetuity of this priceless heritage so that we hand it on to the next generation in as good a state as it has been handed on to us?  I do not have specific worries or anxieties but there is some room for anxiety in relation to some of the more perishable of these objects, some of the manuscript material.  This is a matter of very grave concern.  It is a matter which should be investigated and the views of the trustees and staff should be fully taken into account in such an investigation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Fitzsimons that it is not adequate for the security of such a priceless collection that whenever there is to be an exhibition mounted or a change in the items on display, in either the old Library or the new gallery building, the objects have to be carried in the open air.  A curator with a tray would have to carry the priceless objects, no matter what the weather, possibly hurrying in the rain from one building to another with somebody else holding an umbrella or with a simple cover over these objects.  That is not desirable.  That is not an adequate way of securing in the first place, and also preventing possible accidental damage to, such objects. There should be linkage without the necessity to go out into the open air. There should be better provision for the exhibition itself.  Because of the constraints on space in the Chester Beatty Library there is no permanent exhibition. That again would be unusual in a collection and library of this kind.  Normally a visitor coming from another country or from an Irish source would look for the permanent exhibition as well as any other particular exhibition at any point in time. For reasons of lack of space that is not available.</P>
    <P>This is where I come down to the niggling points but they are a stunning contrast to the richness of the collection.  The display cases in the Far Eastern room, for example, are not suitable for the valuable Japanese pictures on display.  The lighting is wrong.  There is concern about displaying <Col N="1186" /> these invaluable Japanese scrolls and pictures in the type of cases there.  It would seem obvious that a body with such an incredibly important collection, including an important collection of Japanese pictures, would be able to have adequate display cases.  But that is not the case at present.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Office of Public Works becomes more involved in areas like maintenance there will also be a budget for simply ensuring that there is adequate resources available for lighting, display cases and other necessary improvements.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a great constraint on space.  The Chester Beatty Library needs special areas for particular exhibitions.  I did not get from the speech introducing this Bill a sense that the money envisaged which is at present referred to as being a total of £50,000 would be adequate for the kind of structural improvements required.  One possibility &mdash; Senator Fitzsimons referred to it &mdash; would be to move from Shrewsbury Road into some other building.  Within the complex on Shrewsbury Road a very considerable improvement could be made on space.  For example, the older Library building was intended to have a second storey which it does not have. It would be interesting to explore the possibility of building that second storey in order to create further space.  There are other ways in which existing buildings could be expanded to provide greater space.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne referred to some extent to the fact that the collection is not very well known to many Irish people.  I agree with him.  Hopefully this debate and the fact that we are discussing this Library in the Seanad will help to correct that.  One of the reasons is its location: It is located in an upper middle class residential area of Dublin.  It is not an area that vast numbers of the population generally find themselves in.  It is noticeable on a visit to the Chester Beatty Library that there are no facilities for the public.  For example, there is no place to have a cup of coffee.  There is a Library shop now and you can buy prints.  Anybody <Col N="1187" /> bringing children or who want to spend a bit longer are at a loss for easy access to refreshments, to a cup of coffee or to a lunch nearby because of the location of the Library.  I am sure that if there was a possibility of providing some limited refreshments in the Library, this would be of enormous help.</P>
    <P>Because of the wealth and variety of the objects in the collection both from the civilisations from which they are drawn and the different textures &mdash; from books, pictures, china objects, almost every substance of quality is reflected in the collection &mdash; it would seem desirable that there should be a conservation officer and conservation laboratory.  This would seem to be a very important aspect of developing and ensuring the preservation of the collection.  There should also be training for further experts and staff in the area.  That would seem to be the kind of development we should be envisaging.  Similarly, it would seem highly desirable &mdash; if we are going to see an expansion of an existing development of involving schools and universities in visiting and using the resources of the Chester Beatty Library &mdash; that there should be an education officer.  This would be of enormous benefit if we are to see the development of this collection.</P>
    <P>That would reflect the intention of the donor, Chester Beatty.  Not only did he bequeath his collection to the Irish people but he wanted it to be a learned institution. He actually, in some correspondence, had a vision that it would be linked to a university &mdash; he mentioned Trinity but that was only in passing.  The link with a university is more what he sought. All of that element is still underdeveloped. It would be greatly helped, as far as schools are concerned, if there was an education officer to help to develop it. The reason for that is central to the importance of the collection itself.  The most positive aspect of the collection is its superb quality and international importance.  As another part of ensuring its fuller development, it could and should be a conference centre for specialists worldwide.  There is no doubt that <Col N="1188" /> scholars from all over the world do come. They are probably the people who make most use and get most benefit from the Chester Beatty Library, a constant stream of scholars who avail of the rich variety of priceless objects.  It would be an important development to have a conference centre for specialists worldwide. It would be possible to organise major conference exhibitions because of the quality of the objects.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that only 1 per cent of the collection is on display at any particular time.  Another serious problem is that a whole proportion of the collection in the Chester Beatty Library has not been properly examined and made accessible outside the Library by being written about.  Therefore, it is not known because it has not been properly written up and published as such.  This is a terrible tragedy.  For example, the Durer Drawings were published a few years ago in the Chester Beatty Library.  Until that was done nobody even knew they were there.  It is a beautiful book of the collection; they are all of very high quality. There are so many other areas where it is not possible to know what is there, as they have not been properly collated yet because the staffing resources have not lent themselves to that.  It is extremely important that there is a full examination and writing up of the collections so that this can be published and a wider audience, both in Ireland and worldwide, will know of the wealth from the various cultures.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the collection which does not seem to have realised its full potential as far as we in Ireland are concerned.  Because the collection is international in standing and scope, because it is universal &mdash; as has been emphasised by other speakers &mdash; almost every major culture is represented in the Library.  It is of incredible potential for an island people, for the Irish nation, young children in Ireland and citizens of this country.  Because we are located on the edge of Europe, an island people, we can be rather inward looking in how we define culture.  Yet we have, here in Dublin, an extraordinary collection of <Col N="1189" /> the major civilisations of the world, an extra learning potential for our young, but it is not being developed in this way. It is not being linked in in the way it should be with what is happening in the universities.  Despite the fact that it is over 30 years since the Library was established in Shrewsbury Road, it is still a place that one could say that many Irish people are completely unaware of or only know as a name.  They may see the sign as they drive past but have not been there.  This is a sad reflection on the impact which the Chester Beatty collection has had.  It undermines the vision which Beatty had that it would be a major resource and learning institution for the nation.</P>
    <P>In order to develop this I believe that schools and colleges should have available to them the sort of facilities that major museums and collections have developed.  In other words, they should have slide packs, videos and wall charts from the collection.  These should be part of the education programme in schools and colleges.  Irish children should be very much aware of and speak familiarly and proprietorily about the Chester Beatty collection because they are entitled to do so.  School textbooks should be illustrated with items from the Library and they should reflect this culture. It is significant that, notwithstanding that we have this enormous resource, the universities have not developed Islamic and other studies which reflect this culture.  It might even sound strange to say that they should because we have not really taken it all on board in the way that it is so available to us to do if we only appreciated fully the enormous richness of it.  Therefore, it would be very important that this would happen.  There must be a much greater involvement of the Chester Beatty Library with third level institutions.  There should be greater exchange of staff and personnel.  I know of one graduate student in fine arts in Trinity College who is mainly based on the Chester Beatty Library because that is the nature of her studies; she is specialising in Islamic studies.  There is a certain <Col N="1190" /> linkage with the universities but this could be greatly increased without in any way undermining the independence and the autonomy of the trustees of the Chester Beatty Library.  There is great room for developing that potential.</P>
    <P>On this area of development I would urge as other Members of the House have urged, the importance of ensuring that we conserve and guard the collection in a manner which is at least in line with 20th century developments worldwide. With a collection of the highest international standard it is our duty, obligation and responsibility to ensure that the standard of preservation, conservation and maintenance is of the highest late 20th century standard.  To accept less than that is to diminish the value of this heritage.  We have no right to do that.  It would be contrary to all our instincts and to all the views expressed on this Bill in the House.  Our first duty is to conserve.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied at present that there is adequate conservation in the manner of storage, in the manner in which items have to be moved from building to building and in the atmospheric conditions in which items are kept.  Secondly, we must exploit fully the collection for the benefit of the public at large.  There should be much greater use of exhibitions and involvement of classes.  There is a role for an education officer to go and talk in schools about the Library.  There is also the need for the publication of a mixture of scholarly matter and scholarly examination of parts of the collection which are still almost unknown because they have not been catalogued.  They are also more popular in the sense that they are more addressed to general publications about the Library itself and the collections in the Library.</P>
    <P>It is important that we ensure that young staff are being trained.  I had the impression when visiting the Library that it has a very small, highly expert staff, all of a certain age &mdash; without being rude &mdash; and that it was not visible that they are working with each individual, highly qualified curator in the areas of the collection. It was not visible that four or five young Irish people were getting a highly <Col N="1191" /> important training so that this tradition would be carried on.  That is important. We are all taking pleasure in having a debate in the Seanad on this magnificent collection and magnificent heritage.  It is an opportunity to express concern.</P>
    <P>In so far as this Bill authorises the involvement of the Office of Public Works and the expenditure of further money on the Library, I would fully support it.  But I would, as Senator Fitzsimons has done and, as I am sure Senator Bulbulia did in her contribution, like to see this expanded in a more generous way in the areas I have talked about.  I would like to see the real potential of this collection understood and developed.  I would like to see that primarily for the Irish people although I agree that the collection is important in drawing scholars and others from all parts of the world to see it.  They would come in greater numbers if they knew more of the collections, if they were further explored and catalogued.  At the moment it is largely a hidden resource.  We must be concerned about that and make sure that it is fully explored and exploited.  Finally, I welcome this Bill and I hope in his reply the Minister will indicate the attitude towards the further development of the potential of this magnificent and valuable collection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is largely concerned with the question of the maintenance of this very rich collection.  It is altogether appropriate that in discussing the Bill we should emphasise the uniqueness and the richness of this collection.  It is a very small movement in the alphabet from the letter i to the letter j; it is a very small movement in the listing of the countries of the world from Ireland to Japan; but it is a very large movement in culture to move from the culture of this far western European island to the islands of Japan.  We have here in Dublin in the Chester Beatty collection a full reflection of the wide diversity of cultures that lies between Ireland and Japan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is some years now since I last read the account of the voyages of Marco Polo.  I cannot quite remember whether it was <Col N="1192" /> the first journey that took the northern route and the second the southern route to China, or <i>visa versa.</i>  Both these great traverses of culture are represented in the Chester Beatty Library; the northern route from these western islands to Germany, where printing was invented, to the Black Sea to Samarkand and the great silk road to China.  All the cultural diversity of that route is here in Dublin.  If we take the southern route through the Mediterranean lands to Asia Minor, Persia and through India, China and Japan all this tremendous diversity of culture is represented in this Library in Dublin.  As Senator Bulbulia has said, in a sense &ldquo;library&rdquo; is a misnomer because it is at once a library, a museum and a gallery, a most amazing assembly to have been put together by one individual.</P>
    <P>It is only natural for somebody like myself who has spent his life as an engineer and being subject through that of the general suspicion that all engineers are philistines to at least be able to point to Alfred Chester Beatty and say that here was an engineer who proved that engineering, culture and taste were not incompatible. He was, as Senator Bulbulia indicated in her speech, a most remarkable man.  He was, as Senator Fitzsimons said, a man who really roughed it during his younger years, a man who was told in his early forties that he could not be insured because of the damage to his own personal health as a result of his practical mining experience, but who, we are all very glad, lived for another 50 years to prove the insurers were wrong.</P>
    <P>Even those of us who have enough interest and enough knowledge to take part in this debate can hardly realise the riches of this collection.  It is a treasure house of human endeavour.  It is true, as Senator Browne said, that there is this tendency that when you have these things on your own doorstep you do not appreciate them.  This is certainly true of the Chester Beatty Library.  I have had much pleasure from the Chester Beatty Library but I did not visit it as early as I should have.  I cannot quite remember but I suspect my first visit to the Chester Beatty Library was probably under the necessity <Col N="1193" /> of bringing some visitor from one of the eastern cultures that was represented there.  This wonderful treasure is completely under-appreciated.  Maybe it is something about these specialist museums.  There is another museum in Durham.  It is nothing on the scale of the Chester Beatty Library but it is a very interesting oriental museum in the cathedral city of Durham.  When I visited Durham nobody ever told me about it.  I was walking around the city one evening when I discovered this small most interesting musuem by accident.</P>
    <P>We have here one of the most astounding collections.  We have in this museum in Dublin representatives of cultures not only spread geographically but throughout 5,000 years of history.  While we are not primarly concerned with the question of the nature of the collection.  I think it is relevant to what is in the Bill.  It is necessary to realise the uniqueness of this national treasure in order to appreciate how necessary it is, in order to appreciate how high a priority should be given to the maintenance of this treasure.  We have in this Dublin library <i>cum</i> museum <i>cum</i> gallery clay tablets dating back 5,000 years linking us with the very beginnings of literate culture.  Not only do we have that, we have among the Egyptian collection in the Chester Beatty Library - dating back I do not know how far because I am not really concerned with antiquity but with the nature of this particular item &mdash; an Egyptian love poem which gives us a link back to this rather dusty civilisation of Egypt which can bring home to us the realisation that human nature does not change over the millennia just as other parts of the collection indicate that human nature does not change over the world.</P>
    <P>This is not just something in esoteric interest; it is not just something for the cultured few.  The realisation that, over the millennia of history and over the global spread of geography, mankind is one can be the spur to effective political action in the world today in order to ensure that this world of ours does not dissipate itself into fragments.  In facing the great issues of threats to world peace, <Col N="1194" /> of feeding the people of the world we can realise that this world of ours is one world and must be treated as one world.  As a help to realising the unity and diversity of human culture we have in the Chester Beatty collection almost a dozen biblical codices.  We have over 200 copies of the Koran.  We have, as a counter balance to what we learned to appreciate from the western tradition of painting, examples of Persian painting, Turkish painting and of Indian painting.  We have many artefacts from Burma, Thailand and Japan.</P>
    <P>I understand that when there was an exhibition in Japan some years ago for which material was lent from all over the world, the contribution of the collection of the British Museum, that great repository of the fruits of imperial power, was of such a size that the individual who was responsible for it was able to put it under his arm and board the plane for Tokyo. But the representative of the Chester Beatty Library who was bringing the contribution of the Library was forced to book a second seat on the aircraft so much had this collection of ours in Dublin to contribute even in contrast with what we think of as the enormous riches of the British Museum.</P>
    <P>What we are saying to the Minister here today is maybe the trust that we accepted when we as a nation accepted the Chester Beatty collection has been put at risk.  Anybody who has visited the Chester Beatty Library and anyone who has discussed with the members of the staff of the Chester Beatty Library must reach the conclusion that, whatever excuses we may make about lack of resources, it is a fair charge.  Senator Robinson indicated in her contribution that we have at the very least put this magnificent, this comprehensive, this unique collection at risk.  While we must ordinarily commend the prudence of the Minister's Department in taking on extra burdens, we must deplore the inordinate delay in reaching the situation that we have this evening when this Bill is before us.  We must count ourselves lucky that there has not been damage, that there has not been loss.  I would like to say that we as a country who made the gesture <Col N="1195" /> of making Alfred Beatty an honorary citizen and made the gesture of giving Alfred Chester Beatty a State funeral have been extremely lucky that we did not find ourselves in the position of betraying the remarkable trust of Alfred Chester Beatty when he left this collection to the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>I join with the Senators who have reminded the Minister of the importance of this collection and the importance of ensuring that this collection is properly maintained in the future.  It has been preserved up until now but we have been lucky in this regard.  Our luck may not last.  I am glad to see in the definition section of this Bill, which empowers the Minister and his Department to improve the physical facilities of the Chester Beatty Library, that improvement includes addition.  I would join with Senator Jack Fitzsimons in what he said in this regard.</P>
    <P>The other point that is important is one that was stressed by Senator Mary Robinson, that we should use this great treasure that we have.  She has indicated that she feels that there could be greater links with our universities.  I certainly would agree with her on that but it is correct that at the same time we should point out that the links do exist.  There have been links and many scholars, both in Trinity College, Dublin, and in University College Dublin have taken full advantage.  It is true that eastern and far-eastern studies have been relatively neglected in our universities but we have had outstanding scholars in this field.  One can instance Professor Dermot Ryan before he was called to higher things, during the years in which he was Professor of Semitic studies at University College Dublin.  He not only played a full role in promoting such studies but indeed made full use of the facilities of the Chester Beatty Library.</P>
    <P>We must go beyond the scholars.  We must look out to the general public.  Here the Chester Beatty Library has achieved a great deal.  While we would all like to see more visits by the public and by schools, let us not overlook the fact that <Col N="1196" /> there are substantial visits by the Irish public, that there are substantial visits by the schools.  While we pay tribute to the permanent staff of the Chester Beatty Library, we should also pay tribute to those who act as guides for these visits, people who are not members of the permanent staff but who have been trained in order to act as guides for visiting groups.  We would all like to see an improvement in regard to group visits. Indeed we would hope that, in what the Minister is able to do under the Bill, it would facilitate further development in this regard.</P>
    <P>We underestimate the receptiveness of young people to collections such as the Chester Beatty Library.  We under-estimate the receptiveness of young people to our National Museum and to our National Art Gallery.  Children who are brought by parents or, as I now know at my stage of life, by their grandparents to these centres of culture react far more than one would expect.  The latent appreciation of culture seems to blossom and be effective at a far earlier age than, for example, an appreciation of landscapes. I have always remarked that there appreciation of landscapes seems to come at a much later stage.  Therefore, there is everything to be said for encouraging visits by the young.  While this is in a sense an esoteric collection, while it reflects cultures which in many ways we find difficult to appreciate the full nuance of, this should not prevent us from bringing children to see this at an early age.  It may well be that young children can appreciate this better, because their minds have not been overlaid by all the presumptions of our own western culture.  It may well be that just as a young child of the age of five, six or seven is in a better position to pick up a foreign language at that age, rather than at 14, 15 or 16 years of age, so too a child of that age may be far more open to receiving the latent messages of other cultures than a teenage child.</P>
    <P>We have had an interesting debate here in Seanad Éireann.  There has been an emphasis by many speakers on the uniqueness of this national treasure which Sir Alfred Chester Beatty has left <Col N="1197" /> to our care.  There has been a concern that we should exercise that care with more thought and with a greater financial commitment from the State than we have up to now.  There has been a concern that this treasure should be brought more clearly to the attention of the public, young and old.  With those three viewpoints I concur and indeed heartily support this Bill.</P>
    <P>Somewhat later I will be proposing that the Committee Stage be taken in February. I would like to propose that the Committee Stage be held in the Chester Beatty Library.  Perhaps the first stage of education might be to persuade, not those who are here, because they already obviously know of the great value of what we have, but our absent colleagues, to join us in the Chester Beatty Library in February for the Committee Stage.  If anyone can think of any way of doing that, perhaps the next step of the education of the Irish public in regard to the nature of this great collection would have been undertaken.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate on this Bill.  I am pleased, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Office of Public Works, to take responsibility for what is set out in the Bill.  As you know, the Office of Public Works, have a wide range of experience in dealing with problems posed in maintaining buildings such as the Chester Beatty Library.  I assure the House that the Office of Public Works will diligently and conscientiously discharge their responsibilities.  I shall deal with a number of specific points raised by Senators.  I assure Senator Hillery that the Office of Public Works have agreed with the trustees on procedures for the recoupment to the trustees of funds advanced by them.  I understand that the trustees are happy with the procedures. This Bill is necessary because neither the Government nor the Office of Public Works had power to spend money on <Col N="1198" /> this Library until this Bill was passed. There has been a grant to maintain and run the Library.  The trustees had to dip down into their own pockets in order to ensure that certain damage was not done on account of the state of repair of the Library.</P>
      <P>Professor Dooge has said that what is disappointing about this is that it did not come quickly enough.  I am inclined to agree with him.  This Library is there many years and it must have shown signs of deterioration long before now.  I agree with him that something should be done. On my own behalf all I can say is that on 18 October 1984 the Government made a decision to have a Bill drafted.  In fairness to everybody concerned it has come very speedily; in my office I have to wait for Bills a lot longer.  We had the Bill drafted and ready within a year.  I understand that there are problems in the Attorney General's Office and everywhere else but nevertheless it was produced very quickly.</P>

      <P>I am just saying this time scale has not been bad.  In reply to a point raised by Senator Robinson the Office of Public Works provide in the plans for indoor linkage between existing buildings and also linkage into the new extension so that objects would not therefore have to be brought out into the weather when they are being moved between the buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons raised the shortage of space.  It is obvious that space at the Library is restricted.  The Commissioners of Public Works have undertaken a feasibility study in respect of a new extension project to the existing complex of the <Col N="1199" /> building.  The study is at present before the Library trustees.  It is fair to say that the Office of Public Works are not in charge of museums or libraries in this State and that funds would have to be provided.  We have done the feasibility study and if the people accept it, we would certainly be ready to go ahead with the extension but it would have to be provided for in the Estimates for culture and art or in some other area.  We have done that.  If the trustees take up the question again, the funding will have to go to the arts and culture department.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons said it was a pretty small Bill.  I do not know what he means by stop-gap Bill.  The Bill gives the authority and the power required to do the job.  A big Bill would not do anything more than that.  I do not accept that it is a stop-gap Bill.  The Bill is adequate for what it was meant to do.  The purpose of the Bill is to do the necessary things for the preservation of this amazing collection. I agree thoroughly that that should be done.  Maybe it should have been long ago.  We are taking steps to do it now and the Bill gives the necessary authority for the State to provide the money to do it. That is the idea of the Bill.  The £50,000 mentioned by Senator Robinson is what the trustees have already spent and that is what we are going to give back to them. As Senator Robinson will understand we had no legal authority to even estimate what money was necessary to spend until now.  We have no legal authority to go in and do work and spend any money there until this Bill is passed.  That is the idea <Col N="1200" /> of the Bill.  I am not in a position to say what will be done about extensions.  That belongs to another department.  Our people are prepared to do it.  We will be doing a job that will ensure that there will be no damage caused to the valuables and I do not want to go into the collection that is there already.  Other people have done it.  I appreciate that this is very important.  What we are getting here today is the authority.  This Bill will have to go back to the Dáil.  I hope that the other stages will come immediately.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members of the Seanad for their courtesy to me and for the very learned and exciting contributions that have been made right across the board. I thank them for that and assure them that we will be doing what is necessary to preserve these treasures which have been handed over by a very great gentleman for the enjoyment of our people.</P>
