      <P>I have notice from Senators Pat Magner and Brendan Howlin that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, they propose to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions and other arrangements concerning the payment of pensions or other payments to retired employees of Irish Shipping Ltd. approved of by the Minister for Communications.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>
      <P>I also have notice from Senator Loughrey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The serious condition of roads in County Donegal as a result of over 40 days of frost.</P>
      <P>I regret that I have to rule this matter is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility as the maintenance of public roads in a county is a matter for the local authority concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to disagree with you.  I have been in touch with the Department and the county engineer for Donegal.  I am advised that prior approval for improvement works must be sought from and granted by the Department of the Environment.  As a result of frost in Donegal improvement works will have to be carried out.  I ask you, with respect, to re-examine that on those grounds.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 5, 3 and 4, in that order.  It is also proposed to suspend the House for tea from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  That would take up to No. 4, at 6.30 p.m., or earlier if the business permits.  Regarding item No. 2, I have had discussions with the Whips.  The original Order would set aside only one and a half hours for the debate and there would not be a limit on speakers, which might do an injustice to the actual motion and the interest in it on both sides of the House.  However, I am proposing that we have the normal time limit on non-Government motions. That would mean three hours overall debate.  The proposer of the motion will have 30 minutes and each contributor will have 15 minutes, to give as many speakers as possible an opportunity to contribute to this motion in which many of us have an interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the deputy Leader has decided that we should have <Col N="109" /> an extension of time on the motion dealing with disadvantaged areas but there are a number of speakers who would wish to contribute.  If you take the half hour for the Minister there are two and a half hours left.  That confines the number of speakers again.  Since the problem of disadvantaged areas has been around for a number of years, and there is not a county in Ireland in which meetings have not been held to discuss the problem, if we could have an open discussion without a time limit I do not think the people involved who are really interested would extend the debate too long.  I appeal to the deputy Leader of the House to allow anybody who has a definite and genuine interest in this debate to speak.  We are taking Nos. 1, 2, 5, 3 and 4.  Since the debate on the motion will take place from 6.30 onwards is the deputy Leader of the House only ordering the Canals Bill today?  What exactly is the situation?  We have not got any details yet.  Does the deputy Leader of the House expect a debate to take place on that item today?</P>

      <P>With regard to No. 5, the Canals Bill, I ask that it would not be ordered for today.  Due to an error the Canals Bill was not included in the Whip's notice to Senators on the Government side of the House.  Those of us who have an interest in the Canals Bill are prepared but we were not aware that it was coming up today.  This leaves us in a very awkward position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two winters have now passed since the Government promised legislation on homelessness.  My Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill has been on the Order Paper for considerably in excess of those two winters and yet the Government have apparently decided that the Canals Bill must take precedence over it. Not even the Family Planning Bill, which the then Leader of the House would not even name, not to mention discuss, was postponed to the extent that my Homeless Persons Bill has been postponed.  I find it singularly objectionable that after <Col N="110" /> an extraordinary and inordinate Government delay we still do not have time to complete what is a relatively innocuous Bill.  I have been uncharacteristically patient because I believed it was the proper way to do it.  There are people who have suffered over two winters and anybody who wants to find out what it is like should read the report of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee on homelessness which is comprised of civil servants, not of people involved and who have suffered for two years waiting for a promise to be kept. The least that I can get in the form of a promise is a promise of time to complete quickly the Second Stage of this Bill so that we can talk realistically about doing something about homelessness.  I am sick and tired of waiting and being put at the bottom of a list.  I am really beginning to believe that the most disadvantaged area of all is the area of a private Member trying to introduce legislation in this House.</P>

      <P>I would like to support what Senator McAuliffe-Ennis said in relation to the Canals Bill.  Like Senator McAuliffe-Ennis, and I am sure others, I have a speech in preparation on this subject and without notice the deputy Leader of the House orders it for today. This is unprecedented and I would like to ensure that this measure will not be taken today.  I was in possession when the Homeless Persons Bill was adjourned on the last occasion.  I would be more than happy to continue on that Bill if the deputy Leader of the House sees fit to have it ordered instead today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a plea that a compromise be reached as some of our friends on the other side of the House are anxious to put off discussion of the Canals Bill.  I know that the canals are in need of attention but I do not suppose that they will deteriorate so much if the discussion is put off for a week.  I feel we should take the Homeless Persons Bill instead of the Canals Bill.  My understanding was, as I am sure was Senator Ryan's, that when we returned to this Bill before Christmas it was with a view to finishing off the Second Stage and that when Senator FitzGerald adjourned the debate we would come back to it rapidly.  Rather than deal with the Canals Bill, 1985 today we should take the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 to try to finish Second Stage rather than have it drag on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support both Senators Brendan Ryan and McGuinness in regard to taking the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 and deferring consideration of the Canals Bill, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point made by Senator McAuliffe-Ennis that notice was not circulated to Senators on this side of the House that the Canals Bill, 1985 would be taken today.  It would be desirable to have it postponed, not indefinitely but for a short period, to enable Senators to be prepared for it.  I share the sense of impatience and even frustration of Senator Ryan in relation to the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983.  This is a major proposal in the area of reform of our social legislation.  It affects the position of the most needy and disadvantaged in our society.  I feel it would have been possible for the House to order a more lengthy debate so that we could conclude <Col N="112" /> the Second Stage of that Bill.  I have been waiting, and I know a number of other Senators have also been waiting to get in on the debate on that Bill.  As the business has been ordered today, it is unlikely that there will be any length of time for a debate even if the Canals Bill, 1985 is not ordered for today.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the deputy Leader of the House to ensure, perhaps on a Thursday, that time would be set aside for an extensive debate which would lead to a conclusion of Second Stage.  The debate that has taken place has been extremely fragmented which is not a good way for this House to consider and examine this very serious social issue.</P>
    <P>I would support the proposal of Senator McGuinness to substitute the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 for the Canals Bill, 1985 as the third item on the Order of Business in the hope that we can-have some debate on it this afternoon.  I would ask the deputy Leader of the House to ensure we get a much better opportunity, perhaps on a second sitting day in the week, to have an extended debate and finalise the Second Stage of that Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the previous speaker and I would ask the deputy Leader of the House to readjust the Order of Business so that we can discuss the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983.  The subject of canals has been dormant for many years so I cannot see any urgency attached to it at this time. The Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 deals with a very sensitive area regarding the housing of people who have no houses to live in, for example, those sleeping rough and unable to get proper housing.  It would appear that after two years the Government have no intention whatever of bringing in such a Bill.  For that reason I go along with the speakers in saying that two years is a long time to wait.  The Order of Business should be readjusted to include the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, 1983 instead of the Canals Bill, 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It never ceases to amaze me that Members of the House express views one day which are contrary to the ones they express on another day.  I had opposition on the last day we were sitting from Senators B. Ryan and Lanigan that we were not taking enough Government legislation.  Today I ordered two pieces of Government legislation and I am asked not to have one because Senators want Private Members' legislation.  We cannot have it both ways.  Whether we sit on Thursdays, Fridays or Sundays is a matter for agreement between the Whips.  It is appropriate from Senator Robinson's comment that the Whips meet to see if there is a consensus of people who want to be in this House every day.  It they are available on Thursdays then the Whips will certainly be able to consider it.  There is no point in having this House sitting all day with just one or two people here devoting all their time to the legislation before them at the request of somebody else who at all times may not be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Members &mdash; I do not want to lecture them on the Order of Business &mdash; that on the last day on which this House sat I ordered the Canals Bill for today, which meant that this was the earliest possible date on which we could take it.  On the Adjournment of the House &mdash; there were not many Members present &mdash; I said that we would be taking the Second Stage of the Canals Bill today. I arranged that the Minister would be available if we reached it.  That is the only way I can progress on the Order of Business on the basis of wanting to facilitate Senators with Government legislation and wanting to ensure that there is a Minister available when the legislation comes up on the monitor.  I do not want to prejudge how long the Age of Majority Bill will take but if it takes ten minutes then this House will have no problem, but if it takes two or three hours &mdash; I cannot determine that &mdash; I want to make sure that every Member of the House will have the opportunity to make <Col N="114" /> a contribution on any of the remaining Stages of that Bill.  I cannot put a time limit on that.  I am in the hands of the House as to how long any legislation will take.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan's comment about not restricting the motion on the disadvantaged areas is a good one but I ask Senators to abide by the rules and that for the moment the House should adopt the normal procedure for non-Government legislation, that is three hours.  If, at the end of that time, there are people who have not had an opportunity to speak then this House can determine that the time will be extended to facilitate them. I would like to facilitate Senators on that because it is a reasonable request.  Other than that, how the business of this House runs or whether we get to any particular legislation is a matter for the Members. I must ensure that the Government legislation, which was promised, is ordered. It is then a matter for the House whether we get to it today or the next day.</P>
    <P>I must remind Senator B. Ryan that the Fine Gael group in the House forfeited some of their Private Members' Time to try to facilitate his Bill.  Everybody is concerned that it should progress as quickly as possible.  There is no way that that Bill in its present form could be adopted by members of local authorities who have experience in the area of re-housing. Just to think that this is a lovely Bill and if it can be passed through this House it will settle all the problems of houses for homeless people might be irrelevent in view of the depth and complexity of this matter.  The Government are aware of the complexity and have promised their own legislation.  I have given a commitment to Senator Brendan Ryan that we will proceed in an orderly fashion to discuss this Bill and promote it as far as we can as a House of the Oireachtas. Then it is a matter for the Government to amend it, or accept it or bring their own Bill forward.  I ordered it for today in the hope that we might reach it.  There have been consultations between the Whips and between other people about the Order of Business.  I did not decide it off the top of my head.  I am sorry that <Col N="115" /> Senator Ryan was not consulted.  I cannot consult with every Member of the House, I can only consult with the leaders of the groups and the Ministers involved.  That is why I have ordered the business as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for a reduction in the age of majority from 21 to 18.  It also provides that on marriage a person under 18 becomes an adult.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the fact that one or both spouses enter into marriage before they have attained the age of 18 years can in many cases be an indication of immaturity rather than maturity.  Therefore, would the Minister consider it desirable that contracts entered into by such persons should require the signature of both spouses? Such a requirement would provide some safeguard against the type of exploitation to which I and other Senators adverted during our Second Stage contributions. A safeguard such as this is vital in cases where either or both spouses are under the age of 18 and also in cases where neither spouse has reached the full age for marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Senator has outlined, <Col N="116" /> a person would reach the age of majority on attaining 18 years of age, or on the date of marriage if that is earlier. A person will reach the age of majority on the day of the marriage and for that spouse that day will be the day he attains age of majority.</P>
      <P>On the question of contracts, the difficulty that arises is that if we try to protect people from their own immaturity, regardless of what age they are, whether it be 16, 18, 25 or older, then we would put them in a position where the banks, the lending associations or the local county councils would not be in a position to enter into a contract with them if they are not to be full parties to the contract. If we put in any kind of subsidiary clause which indicates further protection for people to whom we are now extending these benefits, then we will obviate the practical advantages of having reached the age of majority.  On a practical level it would be normal for lending agencies to require both signatures.  That would be particularly true where the most perceived need arises from the point of view of Deputies and Senators who have the experience of young people between 18 and 21 who cannot get a local authority loan.  I understand that requires two signatures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of attaining majority on marriage, would the Minister explain to the House why people should become adults because they are married prior to reaching 18 years?  I do not know why that should qualify a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): That is approaching the argument from the wrong end.  People marry at an age younger than 18.  That puts them in a position were at least they endeavour to set up an independent household, lead a life as a husband and wife and make decisions as a family.  That situation at the moment leaves them in a position where, for example, they cannot get a housing loan or they cannot enter into a <Col N="117" /> contract for the purchase of anything, or furnish a house or flat if they are local authority tenants.  It is not to approach the argument to say why they should be adults at 18.  It is realistic that because they are married and they want to lead independent lives, whether in private accommodation or in a local authority flat or house, they have certain legal disabilities which we are trying to remove from them.  The whole question of the age of marriage is a separate issue.  It will be a matter for the Government to decide whether they will change the free age of marriage to 18 by regulation of the Minister for Health, which I said previously, does not require legislation, and then how they will act on the minimum age for marriage and whether marriage below a certain age would be null and void.  It is at that stage of the argument that Senator O'Leary's point is more relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there is a historical basis for this but we are doing something new here.  Could the Minister give us a convincing argument why we should agree with it?  It appears that a person who has attained the age of 18 years should be considered an adult and to be no longer under the disability of having a limited right of contract.  It would be wrong to say that everybody who gets married under 18 years of age is irresponsible, but it is certainly true that some people who are under 18 years of age and get married take that step in a hasty manner.  Why should two people under 18 years who take a step as important as that in a hasty manner, and as a result of their haste are proving that they are not mature enough, be granted an earlier arrival at the age of majority than the people who refrain from getting married even though they are subject to the same pressures, desires and impulses?  There is no logical reason why somebody who wants to get married under the age of 18 years should suddenly become an adult.  I would like the Minister to have another look at that to see whether we should define an adult as just <Col N="118" /> being a person who reaches 18 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I would like to say to the Senator that my approach here would be that when we go about changing the law we should change the law for the benefit of people, not as an academic exercise in law change. Anybody who is working at the other end of the problem knows that when young people who are under 21 years of age get married certain difficulties arise.  Those difficulties are not just difficulties for people between 18 and 21 years; they are difficulties that exist for all people under 21 years who are married when it comes to providing a home.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the Senator's attention to the Law Reform Commission's Working Paper No. 2, published in 1977.  On page 20 of that working paper it states:</P>
      <P>The origin of the idea of emancipation is the relief of the minor from parental power and control &mdash; a power and control greater in those systems of law that are based upon the Civil Law, than is those based upon the Common Law.  The law as to emancipation of minors is not uniform throughout the Civil Law world and there are variations even among the members of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>Then it goes on to refer to Article 41.1 of the Constitution which states:</P>
      <P>1º The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
      <P>2º The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
      <P>It goes on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From this it can be argued that no legal impediments or obstructions should be placed in the way of a young <Col N="119" /> married person solely on the grounds of age and that such a person would have the legal capacity to acquire a home and to furnish it.  He should also have the right to establish a trade or business.  As a consequence he should be legally able to borrow money, to incur debts and to undertake contractual obligations.  Third persons should be able to deal with any married minor secure in the knowledge that the minor will be bound by his transactions.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say in paragraph 2.44:</P>
    <P>Recognition has already been given to the special position of a married minor.</P>
    <P>It refers to the 1964 Guardianship of Infants Act.  The Law Reform Commission Report, LRC 5 of 1983, in section 17, page 9, states:</P>
    <P>The Commission noted that from this it could be argued that no legal impediments or obstructions should be placed in the way of young married persons solely on the ground of age and that such persons should have the legal capacity to acquire a home and to furnish it.  They should also have the right to establish a trade or business. As a consequence they should be able to legally borrow money, to incur debts and to undertake contractual obligations. A third person should be able to deal with any married minor secure in the knowledge that the minor will be bound by his transactions.</P>
    <P>Almost the same words in the argument in the working paper are incorporated in the final report and they based it on certain Articles in the Constitution which I have quoted.  There is a very strong constitutional argument for doing what we are doing here.  If we were to separate the age of majority from the age of marriage as suggested by the Senator, we would have a constitutional difficulty.  If there was never a constitutional difficulty what we are doing makes sound commonsense in the real situation where people are faced with the difficulties of being <Col N="120" /> married, being under age, trying to set up a home, frequently having a baby, looking for a flat or a local authority house, or trying to borrow money to build or buy their own house.  That is the normal pattern we come across and I do not think it would be advisable to rule out from the benefits of this legislation people under 18 years of age who are married.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator O'Leary would like us to get involved in a very interesting philosophical discussion of this question but, by and large, I agree with the Bill as it is.  We have to approach this question from the point of view of why the Bill is being introduced, why is the age being brought down.  Is it for the benefit of people who are 18, or is it for the benefit of the public generally?  I assume it is for the benefit of the people concerned, those who have reached 18. It seems to be the general view that at that age not only are they qualified to make decisions and enter into contracts and so on, but from their point of view it would be very advantageous that they should be enabled to do so.  It is correct to say that in many cases the reason why people of that age would want to be able to enter into contracts and do all the other things mentioned is that they are contemplating marriage.  So, in a marriage where the couple are a year or two under 18 exactly the same arguments apply, that in these circumstances they should be able to do what those who are 18 will be enabled to do under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mullooly was talking about taking advantage of people between the age of 18 and 21.  They cannot have it both ways; if we are going to have a situation where people of 18 and over are deemed to be of full age and capable of doing things which those over 21 were entitled to do up to now, then they have to take the consequences of that.  We cannot have a situation where they are going to have all the advantages of being given these new rights but not suffer the disadvantages.  It is true also that people under the age of 18 who are married would want these rights and it is correct <Col N="121" /> that a special case should be made for them.  It can certainly be argued that a person married under 18 is not more mature than a person who is not married, but from the point of view that those who are married and under 18 need these rights to buy a house, or whatever, then there is a good case for giving them these rights.  The case as made in the Bill for giving these rights to married people under 18 is, in all the circumstances, a reasonable one.</P>

      <P>I would agree with the point of view expressed by Senator Ryan. If the point of view expressed by Senator O'Leary were put into legislative form there would be a very impractical situation. If people marry under the age of 18 then that is only achieved after certain consents have been obtained.  It would be very impractical if such a person were not able to deal at arms length in contractual situations in the wide-ranging world that we live in today.  It would make the position of such a person absolutely impossible.</P>
      <P>I would like to look at the matter from another point of view and this is something I raised on Second Stage and which other Members have raised and that is the question of the age of unfettered freedom to marry.  I still do not follow the reasoning as to why that is not reduced to 18 years.  In the Minister's Second Stage speech in this House he said that the matter was being discussed by the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown and that the Government would await their report for further consideration. Do the Government, first, intend following the advice of that committee actively to pursue this issue and, secondly, has the Minister any idea or firm commitment one way or another at this stage as to what the age of unfettered freedom to marry would be?  It seems unwise that that particular exception should exist following the introduction of this Bill and particularly following the arguments that have been put forward by so many people in favour of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I would refer back to the point made by Senator O'Leary &mdash; and the Law Reform Commission also &mdash; in arguing this.  They referred to the fact that a married minor already had certain legal powers under existing legislation: for example, the Guardianship of Infants Act makes it possible to appoint a guardian by will; the Succession Acts, to make a will; the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844, as amended by the Marriages Act, 1972 allows a widow or widower who is a minor to marry without parental consent or other consent.  The commission saw no reason why these precedents should not be followed generally in regard to other legal transactions.  They also considered that this view was further endorsed by section 10 of the Family Law Act, 1981 which declares that consent to the sale or disposition of the family home will not be invalid by reason only that it is given by a spouse who has not attained the age of majority.  They recommended that, on marriage, a minor should in law become an adult and should have all the rights and be subject to all the liabilities of a person who has reached the age of majority.  Incidentally, when they published this nobody made a submission during the time between the working paper and the final report which suggested that it should be otherwise.</P>
      <P>On the question raised by Senator Durcan on the age of marriage and what the free age of marriage should be, I made a number of points about this on Second Stage.  First, the age of marriage and the age of majority have never been treated in synonymous terms and I do not see why we should do so now.  They are separate issues and I would like to see them treated separately.  Secondly, the Minister for Health, by regulation, can reduce the free age of marriage from 21 to 18, so it does not require primary legislation and it does not require inclusion in this Bill.  If the Government decide that the free age of marriage should be 18 then it can be done by regulation by the Minister for Health.  It is the Marriage Act of 1972 which empowers him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" /> On the question then of whether there should be a minimum age for marriage below which marriages would be null and void if contracted and where the whole question of the consent of the parent or guardian or indeed the courts would be removed from legislation and practice and you had a cut-and-dried situation where a person was free to marry at 18 and below that age any marriage entered into would not be a valid marriage &mdash; this is something that we should look at when the Committee on Marriage Breakdown publish their report and I understand they will be publishing it shortly.  To comment further would be to pre-empt the debate on that report and certainly to pre-empt the Government decision as a result of that particular section of the report.  I know they are making recommendations on the age of marriage.  I know also that the nature of their recommendations was published in the newspapers but their work is not complete and in so far as they are a committee of the Houses all their advice will be incorporated in one report which will be available to all of us. That would be the time to make the appropriate decision on both the free age of marriage and the question of the age of marriage in general with or without consent, whether it is of parent or guardian or the consent of the President of the High Court, as arises in some circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice never ceases to amaze me in the way in which he can face two ways at the one time.  On the one hand he says that the age of majority and the age of marriage are separate issues.  On the other hand, when I raised my original point he in fact said of course the age of majority is vital in respect of those people who chose to get married and who get the necessary consent under 18 years of age.  They are not separate issues.  Whether the Minister likes it or not they are caught up together. The age of majority and the age of marriage are, by the Minister in his legislation, being tied together.  Anybody under 18 years of age who gets married will <Col N="124" /> have reached the age of majority.  So, in fact it is the Minister who is typing it up. It is true to say that certain legislation has already made a connection between the two but we are going much further than that.  What we are saying is that anybody under 18 years of age who gets married will reach the age of majority immediately.  Of course I understand what the Minister says with regard to the difficulty of those under 18 years of age getting loans from the local authority.  I understand that that problem exists at present with regard to those under 21 years of age.  But there are two points to be borne in mind here: first, the reduction of the age from 21 to 18 will of itself get rid of the major portion of the problem. Making 18 the age of majority will get rid of most of the problems in this area. But there will be a residual number of problems of people who married under 18 years of age.  Their situation would not be ameliorated by this Bill unless what the Minister suggested is possible.</P>
      <P>When legislation is introduced it is not just introduced for the purpose of facilitating any sub-group of people, a sub-group being the people who are under 18 years of age when they get married.  It must also be introduced bearing in mind the common good.  Will it have the effect of encouraging people to get married under 18 years of age?  If it will, is that a policy direction in which we wish to go? If there are those who think that people should be encouraged to get married at as young an age as possible, that is fair enough, but I can see a situation coming about where in the absence of any other activity by the Government or by the Legislature over the years to come, we will encourage people under 18 years of age to get married because they will acquire significant additional rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made my position quite clear last week when we discussed the Second Stage of this Bill.  I am quite happy to have the age of majority at 18 years of age.  I do not want it to go any lower than that.  I think that is the very minimum that it should be.  I do not believe that we should encourage people, or even permit <Col N="125" /> people to get married, in our present constitutional framework, under 18 years of age.  Here we are introducing legislation which is specifically designed to facilitate that mood.  For that reason I think it is inconsistent.  That is why I think the Minister should have another look at this and leave the law in respect of those people under 18 years of age in the same situation as at present in respect of those under 21 years of age who choose to get married.</P>

That is the list of enactments in regard to which 21 years of age will continue to apply.  What is the practical effect of the inclusion of the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844 in that section? If the Minister has that information available it would be of considerable advantage to me anyway in the consideration of this legislation.  When the Minister has dealt with this I have something further to say on (b) (VIII) which I think is one to which the House should give some attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider (VIII) which I think is the one which <Col N="126" /> was included at the suggestion of certain Deputies in the other House, confirming the application of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act and also the Illegitimate Children Affiliation Orders Act, 1930 but specifically the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, and provides for the payment of the maintenance in support of children up to the age of 21 years?  Perhaps I could briefly say what I understand the position to be, and if I am wrong the Minister can correct me.  I understand that at present there is a general duty on parents to maintain their children in that sense up to 16 years of age and that that general duty ceases at 16 years of age.  Where a person is pursuing a course of full time education that maintenance duty continues until the person is 21.  I further understand that there are presumptions that a child who is in some way disadvantaged or disabled does cease to have the right of maintenance on the attainment of 21 years.  I am not really concerned with that; I think it is a separate and distinct point.</P>
      <P>It appears that two points arise on that. One is, why should there be a general duty of maintenance only as far as 16 years?  If the child does not, in normal circumstances, leaving out the question of marriage, reach the age of majority until 18 years of age why should the parents' duty of maintenance cease at 16?  Would the Minister agree that the general duty of maintenance should be increased to whatever is the appropriate age of majority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is how does the Minister come to the conclusion that when a person has reached the age of majority at 18 and is in full time education, that on another adult citizen of the country who happens to be that person's parent, there is a duty to maintain that person even though the person they are maintaining is an adult and may have no duty or responsibility to live within the rule of guardianship of the parent during the time between 18 and 21?  Further, does the Minister think that that is a duty which is enforceable under the Constitution? Is it enforceable that one adult <Col N="127" /> should be forced by law to maintain another adult in the pursuance of an expenditure &mdash; that is on full time education &mdash; which the maintaining adult has no power to initiate or power to stop?  It appears to me to be quite an extraordinary extension of responsibility to suggest that one adult should be maintained by another, when there is no mutuality of contract between them.  Obviously, in the case of husband and wife, where there is a marriage contract between them, and the wife is under a duty to maintain the husband and the husband is under a duty to maintain the wife, I can understand that because that is as a result of a separate and distinct contract.  But this is not as a result of a contract at all.  It is just something which continues after the parent has ceased to have any power or influence over or duty or responsibility towards the direction of the child's life.  I would like to ask the Minister what is his view on that; why he changed his view during the discussion in the Dáil and how he squares that with the change of view within the Law Reform Commission between the working paper and their final report, when initially they recommended that the law should be as it is now proposed and later changed to a situation where that duty should cease at 18 years of age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Senator O'Leary is bringing up two distinct matters under this heading.  First of all, I will deal with the change brought about in the Bill as a result of the amendment I moved in the Dáil.  At present a maintenance order may be made under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 or the Illegitimate Children Affiliation Orders Act, 1930, as amended by the 1976 Act, in respect of a child up to 21 years of age, if he is receiving full time education.  Under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, a maintenance order may be made for a child up to 21 years without any requirement as to full time education.  The Bill, as initiated in the Dáil, would have had the effect that references to 21 years of age in both these <Col N="128" /> statutes would be construed as references to 18 years of age after the commencement of the Act.  Consequently, maintenance orders could not be made for children over 18 years of age, except, of course, in respect of incapacitated children, in respect of whom there is no upper age limit.</P>
      <P>I changed from that position as published to the present position when I moved the amendment to include this new paragraph because I listened to the Deputies on Second Stage and thought they made reasonably convincing arguments, especially one particular Deputy. I moved that amendment and the next one as a result of that.  The present position under which maintainance orders can be made in respect of children up to 21 years of age, is being maintained.  It was accomplished by the amendment which I moved in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary referred to the background to this.  The Law Reform Commission considered the question of maintenance of children who have attained the age of majority.  In their working paper they indicated that they were in favour of continuing the existing law relating to entitlement of maintenance up to 21 years of age.  That is in paragraph 5.22 of the working paper.  But in their final report, in paragraph 67, they concluded that it would not be desirable to impose continuing maintenance obligations on parents of children, other than those who are mentally or physically disabled, who have reached the age of majority, even if they are receiving full time education.  The commission considered that that balance of the argument favours the view that the necessary implication of attaining majority is that a person is sufficiently mature and independent to be responsible for his or her own maintenance rather than looking to his or her parents for support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as initiated was drafted on the basis of the recommendations in the commission's final report.  There are arguments on both sides.  Quite obviously, when I produced a Bill on one basis and subsequently amended it, it was clear that there were arguments on both <Col N="129" /> sides and that I was not definitive in my view until I came to the amendment stage.  On the one hand, maintenance under our laws has never been payable beyond the age of majority, except in the case of handicapped children.  It can be argued that once the law accepts that a person has attained adulthood, obligations on his parents to support him beyond that age in the normal case where no question of handicap arises, should not be imposed by law.  It can also be argued that it is only where parents are separated and in dispute that one or other in practice will be obliged by law to maintain a child in higher education, and that this is unfair.  For the majority of children whose parents are living together there would be no question of one or the other of the parents being obliged to maintain the child in higher education.  That would be a family decision in a family situation. The argument is really on the lines that children of separated parents should be treated no differently from other children, that is leaving it up to the parents themselves to decide or agree up to what age beyond 16 years they should maintain the child.</P>
    <P>On the other hand it can be argued that the reduction in the age of majority, which is intended to be of benefit to young people, should not operate to the detriment of some who may be in difficult family circumstances and who are not in a position to support themselves but whose parents can afford to support them.  In the practical situation you would have children of broken marriages in third level education who are being maintained as a result of maintenance orders and whose source of income would be cut off and who would have to discontinue their education.  That is a major difficulty. But the working paper advised in one direction; the final report advised in another direction.  I followed the final report when I published the Bill.  Subsequently, listening to the arguments on Second Stage in the other House I introduced this amendment.  It was accepted unanimously.</P>
    <P>The second point raised by Senator O'Leary is connected with the first.  He <Col N="130" /> raised the point of the obligation on parents to maintain children up to 16 years of age.  He questioned why that should not be 18 years and why, when I was changing from 21 years down to 18 years for the age of majority, I did not also move from 16 years to 18 years on the age where parents would have an obligation to maintain their children.  I have two reasons for doing so.  It is a separate issue from the age of majority. It is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.  Also, it could raise many other issues which might delay this Bill.  If the Minister for Social Welfare wants to move on it then a Social Welfare Bill might be a more appropriate vehicle.  I said in my Second Stage speech here that the commission proposed that the age up to which parents should be obliged to maintain children for the purposes of social welfare and other legislation should be raised from 16 years to 18 years of age.  But when we were considering it in Government it was considered that this matter would be more appropriately dealt with in the context of the legislation concerned.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, on the question of the obligation of parents to maintain children up to 18 years of age, I would favour that personally: I do not have any argument in principle against it.  It was simply considered that this Bill was not the appropriate vehicle and that it might complicate the situation further.  It was intended that this would not be a controversial Bill but that it would be a Bill that would give real legal benefit to a particular defined category of approximately one quarter of a million young people.  On the other hand, it is the balance of argument between what the Law Reform Commission recommended in their working paper and what they concluded in their final report.  I went one way when I authorised the publication of the legislation and then I went back to Government and told them I wanted to amend it because of the arguments which were put on Second Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On the basis of a legal evaluation of the argument I did not think it advisable to bring everything down to 18 and make <Col N="131" /> no exceptions on the basis of the particular situation in which individuals find themselves.  I think their maintenance should be maintained up to 21 while they are in third level education.  I am sure the Senator will tell me that hard luck cases make bad law but I think there is a balance of argument there.  I am trying to explain the way in which I arrived at the decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this is not the appropriate legislation to change the general duty of maintenance from 16 to 18.  I mentioned it to put the thing in its full context.  I would not consider moving an amendment to this legislation to include that because I understand it is not the Minister's area of responsibility.  The Minister did bring to our attention a particular problem that arises.  On a transitional basis a problem would arise in respect of orders which had been made and commitments which had been entered into in respect of individuals who assumed they were going to be maintained until 21.  Some kind of transitional provisions in that regard would have been in order.  The Minister did not tackle the major point I am making and that is, is it enforceable?  Can you legislate to make one adult who is in no position of authority or contractual position or has not guardianship over another person maintain a third party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might like also to consider the possibility that this does not only apply in cases of husbands and wives who are separated.  Without knowing the exact method by which it would be done I am quite confident that after this legislation is passed the child or the erstwhile child will be in a position, if he or she wants to pursue third level education after 18 years of age, to seek a maintenance order against the parents.  Even if the parents are living together I do not see any reason why the child would not be in a position to seek a maintenance order.  The legislation may be framed in such a way that they might have to do it through a third party, but that would not present any tremendous problem.  You <Col N="132" /> have a situation where you are not just talking about children of broken homes, you are talking about a situation where you are granting to a new group of adults, those between 18 and 21, the right to decide for themselves, without reference to their parents, that they are going to go to third level education and then to seek the support of a court in maintaining them in that condition.  The parents will have lost the guardianship.  They will not be able to tell the child: &ldquo;You will (or you will not) go to university.&rdquo;  The child himself will say: &ldquo;I want to go to university and because I am going to university you must maintain me.&rdquo;  That appears to me to be a very peculiar law.  While I understand and appreciate and agree with what the Minister is trying to do I wonder is it enforceable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Still it is not a precedent to argue that one adult should not be responsible for the maintenance of another adult because that is the situation that pertains already in law. The third point that I would like to make is that a maintenance order of this nature will be a matter for a court to decide and the court is obliged to decide, examining all the circumstances of what is fair and what is proper.  Finally, in section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 it says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> Any person being a guardian of an infant may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the infant and the court may make such order as it thinks proper.</P>
    <P>It is the guardian or the parent that initiates the maintenance order in the court and there is no provision under the Guardianship of Infants Act for the child to initiate a legal action to achieve maintenance. They cannot get to first base on the issue.  It is not extending to a whole category of new people the right to take actions against their parents so that they will be maintained between 18 and 21 because the primary legislation does not provide for their maintenance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I do not have that legislation with me but my memory is that the child can get over the problem of the guardian having to make the application.  The guardian does not have to be the parent.  The court can, in fact, recognise another applicant as the person's guardian for that purpose.  If that legislation limits the power of application to the guardian then how is it going to apply when this is passed?  It is quite clear that after this is passed neither parent will be the guardian of the child. They will be the parents of the child but in law they will not be the guardian of the child.  Will they then find themselves in the same difficulty as the Minister says that the child will find itself in?  If only the guardian can make the application and the parent will no longer be the guardian, because a person will have reached the age of majority, who will make the application?</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): There is no problem in giving a commitment to have a look at it, that is if the Seanad gives us the time to look at it between Committee and Report Stage, or as Committee Stage goes along.  It is only fair to say that any time we make changes in the law, especially law of this nature, it can run the distance and can be subject to constitutional test.  Any time anybody changes any law he does it in the knowledge that it can run eventually to the Supreme Court and it can be tested.  That should not inhibit us from making changes in the law which we desire.  I know that Senator O'Leary would probably approach the thing from a different background from that which I would approach it.  My approach would be that there are practical difficulties which I can identify and we should change the law to remove the practical difficulties which are affecting the day-to-day lives of young people.  I am not approaching it from the side of studying the law and seeing what are the required changes to make it better law <i>per se.</i>  I am trying to remove difficulties which are certainly affecting young people between 18 and 21 and certainly young married people under the age of 21.  I will look at it.</P>

      <P>I consider it more desirable to refer to somebody who has not reached full age as a minor rather than as an infant.  My question is, is it not proper to do that at the present time?

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): We are not changing the term &ldquo;infant&rdquo; to &ldquo;minor.&rdquo;  In existing legislation where the word &ldquo;infant&rdquo; is the term used, it will remain.  It is an enabling section to enable people to substitute the word &ldquo;minor&rdquo; for &ldquo;infant&rdquo;.  It also encourages the use of the term &ldquo;minor&rdquo; rather than an &ldquo;infant.&rdquo;  I think it is a misnomer to refer to a person of 17 years of age as an infant.</P>

      <P>The Minister said it is an enabling and an encouraging section but, in practical terms, does it mean anything? At the moment, people under 21 years of age are referred to as infants and as minors.  The section does not change anything. Would it not be better, in a more positive form, if the section were to state that &ldquo;a person who is not of full age shall be described as a minor&rdquo;?  It would be preferable, when this Bill is enacted, that a person under 18 years of age should be referred to as a minor rather than an infant.  The section as it stands does not do anything.  The Minister says that the section encourages but it should do more than that.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Any change in the use of language will only take place over time.  I do not think we can wish changes in language.  If the colloquial term is &ldquo;infant&rdquo; it will take time before the colloquial term becomes &ldquo;minor.&rdquo;  It is changing and people quite frequently talk about people under age as minors, but the legal term is &ldquo;infant&rdquo; because the particular Acts which govern <Col N="136" /> that, refer to &ldquo;infants&rdquo;, for example, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  If it is to be made mandatory to change from &ldquo;infant&rdquo; to &ldquo;minor&rdquo; then in logic we would have to change the terms in the different laws in which the word &ldquo;infant&rdquo; is used.  I think the practice will continue to be a movement from the use of the term &ldquo;infant&rdquo; to the use of the term &ldquo;minor&rdquo;.  The Law Reform Commission report to which I referred, in paragraph 7, page 58, refers to the draft legislation. It reads: &ldquo;Section 5 of the Bill proposes that a person under the new age of majority may be described as a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; instead of as an &ldquo;infant&rdquo;.  The section is an enabling one so that it will still be correct to refer to persons under 18 years of age as infants, The Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 will, of course, still be the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  I am doing it for the reason outlined and I am following the advice of the Law Reform Commission report and the particular section of their draft Bill.</P>

      <P>This is not a very important matter.  I rounded up a Second Stage speech and I do not disagree with the Minister's reply.  It seems to me that in a sense one year would be the same date and the same time a year hence. Therefore, if we start on a particular date and count that day again a second time we reach 366 days instead of 365 days.  I <Col N="137" /> agree with the Minister that it may be necessary to do it from the point of view of social welfare legislation.  Take for instance the case of a driving licence.  If I take out a driving licence today it will expire on 5 February 1986.  The year does not include that date again.  The point I am making is that if we count the year in that way, say, as it is calculated for a driving licence, it ends on the day previous to the day the licence is taken out.</P>

      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): What I am trying to get at is if your birthday is next Saturday, the common law provision would suggest that you reach the full age, say, 21 years not on Saturday morning but on Thursday night-Friday morning, the first moment of Friday morning.  It is not a question of not counting the day twice, it is a question of not counting the day at all.  Instead of actually computing one's age from the anniversary of one's birth, one would do it from the first moment of the day previously.  That is the common law position.  This brings it into line with common sense.  You are 25 years of age and I suppose accurately on the actual moment of the anniversary on which you were born, but certainly the first moment of that day, is the appropriate birthday rather than the first moment of the previous day.  It is not simply changing for the sake of academic neatness or legislative precision.  There is a major piece of legislation, the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 which has already done this and we are bringing this into line with it for the age of majority.</P>

We are aware of how the age in calculated for voting purposes and the register of electors.  Section 5 (6) (b) of the Electoral Act, 1963 provides that the Minister for the Environment may specify in the regulations the date on which a person must be 18 years in order to be registered as a voter.  The relevant regulations specify 15 April as the appropriate date.  The position of a person who would reach 18 years of age under the common law rule on 14 April does not appear to have arisen for consideration.  It is to make sure that it is 14 and not 13.  I would not like a constitutional action to be taken on the validity of an election on the basis of leaving it out rather than putting it in.</P>

      <P>Section 6 (b) provides for the addition of a new subsection to section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  The new subsection will be subsection (5).  It reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any reference to an infant in this section (except in paragraph (a)) of subsection (2) shall include a reference to a child who has attained the age of 18 years and is suffering from mental <Col N="139" /> or physical disability to such an extent that it is not reasonably possible for him to maintain himself fully.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell the House whether there is any procedure laid down in the Guardianship of Infants Act for determining whether a person is suffering from mental or physical disability to such an extent that it is not reasonably possible for him to maintain himself fully or could this become a matter of dispute which, in every case, might have to be determined by the courts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): There is no criterion laid down for mental incapacity and it is a matter for adjudication by a court, but paragraph (b) to which Senator Mullooly refers provides for the addition of a new subsection (5) to section 11 of the 1964 Act.  The new subsection will allow a parent to apply to the court for an order directing the other parent to pay maintenance for the child even though the child has reached majority, now 18 years, in a case where a child is mentally or physically disabled so that it is not possible for him to maintain himself fully.  The new subsection will allow such an order to be made up to any age.  This is already the position under the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  The power to make maintenance orders generally for children up to 21 years of age is dealt with as a separate matter in section 2 (4) which exempts references to 21 years of age in the relevant legislation from the effect of the change in the age of majority.  There is no criterion, the court adjudicates but it is maintaining a provision which applies to incapacitated children above the age of majority and allows a court to issue mainteneance orders.</P>

On Second Stage the Minister stated that 200,000 young people will be immediately affected by the legislation and another 60,000 or 70,000 will reach the age of majority during 1985.  In view of the fears expressed by Senators on Second Stage is the Minister satisfied that there is sufficient time between now and 1 March to bring this legislation to the attention of the young people who will be affected by it and to put them on their guard because of its possible implications for them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I am satisfied. The working paper came out in 1977 and the final report came out in 1983.  There has been intermittent publicity about the age of majority since about 1976.  When the Bill was first published it was met with considerable goodwill and received quite an amount of publicity.  It also achieved publicity in the Dáil and here in the Seanad.  Young people are aware that there is a change pending even though they may not be aware that it is coming as soon as 1 March.  Both here and in the other House a suggestion was made that an explanatory leaflet should be drawn up by my Department which would be available.  I am having that idea examined.  It depends on two factors. First there is the question of cost.  If we were to try to get a leaflet such as this into the hands of everybody affected we are talking about 250,000 pieces of literature, which might be fairly costly. Secondly, there is the appropriate manner in which to supply the information to the people who are actually involved. I will have the situation examined to see if there is some method, either by explanatory leaflet or by some form of advertising, so that the 250,000 young people or so who will be immediately affected from 1 March and during 1985 will have it brought to their attention that these new rights have been conferred on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Paragraph 6 refers to it.  I find the Schedule extraordinarily complicated.  I will read the note I have.  Paragraph 6 proposes that in the case of a right of action that accrues before the commencement of the proposed legislation the action may be brought at any time before the expiration of the relevant number of years specified in section 49 of the Statute of Limitations, 1975 from the date when the infant reaches 21.  Section 48 of the statute of 1957 provides that a person is under a disability while he is, <i>inter alia</i>, under 21 and section 49 of the statute provides for the extension of a particular limitation period, applicable in the case of a disability.  In the case of a right of action accruing after the commencement date a young person will cease to be under a disability on reaching 18 or getting married. That clarifies the situation.  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; if it is before 1 March 1985 and &ldquo;no&rdquo; if it is after that date.</P>

At present he would have a period of three years from the date he becomes 21 in which to sue.  When the age of majority is reduced to 18 he will become an adult on 1 March 1985 and unless this saving provision were inserted he would be able to sue only within three years of that date.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not put down an amendment on Report Stage for two reasons.  One is that I did not have time, the Report Stage being taken immediately; second, such an amendment would require a seconder, and I doubt if I could have found one.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the problem disclosed in section 2 (4) (viii).  I made representations on two lines.  The main one is that the maintenance of one adult by another adult was not a unique concept or a concept already in existence in Irish law, and I specifically referred to the question of the mutual responsibility of spouses to maintain one another.</P>
      <P>That arises as a result of a contract which exists between husband and wife under which one or other may put himself or herself at a financial disadvantage in pursuance of their duties under that contract. As a result, they are entitled to be financially maintained as a result of the disadvantages and disabilities under which they have placed themselves over a period.  That is the reason that there is a duty of maintenance on one spouse or another.  I can enter into a contract to maintain another adult, and that contract will be perfectly enforceable in law.  It is not impossible to enter into a contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we are not talking about somebody entering into that contract: we are talking about a situation under section 2 (4) (viii) of the parent, who is an adult, and the child, who is also an adult, being in a unique relationship.  The parent has no guardianship over the child because when the child reaches the age of majority that guardianship ceases.  The parent has no right to tell the child what to do with its life.  The child is in every sense a free agent, but the child has the right to call on the parent to maintain him even during the period between 18 and 21 years of age, provided he is in full time education.  I do not think that would survive any kind of a real challenge.  If it arose it would disclose a particularly unhappy relationship between children <Col N="145" /> and parents.  These situations seem to have a habit of happening, and we have a duty to ensure that legislation which we pass will be examined and its implications fully thrashed out.</P>
    <P>What the Minister said previously is quite true.  It is possible that any legislation which we pass will be found to be in conflict with the Constitution, but that does not release us from the obligation to do the best we can to ensure that what we pass is in conformity with the Constitution.  The reason that it might not conform with the Constitution is that we are not the arbiters of the way the Constitution should be interpreted.  I cannot see any principle which is compatible with the free and independent status of citizens under the Constitution, imposing on one adult, in no special circumstances, the responsibility to maintain another adult.  I do not see any way in which that could come about.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the possibility that the child could make application in these circumstances.  The Minister has been advised that that right was limited to a situation where the husband and wife had been separated and there was a situation where the court recognised somebody in a position of guardianship, because of desertion or some other matter like that. It appears that there are possibilities for the child to make an application independent of that.  If one of the parents refused to join as plaintiff in a case where a child is looking for maintenance between the ages 18 and 21 years, I doubt that the court would allow that situation merely because of refusal of the wife.  If the husband was the person with the money and the maintenance order was being sought against the husband and if the wife refused to act on behalf of her adult child, I doubt that the court would refuse to consider the adult child in that regard. The court would hear and determine the merits of whether that child should be supported in the intervening period between 18 and 21.  That appears to be imposing a considerable additional duty on the parent and a considerable right on children which goes far beyond what is intended by those who framed this law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): On the constitutional point raised by Senator O'Leary, the precedent I quoted was that a spouse at present is obligated under the law to maintain the other spouse. There is a precedent for the situation of one adult being obliged under law to maintain another adult.  Up to now that has not been challenged.  When people marry they do not contract to maintain each other &mdash; that is not part of the contract. The obligation to maintain a spouse is imposed by law, but it is not part of the initial contract of marriage.  There is a very strong precedent there and I am urging that the precedent is applicable when we are talking about a young adult over 18 years and under 21 years to whom a maintenance order applies.  That is enforceable by law.</P>
      <P>On the second question as to whether a child can apply to the courts for maintenance, separate from parents or guardians, I will quote from Family Law in the Republic of Ireland, second edition, by Alan Joseph Shatter.  There is reference to the financial provision for children of spouses and he goes through the background and refers to the situation in common law, poor law and alimony and comes to the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964.  It states:</P>
      <P>Finally with the coming into force of the 1964 Act a parent was able to apply to the Circuit Court or High Court for a maintenance order to be made in his favour requiring the other parent to provide support for a child in the applicant's custody.</P>
      <P>He goes into detail on page 283 and in the last paragraph of the page there is a section which is headed, &ldquo;Who may Apply&rdquo;.  I quote from that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great majority of applications for maintenance for the support of dependent children are made by a spouse when seeking maintenance for her own support.  However, the Act also permits a third party to seek a maintenance order for the benefit of dependent children in certain circumstances <Col N="147" /> where a spouse is (a), dead, (b), has deserted or has been deserted by the other spouse or (c), is living separately and apart from the other spouse and there are dependent children of the family who are not fully maintained by either spouse.  Then the court may order a spouse to make a periodic payment of maintenance for the support of each dependent child to the person applying for the order.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state that a provision could be used, for example, by a grandmother or an aunt to force a grandson or nephew to support a child of his in either of their care.  A social worker could also bring proceedings under this section to force a parent to maintain his or her child.  An interesting question that arises is whether a child himself could bring proceedings against the parent to obtain support in the absence of a third party or other parent seeking maintenance on his behalf.  He says it is arguable that this could be so, but no such proceedings could be brought against parents still living together, but there is no provision in the Bill for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of Deputy Connaughton, the Minister of State.  This is because of the death of his mother.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to put on record the position with regard to the current review of the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas.  I would like to remind the House that this is the third review of the boundaries undertaken in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The review arose out of local dissatisfaction at the outcome of the second review which the EC authorities finally agreed in January 1981.  This third review, however, differs from the two previous reviews in that for the original designations and the two previous reviews the DED, the district electoral division, has been the basic unit in designating areas in Ireland under the Council directive on mountain and hill farming and farming in certain less favoured areas.  This directive, designed for extensive and homogeneous areas suffering from permanent natural handicap, previously had been interpreted so far as Ireland is concerned to refer to an area covered by an appreciable number of DEDs.  This had effectively ruled out the inclusion of smaller pockets of land below the level of DED and gave rise to much dissatisfaction at local level.  The problem was clearly exacerbated by the irregularity of DED boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large volume of representations was received from over 60 different areas <Col N="149" /> throughout the country.  These came through county committees of agriculture from farming organisations at national and local level, from <i>ad hoc</i> groups, from elected representatives and from individual farmers.</P>
    <P>These interests criticised the implementation of the directive in Ireland, and claimed that certain areas were treated inequitably in not having been designated, while being of the same land quality as areas that already are designated. The representations and submissions received were concerned with the following issues:</P>
    <P>Designation of new areas in the eastern region;</P>
    <P>Reclassification of existing mountain sheep grazing land;</P>
    <P>Designation of additional areas within the western region as More Severely Handicapped.</P>
    <P>The review carried out has been by far and away the most detailed examination ever undertaken here.  Substantial resources from my Department have been involved in examining the situation in more than 600 district electoral divisions comprising a total number of town-lands in excess of 10,000 and covering close to 4 million acres in every county in the country, apart from the four northwesterly counties which are already designated for the full benefits available under the scheme.  In addition we have examined in detail a large volume of representations that I referred to above.</P>
    <P>Following its examination of the results of the review, the Government made a comprehensive submission to the EC Commission on 2 August 1984 with a view to having the existing Disadvantaged Areas in Ireland extended and in certain cases reclassified.  This submission has been followed up by a series of meetings with the Commission to clarify certain aspects of Ireland's application and to supply the material needed by the Commission to enable it to prepare a proposal for presentation to the Council of Ministers.  This is the normal procedure <Col N="150" /> followed in applications of this nature.  The urgency of the matter has been stressed and the Commission has been pressed to come forward with a proposal as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have set this procedure out at some length because I do not want people to have the impression that extending the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas is only a matter of sending in a list to the Commission and that this is the end of the story.  Let me remind you that the previous review was begun after the change of Government in 1977 when the new Government decided that a review was necessary.  That review was not finally approved in Brussels until January 1981.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that recent allegations concerning Ireland's submission on the disadvantaged areas are completely misleading and without foundation.  They are unhelpful, and in fact, are damaging to Ireland's case.  It has been alleged that our submission is inadequate and has been returned by the Commission due to lack of information.  This is simply not true.  The content of the present submission reflects what is the most comprehensive review of the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas ever undertaken in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Government's submission relating to area reclassification require the approval of the Commission, while the addition of new disadvantaged areas necessitates a decision by the Council of Ministers.  At this stage I do not propose to disclose information in relation to particular areas since this could prejudice the final outcome.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of extending the status of mountain areas to certain disadvantaged areas in the west of Ireland under EC Directive 75/268 this has been the subject of separate and specific representations to the EC Commission.  I am continuing to press the issue, and it has been raised separately in the context of discussions which are taking place in Brussels at present on the Commission's new proposals on agricultural structures.</P>
    <P>I would now like to say a few words on <Col N="151" /> the programme for western development, or the western package as it is most commonly known.  This is a particularly suitable time to have a discussion on the package since the first review of the programme is due to take place this year in consultation with the EC Commission. We can, therefore, be greatful to the joint committee not alone for giving us the benefit of their own deliberations, but also for providing an opportunity to have the subject aired more widely in the House.  This year's review is very important, since it will most likely be the only chance we will have to make worth while changes in the programme, which is due to run for ten years from 1981.</P>
    <P>It is right, of course, to look at the individual elements of the package, at land improvement, roads, afforestation etc. and see how they are progressing, but I think it is important to bear in mind that each measure contained in the package has the same objective, that is the stimulation of agricultural development in the west of Ireland.  No one expects that every farmer in the region will avail of every measure in the package, but with each individual making full use of those elements which are best suited to his situation, farmers as a body will benefit and the agricultural economy of the west will be improved.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that the package was an ambitious piece of legislation.  It envisaged taking the whole western region, tackling its infrastructual problems, improving the land, assisting marketing and processing projects, providing better facilities for agricultural training, aiding on-farm investment and giving the farmers an opportunity for an alternative land use by aiding the afforestation of marginal land.  By any standards that is an ambitious programme, and its success or failure can only be judged in the long term.  Taken in conjunction with the western drainage scheme, under which the uptake exceeded all expectations, the package can confer enormous benefits on the west in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As I have said, at this stage we cannot <Col N="152" /> judge the success or failure of the package, but I think we can reach some conclusions as to the targets we set ourselves in the programme.  I am talking now, of course, about the agricultural elements of the package.  By and large, progress under the other elements &mdash; electricity, roads and water &mdash; is well up to expectations. Possibly in our enthusiasm for the measure we may have set our sights a little too high on some aspects.</P>
    <P>For instance, over the ten years the intention was to divide and improve some 60,000 hectares of commonage, but it is now clear that this target will have to be revised downwards.  Similarly we were a bit optimistic about the area of hill and mountain pasture which would be improved.  On the other hand, the entire 20,000 hectares of permitted intensive reclamation in the lowlands will be taken up by the middle of 1985.  This is the situation which will have to be looked at in the course of this year's review.</P>
    <P>The hardest look of all, however, will have to be taken at the on-farm investment element.  This was to be the heart of the entire package, the drawing together, as it were, of the benefits of all the other elements.  Uptake has been, to say the least, disappointing, with only about 1,000 participants to date.  In my view, this is the element of the Western Package which most needs examination and debate because, unlike the other sectors, it is not just a question of the target not being reached but rather a lack of interest by western farmers in general in the whole concept of the orientation of production to beef and sheep.</P>
    <P>There are those who say that the conditions of the scheme are too stringent, thus militating against its success.  The fact is, however, that the scheme was made as flexible as possible within the terms of the EC regulation.  Any move, say, to extend the scheme to part-time farmers would be bound to meet with the stiffest opposition from the Community, whose overall policy is to aid only those farmers for whom farming is their principal occupation. In my own view, the factor most militating against the success of this part <Col N="153" /> of the programme is the traditional farming pattern in the west.</P>
    <P>The same situation obtains in regard to private forestry, I suggest.  It is not alone the Irish farmer but Irish people in general who have not shown great interest in the matter up to now.  The committee have highlighted the potential of afforestation and have expressed their support for a number of proposed pilot projects. My understanding is that the idea of projects such as these was discussed at a recent seminar on private forestry organised by the Forest and Wildlife Service and that the service is very receptive to proposals of this nature and prepared to assist to the fullest possible extent when positive plans are drawn up.</P>
    <P>One other point I would like to advert to in the committee's report is their reference to the ratio of Department of Agriculture offices in the west to the number of farm holdings.  I can assure the House that the number of offices and the number of officials operating from them is considered to be adequate to provide the service necessary to western farmers and to ensure the promotion of the Western Package to the maximum extent.</P>
    <P>As regards agricultural education, the provisions in the package for increased facilities was intended to redress the imbalance in this regard, as far as the west was concerned.  Already, 11 of the envisaged 22 training centres have been opened, and it must not be forgotten that these centres also provide modern accommodation from which the ACOT advisory service can operate in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the recommendation in Report No. 12 of the joint committee regarding the raising of the off-farm income limit for headage purposes has already been implemented.  When announcing the arrangements for this year's sheep schemes on 18 December, I also announced that the off-farm income restriction was being raised from £3,500 to £6,400.  The new limit is, in fact, the western comparable income criterion used in the Farm Modernisation Scheme, and its introduction in effect means that farmers and their spouses can have a <Col N="154" /> combined off-farm income of up to £6,400 in the 1984-85 income tax year and still be eligible for headage grants under the 1985 disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>Many farmers who supplement their farm income with seasonal earnings from forestry or county council work, etc, and who were excluded from participation under the £3,500 limit rule will now be brought back into the disadvantaged areas scheme.  On the other hand professional people and businessmen with farms or farmers with spouses working full time as teachers or nurses will continue to be excluded because of the level at which the new income limit has been set.</P>
    <P>Much stress has been laid in the context of lifting restrictions, on the fact that the EC recoup one half of headage grants, but I would like to disabuse commentators of the idea that this confers an unlimited licence on the Government to grant concessions.  Indeed I feel that it is appropriate to point out that the 50 per cent recoupment by the EC of headage payments is made in arrear in the year after the expenditure is incurred by a member state.  Extra expenditure arising from an increase in rates or in participants must, therefore, be borne in full by our Exchequer in the first year, and this extra cost implied increased national taxation or borrowings in the short term.</P>
    <P>To pay for the concession that has been granted and still keep within the Vote allocation for 1985, it has been necessary to make a small reduction of a flat £1 per head in the sheep headage grants for 1985.  While the decision to increase the off-farm income limit has been generally welcomed by the farming organisations, there has been some criticism of the reduction in sheep headage rates.  This aspect has been likened to &ldquo;robbing Peter to pay Paul&rdquo;, but given that the option to incur extra Exchequer expenditure was excluded in view of the taxation implications, the only choice open to us was to cut either the sheep or cattle headage rates.</P>
    <P>We opted for a small cut in sheep rates because the payments per livestock unit for sheep were almost double the cattle <Col N="155" /> equivalent.  In 1985 flockowners with 200 ewes in the disadvantaged areas will receive £1,500 in sheep headage grants whereas herdowners with 30 livestock units, equivalent to 200 ewes, will receive no more than £872 in cattle grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that because this is not a normal motion being put forward by an individual party Senator Higgins and I have agreed, if the House agrees, to share the time proposed between us.  Secondly, I would like to extend my sympathy and the sympathy of the House to the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Connaughton, on the death of his mother.  Go ndéanadh Dia trócaire ar a hanam.</P>
      <P>The EC Committee on Secondary Legislation were anxious for some time to have a very considered look at how the directives relating to the disadvantaged areas scheme were operating.  In the context of the present time when there is a unique opportunity available to the Government as we go into the price negotiations, and with so many limitations on the capacity of individual farmers to extend their enterprises in beef, cereals and in dairying, the question of trying to do something more for the disadvantaged areas throughout the country became all the more acute.</P>
      <P>The morale of the small farming community in poor mountainous and marginal land is very low.  If one is to consider the impact of the super levy on milk production on small milk producers one will immediately understand where they cannot expand that enterprise.  When it is their main enterprise, as it is on a very considerable number of these farms, some additional help, some other structural way, will have to be found to try to maintain the farming population in those regions, because there is not any other alternative employment available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should, therefore, in consideration of the report, assist the Government in taking whatever initiative they can in persuading the European Commission to not only extend the disadvantaged areas but <Col N="156" /> to reclassify other areas as mountain regions.  I will deal with that in more detail later.  In the context of the Minister's statement we greatfully acknowledge his belated conversion on the basis of off-farm income.  We have been arguing here and in the other House that the imposition, which the Government imposed shortly after coming back into power, in relation to the off-farm income, was very unfair.</P>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas scheme and the headage payments in particular are accorded only to areas that meet very strict criteria in depopulation, poor soil and permanent handicapped features. Under that pressure many farmers or their spouses have had to seek employment off the land to try to supplement their income.  We could give many examples where major schemes of investment were undertaken on these farms such as in the provision of in-winter facilities, improvement of the land, borrowing for additional stock which the agencies representing the Department of Agriculture, the ACOT advisers over the past ten or 12 years advised these farmers to get involved in and provide in-winter facilities, improve their land, fertilise it more, increase stocking rates and so on.  In an effort to meet the commitments, which were greatly increased by rising interest rates in the late seventies and into the eighties, they tried to find alternative employment on a short-time basis and then found themselves in the position where they disqualified themselves as a result of a Government decision.</P>
    <P>We welcome the fact that the Government have responded to the representations from the farming organisations and from ourselves in changing this clause. However it has a bite to it, as the Minister referred to.  It is a bit like &ldquo;robbing Peter to pay Paul&rdquo;.  It is even a little more serious than that, because while there is scope for an increase in the sheep population, while it is an enterprise which has been gathering momentum, having had a very serious fall back in the late seventies &mdash; there seems to be still scope for expansion in that enterprise &mdash; nevertheless it is an enterprise which is confined to a <Col N="157" /> great number of farmers who have very difficult terrains to manage.  I doubt very much if the decision to reduce the payments to this category of farmers is a very fair one.  I am not saying that the financial position in which the Government find themselves is not difficult and that it is not extremely difficult to provide an equitable system which will be fair to everybody but I feel that selecting a group of farmers managing in the main difficult terrain to subsidise the change in the off-farm income clause is very unfair.</P>
    <P>To move on to the question of reclassification our committee were fortunate to have a very comprehensive report presented to us by the Connacht farmers and Donegal Co-Op on the question of the reclassification of the severely handicapped areas in Ireland to mountain status.  They did, following very extensive research which they carried out on this proposal, make comparisons with the Cantal region in France.</P>
    <P>I want to take an issue here briefly, the Minister's statement in relation to the pressure he finds himself under from groups who suggest that you can do what you like with this scheme because you are getting 50 per cent of the money from Europe.  I do not think the Minister really understands what the people involved here are trying to say.  I do not think that there are unlimited resources.  It is that, for some reason, in our approach in Brussels we are prepared to accept what many other regions have not accepted.  Here we have a prime example of where the average number of cows per holding in the Cantal region is almost one and a half times that given for County Mayo, where the cost of inputs is dearer there, where the seasonality of milk supply, which is so low in the winter time here and very high in summer, almost evens out in that region giving a consistent income for the whole year and where rationalisation and management of processing industries is so much easier.  Almost on every front they have been able to demonstrate that the Cantal region has accorded to it mountain status which has not been possible for many of the areas which are severely handicapped in Ireland.  One of <Col N="158" /> the things the Government have got to try to do something about is the reclassification of these particular areas.</P>
    <P>That becomes all the more urgent in the context of living in the quota system in agriculture.  It is all very fine for somebody who has 100 cows.  He may have a 4.6 per cent increase.  Perhaps we should be talking about a different percentage, but I am not prepared to admit at this stage that the officials in the Department of Agriculture, having been involved, to some degree, in the earlier cock-up, will not find a way to win that battle, so I am staying with 4.6 per cent.  If you can increase by 4.6 per cent on a farm output basis and if you are milking the average cow numbers in the disadvantaged areas, which in the Slieve Felim area of Tipperary is 14 and varies somewhat throughout the west, a 4.6 per cent increase is not worth a damn to a farmer who is developing his farm by borrowings and hoping to maintain some decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the context of the new position relating to the restrictions on output, which will not have the same detrimental affect on larger farming enterprises but is catastrophic in the small farm situation with difficult terrain, lack of facilities and without the capital to get the best out of their enterprise this will throw more people onto the labour market, which is already unable to cope with the many thousands who are coming on stream.  The reclassification of that area removes the obligation on farmers to pay the co-responsibility levy, and perhaps in time, when the Commission can be persuaded, may also be a consideration in the context of the super levy situation.</P>
    <P>The extension of the disadvantaged areas is a very hot potato.  The Minister said that he has been wrongfully criticised, that this criticism has harmed him and the fact that this matter was referred back to his Department last year for additional detail has in some way damaged the situation.  If that were the position, nearly every politician should retire immediately, because politicians from every party at different times have tried to highlight problems in order to heighten <Col N="159" /> interest, both at home and abroad.  I would not say, as one who at one time, for a very brief period, tried to represent this country in Brussels, that any positive representation in Ireland highlighting the need to make changes could be viewed as a disadvantage.  If a civil servant is unable to take that kind of pressure, then I fear for him or her in the years ahead, because these pressures will not decrease. The highlighting, representation and the approach to this matter is no disadvantage to the Government.</P>
    <P>It has to be admitted that this report is a very comprehensive review.  It has covered a very wide ambit.  The change from district electoral divisions to town-lands is a welcome step, because in the previous successes in 1974 and in 1981 when the district electoral division was used farmers with reasonably good land found themselves in the disadvantaged areas and small farmers with poor land adjoining these areas found themselves outside the disadvantaged areas.  They obviously had a very serious grievance. The question of operating on a townland basis, while it is not foolproof, is an improvement that could involve very comprehensive investigation, and very detailed examination.  I can only hope, not being privy to what has been decided, that a very good job has been done and will have the support of all parties in Ireland and in Brussels in furthering the cause for the extension of these areas.  If we have any reasonable success there it will raise the morale of many of our farmers, particularly those in the areas referred to.</P>
    <P>We referred in the report, in the context of the western package in particular, to the slow take up on private afforestation. That package, which was a major boost to the western area, has in a number of ways been quite a success.  I do not think that we would want to try to indicate that everything in it has been bad.  Very good improvements have been made.</P>
    <P>In the private afforestation area we have to get over the problem, which seems to be almost peculiar to Ireland by <Col N="160" /> comparison with most European countries of the very small amount of private afforestation.  I do not have the figures, but I know that in many of the European countries private afforestation is almost equal to the schemes embarked on by the Government.  From surveys carried out recently it would appear that the total cost in gross terms to the country for private afforestation is considerably less. Therefore, from every point of view, we must try to encourage farmers.</P>
    <P>I know it is difficult to invest in something that will take perhaps 30 years to mature.  Every stimulus must be given. All of us in public life, the Department of Agriculture and ACOT need to encourage this area much more.  How we will manage these resources ultimately, the changes that will have to be made and the commercial ethos that has got to be brought into the management of our timber resources, will be much easier if there is an advance in the private area which cuts down the public sector costs and also gets the balance right.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he was disappointed about the commonage development. Perhaps I am living in cuckoo land, but I have a strange recollection that the Government abolished the Land Commission, introduced a potential land tax and asked the people in the Land Commission that they should be responsible for providing the base for the introduction of the land tax.  It is difficult to be in two places at one time.  If you are dividing a commonage, with all the difficulties in getting farmers to agree on the problems in relation to fencing, roadways, divisions and the problems relating to disease eradication you are expecting these men not only to be in two places at one time but to be magicians.  We do not have the men on the ground to do that any more.  They are doing a different job.  That is probably the reason that is happening.  I see the Minister shaking his head, but I will await his reply and I will take some convincing on it on the basis of what I see happening in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>We are anxious in the main to support the Government on this question of extending the disadvantaged areas <Col N="161" /> scheme, of the reclassification of the severely handicapped to mountain status, and will be glad over the next few months to highlight everywhere we can the domestic pressure that is on us from small and poor farming territory for improvement of these existing schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I want to thank Senator Smith for agreeing to allocate the balance of his time to me and also the Chair for agreeing to the arrangement.  I, like Senator Smith, welcome the report for many reasons, particularly for its sense of timing.  Decisions which are vital for agricultural development at all levels are in the process of formulation by the European Commission at this very moment.  The consequences of these restructuring decisions will be far-reaching.  I would go so far as to say that within the context of these deliberations lies the fate of thousands of small farmers on our western seaboard. It is important, therefore, that this House add its voice, as Senator Smith has said, in support of the twin case now being made by the Minister for Agriculture. Firstly, there is the case for reclassification of certain areas of the west now designated by the EC as severely handicapped, areas meriting similar aids to those classified as mountain areas with the Community.  Secondly, &mdash; this is the area that we have also a joint interest in &mdash; that there be quite a considerable extension of the boundaries of the areas now classified as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I want to congratulate Deputy Joe Walsh and his agricultural committee for producing a concise but nonetheless comprehensive critical appraisal of the various EC directives under which various disadvantaged areas schemes have operated here.  I want particularly to commend the document for substantially reinforcing the case for reclassification on the one hand and extension of the disadvantaged areas on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EC Directive 268/75 is a lifeline for thousands of small farmers in this country. To many it offers the best hope of survival at the present level.  To others it is the preservation of their very role in <Col N="162" /> Irish working society.  The people whom this directive defends have as much right to the protective mechanisms enshrined in the directive as those farmers who on size element alone can be categorised as commercial.  It is appropriate also that the submission for reclassification on the one hand and for the extension of the disadvantaged areas boundaries on the other hand should be made jointly and should be kept side by side right throughout the negotiations.  It is quite obvious that if one is conceded then cross-country synchronisation will have to take place in relation to the other.</P>
    <P>At present Directive 268 classifies the less favoured areas of the EC into two main categories, those defined as mountain areas under Article 33 from which Ireland is totally excluded, and those defined under Article 34 as hill or lowland areas which are better known as disadvantaged areas and to which this document directly relates.  The latter areas merit their status because of the danger of depopulation and the presence of land of limited potential from which economic results are appreciably below average.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of grant aid the disadvantaged areas are further subdivided. Counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo and Mayo together with parts of Monaghan, Cavan, Longford, Roscommon, West Galway and South Galway, most of Clare, Kerry, West Cork and small areas of West Limerick and Tipperary are called severely handicapped.  The joint committee's report does a very thorough assessment of the merits and success of the various schemes relevant to both the severely handicapped and the disadvantaged areas.  There is no doubt but that the system of headage payments is the most important single aid in augmenting farmers' incomes in these areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment of the Minister to two facets of the scheme. First, there is the very vexed question of off-farm income, referred to already by Senator Smith, of a derisory £3,500 being the threshold above which payment can be made.  I welcome sincerely the pre-Christmas commitment by the Minister to raising the eligibility limit to £6,400. <Col N="163" /> However, I am totally against the idea of penalising part-time farmers if their off-farm incomes are above a certain level. When will people in power in this country and in Europe realise once and for all that there are thousands and thousands of part-time farmers in the west, that these people are part and parcel of the social and economic fabric of rural Ireland, that they work very hard in their off-farm jobs and long hours on the farm before and after their off-farm jobs in order to try to make ends meet?  These people do their jobs both on and off the farm efficiently.  They do not keep down off-farm jobs simply for greed but because the combination of a job with the running of a small farm is an economic must for thousands of families in the part of Ireland that I come from.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the increase in the eligibility limit I am afraid that, unfortunately, by the time the £6,400 threshold actually comes into operation the probability is that the wages of a county council labourer will have actually outstripped that figure, thereby debarring that person once again.  I urge the Minister to index-link the limit on an annual basis so that the off-farm entitlement will keep pace with the prevailing and relevant economic conditions of the day.  I want to again record my appreciation and indeed that of the people of the west in general to the commitment of the national plan to increase headage payments from £32 to £70 per beef cow.  It represents the greatest single income boost that western farmers will have received.</P>
    <P>We are now almost at the half way mark in the programme for western development known as the western package implemented under Council Directive No. 1820/80.  This ten year programme which was introduced in June 1980 has certainly done a lot of good.  Its purpose is the stimulation of agricultural development in the less favoured areas of the west.  The scheme has been thoroughly appraised by the Minister of State and has been thoroughly analysed in the joint committee's report.  I know from personal contact with people that <Col N="164" /> many people have benefited from the 80 per cent grant aid scheme for the provision of electricity on farms for the installation of three phased supply etc.</P>
    <P>Thousands of people in rural Ireland have benefited from a similar level of grant aid for private group water schemes.  I fully acknowledge that the grants of up to £600 for domestic supply and £400 for farm supply are generous and that they have enabled a reliable piped water supply scheme to become a reality for the vast majority.  However, I submit that there is a minority of somewhere between 10 and possibly 20 per cent who still have not water on tap and will never have such, not because they have refused to participate but because of the remoteness of their dwellings.  This makes the level of personal contribution simply too prohibitive for them.  I can cite dozens of examples of applicants who would have to pay up to £1,500 on top of the normal grants.  I can straight away recall two households with mentally handicapped adults which will never have running water unless the grant levels for extremely disadvantaged areas are dramatically increased.</P>
    <P>I would certainly say that the works carried out under the local improvements scheme have benefited rural areas enormously.  Accessibility to farm houses has been greatly facilitated.  Small drainage schemes benefiting hundreds of farmers, not included in the Office of Public Works scheme, have been carried out.  In view of the fact that the FEOGA scheme reimburses the Exchequer by 50 per cent, as has been mentioned by the Minister of State, I would urge that the Government make maximum use of it in view of the limited life-span of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The report records its satisfaction at the success of the scheme for commonage division.  There are some reservations in relation to follow-up, and I would agree with those.  There is also ample evidence that mountain and hill-land pasture improvement work is below target.  One of the most disappointing aspects of the package is the orientation of agricultural production.  One of the main reasons for <Col N="165" /> its failure is the restriction on investment in dairying; also the obligation to keep accounts and the fact that the calf-to-beef scheme is applicable only where there is borrowing.  The chances of success would be greatly enhanced if there was a direct payment and also if a calf-to-store scheme was introduced which undoubtedly would be more suited to conditions prevailing in the west.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned, the level of uptake in afforestation has been disappointing. Grants of 85 per cent for farmers and 75 per cent for others are certainly by any standards attractive. One must conclude, therefore, that there is a need for a massive educational and publicity drive in order to sell the idea once and for all, particularly in areas which are regarded as marginal for agricultural production.  These can be among the most productive for tree growth in western Europe.</P>
    <P>The prospect is enhanced by the conclusion that there is likely to be an ongoing deficiency of timber within the EC. We have even the potential to develop a substantial export market to other EC countries with the consequential beneficial effects on our balance of payments. The ICOS idea of two pilot projects mentioned in the plan &mdash; one for the Leitrim-East Sligo-Donegal area and the other for County Clare &mdash; is an excellent idea which, if implemented, should certainly help to eliminate the quite understandable prejudices which people have towards committing their land and their resources to a project which will not see fruition within an average lifetime.</P>
    <P>The western package has been making £5.2 million available each year since 1980 under the FEOGA scheme for improving facilities for marketing and the processing of agricultural products.  The bulk of this money has gone to the meat industry.  The grant level applies at 50 per cent as against 25 per cent elsewhere. Unfortunately, the scheme ends this year.  I want to be critical here, because I venture to suggest that only a fraction of this money has been spent in actual processing.  Meat factories seem, by and large, to concentrate on the preparation <Col N="166" /> for export of carcase beef and lamb as against the actual development of the processing of the meat itself.  While a substantial number of jobs have been created in meat plants, which are certainly welcome, they are minimal in comparison to the potential to be derived from jointing, vacuum package, canning and other areas of processing.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, this element of the package expires this year with a vast processing potential largely unrealised.  I would urge that every effort should be made to obtain a further extension of the scheme but with a commitment to the tightening of the application of the criteria in order to maximise job creation.</P>
    <P>One of the outstanding successes of our EC participation has been the operation of the western drainage scheme under Directive 78/628.  I re-echo the joint committee's satisfaction at the bringing into agricultural production of 150,000 hectares of land which was waterlogged, useless and would be there for posterity.  Marvellous work has been done under this scheme.  I welcome the commitment by the Minister to, at last, deal with the 2,000 cases which are now on file and which have not been dealt with.</P>
    <P>One of the ongoing arguments about our participation in the European Community has been, undoubtedly, that large sections of Ireland have been wrongly classified.  Two previous boundary examinations took place and no change was effected.  As has been stated by the Minister of State, in June 1981, the Government announced a third review.  It is pretty comprehensive.  Six hundred district electoral areas had been thoroughly examined.  On 2 August 1984 the Government made a comprehensive submission to the EC with a view to having two objectives met, first, the existing disadvantaged areas extended and, secondly, certain disadvantaged areas reclassified, the former requiring the consent of the Council of Ministers and the latter the consent of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission sought further data, and this has been forwarded and is now under consideration.  There is little doubt <Col N="167" /> that there is every justification for extending the disadvantaged area boundaries. There are large tracts of unclassified land.  Some of these tracts are contiguous to very good land and should have been classified as disadvantaged areas initially but because they embraced the handicaps and disadvantages which apply to western areas and are shown as green in the back of the report, for some reason or other these have been left out.</P>
    <P>I want to underline my total commitment to this case.  I also want to emphasise that as somebody representing the area classified as severely handicapped &mdash; I think it is shown in brown on the back of the report &mdash; I would be dismayed and disappointed if our negotiators succeed in having the boundaries extended and if they fail to convince the people of Brussels of the justification of reclassifying severely handicapped areas of the west for special aid purposes.  I believe that both cases are inexplicably bound together.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I referred to article 3.3 of Directive 268 which conferred mountain areas status with all its consequent benefits on substantial areas of our EC allied countries.  The Pyrenees slopes are so classified, the Auvergne plateau in France, the Alpine slopes, the entire stretch of the Appenines in Italy into Sicily, the entire island of Corsica, substantial portions of Sardinia, the slopes of the Vosges and Jura mountains of France, the Black Forest slopes in Germany. These mountain areas are so defined because there are considerable limitations on the possibility of using the land and an appreciable increase in the cost of working it due to altitude.  There are difficult climatic conditions, shorter growing seasons, slopes too steep for machinery or any special machinery. Altitude quite clearly, therefore, took precedence even though climatic conditions and the potential for grass-production are quite clearly superior in many areas with a high altitude than those applying to the severely handicapped areas of this country.</P>
    <P>In October, 1980, as Senator Smith has <Col N="168" /> stated, the North Connacht Farmers Cooperative Society together with Donegal creamery visited the Cantal area of France, which is a mountain area as defined under, Directive 75/268EEC.  The purpose of the visit was to examine the measures which had been taken there to develop agriculture so that these measures could be implemented in the severely handicapped areas of Ireland. The Cantal is almost identical to Country Mayo, which is typical of our severely handicapped areas, so that direct, valid comparisons are possible.</P>
    <P>The study arrives at some startling conclusions which serve to highlight further the case for reclassification.  The Cantal has a higher population density of 74.7 per square mile as against 54.7 in Country Mayo.  Sixty-seven per cent of the land in the Cantal area can be utilised as against 46 per cent in Mayo.  The annual rainfall in the Cantal region is 48 inches as against 55 inches in Mayo.  The average mean temperature in the Cantal is 9.35 centigrade as against 9 centigrade in Mayo. Cantal has 2,061 mean sunshine hours against 1,202 hours in County Mayo.  The Cantal growing season is five and a half months as against six months in County Mayo, a mere 15 days difference.  The average size of a holding in the Cantal region is 90 acres as against 36 acres in County Mayo.  A figure of 77.2 per cent of farmers in the Cantal region produce milk as against 22.7 per cent in Mayo. The average milk per supplier in 1980 was 9,397 gallons in the Cantal region as against 4,573 in County Mayo, the average yield per cow in the Cantal region is 550 gallons as against 480 gallons in County Mayo.  The total cow herd in the Cantal region is 220,000 as against 100,000 in County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Finally, the gross agricultural output of the Cantal is £100 million as against £55 million in County Mayo.  This figure was obtained three years ago and the ratio I believe still obtains.  It is patently obvious, therefore, that the French province is far ahead in virtually every respect of its west of Ireland counterpart county and that the EC has a case to answer on this question.  I do not <Col N="169" /> begrudge the farmers of the Cantal their benefits and success; indeed, long may they continue to arrive at such very impressive targets, goals and yields and to set headlines for the rest of us.  Those French farmers would readily admit that the primary stimuli which have aided their development have been the combination of grants and interest subsidies which have placed them in a special category. In 1980 farm buildings were grant-aided to the extent of 25 per cent; loans were made available for buildings and equipment at a mere 3¼ per cent over a 15-year period; loans for livestock were given at 4 per cent over nine years and for machinery at 4 per cent over seven years.  Compare these figures with the prevailing interest rates which are being charged by the lending agencies here and one will understand the level of development that has taken place there.</P>
    <P>Every single farm in the Cantal has accessibility and has a tarred road leading into it.  Compare this with County Mayo where each county councillor sees an allocation for this type of work which will tar a princely one and a quarter miles per annum and where long winding paths are still the only means of access to a large number of farms.  I do not know the exact statistics, but not more than 25 per cent of farmers in County Mayo have telephones; in the Cantal every single farm has one, again, as a result of grant-aid.  I do not doubt that the remoteness, isolation and the absence of telephones for emergency contacts is a major contributory factor in the escalation of the number of attacks on people in rural areas of my county and of our province. Surely telephones should rank in equal importance to any other form of infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>I have before me the 1984 December edition of the <i>North Connacht Farmers Magazine.</i>  Again, the heading is: &ldquo;Time to Cut Back&rdquo;.  In the Cantal they have no super levy and no co-responsibility levy. I do not begrudge those farmers their benefits, but we have every moral justification in seeking an equal category for the farmers of County Mayo and the western seaboard in general.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister <Col N="170" /> of State and the Minister for the various initiatives which they have taken in relation to land policy, such as land leasing and so on.  However, the farm retirement scheme has not worked; it has been an abysmal failure because the rules were too rigid and the level of flexibility was inadequate.  The result has been in County Mayo, for example, and indeed throughout the whole country, we have an aging farm population with no encouragement whatever for people to transfer their land.  In the Cantal, on the other hand, they themselves managed to supplement the existing EC farm retirement scheme with the result that the entire age structure and farm demographic structure has changed very favourably.</P>
    <P>There is only one way in which the benefits of the Cantal can be applied to County Mayo and the western seaboard, and that is by the EC Commission agreeing to extend Article 3 of Directive 75.268 by adding the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>That the severely handicapped areas which have similar limitations of the possibilities of use as mountain areas due to a combination of climatological factors, of high precipitation and in wind speed, low air temperature, rapid transpiration, with soils of low permeability, the effect of which is to substantially shorten the growing season and to limit the possibilities for using the land.</P>
    <P>If this insert or addendum is put into the existing directive, then areas of the west of Ireland can be so classified and designated and can benefit from it.  I urge the Minister of State to do so.  I sincerely hope that this is the general thrust of the submission which has been made by the Minister and his officials and that it is being pursued vigorously by them.  There is no moral justifiable reason, as I have stated earlier, for denying those special aids which have been given to the Cantal to the areas which are on the furthermost insular perimiter of the Community.  We await the outcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not now that we should be crying and shouting about the disadvantaged <Col N="171" /> areas: it is ten years too late.  If anybody looks back to the time when we entered the EC when these areas were designated, these were the areas that were agreed by the then Minister for Agriculture.  It is a pity that at that stage there was not as much concern expressed by members on Senator J. Higgins' side of the House as there is today.</P>
      <P>When we examine the various incentives that are available in the disadvantaged areas we see that as a country we are not making full use of what is already available to us.  It is sad that we have not been in a position to take up the maximum headage grants that are available.</P>
      <P>I am surprised to hear Senator Higgins talk so much about the restrictions that were imposed on farmers with regard to income limits: he must have a very short memory; he should remember that these limits were imposed by his own party &mdash; they reduced the income limit to £3,500, and now they have seen the light at last and have realised that for people to survive in the disadvantaged areas they need at least to receive the maximum that they can be paid and that the income limits had to be raised.  There is no reason why they were reduced except that it was Government policy.  It has been Government policy for the past two years to downgrade the status of the west of Ireland and to regard the disadvantaged areas as areas not to be bothered about in electoral terms and therefore those areas will suffer as time goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great praise for what is going to be done; we hear that the beef-cow grant will be increased to £70.  It will be increased in 1986 if this Government are still in office and before that time I would hope if there is a change of Government. That incentive is coming at a time when the suckler cows will have been long hanging by their heels, long tanned and exported.  In other words, it is a case of closing the stable door when the horse has gone.  The farmers who depended on this type of income, depended on sucklings for a living are no longer in business. There is nothing to blame for this except <Col N="172" /> the Government's inability for the past two years to do anything about this and their lack of concern.</P>
    <P>We hear about increases in headage payments, and changes in the sheep headage payments.  Does the Minister of State realise that the last increases that were given in the headage payments were given in 1981?  Yet, we see farmers now receiving half of what their maximum entitlement would be under the disadvantaged areas headage payment scheme.  I call on the Minister to ask the Government to make available the necessary funds to back-up what is available from the EC through the Common Agricultural Policy for the payment of headage grants.  We heard platitudes about the various schemes that are there.  Farmers are not in a position in many cases to take up these schemes; they have not got the financial resources, and until such time as farmers in the disadvantaged areas have money available to them at the same rate as that which is available to their counterparts in Europe, there is no way in which they can develop or borrow money to develop.</P>
    <P>Agriculture cannot afford to borrow at 15 per cent or 16 per cent, which are the rates that are being charged by the lending institutions today.  There is no hope for farming in any part of the country &mdash; disadvantaged or otherwise &mdash; until such time as agriculture has available to it finance at no more than 10 per cent: that is the economic barrier.  After that, as far as agriculture is concerned, money is a burden on the farmer who borrows it over those rates.  The Government have decided that they may not renew the hardship funds scheme which was available to farmers who are in need of a rescue package.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister to allow that package to carry on for the next three to five years.  If we do not take those farmers out of a rut they will not be there to produce or to give of their best.  They will go bankrupt because they will not be in a position to carry on.  We hear great platitudes about many of the things that are available, farm grants for buildings; <Col N="173" /> 35 per cent is ridiculous as far as farm grants are concerned.  I ask that an earnest attempt be made to introduce a realistic grant for farm buildings in the disadvantaged areas.  All the subsidies that are now being paid are of very little benefit to them.  When one sees the cuts that have come on the other side such as the cuts in the budget for ACOT, you realise that many farmers in the disadvantaged areas will not be able to get the advice of their ACOT advisers because of the reduction in the numbers of advisers and the reduction in the funds that have been made available to ACOT.</P>
    <P>Then we wonder how we can improve the lot of the farmers in the disadvantaged areas and in the country in general. These farmers are not in a position to provide from their own resources the necessary advice which they need.  I should like to ask the Minister of State to prepare a special package for farmers in the disadvantaged areas, to provide them with the necessary back-up facilities and know-how to allow them to develop their farms.  Maximum use of the EC has not been made in the past ten years; it has not been fully exploited as far as farming is concerned.  We have seen bits of schemes which have been used as hand-outs &mdash; I call them supplementary incomes &mdash; to try to keep them rather than have them forced on to the dole or forced into a position well below the breadline.</P>
    <P>With regard to EC schemes in connection with the ESB, those schemes should be made available to anybody who builds a house within the disadvantaged areas irrespective of whether they are farmers or not.  If the area is disadvantaged it is disadvantaged in every way, in regard to roads, and its inhabitants, many of whom are much older than those living in the eastern part of the country.  Incentives will have to be given to people to set up homes and to make their living in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Much of the money which was earmarked by the EC for direct income to farmers in the west was lost in transit.  We have seen EC schemes operate totally differently north and south of the Border. <Col N="174" /> I live close enough to the Border to see that farmers in Northern Ireland have fared much better in the disadvantaged areas than have farmers in the west.  Farmers in the North have concrete roads to their houses provided practically free due to EC aid.  Yet a farmer here who wants a road to his house will have to wait for the LIS aid.  This is the last year for money being channelled in that direction, so I would ask the Minister to see to it that this scheme is renewed, but also to see to it that the money that is provided for farm roadways goes directly to farm roadways and is not used to subvent the national budget for county roads as is being done at the moment.  The money which is made available to the Department of Forestry for forestry roads is coming through the EC but it is not finishing up where it is meant to finish, namely, in providing forest roads.</P>
    <P>The water scheme grants of 80 per cent are available at the moment in the disadvantaged areas, but the cost of providing the average group scheme is much higher than it would be in other parts of the country due to lack of population. The maximum of £600 per house or £400 per potential farm supply should be increased, because there is a definite need for this money to be made available in larger quantities.  If we can have 90 per cent in the Gaeltacht why can we not have 90 per cent in the total area?  I agree totally with Senator Higgins' idea that the disadvantaged areas should be reclassified. The disadvantages we have in comparison with our counterparts in Europe are enormous: we are at the furthest point as far as Europe is concerned and everything we produce must carry the extra expense of being transported to the markets right across Europe.  We also have very poor land which is just about able to give one-third to one-fifth of what good land is able to give.  Yet the farmers are not being given the necessary help to develop it, to provide the infrastructure that is required if we are to develop it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the prospect of afforestation, I hope it will be controlled in the disadvantaged areas and not be allowed to run wild, as is happening at the <Col N="175" /> moment, where private forestry is taking up land which could be used much better by farmers in the area.  The net result will be that there will be a decline in the farming population in the disadvantaged areas.  Also, the sons of farmers who enter agricultural colleges should be given the same facilities as were available down the years, which meant that they were given free grants to educate them to farm.  After all, if the parents come within the means for a third level grant they will be given the grant; yet if a farmer decides that his son should attend an agricultural college, he has to pay.  It is sad that this should be the position.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will see to it that money which is designated for the disadvantaged areas goes in its entirety to the disadvantaged areas.  The western package must be continued.  With regard to drainage, we hear that the western drainage scheme will come back into play in 1986.  We all know that delaying tactics of this kind will hinder the development of a disadvantaged area.  If there is to be any real development there we must have it classified in the same way as the Cantal region in France.  The preparation that was done by north Connacht farmers is very good, but why cannot the Minister sell this package to his colleagues in Europe to allow for the reclassification of this area?  If he was able to do that he would then be able to sell a case for having up to 80 per cent of the country classified as disadvantaged so that many parts of it not classified at present as disadvantaged would be included.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will convey to his colleague, Deputy Connaughton, Minister of State, some of the points of view which I have expressed.  It is regrettable that Senator Connaughton cannot be here due to a family bereavement.  It is a pity that this has to be taken in his absence, but I hope the Minister will convey to him some of the points made here.  After all, if we do not decide now to do something with the disadvantaged areas of the west the opportunity will be lost.  They have been classed as being disadvantaged by all Governments <Col N="176" /> because they introduced unemployment assistance in those areas years ago to supplement farmers' incomes.  This is now being taken away from them on the pretext that the incomes from Europe under headage schemes &mdash; which are being paid at half rate &mdash; and other schemes will supplement their income. We should press here for the reclassification of the present area and press for the classification of the entire country possibly as disadvantaged.  Whether we like it or not we are disadvantaged in comparison with our counterparts in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I was dealing with the responsible attitude of young people in Ireland today towards the plight in which they find themselves.  It is described as a crisis for the young people, and they have behaved magnificently to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The media has a very important influence on young people today, and it has been dealt with in the Report at some length.  It is true that the vast majority of the media, whether it is the TV or the press, has acted very responsibly.  On occasions, and all too often in recent times, there has been a fair degree of outcry against some of the material that <Col N="177" /> has been shown on TV in particular and the influence it has had on the young people.  There is no doubt that probably more than any other educational process today television has a great influence in moulding the attitudes of young people. Parents, as the primary educators, have to take second place to the television when the people want to see it.  All too often violence has been shown and it has been shown at a time when young impressionable minds would be, in normal circumstances, allowed to see it. There is, of course, the option of cutting off that service to them, but that only makes it a more powerful influence on the young mind.</P>
    <P>Much of the crime in which young people become involved today is attributed to the violence being shown on certain types of television programmes. There is a responsibility, therefore, on the media to be conscious of how impressionable young people are and to be sensitive to their needs.</P>
    <P>Very often certain aspects of life are sensationalised in both the press and television. When job prospects are mentioned all too often the gloom and doom side is portrayed.  Very often the less well able young people become despondent and apathetic.  There is a responsibility on the media to be very clear and decisive in what they present and the way in which it is presented to young people.  The reports we have had this summer and the two national surveys we have had on youth nail much of the propaganda we have had in the press as a lie in so far as that their attitudes and the actual employment record in the year 1982/83 shows quite different figures from those we might see at a glance in the headlines of the national media.  In this respect, I welcome the Minister for Education's decision to include in the curriculum review the media studies, which will allow young people to examine the media critically, what aspects of it to interpret and the way in which to interpret it.</P>
    <P>The make-up of the committee, involving people from all areas of education, training and welfare has been reflected <Col N="178" /> in the contents of the report.  The most important trend running through it is the link between the educational process and the availability and the preparation for work after post primary schooling.  One of the greatest anxieties among young people is whether they will get gainful employment immediately after their schooling.</P>
    <P>I believe it is incumbent on the Minister with responsibility for youth to see that career guidance teachers are available to all students.  Very many schools, schools in disadvantaged areas which need them most, do not have the help of a career guidance teacher.  In the schools which have that facility all too often the efforts of the career guidance teacher are taken up by the more industrious students who want to gain entry to third level institutions by getting the points system organised for them, while the more ordinary student who wants to opt for the job scene has to take second place, very often to his eventual detriment.  One thing left out of the Report is the connection between a positive career guidance system within the schools and the access of the general youth to that facility for their future.  I would ask the Minister to take note of that and in the very near future to make that facility available to all post primary schools.</P>
    <P>While we await the publication of the policy proper we cannot but acknowledge the important work that has been done by the voluntary organisations down the years, not only in the urban areas but also in the rural areas.  Ten or fifteen years ago organisations in many areas were not very popular, but today we have countless numbers of people involved in voluntary effort to help out the young, the disadvantaged, and to keep them away from the many distractions they may have and which might lead to their involvement with the law or otherwise.  I mention in particular the National Youth Council, Macra na Feirme and other organisations which have done tremendous work in bringing the youth together and getting them to know themselves and each other and how to live with each other.  There is an important social aspect <Col N="179" /> to it as well as an important aspect with regard to their behaviour within society. These organisations have, in the past, operated on a voluntary basis and with scant recognition from the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>We are glad that there has been a positive response by this Government within the limits of the resources available. Nearly £3 million has been designated to these organisations.  It is regrettable that the Opposition spokesperson for youth affairs, when this report was being discussed in the other House, said that it was regrettable that teachers and gardaí did not involve themselves very much.  He said that even if they each gave one hour per week it would be a very important contribution.  Is he unaware of the wonderful work that has been done by members of the gardaí, by teachers and others in society to help young people?  It was a most blatant attack on the people who have given most and given freely and unselfishly of their time.  I would hope that he would rectify that statement in the official report.</P>

      <P>The last plea I make is that the Minister in power today should take one last look and ensure that in the case of all national boards and particularly on the governing boards of university colleges and technical colleges young people and student councils should have a place as of right. This would show the importance of youth in our society.  Go raibh míle maith agat.</P>

      <P>I would like to pay a warm and special tribute to Mr. Justice Declan <Col N="180" /> Costello and to everybody who had a part to play in this excellent report.  I hope the Minister and his Government will show some of the knowledge and, more important, the commitment that committee have shown.</P>
      <P>Most of us serving in public life are sick of reports and of committees.  Unfortunately this Coalition Government, as indeed previous Coalition Governments, have a magnificent record of sheaves and sheaves of paper but no positive action. The Minister in September in the other House asked for the views of the Members of the other House.  He has now asked for the views of my colleagues and me.  The Taoiseach said he did not want a leisurely debate.  We are now three months on.  The Minister is asking us tonight for our views.  I know there are not too many of you listening to your Leader these days, but I hope you will remember that he made that remark.</P>
      <P>I understand that new legislation is necessary for some of the recommendations. I would like to know when this legislation will be available.  Many of the recommendations could be implemented with the present legislation.  I do not see any excuse for not getting some positive results from an excellent document from Mr. Justice Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are marvellous figures being bandied about these days about unemployment. There is a round figure of 217,000.  There is a round figure of 230,000.  The correct figure today, I understand, without another 1,325 coming on stream, is 234,000 unemployed. There is no use talking about green papers or grey papers or blue ones while this is the unemployment figure. The committee do not take sides on all the agencies dealing with youth.  They know the value of each agency, they know the money each agency gets or is reputed to get and they are asking for a clear definition of the responsibilities of the different agencies and the manner in which they work.  I do not think it should surprise any of us that the people who sat on this committee were confused as to where this money goes.  I am confused and many of my colleagues are also.  Since <Col N="181" /> that levy was put on £200 million has been collected in three years.  I do not know where that money has gone.  I do not know how many jobs that money created.  I want somebody to tell me.  A sum of £7 million was switched again yesterday.  Why was it switched?  When the Government put this levy on the taxpayer they were quite clear as to where it was to go, it was to be used for jobs. We are talking about £200 million of a levy, and where is it going?</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that some aspects of the youth policy of the Costello report are complex and will require time to deal with them but a lot should be resolved speedily. I implore the Minister to listen to me. I ask that full time youth workers be funded by this Government.  They are working below a subsistence level wage at present.  We have lost great people from the youth field who went into it absolutely and totally committed.  To ask them to work for some ridiculous wage and that the rest of the money should be collected on a voluntary basis is a load of trash.  I saw committed young people along the western seaboard going into this to become committed youth leaders. Some people think that by reading books and joining organisations they can become good politicians.  The same thing applies to good committed youth leaders. You do not become a leader by reading a book or joining any organisation.  I ask for 100 per cent Government funding for them.  They should have a proper salary scale.  There is no point in saying something cannot be done now.  I am talking about the youth leaders.</P>
    <P>Another interesting thing is the positive expression of concern from these young people.  It is quite clear from the report to anyone who went to the trouble to read it, that there was extraordinary concern for other people regardless of how little they had themselves.  They were prepared to participate in North-South relations.  They were concerned about Irish unity.  They were concerned about peace in the world.  They were quite clear that they wanted to foster and create an understanding among all of us, whether it be here or abroad.  I would <Col N="182" /> like if what was said in the report was recorded here this evening.  They said:</P>
    <P>Naturally we would hope that our conclusions would be favourably received.  But if they are not it is very important that the Government should explain why and announce its alternative proposals.  What is important is that the report is not greeted with silence.  We recommend this course because of our perception of the seriousness of the present situation.  If delays occur, and if an awareness is allowed to grow that nothing is going to happen following the establishment of yet another Government advisory committee then the disillusionment of our young people and (what is of equal importance) amongst those who have dedicated their lives in helping them could be considerable and significantly damaging to our society.</P>
    <P>That is a very important statement and I hope the Minister and the Government will heed it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to paragraph 13.5.3 of the report &mdash; The Need for Integration. I am referring to mentally handicapped and handicapped people.  I support and welcome this section in the report.  I am particularly concerned with the handicapped. I agree with the view expressed in the report that the key to integration lies in achieving a situation where disabled people are accepted not as different people but simply as people with different problems.</P>
    <P>With reference to paragraph 13.5.6 on youth clubs, I would agree with the committee's recommendations that the Government when grant-aiding youth organisations should give favourable treatment to the organisations which are engaged in bringing the disabled into membership.  With reference to paragraph 13.5.7 of the report, I urge that attention be given to what the committee said about employment and training of young disabled persons.  Paragraph 13.5.13 of the report refers to the severely handicapped.  There is a special problem in relation to the accommodation of severely handicapped young people.  The <Col N="183" /> committee have placed as much importance on these special people as on all of us, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister realises the urgency of this report.  This is not another report to be left aside so that in a few months time the question will have to be asked what has become of it.  I hope the Minister will give the grant-aid I have asked for youth leaders.  The Minister spoke rather early in this debate so I do not know his opinion on what I have said. I am sure he does not agree with it.  I understand the Minister has a constitutional right to speak whenever he likes. If he is that interested in what we think, it would be nice if he would come back and give his opinion on what we said.</P>
    <P>I would like to know the Minister's plans for this, the International Youth Year.  I do not know what the Minister's plans for it are.  He has said he would like to hear what the Members of this House are saying.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the people who sat on the committee.  I know at first hand the commitment of the people who sat on that committee.  I do not think it is enough that we should comment on it in this House just for the sake of commenting on it, or that my colleagues in the other House should do likewise.  We do not need new legislation to implement a lot of that report.  It is one of the finest reports I have seen and I hope that we will at least be seen to act on it.  I have never seen the youth as cynical about politicians as they are now.  It is only together that we can change their attitude towards us.  It is unfortunate that they feel like this because they are the ones who will replace us either in this House or the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this motion which welcomes this report.  One of the reasons why young people can be so cynical, and this report indicates some of their cynicism of political groupings, is the fact that in any debate we tend to have in either House of the Oireachtas there tends to be a certain element of political sniping <Col N="184" /> at one another and trying to show that the other side has been remiss in certain areas.  When you are dealing with an area like youth and the problems with which they are confronted and what we should do about them, they will be cynical if we just cast reflections at one another for political reasons.</P>
      <P>During the last year of the previous Government's term of office, under the previous Taoiseach, the unemployment figures went up by 40,000.  Many of those were young people.  There is no satisfaction for young people in hearing me say that or saying that I am satisfied we are doing everything we possibly can in this area, because no matter what we do, with unemployment of the magnitude of 250,000 or thereabouts, it is not a problem peculiar to Ireland, it is also a problem in Britain and in most European countries.  Unemployment is now running at 13,000,000.  There is a major redirection of resources and commitment that all of us will have to take on board and see what exactly we can do for young people.  The time for political sniping is over, because the young people are cynical of all of us.  They want to see action now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this report which was commissioned by the Government to put together, in as precise a form as possible, all the areas to which we as legislators should address ourselves.  Under the excellent chairmanship of Mr. Justice Costello they have come up with a most excellent report and I would certainly commend it.  I would also commend all those who participated in it.  In respect of some of the participants their political affiliations are mentioned.  In order that I would not be accused of being partisan I welcome the fact that Young Fine Gael participated as did the youth affairs officer of the SDLP.  I wonder if Ogra Fianna Fáil were requested to be members of it or whether the Labour youth were there and whether they reacted for or against it.  I am pleased that The Workers' Party made a submission, because in this area there must be an overall commitment from all of us.  Perhaps Orga Fianna Fáil were involved.  I know they <Col N="185" /> have made a major commitment to it. Perhaps the Labour youth decided they would not participate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment of the Minister of State with responsibility for Youth Affairs, Deputy George Birmingham. The Minister said he was prepared to consider applications from all political parties for grant assistance towards the employment of an educational officer with a specific remit in the area of political education.  Above all, and this is where the cynicism comes from, there is a lack of the knowledge of how the democratic process works here or in any country and a lack of interest among young people in how it works.  Interview board members for local authorities or health boards will say that they always discover a complete lack of interest or knowledge among young people they interview in civic matters.</P>
    <P>This must be a matter of concern to all of us, and for that reason I welcome the Minister's commitment to look at the political structures in an apolitical way and try to help the younger sections of those parties to have somebody to educate people along these lines, because it is a very, very important step.  All of us who have any sort of commitment to the democratic process would want to see a continuing development of that concept and to understand completely how the system works.  In this regard I would specifically ask the new curriculum board to address themselves to this problem and the importance of civics, ensuring that civics at that level is taught in our educational system.</P>
    <P>In other countries, particularly in Germany, there is a teaching programme set up by a trust of one of the great founders of democracy in Germany to ensure that this objective will always be carried through and that all young Germans will actually be instilled with this knowledge of and understanding of and admiration for the democratic process.  They have done that on the basis that when there is a danger to democracy by dictators or otherwise it is the young people of the country who always will be at risk first <Col N="186" /> because they can be abused, misused or misled.  Unless we instill in them at a very early age the whole fundamental principles of democracy it is quite likely that dictatorships could take over with the assistance of young people.  That could easily happen here because they tend to turn frustrated away from the democratic process.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that this report indicated that as regards violence and violent means towards the reunification of the country the young people who were surveyed did not reflect that view.  But it is important that other democracies have spent money in the area of civic education for young people.  I agree with the Leas-Chathaoirleach that the real wealth of this country lies in our youth and our future and indeed their own future depend on how they will respond to the immense challenge that faces them going into the next century.</P>
    <P>I have suggested what the curriculum board might do and how they might approach the problem of changing the area of learning, to improve on the area of vocational education and technological education and not to be totally dependent on the system of education which we have had for a long number of years without reviewing it.  It is important that we should review education and training skills.  The educational system must be geared towards the computer and the microchip age which we are now in, and towards the changes that are likely to take place in the future.  I am quite sure that if young people are educated and suitably qualified they can enjoy a very happy and healthy way of spending their leisure time and the increasing amount of leisure time that the younger generations are likely to have in the foreseeable future because of all the advances in technology. But if we as legislators ignore the main recommendations of this excellent report, particularly chapter 16 on page 250, then we will be the losers.  I will quote a comment on the Taoiseach's statement from page 259 because the Leas-Chathaoirleach misquoted him. The Taoiseach made his remarks when he set up this committee to study the <Col N="187" /> problem.  The committee stated:</P>
    <P>We are particularly heartened, therefore, by two things, which the Taoiseach said when speaking at our first meeting.  He expressed the determination that we would not be seen as just another committee set up to talk away commitments, and later when explaining why a 12-month deadline was set for our report he underlined the urgency of our work by pointing out that we cannot afford the luxury of a leisurely debate.</P>
    <P>Those remarks were directed at the members of the committee and not at the Members of the Oireachtas.  They did not have a leisurely debate, they came up with their report in the appointed time and it is appropriate that they were set that guideline by the Taoiseach and the Government.  In fairness, any statements that have emanated following the publication of that and any action that has been taken by the Minister of State present and indeed by the Government show that we all want action and not just a leisurely debate.  It is appropriate that the Houses of the Oireachtas would debate it, but we do not want a leisurely debate.  There is a very special role for youth in International Youth Year designated by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>People want to pick out the sections of last week's budget that they do not like, and in every budget there are sections that people do not like, but the budget contained one common strand relating to these recommendations and to our commitment to young people, and that is the whole area of special allocations, capital and otherwise, that have been designated to youth this year, in the areas of sport, culture and training.  So we cannot say that there has not been an instant response by way of budgetary provision and a commitment from everybody concerned that we would particularly mark the year by stimulating all these activities which in themselves are very important but in my opinion are not the most important.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister present for <Col N="188" /> the way, immediately on taking office, he removed any doubt that youth leaders might have had throughout the country, and there was an element of doubt among them because for some reason the previous Government did not see fit to put them in place permanently without any doubts hanging over where their survival was.  This Minister did that and it has been recognised.  He invested quite a lot of money, and most of us who are involved with young people will be forever grateful because they were at sixes and sevens to know where they were going. That element of doubt about what we felt about the importance of their role has been removed.</P>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency has been set up and has Niall Green as its head, and has quite an amount of money available to it.  It is now involved with AnCO to ensure that there is no duplication. Everybody that we speak to looks to people like Niall Green with a lot of regard for his ingenuity and intelligence and how he has addressed this problem. It is a major step forward in trying to ensure that there is a specific programme to employ young people.  We cannot ignore the major contribution of AnCO, the vocational education committees which I am associated with, of CERT which has done a major job in the food industry and of ACOT with a green certificate in farming.  There is a whole project and programme for identifying those areas, through Macra and otherwise, young people and the contribution they can make, and there is positive proof of this special emphasis.</P>
    <P>In the end, our performance will be judged on how many young people we can actually place in productive employment. I was involved recently in the opening of a career guidance seminar over two days run by the sisters of a secondary school in County Tipperary and I have no doubt, listening to all the young people who contributed at that opening, that their one wish is to get into productive employment.  It is important that we would consult with the trade union movement in this, because they have a major role to play.  I would ask <Col N="189" /> that the Government and ICTU would work hand in hand to come to grips with the problem of unemployment among our young people.</P>
    <P>Our young people are better educated than ever before.  They need direction and leadership.  They need to be involved in all decisions made on their behalf.  I know that this is happening through the national youth organisations, the cooperatives and all other movements involving young people.  We want to put all these items on a secure permanent footing.  What the Minister has done so far has given a tremendous boost in this area.</P>
    <P>Any of the youth organisations we have come in contact with we can always talk to about their programmes of activities, what they are engaged in and what they would feel they would like to do for themselves.  It is not enough just to identify the problems.  We must act on these problems.  Society is prepared to make a contribution towards this &mdash; the 1 per cent is an indication of that.  The contribution that people in employment are prepared to make to the national Exchequer is in the interests of young people.  Such contributions will be rewarded because the results for the national development of our country as a whole will be reflected by the happiness and peace young people can enjoy in employment and the satisfaction that they will have in doing something rather than just hanging around waiting to be directed by their peers and politicians. That is why they treat us so cynically.  We must act and be seen to be acting.  This Minister has a commitment to that, and I commend him for his efforts so far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated for many things, not least for his presence here and his remarkably rapid progress in politics, which is a demonstration yet again of the truth of probably my favourite quotation from any poet, from T.S. Elliott: &ldquo;Do not let me hear the wisdom of old men.  For the wisdom of old men is their fear.&rdquo;  The success of somebody young like the Minister and the achievements of other <Col N="190" /> people who are by any standards young is a very good indication, because the fact that I would even comment on it and comment on people becoming Ministers before they are 40 is one of these extraordinary assumptions about values and qualifications and things that says a lot about the real underlying state of our attitude to young people, which is really that they are very nice as long as they behave like their elders and do what their elders do, and as long as they do that they are very nice; but if they really begin to represent a different culture or a different view then we go into paroxysms of rage, whether it be about the content of MT USA on a Sunday afternoon, or what else.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that what one would usually classify as young people's music &mdash; by that I mean rock and allied kinds of music &mdash; is never played and never presented in our National Concert Hall. There is a large range of reasons why that is excused, but I suspect that somewhere deep down is the suspicion that really that would not be appropriate: what would those young people do if we let them into our National Concert Hall?  So they are packed off elsewhere.  There may well be economic reasons, but I do not believe it is entirely that.</P>
      <P>I will try to put a number of figures in perspective.  I did a quick sum, but I am wide open to correction on this.  I suspect that the cost of keeping that part of our prison population which comes under the general heading of young, in other words under 25 or so or perhaps even younger, would work out at at least £10 million a year, which I would strongly suggest is considerably in excess of what we propose even in future to spend on services for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since it appears that it will be a long time before I get a chance to talk in this House again about homelessness I propose to devote a substantial part of what I have to say to the problem of homeless young people.  I welcome the Minister's reference to it in his remarks last week and to his commitment to meet the problem head on.  Perhaps I can address a few comments that might help him in his determination to deal with this <Col N="191" /> problem.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on the record of this House some of the facts about youth homelessness.  There is the astonishing fact that about 11 per cent of those sleeping rough in Dublin are under the age of 18 years.  It is an astonishing and frightening fact.  It speaks better than any long lists of statistics for our inadequacy in that area.  Large numbers of females are in that under age group.  Most of that group are not transitory, or passing.  They are actually stationary and therefore a long standing problem which we have failed to deal with.  The vast majority of that group are not in receipt of any income from the State; the majority have been convicted of offences; most of those offences are by any standards minor. Many of the older age groups which would presumably have been the young homeless of another era worked on one occasion and therefore many of our young homeless could work if opportunities were presented to them.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the young homeless and the problem of work, there is an extraordinary incentive for young people to leave home because of the way our social welfare system operates.  If a young person of 17 or 18 years is at home the family income will be used to assess the young person's eligibility for unemployment benefit or assistance.  The family income would be used to assess the contribution that he is receiving through bed and board, and the young person can be presented with an assessment of being entitled to £1 or 50p a week when the bus fares to get to the labour exchange to sign on would far exceed the actual value of unemployment assistance.  Other people who are far better qualified than I testify to the fact that young people leave home, not in huge numbers because many of them have good homes and many of them presumably are mature and sensible enough to see the consequences of their actions, because they see it as a way of getting an income for themselves.</P>
    <P>There are on the other hand in this city what could be described as the transient young homeless who stay out for three or <Col N="192" /> four nights on occasions.  The committee made recommendations with regard to them.  There are long lists of statistics available about where the homeless come from and what happens to them.  The saddest statistic of all is the absence of any provision for them.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister makes his promises in good faith, but even if a promise is made in good faith and broken it is still a broken promise irrespective of the genuineness of the commitment at the time.  We have waited so long for anything in the nature of an official response to the problem of homelessness that I sincerely hope that when the Minister made his commitment to deal with the problem of the young homeless the commitment was made on the basis of a very clear understanding of their problems.</P>
    <P>A lot could be said on the issue of youth homelessness alone, but there are many other issues that need to be addressed about the concerns of young people.  I have already said, and it needs to be repeated, that in some way our welfare system operates as a poverty trap for our young people because of this gap between 16 and 18 when they are in limbo.  AnCO and HOPE, a voluntary organisation for homeless young people, conducted a survey of youth unemployment in Finglas and discovered that a quarter of young unemployed people were not in receipt of any State assistance.</P>
    <P>It is always easy for us to say what we have done about any group, but the only way we can really accept adjudication on whether we have done anything for a particular group is the perception by that group of what is being done for them. There is considerable evidence that a large part of our most vulnerable people do not see themselves as being particularly well catered for or indeed having a place at all in society.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we now enacted legislation which will enable a 13 year old child to be detained in a Garda station on suspicion.  We, in this House, could not even think about making exceptions for young people.  When we are put on <Col N="193" /> the spot we still ultimately believe that young people are in some way a little bit different.  We are, by and large, terrified of our young people, particularly the young people who are different in their cultural perceptions, in their style of dress from their elders and those whom we respectfully would suggest are their betters.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that when the Minister leaves this debate the promise he made about dealing with the problem of the young homeless will be a promise that will be fulfilled quickly.  I sincerely hope that suggestions made to me that a senior official of one health board has proposed, as a solution to the problem of youth homelessness, that a hostel with slatted floors be opened, so that they could sluice it down effectively every morning before leaving will not be the nature of the official response.  That apparently was a real proposal by a senior official, suggesting to me that in terms of educating our officials, we have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>There are straws in the wind, however, which suggest that perhaps we will not get as immediate or as positive or as far seeing a response.  One of the specific recommendations of the Costello Committee is with regard to the Vagrancy Act.  They suggested that the offensive sections of that Act should be repealed. The Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism considered this problem.  Our colleagues in the other House and the Government kicked to touch.  On this revolutionary proposal to cease making homelessness a crime, the collective wisdom of Dáil Éireann and of the Minister for Justice was to ask the Law Reform Commission to report on the issue &mdash; in a specific report, on a specific issue, on a specifically particularly offensive piece of legislation which effectively makes it a crime to be homeless. The collective wisdom of most of the Members of Dáil Éireann, and I suspect most of the Members of this House, is to kick to touch and wait for the Law Reform Commission to report on that issue.</P>
    <P>In case somebody thinks I am only reporting academic matters, I will cite a <Col N="194" /> brief report from the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 12 January 1985, about a boy of 14 years who was charged with assault.  It seems he was charged with a serious crime, but stuck on at the tail of the report is the fact that he faced two charges, one of burglary and one of vagrancy. In addition to the charges of assault, somebody slipped in a charge of being a vagrant, in other words, he was charged with this most offensive of all things, wandering abroad without visible means of support.  So whatever about the fears people have &mdash; I know about the fears people say they have but I suspect they are not the real fears, because many of us are in that category &mdash; it would be a good augury of something more than words and goodwill if that particular recommendation in paragraph 13.3.13 of the committee's report were to be implemented immediately.  It is a very simple piece of repealing legislation.  My own draft Bill is approximately two paragraphs. If the Government wish to do it a different way, it would be most welcome. It would be very simple, it could be done immediately and would remove one particularly offensive piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>A much more major piece of legislation that would say something about the real commitment of the Government to our young people would be the enactment of the much promised, much promised, much promised, much promised Children Bill.  That is the real representation of our commitment to our young people, whether we are prepared to reform the most anarchistic piece of legislation dating back almost 80 years on which our children's affairs are regulated. That Bill, or Bills, seems to be indefinitely postponed.  It would be a great indication if not just one but three Bills were to be published sometime in the immediate future.  I conclude by wishing that we will see that most important of all our legislation, real legislation for our children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">

      <P>I would point out that the post compulsory schooling age group is in a state of crisis, not only in Ireland <Col N="195" /> but throughout the world.  Economic and social changes, coupled with international recession, have meant that the traditional means of transition to adulthood by entry into a career structure in the work force is becoming progressively more difficult.  A large number of young people may feel cheated of their expectations and be ill prepared for the changed circumstances in which they find themselves, resulting in problems of alienation, social disaffection and destructive behaviour.</P>
      <P>More significantly, the experience suffered by young people can permanently affect their lives as adults, leading to a large and permanent minority whose attachment to a society which has offered them very little is marginal.  The issue for youth policy is how to enable the young to engage their energy and intelligence in socially valued and personally beneficial activities which would provide options for them to become confident and socially useful adults.  A youth policy is not only necessary to keep young people off the streets or train them for entry into the job market, but to provide them with a means of successful transition to adulthood.</P>
      <P>The NYPC was set up in September 1983 and requested to report within 12 months.  It submitted a 300 page report within the period.  The committee must be complimented on this achievement.  It did the job with urgency and skill and was surely one of the few committees to report on target.  The Government should be encouraged to respond with equal vigour and speed, which I am sure they will.  The report is based on a basic democratic philosophy and vision.  It points to the need for more participation by young people in political, economic and social institutions.  The aim also implies a commitment to reduce our present social and economic inequalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central recommendation of the NYPC is for a national youth service to be set up for the age group 12 to 21 years. It would be a distinct and independent service which would incorporate all the various elements of youth work including <Col N="196" /> training, employing youth workers, working with the National Youth Council, getting premises and so on.  In effect it would be statutory recognition of the youth service.  The policy then deals with specific areas such as travellers, homelessness, the disabled and young offenders.  The report calls on us all to get away from &ldquo;gut reaction&rdquo; politics which, unfortunately, seems to be the trend more than the exception nowadays, and instead to reflect seriously on the problems in our society.  It is the only long term way to deal with issues.  Just as the report goes into great detail in its various proposals in a serious and responsible way, likewise the response should be serious.</P>
    <P>I would refer to the costings of the proposals of the committee.  First, many of the things proposed would not cost one penny, especially with regard to participation. Second, much money is being spent on young people, especially in prisons. Seventy per cent of the prison population is under 25 years of age.  It costs £450 a week to keep a young person in prison.  Prisons have very high failure rates.  Many young people return to crime when they are released.  Surely it would be better to spend money positively on young people, invest in them and we will have a greater return.  If we do not invest now we will still have to spend later.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the new factory, AMD, which will be set up in Greystones creating 1,100 jobs by 1991.  The managing director of the company told a press conference that the main reason his company came to Ireland was because of the educated young workforce, not necessarily the IDA grants.  Our young workforce with such very high expertise will have to be a considerable advantage to us in attracting any future industries.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer specifically to one area in which I have a particular interest, that is outdoor education, and in particular I would like to refer to Cappanalea outdoor activity centre in Kerry, which offers a wide range of activities to young people.  It has provided recreation for underprivileged people.  As well as that it has been used by various groups from <Col N="197" /> Northern Ireland over the past number of years.  I am glad that reference was made to the centre in the report.  The centre is situated about seven miles south west of Killorglin with Caragh Lake to the north and overlooking Cappanalea Lake to the south.  It is ideally suited for such an outdoor activity site.  The site is surrounded by small peaks of up to 940 feet and is very suitable for mountain climbing, hill walking and other activities such as that.  For the past 12 months a temporary youth employment scheme, which was granted by the Department of Labour, has been operating at Cappanalea which allowed the employment of a supervisor who acts as assistant manager, three instructors and a secretary.  This scheme is due to end in March.  A deputation of people will be meeting the Minister on Friday regarding this.  I appeal to him to accommodate the wishes of these people as much as possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to the centre I would like to request the Minister for Education to give formal sanction to the Kerry VEC for their work in the development of outdoor education and for the management and operation of Cappanalea outdoor education centre.  I would also like to make a special representation to the Minister of State at the Department of Labour for the staffing proposals.  I would like if, through the agency of the Department of Education in the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Donal Creed, a precise statement could be given by the Government on their outdoor education policy.  I am sure the people of Cappanalea and the outdoor education centres around the country would be only too pleased to co-operate with the Department in formulating such a policy.  I would appreciate if the Minister for Education could visit this centre.  It has immense possibilities and has a great future if it is properly supported.</P>
    <P>The NYPC report should be a working document.  Let it not be an agenda for the future but for now.  Young people are not the citizens of the future, but the people of today.  I am looking forward to the proposals being implemented and put into practice as soon as possible so that <Col N="198" /> the people who participated on the committee and gave so much of their time will now be rewarded in seeing their work come to fruition over the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the committee who obviously worked so hard to compile this important report.  It is appropriate that at the start of 1985, which is International Youth Year, we should be discussing this important report.  It is agreed that the world will be focussing its attention in much greater detail on youth problems and on youth generally.  It is a very excellent report.  I found it very interesting, very readable.  I must confess that I could have suggested many of the findings in the report from my practical knowledge of youth affairs and indeed my involvement in youth generally.</P>
      <P>Many people are trying to give the impression that our youth are interested in social problems only, items like sex and contraception, which is a total myth. The report highlights that their priorities are very much basic and very much on the ground.  They are interested in bread and butter issues.  They are interested in getting a career for themselves and in setting themselves up for life.  The report says the first priority of this well educated youth is to have good health.  The second priority is to have a job and the third is the noble, honourable priority of peace in the world.  Obviously our youth expressed their concern in this report about the problems of Northern Ireland which have been with us for a long time.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested in the paragraphs which dealt with the family. The report refers to the changing nature of the family as an institution.  We all have accepted down the years that the family is the basic social unit of our society and is recognised as such in our Constitution.  I am aware, as we all are, of the changes in family life and family styles.  We are aware of the weakening of kinship ties which have contributed to the evolution of the nuclear as opposed to the extended family of the past.  The report on page 40 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A crucial factor central to the <Col N="199" /> changes taking place in the family and indeed in society itself has been the women's liberation movement and the struggle for gender equality which affects not only relationships within the family and the divisions of labour but also the values, attitudes and lifestyles of young people growing up in our society.</P>
    <P>You can give me all the social clubs, youth clubs, community halls and community leaders you like but I have always believed that if the mother is at home to meet the boy or girl when they come home from school and talks about the problems of that day, that is more important than all the leadership courses that can be put on for any of these children.</P>
    <P>We have very well educated young people now.  Obviously they have a greater role to play than ever before.  We know our young people are not getting jobs, so they go on to higher education. Education is no load to have at any time. The report admits that education broadens one's outlook and helps for a more enlightened life ahead.</P>
    <P>The report outlines that youth want an assurance that much is being done for them in the area of job creation and opportunity.  It is their main worry.  Many of them refer to the fact that they were very worried about this problem.  This is consistent with reports that are available in many other research findings.  The very fact that the Government have raided the youth employment levy to the tune of £7¼ million will not do anything for the morale and the confidence of young people.  Obviously, the whole area of work experience schemes, AnCO, CERT, Youth Employment Agency and other job training schemes will be affected.  We must remember that the 1 per cent levy placed on the PAYE earner was for specific youth employment programmes. The fact that we have almost 73,000 young people out of work indicates the huge problem we have.  This particular episode of raiding their kitty as it were will do nothing for the morale and confidence of our young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> The interest of young people in politics has been referred to previously.  We note from the report that 1 per cent of our young people belong to political parties. In England, the figure is somewhat higher.  A recent survey in Waterford found that between the ages of 16 and 21 years of age, less than 20 per cent of young people had any interest in local and national priorities.  It is no wonder that young people, with regard to their voting patterns, seem to be guided by their parents on this question of political beliefs and political party affiliation.  It is a question of, which my colleague, Senator Séamus de Brún would say, &ldquo;an rud a dhéanann an cat déanann an caitin.&rdquo;  Every effort must be made by the political parties to make our youth appreciate the working and the seriousness of politics and political institutions. We all have a role to play in this area.</P>
    <P>I hope this report will be implemented. It is a very important one.  It is a good document and one I support totally.  A youth policy should commend all the resources and energies of Government and the people, both young and old.  In particular, youth should play a vital and meaningful role in the problems of youth and youth development.  The implementation of the major recommendations should proceed this year, if possible, to highlight to our young people that we are serious about their problems.  We must never forget that from the youth of today will develop those who will govern us tomorrow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> In replying to this motion on youth, we can take heart from the fact that we have a Government led by a Taoiseach who, obviously has a great interest in youth when he appointed our very youthful Minister of State with responsibility for youth, Deputy Birmingham.  He has been complimented by the other Senators.  He has youth on his side and has common sense as well.  This is a great help to running a department of any Government. I have the utmost confidence that he will produce a youth policy which will be practical and will be of benefit to young people.</P>
    <P>In his speech he mentioned the fact that the youth policy will have to be supported by the social partners.  He mentioned teachers, politicians, and the churches.  I would agree that we cannot have any isolation.  We want everybody pulling together.  One of the Senators mentioned that we want all party agreement on it.  It is an area where we cannot have political point scoring.  We cannot have one particular party thinking that they have all the answers to youth while the other party criticise and find fault with everything that is done.  We need to encourage youth.  We will encourage them by not having sniping action going on as if it was of some benefit.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery in his contribution earlier on talked about co-ordination of the many youth organisations that exist throughout the country.  This is a very valid point.  While it is very important that we have youth organisations of many types in many places we must ensure that we do not have them duplicating and crossing roles and maybe getting money that could be directed to a better way if there was co-ordination.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the very many youth organisations, many of which are run by people who are giving their time free and leave their families to spend hours in youth clubs, on football and hurling fields, in athletics and so on. Money could not pay these people.  The Government would be foolish to try to take over any of these organisations. They can certainly help them by grants. One cannot replace the commitment <Col N="202" /> given by people who are volunteering their time because they have a genuine interest in what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery also emphasised the fact that self-reliance was a very important factor in youth organisations.  This is just what I have been talking about.  One cannot pay people to do things.  They stand on their own two feet because they have an interest.  He was worried about what youth really is when it is under 25 years of age for the YEA, our new Age of Majority Bill make it 18 years and this report make it 12 to 21 years.  This is something that can be tackled.  Definitions may not be as important as they appear to be.</P>
    <P>Senator McGonigle in his usual eloquent and to the point speech was worried that the timetable would not be just let drag on.  I have no worries about his plea that a youth policy would be implemented within this year, which is International Youth Year, because I am sure the Minister will be back to us within a few months.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised one particular point, which surprised me, when he talked about the survey that was done in the diocese of Ossory where it was found that only 4 per cent of the young people felt that they were getting anything out of religion or going to Mass.  This should be a cause for concern in a country we like to think is very Christian, very Catholic and in which people go to church.  If only 4 per cent of young people feel that they are getting anything out of their religion, there is something seriously wrong.  I am quite sure that the survey carried out in the diocese of Ossory was done properly.  It is not easy in this day of commercialism to make people feel that abstract things like religion are important.  However, it would never be good for the nation if religion disappeared out of our lives, especially so for young people who need to have something worth relying on.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke in his contribution was worried about the absence of career guidance teachers in some secondary schools.  It is very important that young people are given proper advice. <Col N="203" /> Very often people take on the wrong course.  They do their intermediate certificate and often have to decide before the results come out what subjects they will do for the leaving certificate.  This is very difficult for a young child.  Indeed, it is difficult for parents to sit down and decide on what subjects a child should do for the leaving certificate when the intermediate certificate results are not yet to hand. Even when these results are out it can be difficult but at least the child involved knows exactly what his or her strong and weak points are.  It is very important that we have career guidance teachers to advise the people who have to make a decision which will affect them for the rest of their lives.  All these things are very important.  While it is costly to provide career guidance teachers for every school because some schools are small it is a plea which I endorse, that when the Minister for Education gets the money she will do her best to provide these guidance teachers.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan had her customary attack on the Government.  She finds that the Government cause a lot of problems. There are Governments which in the past should have been dealing with youth also. Perhaps they should have set up the scene.  I said earlier there is no point in sniping about youth policies so I shall not continue to snipe.  I listened to the Senator very keenly when she spoke about mentally handicapped children. From personal experience, I know of the amount of work she has done all her life in helping the mentally handicapped.  Her record is there to be seen, I should like to compliment her once again on what she has been doing in this area.  I take particular note of what she said.  I am sure the Senator was happy to know, as I was, that in the budget the anomaly which I mentioned in my statement to the House on the last sitting day has been corrected.  I said at the time that I hoped it would be rectified, I should like to compliment the Government for doing so.  I refer to the anomaly that mentally retarded children who continued schooling from the age of 16 years were being <Col N="204" /> deprived of the allowance.  They were getting it if they dropped off school at 16 years.  Nobody more than the mentally handicapped deserve to be supported in continuing their education.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris spoke about the lack of civic knowledge that young people display when they are being interviewed. It came as a surprise to me that in this day and age, when civics is being taught in schools, that this should be so.  I found it very easy in my own classroom, before I became officially involved in politics, to go over the PR system and discuss all forms of politics with the class.  Nowadays I find that if I mention one political party I automatically have to mention the other two in case there is any reaction.  When one is in politics it is not so easy to discuss politics in a classroom.</P>
    <P>It is very important that at secondary school level the young people should know what is going on in politics.  The fact, as other Senators have stated, that the Minister is prepared to appoint officers to advise the political parties on how to interest young people is a major step.  If young people are let ramble all over the place and be impressed by wild statements and ideas which are not very important, they may go astray.  We live in a democracy and we must support the democratic parties.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris said that people are prepared to pay a 1 per cent levy to support young people.  The Senator is right in talking about the willingness of people to pay, if it will help young people to get employment.  I endorse his remarks about the budget putting money where it counts in the sport and culture sectors, providing money for the youth orchestra and for the Olympics in the year before the games take place, as it is easy for a Government to get publicity by providing money in the year of the Olympics.  It is a very good idea to provide money for young people who will carry the flag for us at the Olympics and whom we will cheer madly at that time.  There is foresight shown by the Government in providing this money to help in advance, and I am also glad that culture is getting its place as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> Senator Brendan Ryan, who has vast experience in the realms of youth and homeless people, and knows exactly what it is all about, made the case that the social welfare system often causes problems for young people and encourages them to leave home.  This is something which I hope he will develop further and it is something which is difficult for any Minister to deal with.  Young people are apt to make decisions that are forced on them for lack of money.  He outlined the case that by staying at home they may not get any social welfare.  This is something which should be tackled.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The whole question of disadvantaged youth and the fact that 11 per cent of the youth of Dublin sleeping on the streets are under the age of 18 years is a serious matter.  That percentage of under 18s means that those people are getting no start in life.  It is very difficult for them to make progress later on.  While I have often differed with Senator Brendan Ryan, I should like to compliment him on the work he is doing for young people.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Senators who contributed to this debate and to compliment all the people who give so much of their time and energy in helping young people.  There are many people who give their time, such as teachers, the Garda Síochána and people who are not off work early in the evenings who still come out and help.  These people should be appreciated because as I have stated before, many people will give you money if you are collecting for something but they will not give their time.  The people who give their time and give it free deserve all our thanks.  I should like to compliment the young people, many of them in colleges, who have rag weeks for charity.  I know one college at the moment where a small group have raised £2,000 for charity.  We often criticise the students for what they do during these rag weeks, but they certainly bring in a lot of money.  They are genuine when it comes to the crunch.</P>
    <P>I appeal for an all-party consensus on youth policy and that we would work <Col N="206" /> together as there is a difficult task before us.  It is not easy to provide jobs.  I have the utmost confidence in the Minister and in the Government, that they will come up with a youth policy that will be of benefit to our youth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his presence here &mdash; I appreciate that he did not send a deputy &mdash; to hear the case on Irish Shipping pensions.  As I address this House this evening I have only one fear, that is, that my contribution will be inadequate in demonstrating the injustices done to a body of people to whom this country owes a great deal.</P>
      <P>I should like to begin by reading into the record of the House a letter that appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> in the last few days which was written by the master of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> which is at present tied up in Marseilles.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As you can imagine, life out here can become very boring and frustrating, just waiting for the boom to fall on our jobs and our future.  I think the most depressing news so far has been that the pensions of our predecessors have been cut to a figure comparable to the pocket-money of many teenagers today.  Memories in high places are very short-lived, but I guess some of out leaders weren't even born during the Emergency, so why should I worry?  What hope then for us in our fight for an equitable settlement after giving most of our working lives in unstinting loyalty to a wholly-owned State company?  I would call on all <Col N="207" /> politicians who are worth their salt to stand up and be counted.</P>
    <P>This is a moment, I hope, when those of us who care can be counted.  I sincerely hope that the Government can be included.  I want to declare a personal interest in this matter.  Twenty years ago my own brother was lost at sea with Irish Shipping; lost at sea like so many more, he was one of the young men who died in the service of the company and through service with the company.</P>
    <P>This issue arises in the first place because a State company was put into liquidation.  This has never happened before and all of us here pray that it will never happen again.  The liquidation in itself was without precedent and I submit that the fear of the company's pensioners is also unprecedented.</P>
    <P>I should like to read into the record of the House some facts which may not be so well known in relation to Irish Shipping. First, the executive, clerical and seagoing staff of Irish Shipping had no part in the charter decisions which led to the eventual liquidation of that company. During the entire 40 years history of the company there was not a single strike. Irish Shipping Limited recorded 15 consecutive years of profit and therefore could not be titled in any shape or form a white elephant.  There is also the case that executive staff worked long hours overtime over many years for which they received no payment.  Salaries and conditions of employment were strictly controlled by the Department of the Public Service.  Irish Shipping staff were State employees and were regarded as such until the provisional liquidator was appointed.</P>
    <P>What all this means is that there are no easy examples to fall back on in deciding how to respond.  It means also that we in the Labour Party were entitled to feel aggrieved on behalf of these workers and the way they have been treated.  In all of the liquidations that have occurred in the private sector over the last number of years, there have been very few where the pension scheme collapsed with the <Col N="208" /> company.  It happened in this case.  I can assure the House and the Minister that if we in the Labour Party had known the tragedy that was going to happen to people who in many cases had given a life service there would have been no way in which we would have allowed this to happen while we stood by.  I think I can speak for the entire Parliamentary party when I say we are not prepared to stand by now and see people who deserve far better treatment victimised in this way.</P>
    <P>When I use the word tragedy I am talking about human tragedy.  It is not an issue that just involves money.  If we allow the pensioners of this State company to be robbed, as they are being robbed, we are consenting to the loss of their dignity, the dignity of being able to provide even at the end of a working life.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the House some examples of the treatment that is being meted out to those people.  In individual cases pensions have been reduced from £270 a month to £40 a month, from £925 a month to £141 a month; in what looks like real meanness some very small pensions have been made even smaller, for instance from £13 a month to £9 a month. In a number of cases the pensions have been removed altogether.  Some people with incomes of between £60 and £90 a week now have absolutely nothing.  All of this might be understandable if the cost of protecting these pensions ran into millions.  It would make some sense perhaps if someone could tell us that we were going to break the banks or upset the Government's economic strategy to right this gross injustice.  But it is not. The total number of people involved is 48 and the cost of providing a small measure of dignity for them, or rather of restoring the dignity we have taken away, is less than £85,000 per year.  What has happened here for the sake of a pittance is that we have taken away the rights of a small group of people who have served this country in a unique way.  What possible objection can there be to remedy the damage the State has done?  There will, no doubt, be some who would argue that to treat this case in a way which it deserves would create a precedent that <Col N="209" /> might work against the State in the future.  That argument will not wash at all.</P>
    <P>Apart from other considerations, I have already pointed out that this situation in itself is without precedent.  It happened only because a State company went to the wall, with a badly-managed under-funded non-contributory pension scheme going with it.  If we have other such companies and other such pension schemes we should learn from Irish Shipping. I do not believe that any Deputy or Senator, whether in the Government parties or in Opposition, would be prepared to allow a situation like this one to arise again.  For our part in the Labour Party we will simply not allow more State pensioners to be thrown on the scrap heap.  This is a point I want to stress to the Minister, because an argument will undoubtedly be made in quarters where there is no knowledge of the unique contribution of that particular body of men and women that there is nothing special about these pensioners.  That could not be more wrong.  What we are talking about here is a unique group who have made a contribution to the country that is also unique.</P>
    <P>At the time when neutrality was most under threat during the last war it was the officers and crews of the Irish Merchant Navy and Irish Shipping in particular who preserved our neutrality.  Without them we would not have survived what we sometimes call &ldquo;The Emergency&rdquo;.  In a very real sense they were the only Irishmen who went out to fight and to die for this country in that war.  They went out to fight without guns and in leaky old ships that were unable to withstand the slightest assault.  I have specialised knowledge on that in so far as I sailed on a number of leaky old ships.  From some of the descriptions I have heard of the ships that Irish Shipping took to sea in the forties they were either extremely foolish or extremely brave, and I believe they were the latter.  We are talking here about people who are real patriots in every sense of the word.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any doubt that it was the men of Irish Shipping who protected our <Col N="210" /> neutrality, I should like to read into the record some of the research work done by Robert Fisk for his book <i>In Time of War</i>.  First, I should like to read a memo from Winston Churchill, and I would ask the House to take note of the menace contained in the last phrase: I quote Churchill to his Minister:</P>
    <P>I agree with the general line of your talk.  I could in no circumstances give the guarantee asked for and for the reasons you state.</P>
    <P>About arms.  If we were assured that it was Southern Ireland's intention to enter the war, we would of course if possible beforehand share our anti-aircraft weapons with them and make secretly with them all possible necessary arrangements for their defence. Until we are so satisfied, we do not wish them to have further arms, and certainly will not give them ourselves.</P>
    <P>The concession about Lough Swilly is important and shows the way things are moving.  No attempt should be made to conceal from Mr. de Valera the depth and intensity of feeling against the policy of Irish neutrality. We have tolerated and acquiesced in it, but juridically we have never recognised that Southern Ireland is an independent Sovereign State, and she herself has repudiated Dominion Status.  Her international status is undefined and anomalous.  Should the present situation last till the end of the war, which is unlikely, a gulf will have opened between Northern and Southern Ireland, which it will be impossible to bridge in this generation.</P>
    <P>Let me have a further report on the economic pressure.</P>
    <P>The extent of the economic pressure that the British were prepared to use was enormous.  For example, in 1940, 74,000 tons of fertiliser was imported from Britain. But in 1941 that had been reduced to a trickle of 7,000 tons.  None at all was received in 1942.  Similarly, well over five million tons of feedingstuff was imported in 1940 and it was down to one million tons in 1941 and none at all over the next <Col N="211" /> four years.</P>
    <P>By 1941, Eamon de Valera was asking Irish farmers to double their acreage of wheat in order to avoid starvation and threatening penalties for farmers who planted alternative crops.  This was the background in which Irish Shipping was established.  I quote again from Robert Fisk:</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited was formed in March 1941 and bought its first vessel, the <i>Irish Poplar</i> within a few weeks.  Built in 1912, she had already been attacked by a German bomber in the Bay of Biscay while sailing under a Greek flag, and her Irish crew had to travel to Spain to collect her from a salvage company.</P>
    <P>That is what they went to sea in, ships that were unseaworthy but were desperately necessary for the survival of the State.  I quote again from the book:</P>
    <P>Irish ownership, however, proved no firm defence against attack by either of the belligerents.  In February 1940, the passenger ferry <i>Munster</i>, on charter to the Belfast Steamship Company but flying the Tricolour, was mined in Liverpool Bay.  Then in August, the <i>Kerry Head</i>, a Limerick collier, was subjected to a more deliberate assault and attacked by an unidentified aircraft off the Old Head of Kinsale.  Several bombs fell around her but the crew were unhurt.  In the same month, another mine destroyed the Irish livestock carrier <i>Meath.</i>  All Irish vessels sailed under their neutral flag.  Up to four huge Tricolours were painted on the sides of each ship together with the word &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; in letters 20 feet high, but Allied and Axis aircraft and submarines sometimes mistook Irish ships for French, British or German vessels and the crews suffered accordingly.  In September 1940, for example, the cement carrier <i>Luimneach</i>, which had already been damaged by bombs at Valencia during the Spanish Civil War, was stopped by a German submarine in the Bay of Biscay, while on her way <Col N="212" /> to Drogheda.  Despite the name &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; on <i>Luimneach's</i> hull, the U-boat's captain ordered the crew into their boats and then sank the vessel by gunfire.  For several months afterwards, the Irish Government believed that the submarine was Italian although it was in fact <i>U 46,</i> commanded by Oberleutnant Engelbert Endrass who recorded dismissively in his war diary, that the <i>Luimneach</i> had been flying a &ldquo;British or Irish flag&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A further extract points clearly to the damage to which Irish ships, although neutral, were subjected.  I quote from Robert Fisk's book again because I believe it is extremely necessary that the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues are fully aware of the obligation and the debt which is due to the people on whose behalf I speak this evening:</P>
    <P>In October, the <i>Kerry Head</i> was sunk after being attacked by an aircraft off Cape Clear, County Cork.  Her destruction, with the loss of 12 crew, was watched by several people on Clear Island although to this day the nationality of the plane that attacked her is unknown.  An eyewitness said long after the war that a German plane dropped a stick of bombs on the vessel at around two o'clock in the afternoon, that the <i>Kerry Head</i> exploded in a sheet of flame and that the blast from the explosion brought down the aircraft which crashed in the sea.  A trawler was moored off Cape Clear but did not have sufficient fuel to reach the scene of the attack.  An Irish launch was only taken from Berehaven at 8 o'clock in the evening because the authorities were not at first convinced that there had been a sinking.  Some of those who watched the attack from Clear Island claimed later that they saw survivors clinging to wreckage after the explosion.  Two months later, another unidentified aircraft bombed the Irish lightship tender <i>Isolde</i>, whose captain had been third officer on the <i>Lusitania</i> when she was torpedoed and sunk off Kinsale in 1915.  The bombs that hit <Col N="213" /> the <i>Isolde</i> started a fire in which six of the crew were killed.</P>
    <P>My final extract from this book is one which I think has a particular appropriateness for the motion I put before this House this evening.</P>
    <P>Irish shipping companies did their best to protect their crews.  Their vessels were degaussed to protect them from magnetic mines, and Hempel was given details of all Irish vessels for him to pass on to the German Admiralty and the Luftwaffe.  German naval and air crews were instructed to check their targets but inside the blockade zone around Britain, they did not always have to do so.  The Irish only learned of this in the last months of the war after an extraordinary incident in which a U-boat scuttled itself off Cork. The crew had put their ship's documents into two metal canisters and thrown them overboard before rowing ashore and being taken into custody at Collins Barracks in Cork.  But the canisters later floated on to the beach and were retrieved....  The 20 crew members of the submarine were installed at the barracks, singing German songs as they made their way to and from their meals, unaware that Colonel Bryan of G2 had sent Douglas Gageby, one of his young intelligence officers, down to Cork to examine the canisters.</P>
    <P>Inside them, he found ship's papers, a series of photographs of an air attack on a small trawler and a copy of the submarine's Standing War Orders, signed by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, the former Flag Officer U-boats and now Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy.</P>
    <P>This is what they said:</P>
    <P>... basically Irish ships also come under neutrality regulations....  In addition, for political reasons, Irish ships and also at times Irish convoys are not to be attacked within the blockade zone if they are seen to be such.  However, there is <i>no special obligation</i> to determine neutrality in the blockade zone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> The extracts I have read out demonstrate the case I have been pursuing here this evening.  During the war 135 members of the Irish Merchant Navy died at sea and a large proportion of fatalities suffered domestically over that five year period were in fact members of Irish Shipping. These same sailors &mdash; we are talking about the sailors of Irish Shipping &mdash; also saved a total of 521 lives, sailors of all nationalities, British, American, German as well as Italian.</P>
    <P>The other point the extract makes is that there could hardly be any greater or more savage irony than the only tribute we are prepared to pay at the end of it all is to slash the pensions of the men who fought to protect us, to supply us with essentials and even to feed us.  We can only be ashamed if we do not rectify this injustice.</P>
    <P>To sum up, there are no precedents for this situation and no reason to suppose it will create any.  The number of people involved is small and the cost is miserly, no more than £85,000 a year.  It is totally wrong that we should choose to ignore the contribution Irish Shipping made at a time when we really needed it.  If we cannot resolve the injustice that has been done in this case it will be a long time before I &mdash; and I believe I speak for many of my colleagues in this House &mdash; will be persuaded to acquiesce in another decision like the one which led to the closure of Irish Shipping.  I believe this cause has justice and I believe, because of the calibre of the Minister in charge and also because of the faith I have in this Government and in this Cabinet, that not alone will justice be done but it will be done swiftly.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Magner for raising this issue in the Seanad.  He has recalled eloquently the service of Irish Shipping personnel, particularly during World War II.  He has argued very cogently the case for the pensioners of Irish Shipping.  I fully sympathise with the sentiments expressed by Senator <Col N="215" /> Magner.  Indeed, in advance of liquidation this eventuality was anticipated; every angle was considered, and this is one of the sadder aspects of the whole liquidation, that people on pension could suffer in this way.  Ever since liquidation I have been examining up-side-down and down-side-up ways and means of possibly helping a situation like this.  One might ask why has this problem not been resolved. I want to assure the House that it has not been resolved not because of any lack of sympathy on the part of the Minister or on the part of the Government but because there are legal and financial sensitivities involved; there are implications involved which thus far it has not been possible to overcome.  I am still examining the matter with all urgency.  I have particular sympathy for all the pensioners but I think everyone would feel that those who did serve during those trying times in World War II deserve our special sympathy and they certainly have mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sympathy in a situation like this is not much good.  I am sorry that I am not in a position to announce to the House any firm proposals in this regard.  I want to recall the background to the situation. Senator Magner mentioned that the pensions schemes had collapsed; that is not what happened.  The three pension schemes operable in Irish Shipping are <Col N="216" /> intact.  There was one for the senior executives, there was one for the seagoing staff and there was one for the shore staff. Irish Shipping decided to top up those pensions by <i>ex gratia</i> payments of various amounts.  In some cases they also made <i>ex gratia</i> payments to people or dependants who had been in their care when no pension was payable.  There are 48 people involved of whom I understand about ten had service during the World War.  The pensions schemes have not collapsed although the position I gather is that the trustees of the pensions schemes are bound by the terms of them to wind up the pensions schemes and return the funds to the members of the schemes.</P>
    <P>I hope that, without raising too many hopes, I will be in a position to announce some alleviation at least for those who served during the World War before too long.  There are legal and financial implications. Sometimes this can be infuriating for somebody who is not a legal expert and who wishes just to get things done. Everyone will share my view that the liquidation of Irish Shipping had nothing to do with the employees of Irish Shipping, much less the pensioners.  They do deserve the sympathy of this House and the country.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday 13 February 1985.</P>
