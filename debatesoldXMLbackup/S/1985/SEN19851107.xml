      <P>It is proposed to order Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 and to take them in that order.  As on the last occasion, both Nos. 1 and 2 will be debated together.  I propose that the sitting be suspended from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and that the House should adjourn at 5 p.m.  In the interests of a good debate if any item ordered concludes later than 4 p.m.  I propose that the new business not be taken at that late hour.</P>

      <P>Could I ask a question about item No. 24?  Senator Dooge gave an undertaking, and I am sure he followed it up that he would find out what the Department of Justice were doing in the light of the Law Reform Commission's report on vagrancy.  I do not want the Leader of the House to tell me off the top of his head now what happened but perhaps he could repeat his inquiries and find out what they propose to do on the issue.</P>

      <P>I want to inquire from the Cathaoirleach and from the Leader of the House how long more we are going to be enclosed in this contraption?  I want to know what progress is like upstairs. I suggest to the Cathaoirleach and the Leader of the House that it is about time we had a committee of the House to <Col N="1084" /> supervise what activity is going on above us.</P>

In regard to the question of the permanency or otherwise, every Member of this House would be happy if there were a permanency about his seat in the House, whatever about the surroundings of that seat.  I agree with Senator Howard that it is a matter on which we should receive progress reports, not weekly but from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking before the Adjournment on Thursday evening last, I mentioned the accession of Spain and Portugal and the damage it would do to the Irish fishing industry.  Only this week we see that the Minister for Fisheries is already having problems in trying to get Spanish boats under control.  It appears that they are trying to have a system operated with regard to the licensing under which they will be able to duck in and duck out.  They will be here today, gone tomorrow, and back the following day.  It will reach the stage that the people who are trying to police the fishing boats will not be able to keep control over them.  If that is the case the naval service will need three or four more boats to keep track of them.  There is no way in which we would be able to keep track of a licensing system which allowed them to change from day to day.  I hope that the Minister will continue to press for at least a minimum notice period before one boat can replace another in the prescribed fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>When we consider the entry of Spain and Portugal we must also realise that we are taking in what are classed by many as two very poor regions.  The position we have held due to being classed as a depressed and disadvantaged area will be lost as we now become part of a bigger pool of disadvantaged areas within the Community.  The balance with regard to agriculture will shift very much from the type of agriculture we know in Ireland to the type in the Mediterranean countries where you are talking about the production of fruit, oils and wines.  The wine lake will receive much better treatment as far as Community support is concerned than will the butter or beef mountains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> When we review the progress made in the past ten or 11 months as far as the EC is concerned, we should be forthright in our criticism of their failure to give massive aid from their food supplies to the starving in Africa.  Whether or not we want to admit it openly, the EC as a Community has failed to make available as much from its resources as it might possibly have done.  When we consider the contribution made by the people of Ireland to Live Aid in comparison with the contribution made by the EC in direct aid to the Sudan, Ethiopia and the other countries where famine is rampant, we see that big brother EC has not shown the sort of consideration that we would like to see shown to people who are in hardship and in poverty.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that we should examine the use that we have made as a nation of what is available to us through the various EC schemes.  When we look at the agricultural side, look at the hardships that have been felt by farmers due to the bad summer this year and see that we did not take up the maximum of headage payments that would have been available to us, we as a nation cannot criticise the EC for not having funds available to us from that point of view.  I feel that we should have taken up all the various EC schemes and incentives that are available to us.</P>
    <P>Like other Members of the House in recent times I have received documentation from various voluntary organisations, I suppose it is only fair that we should refer to a recent document which was sent to all Members of the Oireachtas by Macra Na Feirme calling on the Government to implement Regulation No. 797 of 1985 which is the support for young farmers of establishment aid.  This is a very worth-while scheme which we should have taken up.  If we are to see progress it is important from a national point of view that we should look at this scheme which is available with EC help and ask the Department of Finance and the Government to make available the necessary support to back up this scheme.</P>
    <P>We have also seen this year great talk with regard to the incentives that are <Col N="1087" /> available of up to 80 per cent for the disadvantaged areas from EC for forestry. Forestry has a role to play as far as this country is concerned but we should not overstep the mark as far as selling this great EC scheme.  If we study some of the reports that have come out recently, for instance, the Farms and Food Research Report of An Foras Talúntais for October 1985 we see that it states that much of the land that is practically planted in this country and available for planting will be subject to wind blow which will mean that many of the forests now planted will never come to maturity due to the fact that they are in such open country and on hillsides, that they will end up blown down when they reach a certain height.</P>
    <P>This is something that I do not think any private individual who might decide to plant land can get insurance against. It shows that, like any other type of crop, often when it is coming to maturity the elements can do away with the bountiful harvest that you hoped to get from it.  I feel that much of the land, especially in the west, which has been promoted by certain sections as being suitable for forestry, could still play a role in agriculture. Many of the resource surveys, which are being used to show that forestry is the greatest thing possible in the west, are totally outdated and many of them go back to the early seventies prior to our entry into the EC when agricultural produce prices were much lower than they are today.  I feel that a further assessment should be carried out of comparison between land for forestry and land for agricultural purposes such as dairying or stock raising.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister of State would also have the same problems with regard to his area in the west.  We feel that full advantage has not been made of the EC schemes that are available to us.  If we are to become members of a growing, more united Community we must see to it that we take up the full benefits that are available to us from the EC.  We must also see to it that we are not dragged in <Col N="1088" /> to any alliances, military or otherwise, which EC member states may decide to partake in.  At no stage in any agreement or any handout should this ever be placed upon the table for bargaining with as far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is important that the same chances are given to all countries within the Community. I refer to that with regard to what is now happening within the EC for many of our mainland European partners and competitors are being allowed to import cheap cereals into the Community whereas we have not the same advantages they have.  The net result is that they are now the massive producers of the mountains of butter and beef which are accumulating within the Community rather than Ireland.  We face the same penalties due to the super-levy and various other penalties.</P>
    <P>I hope, when further reviews of the Common Agricultural Policy take place, that the cheap food policies pursued by the industrial countries of Europe are not allowed to be implemented to the detriment of Irish agriculture.  I also feel that it is time that the EC reviewed the position with regard to imports of agricultural produce from outside the Community. When we are told that the mountains of butter, skimmed milk powder and beef are growing within the Community I feel that it is regrettable that countries, such as New Zealand and Australia, who have down the years had an alliance with other member states are now being allowed to import food to add to the mountains that are supposedly available in Europe.  If this policy is not soon dealt with, European agricultural prices to farmers will be forced down to world market levels, which would be detrimental to the Irish economy and farmers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will take a very hard look, as I said earlier, at any defence policy which the EC might try to implement.  I expect that the Minister for Foreign Affairs along with all the other members of the Government will keep a very close eye on what is being proposed. I appeal here today to the the Minister of State to ask the Government to make <Col N="1089" /> full use of all the various schemes that are available to us through the EC.  When we have a situation in which EC schemes are not being taken up, where £ for £ is available, it is good economy to back that type of aid with money from the Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Regional Fund it is important that those moneys are spent in the areas for which they are earmarked and not diverted to other projects and to other schemes.  All the moneys provided through the Regional Fund should be spent on a regional basis and as much money as possible should be spent in the disadvantaged areas.  I also feel that the grants which are available for third level education through the VEC from the EC should be available to all students who pass their leaving certificate rather than having them confined to those who may have received a certain number of honours. The reason I say that is that many times in the past it has been proved that not the greatest academically at school have proved to be the greatest when it comes to fulfilling their careers at a later date, after finishing their education.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a few remarks with regard to the present situation within the Community and with regard to the development of the Community in the past ten months.  It would be a very interesting exercise in 12 months time to come back here and review the situation in relation to how we have progressed in that time within the EC and also to assess the contribution that has been made by the new member states who will join in 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to make my contribution in this debate, which is a significant one, because what happens in Europe and what decisions are made affect us all profoundly.  One of the weaknesses is the lack of communication and the lack of awareness generally among the public of what those decisions are and what their likely impact will be.  One of the useful tasks we can perform when it comes to debating this in Seanad Éireann <Col N="1090" /> annually is to have an overview, to examine what has occurred and what its likely impact will be on us and on all the countries affected by EC decisions.</P>
      <P>One could speak about so many areas affected by EC decision makers.  Indeed, those who have contributed to the debate so far have ranged widely in their contributions. The Minister for Foreign Affairs in a very comprehensive speech touched on every conceivable aspect of this.  I do not propose to do that this morning.  I would like to confine my remarks to an area which is of particular interest to me and on which I am spokesperson in the Seanad, that is the response of the EC and in particular the Irish response, to the disastrous famine in Saharan and Sahel in Africa.  What has happened there has been so catastrophic and so alarming in its proportions that even the most disinterested person has been alerted to the fact that this situation demands a response.  It is useful to analyse what has happened, why it has happened, what our response should be, what it has been and what future possibilities there are to cope with this type of situation which will be with us for many years to come, until we can have some vast improvements in Africa.</P>
      <P>The agricultural sectors of many developing countries have performed poorly over the past 25 years.  We must look at the reason why this has been so.  There has been a failure to adapt agricultural techniques to increasing population density on the land.  There have been domestic policies which favour the urban sector and which have, in fact, discriminated against farmers.  In addition to this, the Governments of some developing countries have been tempted to neglect the domestic agricultural sector because of the availability of cheap food for import resulting from over-production in developed countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Third World as a whole food imports have increased more than three fold from 30 million tonnes to 97 million tonnes in the period 1961-81.  It is important to recognise the significance of this.  In sub-Saharan Africa these problems have been particularly acute and have bitten <Col N="1091" /> hard because in these countries food imports have increased more than five fold over the same period which indicates the nature and the depth of the problem in that particular part of Africa.  There is evidence to suggest that a further trend in sub-Saharan Africa shows no sign of abating, that is of food production decreasing at a rate of 1 per cent per person per year.  This is a disturbing statistic and deeply worrying for the future. The reality behind figures of percentage increases and percentage decreases is one of enormous human suffering and hardship. It is one of malnutrition, it is one of disease.  All these realities have been very succinctly brought home to us, courtesy of the media over the last year.</P>
    <P>We must remember that even in a normal year in countries in sub-Saharan Africa malnutrition, starvation and disease are not new.  Decreasing agricultural productivity is only part of the more general problem of what is increasing poverty in these countries.  One consequence of this is that even when there is not an overall scarcity of food vulnerable sections of the community may go hungry because they do not have the purchasing power to buy whatever food is available and the ability to grow food is not there. These countries in such circumstances are particularly vulnerable.  If there is a sustained period of drought or if there is civil or political strife or any combination of a number of factors there is a trigger mechanism there which leads inevitably and inexorably to famine.  When this happens the underdeveloped nature of these countries concerned in terms of poor roads and poor infrastructure generally seriously hampers relief efforts even when there is adequate material assistance made available to them by the international community.  We all saw illustrations of that problem in the course of the famine which hit so hard last year.</P>
    <P>There are solutions of a short term nature.  Indeed, the EC has not been found wanting in that regard.  Senator Ellis criticised the EC when he said the EC could have acted more swiftly.  I will come to that later in the course of my speech this morning.  The only lasting <Col N="1092" /> solution and the only real solution lies in increasing productivity in the agricultural sector within the countries concerned because ever increasing imports cannot be sustained as a <i>modus vivendi.</i> The developing countries have the potential to overcome these problems and studies such as those conducted by the FAO in 1983 have shown that even in sub-Saharan Africa the countries have the technical capacity to feed populations larger in fact than the present populations of these countries.</P>
    <P>In order to realise this potential the developing countries require more suitable domestic policies.  They need improved technology and higher levels of investment.  The international community need not be helpless in the face of these problems because they can assist by providing resources for investment and technological know-how.  It is up to the developing countries themselves to ensure that the policy environment for this type of development is right.  That is something that people on the outside cannot do for these countries.  A combination of the willingness to invest and the willingness to provide the technological know-how coupled with creating the right policy environment for these assistances to flourish is the ideal way forward to ensure that famine, starvation, malnutrition and disease are kept at bay.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that the international community can have a very important short term effect, because it can assist by providing food aid which will be required to fill the gap that is certain to exist for many years until local production can be sufficiently increased to support the populations of these countries.  But if one provides food aid indiscriminately it can have the effect of undermining local production. Over a period it can also change tastes so that a dependence is built up on the types of food that cannot be grown locally.  It is said that, in terms of adaptation and assimilation of one culture to another, the last thing to change and to assimilate is the taste for food.  But I suppose in a situation of food shortage one quickly learns to overcome a learned <Col N="1093" /> response to the appreciation of different kinds of foods.</P>
    <P>It is important that food aid should be integrated into an overall policy which favours the development of the local agricultural potential.  In that way there can be continuity of what is produced.  Of course, where there is famine the overriding consideration is to get food quickly to the hungry in order to save life. But as soon as those emergency measures have had their effect, and as soon as that short term operation is put into effect, it is very important that the energies of people should be put into the long term solutions, in coming to grips with the underlying problems of poverty.  As I have said, this requires appropriate policies and technology and resources for investment.  Food aid is part of a strategy to develop local production capacity, but not indiscriminately or in a way that undermines local production.</P>
    <P>The EC responded to the crisis in Africa.  There are various opinions as to how appropriate, how speedy, how effective this response was.  There is what might be called a seductively simple attitude which is one of moving mountains, quite literally, of transferring the enormous surpluses willy-nilly to Africa and to the hungry.  It is a compelling argument and one which appeals straight away to people.  On the one hand, they see want, and on the other hand, they see plenty. One hears the argument frequently that the want and the plenty can be used to cancel out the problem.  But it is a seductively simple argument and in the long run it is not the best way to handle the problem.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the approach of the EC is to provide assistance for long term development with a view to helping to eradicate the underlying problems.  Food aid is provided in the context of food strategies for development and the Community stands ready to provide emergency assistance on the occasions when that is required.  Ireland supports this type of approach by the Community.  I should like to pay tribute to the efforts of those Irish members of the EC and <Col N="1094" /> in particular to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, who worked long and hard on this matter and was determined and successful in his approaches to ensure that the EC helped to the maximum to redress a tragic situation.</P>
    <P>It is important to mention the third Lomé Convention which, like its two predecessors, was agreed under the auspices of an Irish Presidency of the Community. It is one of the main means by which the Community assists developing countries. The Convention allows preferential access to Community markets for exports of the signatories, African, Caribbean and Pacific ACP States and provides for resource transfers of 8,500 million ECUs &mdash; in Irish punts, that is about £5,800 million &mdash; aimed at promoting the long term development in the economies concerned. It has a strong African focus and emphasises in particular agricultural development.  The Community is, in addition, one of the main sources of food aid for developing countries.  Calculations recently made by the International Wheat Council show that in recent years the EC has provided more than 20 per cent of total food aid provided by all donors.  In terms of size it is second only to the United States and more than four times the size of the next largest donor which is Canada.  Last year the provision in the Community budget for food aid &mdash; that is excluding food aid financed by member states individually &mdash; was more than 500 million ECUs, that is, around £350 million Irish punts.</P>
    <P>It is important to consider what the general Irish response was to the problem. Assistance financed by the Community budget is in addition to assistance provided by member states individually. In the case of Ireland, development aid expenditure last year was just under 32 million punts.  In the case of bi-lateral aid from Ireland to individual developing countries, all four countries which have been designated as priority countries for the receipt of aid are in Africa.  They are Lesotho, Zambia, Tanzania and Sudan and almost 30 per cent of the assistance <Col N="1095" /> is targeted on improving agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Ireland also supports the international institutions which assist Third World agriculture.  For example, Ireland is one of a number of countries which this year made special contributions &mdash; in Ireland's case it was just under £250,000 &mdash; to the International Fund for Agricultural Development in an attempt to break the negotiating log jam which had led to a funding crisis for that situation.  The Irish aid programme also provides for food aid.  It gave £700,000 to it in 1984 and in emergency assistance it gave £1 million. In accordance with the terms of the national economic plan, <i>Building On Reality</i> official Irish development assistance has increased to 38 million punts in 1985 and is set to increase further to 44 million in 1986 and to 50 million in 1987. Although many people, particularly those who have worked in Third World countries, are disappointed that we are not moving more rapidly towards the UN target, nevertheless in straitened economic times we are, I feel, doing what is within our power to do and we are keeping this issue to the forefront of our priorities.</P>
    <P>Famine struck in 1984 and struck forcibly and visibly for all of us because of the basic vulnerability of the countries concerned, combined with a number of successive years of drought &mdash; and in some countries, such as Ethiopia, a prolonged civil strife.  It is clear in retrospect that the reponse to the emerging crisis, both within the countries concerned and internationally, was not fast enough and not decisive enough.  This is why the public in general felt helpless.  This is why when Bob Geldof and Band Aid appeared on the scene, the public responded so magnificently: here was a chance for them to exercise that feeling of helplessness which they had in the face of the slowness of decision-making at international level.  They felt that directly, immediately, promptly and effectively they could make a response in the face of this enormous tragedy which was hitting Africa.  It was a magnificent <Col N="1096" /> response.  I hope that it will save thousands and millions of lives so that the generosity and the spirit of all of those who gave will have a significance which will last for generations.</P>
    <P>When the response came from the international agencies and from the EC in particular which is the subject under discussion this morning, it was a strong response, even through it took a little longer than many people would have wished.  Exceptional amounts of international assistance were provided.  But it is true to say that the combination of the late response and the extreme logistical difficulties led to tragic developments in some areas.  It is terribly important that the lessons of this kind of experience should be learned so that never, ever again will there be a repetition.</P>
    <P>At the same time, however, exceptional organisational difficulties were overcome in many more cases and countless lives were saved.  It is very important to have a balance in the criticism of what has occurred.  In so far as the European Economic Community is concerned, steps were taken to augment the very substantial resources made available at the beginning of the year, when in April 1984 a special emergency plan, costing 32 million ECUs, which is approximately £22 million, was adopted in respect of the most seriously affected countries.  The need for further exceptional measures was first raised at Council in September 1984, when the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, intervened to draw attention to the deteriorating situation and to urge the need for additional Community assistance.  We should be very proud here of that initiative and of that first intervention to get additional assistance.</P>
    <P>The Minister subsequently visited Africa in his dual capacity as President in Office of the Council of Development Ministers and as Irish Minister of State with special responsibility in the area of development co-operation.  He reported back to the Council and gave his findings in November.  This was important because it paved the way for the adoption by the European Council meeting in <Col N="1097" /> Dublin on 3 and 4 December 1984 of what was called the &ldquo;Dublin Plan&rdquo;, which involved an undertaking by the heads of State or Government to ensure that food aid from the Community and its member states to the most affected countries would be not less than 1.2 million tonnes of cereals in the period leading up to the main 1985 harvest.  This involved a significant increase over what would otherwise have been the case.  It is important and significant to note that fact.</P>
    <P>As a first step to implementing this commitment arrangements were made immediately afterwards to augment the development aid section of the Community budget &mdash; Title 9 is what it is called &mdash; by transferring 95 million ECUs to it from another section of the budget for the purchase of food aid.  Before the expiry of the Irish Presidency of the Community, the Taoiseach also wrote to the heads of government of other developed countries to urge that the total international response should be adequate.  I think the public played a very important part in ensuring that all of this happened, because all over the country people began to question what was happening and they began to apply pressure to public representatives, and in their donations to voluntary organisations at that stage they demonstrated their willingness to give in the face of this famine and this crisis.  All of this alerted the politicians to the fact that the Irish public in particular wanted to see action, and the politicians responded, as I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>Throughout 1985, developments in the situation have been carefully monitored by the EC and as time passed it began to become clear that the total availability of international food aid was likely to be adequate to meet the requirements of the affected countries, but that severe problems would be caused in some countries as a result of inadequate port storage and internal transport facilities.  The Community's contribution to the solution of these logistical difficulties involved, for the most part, efforts to increase the <Col N="1098" /> capacity of ground transportation systems. In exceptional cases, however, the Community organised air lifts of food.  In Sudan, for example, when the railway system was destroyed by floods, an air lift was the only way of getting food to people affected by famine.  Since this was the only way of saving the lives of people concerned it was considered to be good value at any price, although only a tiny proportion of food aid, 10,000 tonnes out of the 1.2 million tonnes under the Dublin Plan, was transported in this expensive way.</P>
    <P>At the European Council in Milan in June the progress of the relief operations was reviewed.  It was noted that two-thirds of the 1.2 million tonnes pledged under the Dublin Plan was already delivered or en route.  The commitment made, therefore, at that stage was well on the way to being implemented.  The fact that the main 1985 harvest is not due until the end of the year in many of the countries concerned means that what is required is a phased supply in line for the population's food requirements.  It now seems certain that the commitment made in Dublin will be met fully.</P>
    <P>The official Irish response merits consideration because in addition to its involvement in Community activity such as I have outlined, Ireland has also responded in its own account, and as early as March 1984 Ireland delivered 4,000 tonnes of wheat to Ethiopia which was the country initially most seriously affected.  This in IR£ was at a cost of £1.285 million.  Ethiopia was also the main recipient under Ireland's disaster relief programme.  Total expenditure under this programme in 1984 was about IR £1 million and this paid for medical and transport assistance as well as for the purchase of a further 2,000 tonnes of wheat for Ethopia.  In 1985 so far, 2,413 tonnes of wheat flour together with 100 tonnes of milk powder have been provided to Sudan at a cost of £778,000 and £1 million has been spent on other forms of emergency assistance for the benefit mainly of Sudan and Ethiopia, which are two countries deeply affected by famine and drought and soil erosion.  Some 930 <Col N="1099" /> tonnes of fertiliser from NET have also been shipped to Sudan to assist in rehabilitation efforts and this was done at a cost of £188,000.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ireland's assistance to Sudan for long term development projects, mainly in the agricultural sector, amounted to £360,000 in 1984 and £700,000 in 1985 &mdash; not inconsiderable sums.  So that all told, official Irish direct assistance, that is excluding the Irish share in the Community action, to the most seriously affected countries in 1984-85 amounted to more than £5 million. These official efforts have been paralleled by and have reflected the unprecedented public response in Ireland and in the developed world generally to the famine in Africa.</P>
    <P>It has found particular expression in the Live Aid appeal of Bob Geldof to which the Irish public contributed more per head of population than any other country, apart oddly enough, from Bermuda, which is something that has not been given any public airing.  The total we gave was £7 million.  But even before Live Aid, the Irish public had contributed some £16 million in 1984 alone to Irish non-Governmental organisations. A recent survey from the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation revealed that no less than 91 per cent of all Irish adults contributed personally to the relief of famine in Africa during the last 12 months.  It is a staggering statistic, that 91 per cent of all Irish adults were sufficiently touched to dip their hands in their pockets to make a contribution.  I suppose it tells us something that we really all know, that residually within us, deep down, there is a folk memory of famine and its effects and we cannot but respond even in hard financial times.  There is something within us that tells us that we want to give in these circumstances, and we do, 91 per cent of us.  We can be proud of that fact.</P>
    <P>Irish official aid has strong links with the Irish NGOs.  Likewise, the Government contributed £250,000 to the Live Aid appeal, having earlier agreed to refund VAT payments on the Band Aid record, &ldquo;Do They Know it is <Col N="1100" /> Christmas?&rdquo;.  That was a good, quick, imaginative and a clever thing to do.  It was earnest of intent.  It showed that the Government was prepared in the face of an appalling tragedy to waive that tax. Young people particularly appreciated that fact.  They also appreciated the fact that they did not have to mount an enormous lobby.  It is sometimes sad in Irish public life to find that there has to be enormous pressure before something is done, by and large.  It is so much nicer and so much more effective if something is done swiftly, graciously and in a dignified fashion and that the pressure and the lobby have not got to be there to push seemingly reluctant people into doing something.  This was a once off effort; it was a nice and a stylish way to do things.  I like to feel that it would happen in other areas, particularly contentious areas where there are certain enormous lobbies.</P>
    <P>The current situation and outlook must be considered.  It is a hopeful sign that, for the first time in a number of years, rains have come sufficiently early and plentifully over a large number of African countries to provide proper conditions for crop planting and &mdash; hopefully &mdash; for crop harvesting.  It is hard for us to imagine that people would be grateful for rain, particularly after the summer we have had when we had hoped it would go away and fall somewhere else.  Africa had a good rainfall this year.  Let us hope that this will bring sustenance and support to hungry people.</P>
    <P>The FAO situation report for October 1985 indicates that these favourable circumstances are continuing.  This augurs well for the next harvest.  With any luck, some countries may manage to build up stocks in the period leading up to the next harvest if they receive food aid supplies in excess of their immediate requirements. It is possible therefore that the food aid situation will return to normal &mdash; I say normal for Africa &mdash; in many of the countries concerned.  It is possible that problems of over-supply could arise in some countries with consequential damage to the local productive sector if the delivery of food aid intended for the <Col N="1101" /> pre-harvest period is delayed until after the harvest.  However, lest I be accused of painting too bright a picture, it is important to say that there is no room for complacency.</P>
    <P>A sudden cessation of the rains could happen.  This would injure the prospects of a good harvest.  It is important to note that the actual and real situation will not become clear until perhaps the end of this month.  Moreover, enormous dislocations have been caused by the events of 1984-85. These have reduced the level of planting in some countries.  We know that in Ethiopia the drought drove many people from their farms, from their homelands, in search of food and that seed stock was sold or eaten in desperation.  Animals normally used for ploughing and tilling the land died or were slaughtered for food.  This will have a severe impact on the ability of these subsistence farmers to recover from the drought.  In those circumstances there is a continuing need for vigilance.  We in the EC and in the wider international community must ensure that we have the capacity to respond flexibly and rapidly to developing circumstances.  Plans of the international community must also take cognisance of the fact that at least some countries will need exceptional food aid in 1986 and that others may need logistical support because of local deficits within the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>If we look further ahead, as the EC Commission has stressed we should, it is imperative that long term development programmes aimed at tackling the underlying problems should be strengthened and that early warning systems in respect of famine should be improved, because part of the problem was that we did not really know the scale, the scope and the extent of the problem until it was a little too late to move with the desired alacrity and with the desired volume of assistance.</P>
    <P>It was because of this need that I have spoken of for flexibility that Ireland supported the Commission's proposal for an increased level of food aid in 1986 as compared with the 1985 level and, in <Col N="1102" /> particular, for a reserve which would permit the provision, if required, of 500,000 tonnes of cereal or its equivalent. The appeal of the proposed reserve is that it would permit exceptional assistance to be provided when and in the form required in response to what were the developing circumstances on the ground. If the most optimistic forecast in relation to the forthcoming harvest proves to be well founded we might not need to use this reserve at all, that is, the normal programme of over one million tonnes of cereal plus other products would be adequate to cope.  If, however, the harvests fail and there is a cessation of the rain, and if the production there is not as good as anticipated, if only in some African countries, the existence of the reserve will be an important safety net and that is why it is vital to have that safety net in position in the event of a failure of the harvest.</P>
    <P>For these very reasons Ireland dissented from the negative position adopted by the budget council of the EC at its first reading of the budget on 18 September 1985 in relation to this proposed reserve or safety net which I have spoken about.  Partly for this reason Ireland voted against the budget as it emerged from the council's first reading. Subsequently the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Jim O'Keefe, who represented Ireland at the council publicly described the position adopted in relation to food aid as an &ldquo;outrage.&rdquo;  The Irish views in this regard will be reiterated when the overall situation is before the development council in November 1985.</P>
    <P>This discussion is happening now. Ireland will be looking for increases in the provision for food aid as compared with the 1985 level and, in particular, for the inclusion of the proposed 500,000 tonnes reserve when the 1986 budget comes back to the budget council for its second reading.  Looking to the longer term, Ireland will be supporting moves to make the Community's programmes generally more responsive to the long term developmental requirements of developing countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> I hope I have given a comprehensive picture of what has occurred in the EC, in the face of this catastrophic famine and, in particular, what the Irish initiatives and reponses have been through membership of the EC.  The Irish participation in EC council deliberations was concerned; it was incisive; it was determined and, more important, it was effective. We should dwell from time to time on the good, important and significant contribution we are able to make by virtue of our membership of the EC.  I commend all those who, on behalf of all the Irish people, initiated such useful and valuable moves.  In particular, I commend Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs who speaks for all of us in these matters.  That is the contribution I wish to make on the motion for discussion this morning.  In this House we have an opportunity from time to time to dwell on development co-operation matters.  I hope it will not be too long before we can do so again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very little of what Senator Bulbulia had to say that I would do other than enthusiastically agree with.  I have a very high opinion of the work and achievements of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I admire, among other things, his forthrightness and his frankness. When his fellow members of the European Council of Ministers take an appalling decision, he has no hesitation about saying it.  I remember him being interviewed at a time when the whole food aid issue was still very active and making his points very effectively on a BBC radio programme and, in the process, making a considerable contribution to educating opinion, not just in this country but in our larger neighbouring country about the reality of some of the obscurities of EC decision making.  Looking at the whole issue of developments in Europe and the new impulse towards union and what some people have somewhat optimistically talked about as the new idealism, we would need to avoid any blinkered approach, in particular any <Col N="1104" /> donning of collective rose-tinted glasses in order to avoid confronting the nature of the political process and the political structures in Europe and, in particular, the nature of the economic philosphy which is now dominant within the European Community.</P>
      <P>A number of things seems to be common to the governmental policies of most of the countries within the EC.  One of those is a reduction in public expenditure, allied to a reduction in taxation, allied to a disengagement by and large of the State from the whole process of economic development, allied to an increasing emphasis on the private sector and on what is called deregulation and the breaking down of what are seen as rigidities in the market-place.  These are all fine terms, but what they really amount to is an increasing transfer of the burden of traditional areas of support, like health, education and other areas on to the individual, increasing emphasis on reducing the capacity of trade unions and of the workforce to maximise their bargaining position, allegedly because of increasing competitiveness from countries where wage rates are substantially lower.</P>
      <P>The frightening consequence is that there is very little evidence, objectively, that this sort of policy has worked.  We are, in fact, to some extent, in the grip of an almost ideological frenzy which has taken hold of a number of European institutions. It has taken hold of a number of major European governments, in particular the United Kingdom and Germany and is leading us down a pathway which could lead to large-scale unemployment, large-scale human suffering, considerable disruption and destruction of industry and, at the end of it all, very little in terms of progress.  The evidence from Britain is that, notwithstanding all the enormous efforts that have gone to reducing public expenditure, notwithstanding all the efforts that have gone into disengaging the state from the economy and from reducing the position and strength of the trade union movement, they have not done much about generating employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> Europe is, to a very large extent, in the grip of a very similar economic philosophy to that being propounded in Britain. I have always been somewhat sceptical of the European Community concept. That is why I am particularly sceptical at present because we are liable to have built into it economic thinking and economic theories which are, by the standards of the previous 30 years in Europe, quite extreme in their emphasis on private sector development and on the playing down of the role of the State, things which have characterised the development of European social democracies since the war and which are in the process of being dismantled.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that the most successful economy in Europe &mdash; I mean Europe in the broadest sense &mdash; is not in the European Community.  By any index in terms of growth, in terms of levels of unemployment, in terms of the state of public finances, by any of those indices, Austria is probably the most successful country, economically speaking, in Europe.  It is interesting, that, notwithstanding what is said about the possible threat to our position if we were not part of the European Community, Austria has achieved all that outside the European Community.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting that the country which has displayed the greatest scepticism about progress towards greater European union within the Community is another small country, Denmark, where the parliament have voted against the idea of a new treaty of European union. We would do well to look at other non-EC countries.  Norway is exceptional because of US oil revenues and has a relatively successful economic growth rate.  Sweden has achieved that sort of restructuring of its industry by methods which I would argue are considerably more humane than those being perpetrated in Britain which has managed to achieve a fundamental restructuring of industry where it has, for instance, a level of robot involvement in industry which is three times as high as that of Japan.  It has achieved that without the huge urban <Col N="1106" /> decay, without the huge heap of unemployment and without all the human tragedies which are so visible to us at present.  Therefore, to believe that there is somehow one way forward, which is the dominant economic philosophy currently in Europe, is a serious threat to our interests.</P>
    <P>There is no way that a free market economy, where the major market for goods which are produced by industry is in the centre of Europe, can do anything other than drain resources of capital and labour out of this country towards the centre.  The essence of the economic integration which is referred to in all discussions about Europe must be of a planned economy, in which resources and regulations are there to ensure an even distribution of growth within the Community. The sorts of regulation and allocation of resources which would bring about even an equal development in all regions are fundamentally at variance with the economic philosophy being expounded by many of the leaders of major European countries at present. Therefore, if we are going to walk into a greater, closer economic union, we have a serious threat, not just to our present state of economic development but to our future state of economic development. We would need to look closely at the success of a number of non-EC countries in developing their economies and at the regulations, controls and internal cohesiveness that they developed in terms of a real social partnership.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that people, who quite enthusiastically support the free market model for economic development, with more or less degrees of qualification, are usually equally enthusiastic about that aspect of Europe which is furthest away from a free market model, which is the Common Agricultural Policy.  I support the Common Agricultural Policy.  At least, it is consistent with my general attitude to economic development.  The Common Agricultural Policy is a fundamental challenge to any idea of free market development.  It is based on fixed prices.  It is based on guaranteed prices.  It excludes any element of competitiveness <Col N="1107" /> and competition between those who are producing agricultural products.  It guarantees them their sales.  It is at variance with every tenet of free market economics that I, from my limited knowledge of economics, am aware of.  Therefore, it is somewhat inconsistent and fundamentally threatening to the Common Agricultural Policy for people to speak about free competition and free markets in the area of industrial development and to speak about the absence of free competition and the elimination of free markets in the area of agriculture. One or the other will give.  Agriculture is the most vulnerable.  Therefore, if people continue to advocate the whole idea of free markets and free competition as the model for growth in Europe, agriculture will inevitably suffer from that.  The fact that Mrs. Thatcher, in particular, has been scathingly critical of the Common Agricultural Policy is at least consistent on her part.  In this country, the two major parties in particular would want to make up their minds on whether or not they support free market economics.  If they do, they should try to think out how they can make an exception.  What you usually find in this country is that people are in favour of free markets except in so far as the free markets threaten their own interest group.  If you are in favour of free market economics, then the basic position is that you accept that all groups are subjected to the free market, or else you forget about the free market and talk about a centrally planned economy.</P>
    <P>One of the attractive issues dangled before the Irish people in the period when we were discussing the EC before the referendum was the development of a social policy that would be of great benefit to us, both in this country and in Europe generally.  It suffices to say that there are now around 12 million or 14 million people unemployed in Europe and that the European response is, more and more, to make life more and more difficult for those unemployed people. More people in Britain, Germany and other European countries are announcing that there is no incentive to people to work, that the levels of welfare are <Col N="1108" /> excessively high and that they cannot afford them.  It discourages people from labour mobility, flexibility and from any acceptance of lower wages.  In Britain attacks are being made on any attempt to guarantee the incomes of lower paid workers.  They are being attacked on various things like that.  I do not believe there is any reason to suspect that the major most powerful economy in Europe, West Germany, differs that much from the British philosophy in terms of these issues.  Far from moving towards a greater level of social equity in Europe, it seems that we are tending to move inexorably in the opposite direction towards greater inequality, greater disparties of incomes and less attempt to redistribute wealth and income between various groups in society.</P>
    <P>As a community who are poor by European standards, we have good reason to be worried about our future as a poor community, as distinct from the individual pockets of poverty throughout Europe.  The philosophy which argues that individual groups within the workforce need to have their incomes reduced in order to increase their incentive to work could well apply to us as a community within Europe in the future, particularly if the one final power that we do have &mdash; the power to veto issues which are threatening our national interest &mdash; is in any way qualified by the use of qualified majority voting.</P>
    <P>Senator Bulbulia talked at length about our aid programmes.  I do not know that Europe, as distinct from this country, has really got an awful lot to boast about in terms of the response to the famine in Africa.  The <i>Save the Children Fund</i> in Britain, almost 12 months ago, suggested that the British and United States Governments were using the famine in Ethiopia to attempt to undermine the Government of Ethiopia.  The <i>Sunday Times</i> report recently about the 100,000 people who died during resettlement was a quite scurrilous attempt to undermine yet again Ethiopia, its Government and, indeed, the whole aid programme.  As Fr. Aengus Finucane from Concern said, it was true that 100,000 people died in the <Col N="1109" /> whole resettlement programme, but they died on the programme, not because of the programme.  Their deaths were not caused by resettlement.  There were people, he said, who probably would have died anyway because of the famine and because of the tragic situation in Ethiopia.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Development and Co-operation have had a great opportunity to speak to an Irish priest who was working in Ethiopia and who has a very high level of praise for the Ethiopian authorities and is quite enthusiastic about the resettlement programme.  He said it was painful and difficult and there was insensitive handling of different issues, but he felt it was the only proper response on the proper scale to deal with the scale of the problem and that, of course, there were human tragedies involved but there were human tragedies involved in Ethiopia, whether action was taken or not. His view was that the Ethiopian authorities have responded extremely well to the famine problem.  He was particularly enthusiastic about the low levels of corruption involved and about the fact that aid did tend to get through and was not pilfered, was not taken away, and was not removed for other purposes.</P>
    <P>I have no great enthusiasm for many of the things that the regime in Ethiopia have done, but I do think it needs to be said that there is something close to a propaganda campaign being conducted against the Ethiopian Government by Western European powers, among them some of the more powerful members of the European Community.  The Government in Ethiopia, like all Governments, are slow-moving and perhaps do not respond the way they should, but they are not some sort of ogre between us and the starving people of Ethiopia doing their best to prevent aid getting through. The opposite is probably more likely the case.</P>
    <P>It is tragic that humanitarian and compassionate instincts which have been aroused throughout Europe about countries like Ethiopia could be diverted and could be suppressed by issues of political <Col N="1110" /> approval or disapproval for different regimes.  It would be equally true if there were a Government of a right wing kind, which perhaps I might disapprove of, and I were to use political issues to divert aid from the people in such a country.  It should not happen.  Humanitarian aid is above and beyond politics.  It is wrong for anybody to introduce political questions and questions about the nature of the regime except in so far as is needed in order to ensure that the aid gets to the people who need it.  We have considerable evidence that in Ethiopia the aid is getting to the people who need it.</P>
    <P>On the question of European political co-operation, I am happy that the EC has retained its commitment to the Contadora process.  I think, however, that there is an excessive level of even-handedness in many of our statements about Nicaragua. It is true that Nicaragua is far from perfect.  There are very few perfect states. I look with some interest at the amnesty international annual reports.  I noticed considerable criticism of aspects of life in Nicaragua, and that is true.  It is also true that there was considerable cirticism in the amnesty international report of aspects of life in this country and, indeed, of most of the members of the European Community.  Spain was given particularly scathing criticism about some aspects of its prison regimes and some aspects of its security laws.</P>
    <P>We are not really in a position to be heavily critical of one country in central America.  I do think in the way that we are unequivocally critical of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, and in the way we have in the past been prepared to take severe and stringent economic sanctions against Poland in the wake of the suppression of Solidarity, that we have an obligation to be equally critical of another major superpower, the United States, when it gets involved in the most blatant from of international bullying in order, to quote President Reagan &ldquo;to force the government to cry &lsquo;uncle&rsquo;&rdquo;.  It is not enough to pretend to be evenhanded between equally guilty adversaries. There is no doubt in my mind that in this case the really guilty party is the <Col N="1111" /> party with all the power, all the influence and all the self-interest to be protected. Therefore, in any allegedly agreed European position that must be reflected.  In fairness, the Irish Government's views are closer to that position than those of Europe collectively.  We are being hindered by the blind loyalty of certain other members of the European Community to the United States.</P>
    <P>On the issue of South Africa the Community has come close to disgracing itself.  Bishop Tutu recently accused both President Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher and, indeed, Chancellor Kohl of racism. It is not my word; it was his word, because effectively he said that if what was being done by the South African regime was being done against people who are white the level of indignation and the hostility all over Europe and by European governments would have been far in excess of what has so far surfaced.  There is no doubt from reports we read but that the British Government are now regarded by whites in South Africa as their major champion and their greatest ally.  There have been demonstrations of support for Britain outside the British embassy in Pretoria by white South Africans, who recognise Britain as their champion, ally and defender.  It is tragic that we have been effectively backed into a position by Britain's intransigent, in Bishop Tutu's word, racism and Germany's equal apparent racism on the issue of black rights in South Africa.  We have been backed into a position where apparently we do not feel free to take some of the steps that some of the non-EC countries like Sweden and other countries have taken in the case of South Africa.  Sweden have banned all South African imports. That is not a difficult thing to do in this country.  We could ban imports and in the process we could enable a number of very brave young people to get back to work and end that dreadful, though enormously noble, strike that has been going on in Dunne's Stores for the past 15 months.</P>
    <P>It is getting to the position where our rhetoric is being exposed for what it is &mdash;<Col N="1112" /> rhetoric.  We now have in South Africa all the manifestations of what we used to call totalitariansim when what we meant was that it was on the left.  We have now a supression of any sort of media access. We do not know that is going on in black communities in South Africa.  We are now in a position to judge how poorly informed white South Africans are, because all through the past 12 months, they saw nothing of what we saw on our television.  They saw none of the massacres, none of the bloodshed, none of the horror and none of the police violence because it was not shown on South African television.</P>
    <P>We are now in that position, and it is easy to see already how South Africa as an issue is beginning to lose its newsworthiness because it is no longer visual. Therefore, the visual media are losing interest because they cannot show us any of the spectacular footage that they so bravely collected in the past.  Having held the pass at the time when public opinion was at its most angry, countries like Britain, Germany and the United States will now be able to reassure their ally in South Africa that the real threat is over and ask them to make progress at their own pace even if it is only cosmetic.  The real threat may well be over now.  Europe, far from contributing to the liberation of black South Africa, has contributed to the stabilisation of white rule in South Africa by its equivocation and its unwillingness to impose sanctions.  It is a matter of great immorality, with all the rhetoric we generated so easily, that when action was called for in the light of that rhetoric, we failed to take any action.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the whole issue of European union and its future progress, in this House we have often talked a lot about neutrality.  I only want to advert briefly to it in two ways.  I remain convinced that, given appropriate circumstances, neither of the two major parties in this House would really insist upon the defence of our neutrality, for different reasons and under different circumstances.  As far as I can see, the concept of neutrality that is insisted upon is basically a negative non-participation in military alliances.  In <Col N="1113" /> fact it is the easiest part of neutrality. Apart from anything else, it means we can spend less money than we otherwise might have to spend on what is called defence but, in fact, it is an investment in death.  We do not have to do it and we can avoid doing it.  On the broader issue of our taking an independent political stance, our capitulation to British and German Racism&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not capitulate. That is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would insist that we did. The level of European sanctions against South Africa was pathetically inadequate. It was pathetically inadequate because Britian and Germany declined to allow anything serious in the level of sanctions.  We had massive amounts of rhetoric, fine and noble words, but very, very little in the line of action.  As far as I am concerned, the major obstacle to action came from Britain and Germany. Therefore, I can only conclude that we capitulated.  I am sorry that we take a very different view but as far as I am concerned we did capitulate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>We failed to convince them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We failed to take independent action ourselves.  Therefore, we capitulated.  If we did not convince them and we believed it was of fundamental importance we could, as we did on the issue of the Falklands, take independent action.  We failed to do so.  Therefore, as far as I am concerned, we capitulated to what Bishop Tutu called British and West German racism.  I keep emphasising that is his word, not mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, on the issue of neutrality I want to say two things.  First of all, I am becoming increasingly fed up with Fianna Fáil assertions of their commitment to neutrality.  If I am to be critical of our Government for their performance on South Africa, the performance of Fianna Fáil seems to be singularly lacking.  None of their spokespersons on foreign affairs to my knowledge has as much as uttered <Col N="1114" /> a single syllable about the situation in South Africa or the situation in Central America in the past 12 months.  That says very little for any sort of political commitment to neutrality on Fianna Fáil's part.  As far as I am concerned, Fianna Fáil's concept of foreign affairs extends to six countries north of the Border and no further, with occasional outbursts on issues of Irish interest in the EC.  Any sense of a global policy in terms of neutrality seems to be singularly lacking. That the single largest political party in this country with a history of struggle against oppression in their past could maintain a total silence on South Africa, defies my belief.  I do not believe it is a matter of policy.  I think it is a matter of omission and inertia on their part, but it says very little for the real commitment to neutrality.</P>
    <P>The final point on neutrality, and one that disturbs me considerably, is the consistent media reports, which I have not seen denied, that the West German Government insisted over and over again to the Government of Spain that their membership of the EC would be incompatible with a withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.  I do not know whether those rumours or reports are all true.  If the West German Government are insisting that membership of the EC is in any way directly linked with membership of NATO, then many of our protestations about the fact that there is no such link mean very little.  It means that we are being allowed to think one thing, but the real powers in Europe have a very different view of the future of Europe.  Therefore, any progress towards European union must imply a serious threat to our position in trying to act and think independently on major issues of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time in 24 hours that I have been called on to conclude a debate.  I hasten to assure Members of the House that on this occasion the reply will not stretch to two hours.  We have had a general debate on the question of developments in the EC. It was indicated, when the agreement was <Col N="1115" /> made to take this motion and, indeed, indicated again by Senator McDonald in moving the Motion, that the intention was that we should have a general debate on EC matters and, with this debate out of the way, we could then take up individual reports of the joint committee on the EC and discuss a number of problems in greater depth.  Accordingly, I think all that is necessary for me to do in replying to this debate is to touch briefly on the major issues that have been raised.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate the Senators taking part ranged over quite a number of issues.  A number of Senators talked about the Common Agricultural Policy. A number talked about fisheries.  The question of a convergence in both its senses has come up.  Development Aid has been touched on.  European political co-operation and the present moves towards European Union were mentioned. I would hope to make a brief comment on what I think were the important points made in each of these areas.</P>
      <P>In talking about the Common Agricultural Policy, Senator McDonald stressed that in the case of the Common Agricultural Policy the Community has been the victim of its own success.  It is the very success of this programme, in order to guarantee an income to the farmers of the community, that has led to the present situation where the Common Agricultural Policy absorbs a high proportion of the budget of the Community.  It is clear that this is not a situation which can be ignored.  We must be realistic and realise it is not a situation that will last.</P>
      <P>Senator Smith was right to point out that the most worrying thing in regard to this is the lack of emergence of a real initiative that will guarantee the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy and at the same time avoid the situation of other programmes in which Senators expressed an interest, such as regional and social policy, from going ahead in the manner in which they should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Ireland have a very real difficulty.  Senator Smith adverted to surpluses. With regard to the surplus of milk, <Col N="1116" /> it is not the small or medium dairy farmer in Ireland who is largely responsible for this.  It is the factory farmer of the Netherlands who has distorted the situation and on the basis of importing feeding stuff and factory type production has changed the agricultural structure and created this crisis.  A way must be found out of this.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan pointed out that the way forward in this regard has to be a cohesion &mdash; these are the words he used &mdash; cohesion plus individuality.  As in many other parts of the operation of the EC it is this balanced approach that is needed.  We were glad to hear in the Minister's contribution to this debate of the determination of the Government in this regard.  I should like to quote what he said in this connection.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs said:</P>
    <P>We must seek to ensure a fair standard of living for farmers, market unity, financial solidarity and Community preference.  Moreover, account must be taken of the need for the convergence of income levels between farmers in different parts of the community and for a reduction of the gap between farm and non-farm income.</P>
    <P>This is the basis of the Government's approach to this problem.  This point of reducing the present gap in income is an exceedingly important one.  In Community discussions there are many difficulties of communication not based on language because there is a very efficient interpretation system but based on differences of approach.  They are not extremely wide differences in ideological approach, such as Senator Ryan has suggested, but differences based on different levels of development.  The question of convergence is one area that brings up this difficulty.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan spoke of the problem of narrowing the gap between the richer and poorer countries but he used the words &ldquo;convergence of economics&rdquo;.  That is a dangerous type of language to use in this regard.  We must be clear when we <Col N="1117" /> are talking about problems of convergence within the Community that we are talking about convergence of living standards because to others in the Community if we talk about convergence or if we talk about convergence of economics, they mean the convergence of economic policies, they mean the adoption of common economic policies such as Senator Ryan mentioned.  I do not agree with the Senator in regard to his characterisation of some of those policies but apart from that issue we need to keep a degree of freedom in regard to economic policies because of the structure of our economy and because of our level of development.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan went on to talk of the advantages that would follow from the convergence of VAT rates and how this would ease the frontier problems in regard to goods.  We would like to look forward to the time when there could be a convergence of VAT rates throughout the Community but who in this country would be prepared for a convergence of VAT rates to take place in the next budget and to accept that tax rates on income, particularly on PAYE payers, that would result if our budget next year or any time during the next few years, was to adopt as a criterion the question of ensuring a rapid convergence of VAT rates with our partners?</P>
    <P>On the question of fisheries there were divergent views.  Senator Jim Higgins was concerned with congratulating the Minister on the manner in which he had defended the interests of our fishing industry during the negotiations.  Senator Ellis felt that our fishing industry was now in ruins because of what the Minister had not achieved.  In this, as in all negotiations, it is quite clear that we did not achieve everything that we would have liked for our own purposes but, on balance, we can say that the achievement of the Irish box in regard to fishing was a substantial achievement and while it was something for which we hoped, there were many times in the course of those negotiations while we might have hoped the expectation went fairly low.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> Senator Ellis talked about the depredations of some Spanish fishermen and suggested that the situation would become worse after the entry of Spain. He said there would be worse tricks by the Spaniards once they were inside.  I do not think that is necessarily true but even if the tricks remained at the same sort of level the important thing is that once they are in they are subject to discipline.  This is the great advantage of the European Community to the smaller countries such as Ireland.  If we were not a member of the Community, if we were still in the jungle situation of a small open economy trying to survive during the recession we have had for the past decade, we would be in a powerless condition.  It suits a country like Ireland, a small country with an open economy, that there should be rules, that there should be a referee to see that those rules are enforced.  This will be true in regard to the question of the operation of the fisheries policy after enlargement.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald and Senator Lanigan mentioned the question of development aid.  We all appreciate the contribution of Senator Bulbulia who dealt with this problem in some detail. We all agree with the emphasis which she laid on the importance of long term aid as the only way for Africa to save itself. Ultimately it will only be by the Africans taking accounts of this recurring situation of drought in their own planning, only when the African countries remove from their present policies their anti-rural and pro-urban bias, will there be hope of a long term solution.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan indicated that Europe had little to boast about whatever our individual position might be in regard to development aid.  While I would be inclined to agree that some members of the European Community still tend to follow a somewhat colonial attitude in regard to their aid and trade policy, it is unfair to some of our partners, notably such countries as the Netherlands, to think that we were a lone voice in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the question of European political co-operation, which the Minister dealt <Col N="1119" /> with at some length, Senator B. Ryan made the remark that the Community had disgraced itself over the question of South Africa and that the Irish Government has capitulated to racism.  Of course Senator B. Ryan also talked of the necessity to retain the veto and have no qualified majority voting.  I want to deal with the question of the veto and majority voting in the two quite separate areas of decisions on common action under the Treaties and decisions in regard to European political co-operation.  In regard to common action in the economic area under the Treaties, the failure of Europe to weather out the recession of the past number of years, as well as areas like the United States and Japan who have comparable populations, has been due to the paralysis of decision making in the Community, to the failure to complete the internal market, to co-ordinate industrial policy and technological development.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan is among those who say that Europe is a failure, that Europe's approach is wrong because of the high prevalence of unemployment.  The criticism is often made that, even now in Europe we are talking about institutional reform, we are talking about European union, when we should be talking about how to employ the young people.  When we talk about the reform of Europe, when we talk about a relaunch of Europe, we are talking about the only way to give stable employment to the younger people in the decades ahead.  If we go on as we have been going, whether under the present manner of operation of the Community, or going our separate way, there is no hope of even denting the problem of youth unemployment before the end of this century.  It is only if Europe reforms itself that Europe goes forward, that we have any hope of development.</P>
    <P>I want to turn from that necessary reform of which a key element is the question of decision making to the question of European political co-operation. European political co-operation acts on a consensus basis.  In the report of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee on institutional affairs in <Col N="1120" /> European union of which I was a member, recommendations in regard to European political co-operation do not disturb that position.  There is no suggestion in that report, which has formed the basis for the work of the present inter-governmental council, that majority voting should be brought into the areas of foreign policy.  That is the position at present.  That will be the position virtually certainly in a relaunched Community. That is the way we want it.  We do not want to be coerced in foreign policy matters by a majority of Community members.  We want to keep our own independent line.  We will seek consensus with our Community colleagues.  We will make every effort through consultation and discussion to seek consensus.</P>
    <P>In the end, if we do not agree we have the right and will continue to have the right, to maintain independent foreign policy.  We are proud of this.  We like to think of ourselves as a link between the ex-colonies and the western European countries, but we cannot cherish this independence and, at the same time, coerce the United Kingdom in regard to South Africa.  The fact that we have the residual power in regard to the issues on which we may differ from our European colleagues to go our own way means that we must also allow the United Kingdom to be, as we think, obdurate and wrong and unjust in regard to the question of South Africa.</P>
    <P>Of course we have the power to act independently of the Community.  I am proud of the attitude which our Government took in the Community discussions on South Africa in pushing the Community consensus to the extent that it was pushed and to reveal in that process the isolation of the United Kingdom in regard to its attitude to southern Africa, and also in regard to the problems of Central and South America.</P>
    <P>It is matter of pride to us that it was under our Presidency that the first formal meeting with the Contadora Group was held and that the Contadora process, which seemed in danger of petering out, was revived.  I do not believe that the Community, as a community, has disgraced <Col N="1121" /> itself over any issue in the foreign affairs field, in the field of foreign policy, during this period which we have been discussing.  Certainly our own Government have not in any way compromised their principles.  On the question of European union and the movement towards European union the Minister paid a good deal of attention in his speech to the work of the Inter-Governmental Conference which is now meeting and will report to the heads of Government in a few months concerning the movement towards a relaunched Community.  It is very valuable for us that the Minister should have given so much information in regard to this progress and I think all Senators must have been gratified at the Minister's statement in regard to the issues that were being brought forward by us at the Inter-Governmental Conference.</P>
    <P>In particular I would like to draw attention to what the Minister said in regard to this problem of convergence of living standards, with regard to the question of the various levels of regional development on which anxiety was expressed by a number of Senators in the course of the debate.  I quote from the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>In our approach to the Conference, we attach particular importance, as do some of our partners, to the need to give effective expression in a revised Treaty to the objective of increasing the economic cohesion of the Community, particularly through the reduction of differences in levels of regional development, and to providing for the necessary steps in this regard.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, tabled two complementary proposals in this area, one on regional policy and one on increasing the Community's economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>We will all appreciate that this is being done and congratulate the Minister on taking this attitude in the negotiations and wish him every success in persuading his colleagues that this is vital if we are to have a community of the type that the <Col N="1122" /> founding fathers of the European Community envisaged.</P>
    <P>Some Senators expressed worries about where these developments might lead.  Senator Lanigan thought there was a danger of a two speed Europe and also a danger of us being entangled in a military alliance and, indeed, worried about the position in regard to the veto.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan was worried that we would compromise ourselves that membership of the EC was in effect linked to NATO and spoke of the need for us to be able to exercise a veto in defence of a national interest.  I want to deal with that last part first.  Senator Ryan said we should be able to veto a proposal in defence of a national interest.  In other words, any national interest.  That way lies disaster.  That is what has happened to the Community.  That is not what is really involved and that is not what I attempted to defend in the <i>ad hoc</i> committee or that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is defending in the present negotiations. I want to make this distinction vitally clear, and vital is the correct word. It is proper that Ireland in any negotiations should ensure that we can defend a vital national interest.</P>
    <P>If we attempt and all of our partners attempted to defend every national interest, then there would never be any agreement about anything.  We must distinguish between the degree of cohesion that is needed for the Community to grow, for the Community in the world of today, in the world of the next decade, to be able to provide adequate and increasing living standards for all its citizens and for that we need a degree of cohesion in which we reach compromises between our national interests, confident that in doing so we will improve the economic performance of the Community so that by trading off one national interest against another in the end everybody will be better off.  That is what the whole Community is about.  But there do arise issues of vital, national interest where the issue is so important that exceptionally and hopefully only on rare occasions one or other member <Col N="1123" /> would say that interest is so vital that it cannot be agreed.</P>
    <P>In the work of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee a majority of the members of that committee sought to put a wording in the report which would indicate there should be a very large increase in majority voting. Far from agreeing to any abolition of the right to invoke a vital national interest on that committee I dissented from that wording even though it did not specifically preclude the pleading of a vital national interest.  I am quite convinced that in the discussions of the Foreign Ministers in the end no country will be prepared to say that there should be majority voting on each and every single issue.  Our rights in regard to vital national interests have been defended on the part of this country and will continue to be defended. But we should not slip into the error which Senator Brendan Ryan slipped into of saying that we must defend every national interest because that way lies chaos.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of a possible two speed Europe, again I think it is here necessary to make a distinction.  There was talk some years ago of a possible two speed Europe in which the original founding six might well move ahead of the others and that we would have two groups at a slower and a faster speed divided for all purposes into these two groups.  I do not believe that is a possibility at the moment but, on the other hand, there may well be a necessity for what has come to be called differentiation where, in regard to individual policies on an exceptional basis, there should be temporary derogation or a difference in pace, but to talk of differentiation in this way is not to accept the idea of a two-speed Europe for all purposes.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan was also concerned that any move towards European Union would result in our becoming involved in a military alliance.  Senator Brendan Ryan indicated that he did not think that either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael would defend Irish neutrality.  I want to say, as I have said before, we should be clear in regard to this position.  Our neutrality, together with the fact the other members <Col N="1124" /> are all members of a military alliance, is, of course, a matter that must give rise to some inconvenience and to some difficulty.</P>
    <P>There is no real pressure on us by our partners to change our position in this regard.  Far from it being indicated that it is essential for continued membership of the Community or membership of a new Community that we should be linked to NATO there is not even any attempt to say that it is highly desirable.  It is, of course, a matter of regret to our partners that we do not join them in defence matters, and, equally, it is a matter of regret to us if at any time through inadvertance they fail to realise exactly where the border lies between the political aspects of security, which are properly part of European political co-operation, and military matters, which certainly are not.</P>
    <P>From what has happened to date there would appear to be no further difficulty involved in what is being proposed at present.  It is quite clear that we would not be concerned or would not take part in any such activities which might be proposed, such as a meeting of Defence Ministers of the Community or meetings of Foreign Affairs Ministers and Defence Ministers together.  Equally, Denmark and Greece would not be prepared for any such development which, I may add, has not even been suggested.  It is for this reason that all the emphasis in regard to establishing what has been called a &ldquo;European pillar of NATO,&rdquo; has been discussed in the context of the Western European Union, which is also a defence alliance which very conveniently contains a number of members of the Community but not Ireland, Denmark or Greece. Every indication is that the enthusiasm of the particular individuals in some Community countries who wish to see a closer linkage is all directed to the Western European Union, which is no concern of ours.</P>
    <P>I wish, finally, to make a few comments in regard to the question of the present moves towards European Union.  Of course, greater integration in Europe leading possibly to eventual European Union does involve major political <Col N="1125" /> decisions in this country and for the other countries of the Community.  Therefore, it is essential that the deliberations and the conclusions of the inter-governmental conference and the decisions of the heads of Government should be characterised by imaginative political thinking.  I hope all the participants will avoid the temptation to adopt only the minimum proposed to them.  Such an approach could lead only to the establishment of a Community in which, as in the recent past, the individual interests of the member states predominated to the detriment of a balanced whole.</P>
    <P>The concept of European Union is something much more than this and it requires both courage and imagination from the European political leaders for the creation of a more dynamic Europe. It requires almost the same degree of courage and imagination as was shown by their predecessors when they drew up the Treaty of Rome which launched the Community initially.</P>
    <P>However, when I say we should avoid the temptation to be minimalist and avoid undue defence of individual interests, this does not mean that our negotiators or any other negotiators should neglect important national interests.  It is an immediate priority, as I have mentioned before, for Ireland in these negotiations to secure firm legal commitment to the objective of convergence of living standards, the closing of the disparity between the regional areas of the Community. It is generally acknowledged that the language of the Treaty of Rome, which mentions the need to reduce differences between the regions, has failed to produce effective measures by the Community in favour of the convergence of living standards.  This is one of the signal failures of the Community to date and must be remedied in any relaunching.</P>
    <P>The inter-governmental conference provides an ideal opportunity to have this objective, which was there in the Treaty of Rome, restated in a fashion that will ensure that effective action will flow from it.  Whether that is done in a treaty or on a non-treaty form it is essential that <Col N="1126" /> action must follow.  Accordingly, we in the Seanad should all welcome the Government's decision, as announced by the Minister, to submit to the conference a specific proposal to promote the economic cohesion of the Community by the strengthening of structural bonds.</P>
    <P>Of course this raises, as many other matters raise, the question of the amount of financial resources available to the Community.  While this might be considered as something apart from the subject matter of the Inter-Governmental Council, nevertheless, it is an essential part of the whole process.  We witnessed the continual wrangling about budget problems and about the increase in own resources.  Ultimately there was the agreement to increase the VAT rate, the Community base of its own resources, from 1 per cent to 1.4 per cent, with a further increase to 1.6 per cent in 1988.</P>
    <P>Even before this agreement has been ratified by all the members it is almost out of date.  In 1986, which will be the first year of the 1.4 per cent level, the estimated needs of the Community will be 1.38 per cent leaving absolutely no leeway at all for the Community to take further common action in the areas of regional policy, of the Social Fund, or of technological development.  We must be quite clear that any European union, which fails to tackle this problem of regional imbalance, is not likely to find favour among the Irish people or from any Irish Government.</P>
    <P>If there is to be an effective European union, there must be effective institutions and effective organs for that European union.  The role of each of the Community institutions must be more clearly defined, and their powers and decisions reinforced and, if necessary, extended or increased.  Probably more important than that is to find the new balance among the decision-making organs of the Community. In particular, we have supported giving further powers to the European Parliament.  This attitude has sometimes been criticised as if it involved some diminution of the powers of this House and of the other House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that it <Col N="1127" /> involves nothing of the sort.  It involves a redistribution inside the Community framework of powers that we have already transferred to the Community. What has been proposed in various fora in regard to increased powers to the European Parliament is a reallocation of powers between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  I believe this will give real meaning to the work of our directly elected Parliament and, even though our numbers within that Parliament are few, our vital interests will not be affected as long as within the Council of Ministers there is a retention for the invocation of a vital national interest.</P>
    <P>Equally, the powers of the Commission need to be increased.  Really, all we are talking about here is restoring the powers of the Commission to the role which was envisaged for it in the original Treaty of Rome.  Its authority, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Council of Ministers should be enhanced.  I will probably be expelled from the trade union of ex-Foreign Ministers for making this particular point, but I believe it is an essential one.  For a small country such as ourselves it is essential that we support the creation of a Commission that will have much more power of initiative, not merely the formal power of initiative itself, but a really effective informal power of initiative, a Commission that will have authority, be streamlined and be able to act and, if necessary, to act with audacity.</P>
    <P>This means, primarily, giving an enhanced role to the President of the Commission who should probably be appointed by the European Council, by the heads of Government and who should be allowed much more say in the selection of his Commissioners than happens at present.  If these things are done, then there is hope for Europe.  If we can reform ourselves in Europe in regard to our institutions and in regard to the question of decision-making, then we can turn the tide that has run against Europe strongly in recent years.  We will then be in a position to see Europe advance and we will be in a position to give real hope <Col N="1128" /> to the young people of Europe who have little cause for hope under these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points that were raised in the debate.  I am grateful to those Senators who took part in the debate.  I would like, on behalf of the Seanad, to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose schedule is indeed a busy one, for coming to the House and making a comprehensive statement.  It almost, but not quite, forgives the neglect of the Minister's Department in not providing us with the up to date report of developments in the EC which is required by its statute.  I understand that steps have been taken to remedy that situation and we hope that when we next have a general debate of this type, the matter will have been remedied.  I commend this motion to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies for this report and the work which they put into its compilation.  It is a very useful analysis of the conduct of the affairs of Irish Shipping Limited, the events which led to the liquidation of the company and the environment in which the disastrous decision which led eventually to the liquidation of the company were taken.  It seems to me that the committee, like myself, found it well nigh incomprehensible that a company as successful as Irish Shipping Limited could conduct its affairs so recklessly as to destroy itself.</P>
      <P>The committee has told us where it considers responsibility lay.  It has made a number of useful recommendations which are aimed at ensuring that such a disaster could not occur again.  Some of these reflect action already being taken by the Government and others have been taken on board by those Departments which deal with State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowhere does the report suggest that the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited was avoidable or that the Government should have poured more money into the company to keep it going.  That would only have added to the cost of the disaster. Indeed, developments in the shipping industry worldwide in the past year &mdash; the further decline in freight rates and the <Col N="1130" /> collapse of numerous shipping companies &mdash; have demonstrated the inevitability of the ISL liquidation.  For me, personally, the demise of Irish Shipping Limited was a matter of the greatest regret.  I fully appreciate the personal sense of loss and grievance which the employees of the company and their families feel.  I appreciate the hardships involved.  Given the facts of the situation, however, I believe that nobody in their sane senses could have recommended further financial assistance for the company.  The Government had no choice but to allow the liquidation to proceed.</P>
    <P>I think that it bears repeating here once again that, on the basis of advice from reputable international shipbrokers on the likely trend of freight rates over the period, the total cost to the Exchequer of keeping Irish Shipping Limited going for the five years to the end of 1989 would have been about £144.5 million.  Furthermore, even if the Exchequer had met this enormous bill, the company would still have had debts of £59 million at the end of 1989 and there were little grounds for expecting that it would be in a position to service these debts from its own resources.  So the estimated cost of not liquidating would have been £200 million. Put another way, it would have cost the Exchequer over £76,000 per job per year to maintain each job in Irish Shipping Limited until the end of 1989 with no real expectation that the company would be viable by that time.  It would have been socially indefensible to keep Irish Shipping Limited in operation at such a cost.</P>
    <P>I said that the figures which I have just quoted for the cost of keeping Irish Shipping going were based on advice from reputable international shipbrokers. That advice was obtained just over one year ago.  Unfortunately, the world freight market has continued to decline and the view then expressed has since been shown to be on the optimistic side.  It is now estimated that had Irish Shipping continued in operation its losses for the past year alone would have been of the order of £5 million more than the already unacceptable losses which were then anticipated.  A continuation of this trend <Col N="1131" /> would have increased the losses for the period to the end of 1989 to over £170 million and on overall cost of not liquidating of £220 million.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited is not the only company which has been affected by the world recession in shipping.  Many others, equally reputable, have faced serious financial problems and, in several cases, bankruptcy.  Low freight rates, the slump in the value of vessels and no prospect of market upturn have greatly increased the pressure on many shipowners worldwide.</P>
    <P>I want now to take a little time to set the record straight about the cost to the State of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited.  I want to do this in order to rescue those journalists who are floundering around in a mass of inaccurate and confused information.  The Bishop of Ferns, Dr. Comiskey, who referred recently to a crisis in Irish journalism, could not but have his views confirmed by the unfounded speculation which has been a feature of some recent articles on this matter, notably in two of our Sunday newspapers.  It would have been quite simple for the journalists concerned to have checked their facts but, apparently, they did not consider it necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>The liabilities accruing to the Exchequer from the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited are made up of approximately £36 million in respect of guarantees which the Minister for Finance had given in connection with loans raised by Irish Shipping Limited and, in addition, the Irish Shipping Limited liability in respect of the chartering of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> which fell to the Exchequer under a ministerial guarantee when the company was liquidated.  Three-quarters of the cost was being carried by the State already.  It is estimated that the total net cost of meeting the entire guarantee in respect of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> would be approximately £35 million of which about 25 per cent was Irish Shipping's liability. Under the financing arrangements for the construction of the vessel, half of the cost, which related to the financing of a subsidy to Verolme Cork Dockyard, was the responsibility of the Department of <Col N="1132" /> Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. The remaining 25 per cent of the cost is the responsibility of my Department's Vote in respect of a subsidy to Irish Shipping Limited towards the cost of the vessel.</P>
    <P>By virtue of an indemnity given to the owners of the vessel while its future was being considered by the Government the costs of the care and maintenance of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> while it has been berthed in Marseilles have been of the order of £125,000 per month.  These costs include port charges, victualling, etc. in addition to crewing costs.  The total amount expended by the Exchequer since the liquidation of the company, for the care and maintenance of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> and for Irish Shipping Limited's share of payments due, amounts in all to approximately £2 million.</P>
    <P>The final picture will not emerge for some time yet but it is clear that the total Exchequer liability to be assumed as a result of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited will be of the order of just under £50 million.  This represents a major additional burden for the Irish taxpayer but bears no resemblance to the figures quoted in the recent misleading articles and is, of course, a long way short of the liability which would have accured had we continued to support the company which is now estimated at a total of £200 to £220 million.</P>
    <P>As regards the <i>Irish Spruce</i> I should explain that this vessel was never owned by Irish Shipping; it was leased by the company from its owners, Jura Shipping Limited, and the lease payments were guaranteed by the Minister for Finance. The liabilities arising from the lease are guaranteed by the Minister for Finance and these are included in the estimate of £50 million which I have given.  The ultimate disposition of the <i>Irish Spruce</i>, is, I understand, being pursued urgently by its owners, Jura Shipping and its financiers.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Government decided that <i>ex gratia</i> pension payments formerly fixed by Irish Shipping Limited would be met from the Exchequer in respect of those Irish Shipping Limited <Col N="1133" /> pensioners who had served aboard Irish ships during the Second World War. These payments have already commenced. I am glad to be able to tell you that after further consideration of the matter the Government have decided to extend this concession to all the Irish Shipping Limited pensioners who had been in receipt of <i>ex gratia</i> pension payments from the company.  There are, in all, 25 additional pensioners involved and most of these are in the most deserving categories.  Provision had not been included in this year's Vote for my Department for the payment of these pensions.  It will, however, be provided in the 1986 Vote and payment will be made retrospectively.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to be able to tell you that it has been agreed with the Youth Employment Agency that the agency will continue to sponsor, on the same basis as the present arrangements with the liquidator, the training of the deck and engineer cadets who were formerly employed by Irish Shipping Limited and whose training was put at risk by the liquidation of the company.</P>
    <P>All of the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited who have made application for statutory redundancy payments have received their redundancy and other statutory entitlements from the Department of Labour.  The cost of the statutory payments to date is approximately £0.5 million and I understand that this represents the bulk of the payments to be made.  As regards the question of extra-statutory redundancy payments, the Government have re-examined the situation in great detail and with the utmost sympathy for those affected. Despite a great deal of heart-searching, it has not been found possible to overcome the legal and other constraints which stand in the way of extending such assistance.  We have examined the matter from every possible aspect and no resolution of the problem has been thought of which does not have major adverse implications for the State.  I am sorry to have to say that I do not see any way out of this unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the recommendations <Col N="1134" /> of the joint committee which cover a wide range of concerns relating to the monitoring of the activities of State-sponsored bodies.  The Government some time ago initiated a review of the procedures whereby commercial State-sponsored bodies are monitored.  To improve the two-way process of information and appraisal, State sponsored companies are now required to submit to their parent Department rolling corporate five-year plans (including forecast profit and loss account, balance sheet, working capital, cash flow statements, source and uses of funds), with underlying assumptions specified together with analysis of sensitivity of assumptions to market change, etc. State bodies must also submit medium term capital investment plans and individual projects involving significant investment must be appraised according to set criteria.  I have also instituted an arrangement for quarterly, and in some cases monthly, financial reports indicating how each body under my aegis is performing against target as regards revenue, expenditure, cash flow and balance sheet for each main business area.  The trends emerging from these reports and the major policy issues facing the company are the subject of regular meetings between myself and the chairman and are the subject of meetings with the full board at least twice a year.</P>
    <P>We must, of course, strike a balance between the need for State bodies to operate effectively in a commercial environment and the need for adequate reporting and monitoring arrangements to safeguard the public interest.  It would be wrong to over-react to the Irish Shipping disaster.  It would be equally wrong to ignore the painful lessons of that experience.  I believe that I have got the balance about right.</P>
    <P>Recently, I received the report of the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements which I set up some time ago to investigate and report on our current and future strategic needs and how these should be secured.  When I announced the setting up of the committee to Dáil Éireann last June, I put the strategic fleet question in the context of <Col N="1135" /> recent world developments in shipping, the present state of the Irish shipping industry and the country's present and anticipated economic requirements.  I will shortly be submitting the report of the committee to the Government with my recommendations.</P>
    <P>The demise of Irish Shipping Limited did not mean the end of the Irish merchant shipping industry.  The other State-owned shipping company &mdash; the B &amp; I &mdash; is in the throes of reorganisation and revitalisation with the aim of achieving profitable operation and providing a better service for the public.  The private sector of the Irish merchant shipping industry has shown some resilience in the face of the serious problems faced by the industry generally.  On another occasion I have suggested that we might get away from the idea that a national asset like a strategic merchant fleet must be solely in State ownership; that, perhaps apart from the future State role, we should look outside the strict ambit of the state sector for a contribution to the resuscitation of our national maritime status and well-being and that the State's role should perhaps include that of facilitator, creating the right environment for others.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be publishing a Green Paper on transport policy generally including shipping policy.  That Green Paper will include the principal conclusions and recommendations of the Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements.  In the meantime, I can say that subject to the constraints of public finance and other priorities it is a policy objective of the Government to maintain an efficient and effective Irish shipping industry appropriate to our island status and capable of meeting the needs of overseas trade and tourism.</P>

      <P>I would like to begin my very brief contribution by paying tribute to the members of the committee for this very comprehensive report extending as it does to 102 pages.  It is an area with which I am not very familiar.  It deals in some cases with company matters in very <Col N="1136" /> great detail.  I will deal with them in a very general sense in my contribution to this motion.</P>
      <P>We are an island nation.  It is generally conceded that historically we have found and learned the hard way that no other country will do our work for us; we can only depend on ourselves.  Irish Shipping Limited were established in March 1981 to ensure the availability of vital supplies during the Second World War.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, in 1941.  Under difficult war conditions they did an excellent job.  My party are committed to having a commercially viable deep sea fleet.  The Government made a mistake in appointing a liquidator to Irish Shipping Limited.  In effect it meant the end of Irish Shipping Limited.  It has been stated by those in a better position to know than I, that appointing a receiver or an administrator would have been a better proposition, as was done in the case of the PMPA.  Nobody is denying that the situation was very serious.  Never before were there such difficult trading conditions in the deep sea transport area. The charter rates were very low and had been low for some time.</P>
      <P>The major criticism of Irish Shipping Limited is with regard to their charter arrangements.  They got out of hand completely. There was no communication apparently with the Government.  There is no evidence that there was a marketing analysis.  The Minister said that recent publicity and reports in the media contain speculation that is unfounded but there is an article in the October edition of <i>Irish Business</i> which is very factual and very fair.  It states, in regard to this particular area, under &ldquo;Political Medley:&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But what about the role of the Government which was, after all, the shareholder in Irish Shipping?  What authority did it exercise in the affairs of the company?  It is sufficient to say that in the all-important area of chartering vessels, the management and <Col N="1137" /> board of Irish Shipping was left entirely to its own devices.  The Government only exercised tight control on capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>That is indefensible.  In effect, it was something along the lines of what happened a few years ago when the price of land went our of control; farmers kept out-bidding one another until the price rose to £4,000 per acre.  There was no looking to the future.  Indeed, the banks encouraged them to do that.  It was a similar situation with regard to Irish Shipping. There was nobody with the foresight to realise that such conditions would not continue and to make the necessary arrangements.  Pages 7 and 8 of the report deal with these matters, page 7 specifically. The report on page 6, paragraph 9 states:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee was informed that the strategic fleet requirement established in 1963 had not been reviewed formally since that time.  It questions the relevance of such a requirement in the absence of formal reviews.  It believes that it was unreasonable to expect the company to operate to an objective which had not been reviewed over a 21 year period.  In the light of this disclosure the Joint Committee recommends that every commercial State-sponsored body be obliged to carry out a review of its objectives every three years and that a statement of these objectives be incorporated in its annual report and accounts.</P>
    <P>I think that is sensible.  What is described is something that could not have taken place in a private company or in interests outside the State.  On page 7, paragraph 11 it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee deplores the fact that the Board of directors of Irish-Shipping did not inform the Department of Transport until September, 1982, of the details of the substantial chartered in contracts entered into by the company on its own behalf and in conjunction with Celtic Bulk Carriers <Col N="1138" /> between September, 1979, and July, 1981, notwithstanding the fact that two Bills to accommodate the purchase of the Irish Spruce (i.e. the Irish Shipping (Amendment) Act 1980 and The Irish Shipping Limited Act, 1982) had been enacted during that period.  The Joint Committee concludes that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the absence of this information left the Minister and Members of the Houses at a severe disadvantage when enacting the legislation;</P>
    <P>(b)  failure to inform the Minister of the situation should have merited a request for the resignation of the Chairman and the Board of directors of the company,</P>
    <P>(c)  independent assessors should have been appointed to report on the financial situation of the company as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>There is no question whatever that the major problems of the board arose through the chartering arrangements. Problems have arisen in the transport area with regard to coal, steel and timber in the world market.  There is the position with regard to the <i>Irish Spruce</i>, which as the Minister stated, was not owned by the board but was leased by the Department of Finance.  Could this ship not be used to bring coal to Moneypoint?  Has the Minister considered this?</P>
    <P>The nation was proud of Irish Shipping. It is most extraordinary that a developing country, such as Ireland an island country has no maritime fleet.  Irish Shipping were one of the most successful of all the State-owned companies.  The nation's pride, independence and self-confidence were put under threat as never before since the foundation of the State. There must have been considerable international embarrassment when Irish vessels flying the Irish flag, crewed by Irish people, were arrested abroad and impounded in foreign ports.  Inevitably it must have resulted in a weakening of our commercial independence and an erosion of our international prestige and credibility abroad.  Nobody will deny that the Minister was faced with a serious problem. But less extreme alternatives should <Col N="1139" /> have been considered before abandoing our national interest on the international stage.</P>
    <P>The liquidation of Irish Shipping, which was owned by the Government, means, effectively, that the Government have reneged publicly on their debts and commitments.  This must have very damaging implications for the creditworthiness of the State.  The liquidation will have very serious effects on the commercial operations and the raising of finance abroad by major State companies, such as the ESB, B &amp; I and Aer Lingus.  They have earned a very high credit rating abroad.  I understand that this is the first time since the foundation of the State that such a thing has happened.  It marks a new low in the running of the nation's business.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to personnel and the problems that were encountered in that regard.  The staff were stranded in foreign ports, left high and dry, and their employment prospects were brought to an end.  I believe there was a considerable number serving apprenticeships.  Their families were affected in very large numbers.  The report, on page 42, pays tribute to the employees of Irish Shipping Limited and I quote:</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee acknowledges the excellent industrial relations that existed in the company.  It considers that (1) the Government should make resources available to former employees of the company to find alternative employment; that (2) <i>ex gratia</i> pension payments should be restored fully in all cases, and (3) that arrangements should be made to enable trainees to obtain the necessary sea-time experience.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the decision of the Government to extend <i>ex gratia</i> payments formerly fixed by Irish Shipping Limited.  These will be met by the Exchequer. There will be a further extension involving about 25 additional pensioners. I think this is inadequate.  The committee asked that <i>ex gratia</i> pension payments be restored fully in all cases.  I would ask the Minister if this is being done, or can it be <Col N="1140" /> done, or will it be done?  Were resources made available to former employees of the company to find alternative employment? If not, will that be done?  Is it the intention of the Government to do that?</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that it was a sad day for this country when we had the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited. Most people would agree that something had to be done, but perhaps more finance would have to be made available.  I believe that some imaginative scheme could have been found to preserve our maritime fleet, to preserve our dignity and to put us in a position where, when things pick up on the international market, we could extend the fleet.</P>
    <P>I believe that a major mistake was made in the liquidation of the company. It is a mistake from which it will be very difficult to recover.  It will be difficult certainly for the employees, trusted personnel and skilled operators who were involved.  They formed the team which the board had built up since 1941.  It will be difficult from every conceivable point &mdash; from the employment point of view, from the point of view of depending on other nations in times of scarcity and, indeed, at all times.  I must come to the conclusion &mdash; and commentators have come to this conclusion &mdash; that an alternative way could have been found to deal with this problem without the drastic one of liquidation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity of speaking on this report of the Joint Committee on Commercial Semi-State Bodies and to comment on the short time that the committee took to bring this report before us and the indepth discussions they have had on the entire problem.  It is a good and thorough investigation of the problem.  I am glad that the Minister in his speech, for which the House must surely be grateful, has told us that he is meeting most, if not all, of the recommendations of the joint committee, especially the ones dealing with pensions.  I want to compliment the Government on their decision to continue the pensions of the people who have served that company through difficult <Col N="1141" /> periods, but through better periods for the company.</P>
      <P>The Government took a very courageous step in this whole affair.  One thing that makes me think deeply is that the employees of semi-State companies and the boards of semi-State companies for the last 60 years have considered themselves as being untouchable.  The vast majority of them have been living on backs of the taxpayer, very happily, year in and year out.  It took a disaster of the magnitude of the Irish Shipping fiasco to force any Government to tackle the problem realistically.  No one in his right senses, having regard to the level of taxation in this country, can stand up and clearly say that the Government, or any Government of the day, in the situation of our economy, can contemplate or even think of subsidising jobs in any sector of the community to the extent of £76,000 per year.  Not only that, but I feel that the management that allowed a situation to sink to those depths certainly should not be getting pensions.  They should be at the State's pleasure in Mountjoy or some such situation.  There are people in jail for embezzling.  I am not suggesting that any of the Irish Shipping people embezzled anything, but mismanagement must be looked upon as an offence.</P>
      <P>It is all right to say that there was a downward turn in international shipping and in the trade itself, but surely a big company such as the one we are discussing pay somebody to do projections into the future to look at the market, to be able to evaluate the direction in which the international market is going.  I would expect that that would be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know everybody in the country regrets that we have, as a nation, suffered a severe blow to our pride in saying that one of our semi-State organisations of the size and magnitude of Irish Shipping should have had to go under.  Nevertheless, we must be realistic.  If we cannot afford it, there is certainly no reason why we should have it.  I believe that the Government took a courageous step on behalf of the taxpayer and for that we must be grateful.  At the same time the <Col N="1142" /> plight of the unfortunate people who have given the best years of their lives in the service of Irish Shipping and, indirectly, in the service of the State and who have lost their jobs, is something that we genuinely regret.  It should be possible in a survey or an investigation to be able to pin down the responsibility on the people who made the decisions that have proved to be so disastrous.  I would hope, at the very least, while we accept that it has been an expensive and costly lesson in the end for the taxpayer, that the Government will learn from that decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on the problem with the B &amp; I.  There is no doubt that we must have some links with the outside world over which we have control. During the number of years in the seventies in which I was President of the Transport Commission I availed of the opportunity to travel on every one of the services within the Community of Nine, as it was then.  I looked on the B &amp; I as being &mdash; and even last month when I had occasion to use the service a number of times &mdash; one which certainly gives a top class service.  I was speaking to the Master of the <i>M. V. Connacht</i> on the last trip which I made, and he told me that they were full to capacity right throughout the season that has just passed.  Even if there is a problem in B &amp; I, I think they give a good service.</P>
    <P>From speaking to European tourists, such as Germans and French people, I feel that it more than favourably compares with anything in other regions in Europe.  From my point of view, any deficiency is no fault of the people who are actually working on the ferries.  The problem must be with management and with administration.  Whatever steps the Government and the company are taking now to rectify the situation should be urgently taken so that the company can be restructured if it needs to be.  We certainly must have a service.  That part of transport is very important to the economy of the State.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention to the Minister the weakness of the transport policy within the Community.  If one <Col N="1143" /> looks at the Treaty of Rome &mdash; and it is very relevant to this debate &mdash; one will notice that in the original Treaty there is the aspiration of a transport policy.  If we think of the regional policy, the idea is that there should be an equalisation between the richer regions of Europe and the poorer regions.  That is not possible unless there is an equalisation in the costings of transporting the produce from the peripheral regions into the central, valuable market places in Europe.  For 20 years now we have not had sufficient momentum in the evolution of a transport policy.  This is one of the areas that would greatly enhance, support and facilitate the producers in this country, and not just agricultural producers but the producers of manufactured consumer products.</P>
    <P>We have possibly the most expensive stretches of channel between this country and Europe, no matter which way one turns.  There should be a policy which would put our producers on a footing with those in Central Europe.  That is what the Treaty of Rome sets down very clearly.  Nothing has been done about that.  I hope that, having regard to the problems he has experienced this year, when the Minister goes as a member of the Council of Ministers, he will see the value of giving our country a fair crack of the whip through the medium of a transport policy.  People have been talking about that for 25 or 26 years and yet there is very, very little progress on the entire problem.  It is nonsense to expect huge improvements in the economy of the poorer regions, if going hand in hand with the regional policy there is not an input, having regard to the difficulties both timewise and cost-wise to transporting the produce from the less prosperous regions.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his very forthright and revealing speech.  He has set out the problems of the sector very clearly to the House this afternoon.  As far as I am concerned, I would be very supportive of the Minister taking whatever measures are necessary in order to ensure that, first of all, justice <Col N="1144" /> is done to the pensioners of Irish Shipping. I compliment the Minister and the Government on the decision they have taken, but on the problem of the B &amp; I company I would hope that the Government would take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the continuation of this service.</P>
    <P>If the ferries are working to full capacity on the service, then there is something wrong if they are losing so much money.  If one looks at the ferries going from the south of England to Belgium or, indeed, any of the ferries operating on the straits in other regions of the community, as far as I can see none of them is in the category of losing as much money as this service.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to look urgently at the management structure of the B &amp; I company.  I would even go as far as to suggest that he should talk to the masters and the pursers of the ferries who are putting their backs into the job.  These are the senior people on the ships.  There must be some way of tackling the problem because the people who are giving dedicated service are giving very courteous and efficient service and it is possible that they would have a very worthwhile input to point to the solution of this mysterious problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Members of the House in congratulating the Oireachtas joint committee on the production of this report.  I want to put it on record that it is a sad day when a Minister has to come into this House to defend and justify the action taken by the Government with regard to Irish Shipping. The Minister puts it in a nutshell when he says:</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the committee, like myself, found it well nigh incomprehensible that a company as successful as Irish Shipping Limited could conduct its affairs so recklessly as to destroy itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The kernel of the problem is here, especially with regard to the chartering of certain ships.  There is a lesson to be learned there, a lesson for all time.  We <Col N="1145" /> have had major blunders in recent times, such as the Bula Mines saga.  The lessons to be learnt from both Bula and Irish Shipping should be taken note of.  Irish Shipping Limited were formed during the war years, in 1941 to ensure for the people of Ireland that the vital supplies, so badly needed at that time for our survival, were delivered by the fleet.  Perhaps enough tribute was not paid to Irish Shipping and to our shipping fleet at that time and after the war.  It can be recorded at this late stage.  They were formed in a time of war, in a time of great danger to ships and to crews.  Surely as a major shareholder in a company who, as the Minister stated, conducted their affairs so recklessly, the blame rests on the Government and on the Minister, as much as on Irish Shipping Limited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I am blaming all Governments.  It is the duty of the Government and the Minister to see that they are kept informed of any major decisions, the capital involved, and the value for money.  The liquidation of Irish Shipping has left a sour taste in many people's mouths.  The sudden decision taken by the Government shocked the nation.  Ships were impounded in foreign ports and crews domiciled in foreign countries apparently without clear regard for the crews or their families.  It was a poor reward for services rendered to the country.  Major decisions such as these can have repercussions in years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was young I saw the railway stations in Clones and Oldcastle, which were terminals, closed down by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Many people objected at that time.  The railway lines were lifted and the stations sold off for practically nothing.  Those towns were turned into ghost towns.  They have never recovered since.  Having regard to the state of the roads in the country, the heavy traffic, and the amount of money now needed to bring them into a proper state of repair <Col N="1146" /> to carry the traffic, it was a wrong decision to close the railway lines at that time.  Maybe now if the money was available those lines could be re-opened, but they are gone.  The decision to close the railway lines was wrong.  Such a decision saps the life blood of any area.  Any decision like that should not be taken lightly and should not be taken as a shortsighted measure.  No matter what justification there seems to be for immediate liquidation of Irish Shipping, events have proved since that the cost of liquidation was very heavy on the taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator McDonald.  I would have to say to Senator Lynch that I am in agreement with him about the railway lines.  Irish Shipping were the responsibility of the Government and the Minister, but what the Senator did not say was that Fianna Fáil were the party in power at the time. If the Senator wants to blame anybody, the blame lies with his own party.</P>
      <P>As regards the railway lines the Fianna Fáil party were the greatest offenders. The railway line from Listowel to Ballybunion was closed under a Fianna Fáil Government.  If that was there today, it would be a very valuable asset to tourism. The railway line in South Kerry from Tralee to Cahirciveen was closed down by the late Erskine Childers, who was then Minister for Transport and Power. The Minister was in Killarney opening the second phase of the Torc Hotel at the weekend and, on the following Monday, he closed the line from Tralee to Cahirciveen. He gave guarantees at the time that Cahirciveen people would still have the service of transport through the bus services from Cahirciveen to Tralee at a reasonable rate and would have a frequent service.  They had it for a short time at a reasonable rate, but they then finished up with one bus a day from Cahirciveen to Tralee.  Subsequent to that &mdash; I do not know if it was an EC regulation but it was brought in when Deputy Peter Barry was Minister &mdash; when a railway station is closed down the lines have to remain for ten years.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Senators for contributing to the debate and briefly deal with some of the points raised.  The points made by Senator Fitzsimons and Senator Lynch that we should have avoided liquidation does not bear thinking about.  The Government made every possible effort to avoid liquidation.  We looked at every other possibility before liquidation, but there was no alternative.</P>
      <P>In my opening speech I have given the figures.  The estimated figures a year ago to keep Irish Shipping going showed that it would have cost, over five years, £200 million.  We can now revise that upwards to about £220 million because of the further decline in deep sea trans-shipping rates.  That would have been the cost of keeping the company going.  There have been in this House, and in the other House, ill-advised, baseless suggestions about appointing receivers or administrators. That illustrates how unresearched the contributions from the Opposition have been.  The circumstances in which a receiver can be appointed to a company are well known in company law and in company practice. A receiver can be appointed only by a debenture holder.  There were no debenture holders in the case of Irish Shipping.</P>

    <P>What happened was that a provisional liquidator was appointed not by the Government but by the High Court, at the initiative of the board of Irish Shipping. The Government did not decide on liquidation.  It was decided by Irish Shipping.  The Government decided that they could not make any further financial <Col N="1148" /> commitment to Irish Shipping.  The provisional liquidator had the same status and powers as a receiver.  If there was any possibility of re-negotiating the charters or coming up with a package to salvage Irish Shipping it could have been done at the time of the provisional liquidation. That was impossible once the provisional liquidation was made official.  I want to dispel once and for all this idea that we could have appointed a receiver and that somehow there might have been a way out of the problem.  That is not the case.  The provisional liquidator could have done anything a receiver could have done to salvage but as we fully expected that was not possible.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the point made by Senator Fitzsimons that Fianna Fáil are committed to recreating a commercial deep sea shipping fleet.  What does he mean by that?  This has been stated in the other House as well.  The Government are committed to having a deep-sea shipping fleet but we are not committed to spending millions and millions of taxpayers' money on something that we were able to have for years and years without involving the taxpayer.  The taxpayer is already far too heavily taxed in Ireland.  It should be possible in the years to come to recreate a deep sea shipping fleet.  It does not have to be necessarily a State owned shipping fleet or a fleet set up with the State's money although that is always a possibility.  It is a possibility that it would be done that way or that it would be done partly that way.  I do not exclude it but the circumstances would have to be right and the call on the taxpayer would have to be nil or minimum. I believe we can have a deep sea shipping fleet again, we should have a deep sea shipping fleet again but it should not necessarily involve a call on the taxpayer. Senator Fitzsimons also referred to criticism of the Government in <i>Irish Business</i> in that they had no control of chartering. That is an accurate criticism.  The only difficulty I have about what Senator Fitzsimons said is that he implied that the article in <i>Irish Business</i> was a criticism of this Government and of me whereas the criticism applies to the Government of <Col N="1149" /> the day which was his own Government back in 1979/81.  That applies equally to what Senator Lynch said and to which Senator Daly referred.  I have taken a lot of abuse over this whole episode because I did my duty.  I do not mind doing that. I have avoided making political capital out of it, I have avoided bringing party politics into it but if the members of the Opposition are determined to blame the Government so be it, but I have to remind them that it was their Government who were in power in 1979 to 1981 when all this happened.  I would make a further point that this awful development in Irish Shipping's otherwise very praiseworthy history took place during that very period in Irish politics 1979/81 when this country was ruined economically with the whole spend, spend, spend environment which has us in the economic mess we are in today.  This whole problem also arose at that awful time in Irish political history.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons asked why the resignation of the chairman and the board was not requested.  In relation to the board there was little point in asking the board to resign when it was a new board. Almost all of the board at the time of the disastrous decisions had already left the board so there was little point in asking a new board to resign.  It is true that the chairman was still there having been chief executive at the relevant time; he is now chairman.  That was considered but it was felt that the first thing we had to do when the extent of the problem became evident was to try to rescue the situation and that we would not change captains in the middle of the storm but consider the situation as soon as we got it somewhat under control.  Ultimately the chairman's resignation was requested.  As is known a settlement was made with him.  I can tell the House that I was dragged screaming and roaring to the table of that settlement but the legal advice was that that course was the least disadvantageous one available to us to avoid all sorts of litigation in the courts in the midst of this awful problem of Irish Shipping.  I was most reluctantly drawn into that agreement. We did it because it was the least disadvantageous course and we did it in <Col N="1150" /> the belief that there was still some hope of retrieving the Irish Shipping situation but sadly it quickly became evident that that was not to be.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons also asked could Irish Shipping not be used to carry coal to Moneypoint and whether this has been considered?  Every aspect of this matter has been considered.  It should be repeated that the <i>Irish Spruce</i> is not our property.  It belongs to Jura Shipping Limited and its financiers.  Its ultimate fate depends on those.  There are all sorts of other legal and operational problems involving our continued ownership and operating of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> because of the background.  I hope that before too long now the future of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> will be clarified.</P>

      <P>The less extreme alternative should have been considered by the Minister, Senator Fitzsimons suggested. Does anyone in this House seriously think that less extreme measures or alternatives were not considered.  Of course every possible alternative was considered, high up and low down from top to bottom in the greatest of detail, morning noon and night, Sunday and Monday, to try to avoid this awful decision but in the end it was clear that there was no alternative.  As every day goes by it is clearer that there was no alternative because the costs are mounting as deep sea shipping rates continue to decline to lower and lower figures. Since Irish Shipping several other very reputable and big shipping companies have gone in the same way, for example Reardon Smith in Wales, Sanko, a very big shipping company in Japan and also a Portuguese national shipping company. There was simply no alternative.  If anyone thinks that we would have been wise spending £220 million to maintain a shipping fleet which in the main consisted of ageing ships which would have had to be replaced anyway I honestly do not know how they could account for that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Every other option was considered.  I can assure the Senator that no other option was feasible or possible. The cost in this case made it prohibitive. There was no alternative.  I want to emphasise that.  Because there was no alternative we were forced to this decision and to face the enormity of it and to face all the terrible sadness that has been inflicted on the workforce of that company who deserved a better fate. It is my sadness that legal and other constraints have prevented us from being of any assistance to them.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzsimons also said the liquidation means that the Government have reneged on its commitments, and that this will affect its creditworthiness and so on.  The Government have not reneged on their commitments, and never will renege on their commitments.  The Government will always meet their debts.  They will always meet debts incurred by them and with their authority. I would hate to think that Members of this House would advocate the principle that the Government of Ireland should be forced to pick up the tab for any reckless or unauthorised decision taken by executives, never mind boards of any of our State companies.  If you think of the potential indications of that, that any executive of any State company, could commit their company without authority to all sorts of liability and in the end the Exchequer or the taxpayer would have to pick up the tab, that is not what democratic control means and it is not what responsibility means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons was not absolutely clear on the announcement on pensions. The fact is that all pensioners, all people who were on pension from Irish Shipping on the day of liquidation who were in receipt of <i>ex gratia</i> payments will now have those <i>ex gratia</i> payments restored to them by the Exchequer and they will be restored retrospectively.  A provision will be made in the 1986 Estimates so that payment hopefully can be made early in 1986, the previous level of pensions being <Col N="1152" /> restored and the retrospection paid.  This has already been done in the case of those with service during the World War.</P>
    <P>There was one final point made by Senator Lynch and that was the suddenness of the decision.  He said that having crew members stranded abroad was not good enough and so on.  A liquidation is not something that is broadcast in advance because if it were there would be the very severe danger, indeed the likelihood, of a stampede of creditors to pre-empt the equitable distribution of the assets.  That is usually what happens if strong speculation about liquidation takes place.  Of course if liquidation is to take place it has to be done quickly and immediately to prevent that.  If we had taken any pre-emptive steps to relocate the fleet or bring the fleet home etc. that in itself could have been adduced as evidence in the courts of our acting improperly and acting pre-emptively to the potential disadvantage of some of the creditors and that would be called fraudulent preference and could have brought us into liability for all the liabilities of the company and these are all very sensitive areas of bankruptcy law which influence the timing and nature of the decision.</P>
    <P>This episode is a cause of great sadness to the Government and of great sadness to me personally but I have to repeat that this was a decision to which there was absolutely no alternative.</P>

    <Title>Report of Ombudsman: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Annual Report of the Ombudsman for the year ended 31st December, 1984.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator McGonagle.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a brief contribution on this motion <Col N="1153" /> regarding the Report of the Ombudsman. I should start like other Senators in paying a great tribute to Mr. Mills.  When the Bill came before this House to appoint Mr. Mills it was received with great enthusiasm.  The feelings of Members of that time could be expressed in the title of one of Charles Dickens great novels <i>Great Expectations</i> both with regard to the Ombudsman and to the person who was selected to fill the position of the Ombudsman.  Often our expectations are dashed or things may not reach the heights we would hope for but in this case there is no question but that our greatest expectations have been fulfilled by Mr. Mills.  He is a man of great enthusiasm, ability and concern.</P>
      <P>The authorised investigative staff in 1984 comprised of one director, one senior investigator and four investigators. The full complement of four investigators have only been appointed since August. Taking that into consideration the report is a very full one.  In terms of reports as they come before the House the volume is rather slim.  Indeed it would be much slimmer if it were not for the selected cases which were included.  I have no doubt that in future years we will have much larger volumes.  It would be nice to think that they will get smaller and that the work of the Ombudsman will decrease but I am afraid the situation in other countries and the situation as it is here points to the fact that the Ombudsman will have a very difficult job and an increasing role.  Indeed, placed in a central position as he is, I think representations could be made to have officers distributed around the country and make accessibility easier.  Perhaps officers of this type could be members of local authorities or other bodies who would fulfil this function part time.</P>
      <P>In the report the Ombudsman referred to delays on page 22.  He said that these were a matter of serious complaint.  It is heartening to see from the report that the major concern of the Ombudsman is to ensure that complaints will be dealt with in his office as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" /> The Minister in his introductory speech stated:</P>
    <P>Going on the experience of ombudsmen abroad it can be expected that a fair proportion of investigations will show that the administrative actions complained about were fair and reasonable in the circumstances.  This is borne out by the statistics in the report which show that quite a number of complaints were not upheld.</P>
    <P>This may very well be so, but a considerable number of complaints were upheld. I think the emphasis could equally be placed on this.  The number of complaints received was 2,267.  Within the jurisdiction there were 1,544 leaving 723 outside the jurisdiction.  It would be proper to make a plea that the jurisdication of the Ombudsman should be extended into other areas.  The Minister has referred to this and he has referred to the financial position which makes it difficult.  Nevertheless, it is unfortunate that people in other areas which are not included within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman should have to suffer because of this.  I can think of other areas.  One of them is the vocational education area.  This is not an area that is included within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman.  It is a very important area and it should be considered as well as many other areas.</P>
    <P>The number of complaints completed amounted to 1,013; 400 of these were resolved; assistance was provided in 148 cases; 294 were not upheld and 171 were discontinued or withdrawn.  The Minister has given us reasons why some of these were discontinued or withdrawn.  They may have been dealt with or people may have been made to realise that they had not a legitimate complaint.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we discuss the Ombudsman's report in this House because while the Ombudsman cannot impose his findings on the public service he has the authority and the duty to bring his findings and recommendations to the Oireachtas.  In this area it is most important and particularly in the area where the Ombudsman might not be able to get satisfaction because, as has been pointed <Col N="1155" /> out by the Minister, no authority would care to have its case in that situation discussed in this House.  It is interesting to see the reference to the complaints from former civil servants and to see the situation where they are on the other side of the counter so to speak.  By and large we cannot complain about the way we are treated by our civil servants.  We are proud of them.  Perhaps in some instances there may be cause for complaint but it is interesting to see that reference.</P>
    <P>Another important area of the report is the suggested review of legislation in particular areas.  On page 13 the report states under social insurance:</P>
    <P>It is inequitable that persons who had paid more for social insurance stamps should get less benefits then those who paid less because the deciding factor was the number of years from their first contribution after 1953.</P>
    <P>This is further developed on page 18 where it states:</P>
    <P>. . . how frustrating it must have been for certain applicants for Old Age Contributory Pension to learn that if they had paid less contributions during their working lives they would have qualified.  There is an inherent inequity in any system which treats those who have paid fewer contributions more favourably than those who have paid more.</P>
    <P>This is self-evident.  It is extraordinary that it has taken the Ombudsman to point out this anomaly and to have it corrected. Surely it is something that should have been obvious and must have been the subject of many complaints over the years.  It is extraordinary that it is only when the complaints have been taken up by the Ombudsman and recommendations made for review that this matter will be considered.</P>
    <P>The law of domicile is something about which I have heard complaints many times in this House.  The domicile of a wife is that of her husband even where they are estranged or living apart and even perhaps where the husband is living in a different country.  This is wrong and <Col N="1156" /> surely should have been attended to before now.  Also with regard to the deserted husband there is the anomaly whereby a deserted wife in particular circumstances would receive about £20 per week more than a husband under the same conditions.  This is an anomaly which should have been obvious.  It should have been corrected without having to be brought forward by the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>There is the tax anomaly where a widow with a child is receiving an annual income above a comparatively low level from an insurance company and the mother is not able to claim from the Revenue Commissioners either the child allowance of £100 or the personal allowance of £1,300 as a single parent.  This is an area about which many complaints were made.  Something should have been done before now.</P>
    <P>In relation to trade disputes the report states that under the provisions of social welfare legislation persons who do not stand to gain materially from a strike by fellow workers can still be prevented from obtaining unemployment benefits if they are regarded as being members of the same grade or class.  Complaints have been made in this regard and nothing has been done.  I am glad to see from the Minister's report that in all these areas something will be done.</P>
    <P>It also seems inequitable and wrong that payment is delayed particularly for a long time and that no allowance is made for increases in costs or devaluation in currency.  I was very interested in Senator McGonagle's contribution where he pointed out that the Ombudsman had the power to make a recommendation for an <i>ex gratia</i> payment in those circumstances. I am sure this will be done.  It was one of the many interesting facets of Senator McGonagle's contribution and the fact that he has been an Ombudsman in the North made it all the more interesting.</P>
    <P>The valuation of property, where this could take place when a person was abroad, for example, is another area where something should have been done before now.  I presume that antiquated <Col N="1157" /> law referred to is the 1898 Local Government Act.  It seems extraordinary that an Act that is almost a century old should still be enforced when such developments have taken place with regard to the materials that are used.  In those days, for example, lead and copper pipes were the norm and a soldered joint was a work of art on a lead or copper pipe.  Nowadays I am sure there are many skilled craftsmen who are unable to do a soldered joint and yet those conditions apply with regard to drains, for example, as opposed to sewers.  This is an area where it is important that review of the legislation would be carried out without any greater delay.</P>
    <P>There are other areas which were mentioned by previous speakers.  Senator Lanigan referred to the position in the area of social welfare where people receiving benefit did not receive their cheque in the post.  On telephoning the particular Department which dealt with their problem they were told that there was an industrial dispute and the information could not be given.  This is most unfortunate.  I am sure the Minister would understand the special problem of people on low incomes like that, people with families.  I know a number of cases of people coming to me who had to spend 50p to £1 on the phone and more if the call did not run smoothly, maybe another 50p.  Those people could not afford this expense.  I feel that it was not good enough.  Something should have been done such as providing a freephone service for those people.  Recently, as Members of the Oireachtas, we were circulated with numbers we can phone to get early information on problems regarding old age pensions and so on.  This is most important, I welcome very much that we have that facility where we can phone without the delay of waiting for a reply to a letter.  This is to be commended.  I cannot see why some similar arrangement could not have been made for people who had these problems, people who did not receive their benefit in the post.  Surely it would have been possible to provide a free service or that the Department would undertake the responsibility for payment.  I ask the Minister if this could be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> Another area which was discussed in regard to An Bord Telecom is in regard to disputes in relation to telephone accounts.  It is dealt with on page 20 under &ldquo;Telephone Accounts.&rdquo;  The report states:</P>
    <P>As I have explained early in this Report I am empowered by law to carry out investigations into complaints about disputed telephone accounts as well as unsatisfactory or faulty telephone service which arose only during the period between 7 July 1983, the effective commencement date of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, and 31 December, 1983, the date on which certain functions of the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs were transferred to Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to telephone accounts is most unsatisfactory.  Many people have complained that phone bills are too high.  I made representations for a number of people who told me that there was no way that they could have made the phone calls that they were charged for in their accounts.</P>
    <P>There is no way of checking this out. There is no way, for example, of proving that somebody did not use the phone when the people of the house were away or when somebody was out of the office. A few years back, before this sophisticated arrangement we have now came into operation, by payment of a small extra fee it was possible to get a list of the trunk calls that were made during the period chargeable.  That was very helpful. The trunk calls, of course, in all cases make up the larger part of the account It is impossible to get that list now.  In effect, we are going backwards.  I cannot see why, with all the sophisticated equipment it is possible to get, that some simple arrangement cannot be included to monitor the calls.  I know it is possible to get equipment to lock up a phone to take only incoming calls, but that is not satisfactory.  When a person in business is presenting a bill charges are itemised.  I see no reason why Bord Telecom Éireann should not have to itemise the phone calls <Col N="1159" /> that are made, their duration, the dates on which they were made and so on.  I believe it would cost a little extra, but I also believe that people would not object to paying the extra cost if they were presented with an account they could check.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to learn that it is possible to rent a meter.  Perhaps the Senator would point out if the meter would do exactly what I say, give the date, the time, the number phoned and the cost of each phone call.  If it is possible to get that meter it is all the more reason why An Bord Telecom should use equipment of that kind.  I have no doubt there would be less discontent among subscribers if they could check their accounts.  I would certainly like to make a recommendation that a metering arrangement be used for all subscribers.</P>
      <P>I note that the Ombudsman has no power to force people to accept his recommendations, but if they do not they can come here before the Oireachtas. That is pressure enough to make sure that his recommendations will be accepted.  I also note from the report that he was taken to court on a number of occasions &mdash; this has been commended by the Minister &mdash; to see exactly what the situation was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actions of private companies, of course, are outside the scope of the Ombudsman.  Complaints relating to recruitment, pay and conditions of employment were referred to specifically by the Minister in regard to personnel. <Col N="1160" /> I accept that that would be a difficult situation for him and a difficult role to fill.  I do not think there is any great demand for the powers of the Ombudsman to extend into this area.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the map which shows the extent of the works of the Ombudsman over the time, the numbers in each county.  I notice that County Meath has 41, Leitrim is the lowest with four, and Dublin is the highest with 535.  I would like to see the country divided into subareas to make accessibility easier.  I am glad that the Ombudsman, in travelling over parts of the country to promote his work and to deal with people who have complaints, visited Navan on his first itinerary. I am not sure what the result was in Navan but I hope it was satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Like the other Members I warmly welcome the report of the Ombudsman.  I hope that it will get smaller in future years, but the probability is that it will be quite a large volume the next time.  I congratulate the Ombudsman on his work and I congratulate his staff.  I would just like to repeat my representations to the Minister that despite the financial constraints the power of the Ombudsman should be extended to many other areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join other Senators in welcoming the first annual report of the Ombudsman, for 1984, and to compliment him, and his staff, for the efficient way he handled his office in his first year of operation.  The aim of the Ombudsman is to ensure that the ordinary man in the street gets fair play in dealing with administration and if he has been wronged he has remedial action available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious from the number of complaints received that the setting up of this office was most desirable.  In its first year of operation 2,267 complaints were received, of which 1,544 were within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman.  Of these 1,013 were completed and 531 were carried forward to 1985.  Complaints came from all walks of life and from every section of the community.  It was interesting to note, however, that social welfare <Col N="1161" /> accounted for almost half of the complaints, with a figure of 744.  The next highest was with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the civil servants in these two Departments gave their fullest co-operation to the Ombudsman in trying to resolve these cases. Without the co-operation of the civil servants solutions could not have been found to the many problems encountered and thus the work of the Ombudsman would have been greatly hindered.  However, the report stated that a certain section of senior civil servants did not co-operate and, indeed, resented the intrusion and the questioning of their decisions.  I presume that is understandable because in the setting up of any new Department there was bound to be a great deal of suspicion.  At this point I would expect that the suspicion had gone and that a good relationship with the public service exists.</P>
    <P>Public servants make decisions every day affecting the lives of thousands of people and it is not possible for them to be right in every decision.  Mistakes are made and will be made again.  As a result, people need and avenue for redress.  I am glad the Ombudsman stated in his report that his position is not to be misinterpreted or compared with the role of public representatives who continuously make queries and representations on behalf of their constituents.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's office was set up under an Act of the Oireachtas to investigate complaints by citizens against the public service and to establish whether or not Departments had been guilty of maladministration.  The posing of the question, &ldquo;If I were on the other side of the table would I like to be treated in this way&rdquo;?  is a good reminder to any civil servant.  If they ask that question from time to time it will ensure that each case will be treated as fairly as possible.  Good administration means more than doing what is precisely legal.  It means fairness, taking care and good communications. The essential function of the Ombudsman's job is to promote fairness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> The report also raises questions in areas where reviews of social legislation should take place.  The anomalies in the laws of domicile are mentioned, which have been of great concern over the years; also the case of the deserted husband <i>vis-à-vis</i> the deserted wife, where she can get an additional £20 per week allowance and indeed the old problem of the system of determining the entitlement of people to the contributory old age pension.  It is right that the Ombudsman should raise these questions.  However, as legislators we also have a duty to see that these anomalies are terminated. I welcome the Minister's statement that the Government are taking action in a number of these areas.</P>
    <P>In his report the Ombudsman states that members of his staff are now visiting regional areas for the purpose of interviewing complainants at local level.  This is a very positive step forward in so far as people are not always in a position to come to Dublin to make their complaints. I realise they could have them written or phoned but in many cases the person to person contact is the only solution.  An extension to the areas mentioned in the report will be welcome and worthwhile, particularly when it has been shown in the geographical diagram that complaints were received from all of the 26 counties. Particular attention should, of course, be given to the high density urban areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to the publicising of the services of the Ombudsman's office, I feel more should be done.  The Minister has mentioned the areas in which posters and local advertisements are placed but there should be more television and radio advertising outlining the services available, particularly as the office is a new one.  I am satisfied that if I conducted a survey in my area it would show that the vast majority of people would not understand the function or the role of the Ombudsman and indeed, even in some cases might not even be aware of his existence.</P>
    <P>Like Senator McGonagle, I would recommend that a major publicity campaign be put into action.  I welcome the extension of the Ombudsman's remit to cover <Col N="1163" /> local authorities and health boards and also to include An Post and An Bord Telecom.  I have no doubt that when we are reading the 1985 report there will be a big increase in the number of complaints as some of these areas are very contentious.  There is a big challenge ahead for the Ombudsman and I wish him and his staff every success in meeting this challenge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators who have contributed to the debate for the very high level and genuine degree of praise which they have extended to the Ombudsman and his staff for their work in investigating complaints during the first year in existence of the Ombudsman's office.  There were a number of useful comments made during the debate.  It is clear also that there is general agreement on most of the issues which were raised in the report.  I would like to make reference to a couple of those and comment on them.</P>
      <P>Members of the House were concerned about the lack of co-operation from some Departments of State.  The efficient discharge of the Ombudsman's role depends to a large extent on the full co-operation of all the agencies covered by the Ombudsman's remit and each individual member of their staff.  I want to repeat again that this co-operation will be expected from now on.  Any lack of co-operation will be seen as an attempt to frustrate the explicit intentions of the Government and of the Oireachtas and will not be tolerated.  It is an area that will be kept under close scrutiny and I hope that it will not be necessary to make any further comment on the matter.  I was heartened indeed to see that a number of Senators, in the course of their contributions made reference to the same point and called for the greatest possible degree of co-operation from the staff of the public bodies within the Ombudsman's remit with his inquiries and investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question which received most attention by speakers was that of <Col N="1164" /> delayed payments.  The comments, particularly of Senator McGonagle, were particularly interesting.  Needless to say, of course, the question of the Ombudsman making recommendations on any matter under investigation is entirely for himself.  However, the Government are concerned about the anomalies highlighted by the Ombudsman in his report, as I said in my remarks earlier in the debate.  I would like to repeat that the report has been brought to the attention of the Ministers concerned.  The Government have asked each Minister to take appropriate action to remove the anomalies in so far as it is possible to do so and within the resources available.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that the question of introducing legislation to provide for the payment of interest by the State in the cases of delayed payment has wider implications than just the social welfare area.  The Minister for Finance will, I am sure, wish to study the matter from the point of view of the potential additional expenditure involved.  The whole matter is, however, a clear example of the very useful role which the Ombudsman can fulfil in pointing to cases where remedial action may be required on a level other than, for example, purely administrative changes at departmental level.</P>
    <P>I would like once again, as I have had occasion to do several times in the last year or two in this House, to thank Senator McGonagle, whose contributions as a former Ombudsman in Northern Ireland is always particularly useful and relevant.  I would have to say that to a large extent I share his views, especially the views which he expressed regarding the necessity to step up the amount of publicity and publicity material available, making people aware of the existence of the Ombudsman's office and of its role.  Similar comments were made by Senator Fitzsimons and by Senator Kelleher.</P>
    <P>I explained to the House previously that I have urged the Ombudsman to become more involved in publicising the work of his office.  I do not think it is that the Ombudsman wishes to hide his light under a bushel but the sheer physical <Col N="1165" /> problem of setting up the office in its first year and then, when it was essentially just one year old, having its remit more than doubled in the size of the areas under investigation, have created their own demands on the time and resources of the Ombudsman and his staff.  Bearing that in mind the publicity campaigns that he has engaged in to date have been reasonable.</P>
    <P>As the House will know, he has been engaged in an increase in the level of publicity associated with the office.  As I explained to the House, when I spoke earlier, he has begun to embark on a series of regional or provincial tours to visit towns in various parts of Ireland.  As Senator Fitzsimons said, Navan was one of the first of those towns.  Those visits to those provincial centres will be useful in developing an awareness of the concept of the Ombudsman and his role.  I was a little disappointed to hear Senator Kelleher suggest that were he to conduct a poll of his neighbours and constituents he felt that a large number of them would not be aware of the role or functions of the Ombudsman and that some of them might not be aware of his existence.  I would like to say, in the kindest possible way, that I disagree with the Senator.  I do not believe that there is such a low level of awareness of the existence of the Ombudsman's office.</P>
    <P>There was quite a lot of publicity attached to the setting up of the office. On a regular basis I know that the Ombudsman avails of invitations extended to him to speak at various public functions in different parts of the country and to appear on the national airwaves.  There is, for such a new office, a surprisingly high level of awareness of its existence.  I hope that were the Senator to conduct that poll the results would be pleasantly surprising to him &mdash; not that I hope the Senator will have any excuse or opportunity for conducting polls in his area or constituency for the next number of years.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred specifically to the points regarding lack of co-operation <Col N="1166" /> on the part of certain public servants in the course of last year.  He referred specifically to the attitude adopted by An Bord Telecom towards their customers.  I have explained to the House previously by that it was because of the high level of customer dissatisfaction which all of us, as public representatives, were aware of, on the part of the general public in relation to An Bord Telecom that the Government extended the remit of the Ombudsman specifically to this area.  I hope that his intervention into the system will help to bring about a more courteous and efficient service from An Bord Telecom to the general public.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank Senator Higgins, Senator Kelleher and Senator Fitzsimons for their contributions also.  It is always heartening to have a generally positive response to a debate from Senators on all sides of the House.  Finally, may I say that the means by which the Oireachtas considers future reports of the Ombudsman is one on which I have an open mind. That might best be considered in the light of developments over the next year or so and in light of consideration of this debate and the debate on the report which is yet to take place in the other House.</P>
