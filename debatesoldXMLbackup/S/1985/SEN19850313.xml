      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to move under Standing Order 29 a motion for the adjournment of the Seanad on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, the matter being:</P>
      <P>The widespread disquiet in west Mayo and on the western seaboard arising from the recent outrages, particularly of last weekend, committed against the elderly, which suggests inadequacies in existing rural policing methods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the decision the House has taken, it is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Agreement has been reached to interrupt No. 2 at 4.30 p.m. and adjourn the Second Stage of that debate to another day.  At 4.30 p.m. we would commence No. 3 and there is agreement that that could be completed by 6.30 p.m.  Agreement has also been reached that the Minister would reply to that debate at 6.15 p.m., allowing him to wrap it up and have No. 3 agreed by 6.30 p.m. to allow the emergency resolution to take its course.  We are not adjourning for tea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I do not disagree with the Order of Business, but on item No. 3, if there has been agreement between the Whips that that matter should be taken effectively between 4.30 p.m. and 6.15 p.m. with the Minister replying at 6.15, did the Whips consider whether the House should contemplate a limit on the amount of time taken by any one speaker?  Quite a number of us would like to contribute to that debate.  I wonder if the Deputy Leader of the House has any proposal to <Col N="1031" /> make with regard to the limitation on time any individual speaker may take.  If there is no limitation I can envisage a situation in which only two or three people would get an opportunity of expressing their views on this important matter.  Therefore, I would ask the Deputy Leader of the House to consider whether each contribution should not exceed 15 minutes.  The Minister is going to reply for 15 minutes.  I think each other contribution should not exceed 15 minutes. In that case, if the Minister was not going to make a long statement at the start, we would have a little short of two hours.  That would allow only seven speakers 15 minutes each.  But at least if we imposed a maximum limit of 15 minutes, there would be the possibility that some of them would finish in less than 15 minutes and that eight, nine or ten people might get an opportunity of making a brief comment on this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to inquire from you, or from the Deputy Leader of the House, on how many occasions in the past there has been a time limit on Government business in this House?  I am not aware in the past of time limits. I would like to inquire as to who agreed to this?  There are seven Members of this House who are not affiliated to any group and to my knowledge none of us has agreed to the Order of Business for today.  Finally, I have risen on the best part of six occasions since Christmas to raise the question of item No. 5 and on each occasion I have been given more or less sweet words about how people were doing their best.  But as item No. 5 has now slipped from being third on previous occasions and, indeed, second on some occasions, to being No. 5, I have to assume that, notwithstanding the obvious goodwill of Members of the Government parties, they are being prevented by the Government from discussing this Bill because of the lethargy of the Government and because of the succession of broken promises by the Government on <Col N="1032" /> the issue.  I wish to propose an amendment on the Order of Business that item No. 5 should be taken as the second item today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to question the Order of Business in relation to the taking of No. 3 because to me and, indeed, to all of us, it is a very important measure.  To limit it in the way suggested by the Deputy Leader of the House is not doing justice to this very important measure in our democracy.  Further, I was given to understand that last week there was a great air of importance being given to item No. 2 and that we were to have the Taoiseach here today for this matter.  We have not had the Taoiseach here during this session &mdash; indeed not since the Seanad was elected.  I may be corrected on that, but I do not think he has been.  Certainly he seldom pays a visit to this House.  Many of us were looking forward to his coming here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all due respect to the Minister of State, we see him pretty often in this House, and indeed he is very welcome on as many occasions as he can come here, but this was an occasion &mdash; and we have fought for a long time to be given the opportunity to introduce Bills here rather than have them introduced in the other House; we have now been given that opportunity &mdash; on which to have the Taoiseach introduce the Bill in this House.  That would have been a further step to give more importance to the Seanad.  My impression last week was that one of the reasons for us having to sit all night until almost sunrise the next morning was that the Taoiseach was coming here today.  Now the Taoiseach is not available.  Are we again, with respect to the Minister of State, down-grading this occasion of introducing this Bill into the House?  It is a very important Bill.  We have not had anything like it in our time in the Oireachtas.  We should have been given the opportunity of having the Taoiseach here.  We quite understand the Taoiseach is ill and cannot be here today, but could I ask the Deputy Leader of the House if this Bill could be <Col N="1033" /> left until a day when the Taoiseach would be available?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am loath to defend the Taoiseach from the remarks of Senator McMahon, but that was fairly unreasonable as the Taoiseach is in his bed, as far as we know.  I would like to support the remarks made by Senator Ryan on the Order of Business, and support his call for a debate on No. 5.  I am rather nonplussed by the attitude of the Government to the Order of Business, which today particularly seems to me to be upside down.  I would not in any way quarrel with the decision to have a debate on a matter of public urgency at 6.30 but we have had to abandon two matters on the Adjournment, one of which it was indicated would be taken this week.  We have had to postpone again the extended debate on Nicaragua.  It appears we are unable to take the Homeless Persons Bill.  I would like a commitment from the Government either that the two Private Member's Bills, which have been on the Order Paper for a long time, will be taken today &mdash; they are serious Bills and it is time the Government took a stand on them instead of avoiding them &mdash; or that the Government gave time for them tomorrow or Tuesday next and disposed of them in that way. What I do not like is seeing the Government avoiding two Private Member's Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the call of Senator McMahon for an extension of the time for the debate on the Local Elections (Postal Voting) (Amendment) Regulations.  This is a serious business that comes in the year of an election.  I can remember when I was a very innocent young person, almost a boy, contesting the local elections of 1974, and some of the abuses perpetrated at that time by the Fianna Fáil Party when postal voting was introduced in a limited form and unless we give the Bill our long <Col N="1034" /> and serious consideration I would not like&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have the utmost sympathy for Senator Brendan Ryan in regard to his Bill, because he has mentioned it here on a number of occasions, somehow or other, I do not think, in view of the very important motion that we have before us today, on law and order in the west, that today would be the day to take that Bill because I do not think we would have time for it.  I am suggesting to him that if he insists on taking it next week we will support him on the Order of Business.  We would be slow to do so today on account of this other motion. As regards the local elections, I agreed with the Deputy Leader of the House that we take it from 4.30 to 6.30, but perhaps we made a mistake there, because two hours is a bit short for it.  If we had the Archives Bill only for an hour, or until 3.30, and then went on to the postal voting motion we might get over it that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KatherineBulbulia" hpid="Mrs. Bulbulia Mrs. Bulbulia">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said in connection with the Local Elections (Postal Voting) (Amendement) Regulations that it is a very important matter to us as indeed many of us will be heading into the local elections.  We must make the point that it is extremely important because it is going to affect the voting rights of the disabled.  Many of us in the Seanad have nominations from bodies representing disabled persons, indeed, I have one from the Multiple Sclerosis Association, one member of which conducted a campaign through the courts to be allowed her right to vote as a disabled person and it is for that reason that this legislation is of enormous significance and merits the attention of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the suggestion <Col N="1035" /> of Senator O'Leary is an excellent one and it is a matter for the House to agree on the time limit that might be imposed on speakers.  If there is a 15 minute time limit it will enable quite a lot of people to get involved in the debate.</P>
      <P>It is being taken because of its urgency and this has been emphasised by Senator Bulbulia.  This legislation was debated for only three and a half hours in the Dáil and in discussions with the main Opposition party it was agreed that two hours would be reasonable.  Now Senator Ryan suggests that possibly we should have three hours.  That is a matter for the House.  I have no fixed views about it so long as we get it completed.  We did reach agreement that the Minister could come in to reply at 6.15.  Regarding No. 2, the National Archives Bill, it was the intention of the Taoiseach to be in the House to take this Bill but unfortunately he is ill with the 'flu and could not be with us.  He intimated to me through his office that he wished the Bill to proceed and be taken by the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>I am happy that he, as Taoiseach, wanted the Bill initiated here.  It is because of his interest in the Bill that we are confining the debate to just the formal Second Reading, giving an opportunity to the Opposition and possibly to other speakers, to speak on it.  After that, it will be the intention of the Taoiseach to be in the House for the full debate and to reply to it.  That covers the point Senator McMahon raised.  I did not arrange the Order of Business without consultation with the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reminded Senator Ryan that it is the duty of this House, first of all, to look after Government business, which I am doing today.  In the past we have ordered the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill to be taken when possible.  I totally refute the suggestion that there is any desire on the part of the Government not to take it or indeed not to reach completion of the Second Stage in spite of the anomalies &mdash; and I will not go into them because it would be out of order to do so.  I deny that we do not want to take it.  I would question also whether Senator <Col N="1036" /> Ryan considers that the House has already arrived at a decision to take an emergency resolution at 6.30 which I think even he would agree is important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the imminence of the local elections it is important to extend postal voting to disabled people. It is a question of trying to decide the level of importance and the priorities and the Government must have priority in this House.  In ordering the business, I am open to Senator Ryan's suggestion that possibly No. 2 would be completed at 3.30 instead of 4.30.  That is a matter for the House to decide.  If Senator Ryan formally proposes that we could then decide on Senator O'Leary's suggestion of 15 minutes per speaker.</P>

I will be shortly moving the Combat Poverty Agency Bill, which is a Government Bill and would have precedence over the Housing Bill. I am giving no commitment that we will be able to take the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill next week.  I am glad that there is agreement on the other side of the House.  Perhaps the Opposition might facilitate them, as the Leader said, with their time on their motion when it is available, but that is a matter for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was extremely anxious to introduce this Bill in the Seanad himself.  I could say that he was enthusiastic about the opportunity of bringing it before the House.  As the Seanad will be aware, he has taken a personal interest in this matter over a long period and is delighted that the Bill has finally reached the floor of the House.  However, as regards the suggestion made earlier by Senator <Col N="1039" /> McMahon, in the most polite fashion possible and without being critical of the Taoiseach who is ill, I think he would prefer to gain a week, fortnight, or three weeks by having the Bill introduced now rather than delay it for his presence here.</P>
      <P>As I say, the Taoiseach is ill and, while I regret the circumstances &mdash; I share the disappointment of Members of the House that he is not present for this occasion &mdash; it is of course a privilege for me to introduce this Bill here.</P>
      <P>This Bill is the first attempt, since the foundation of the State, to establish a structured basis for the preservation and general care of archival material.  Under the Bill, primary responsibility for national archives will be vested in a new institution to be known as the National Archives.  The new body will take over the existing functions of the State Paper Office and the Public Record Office and will also be given a range of functions appropriate to modern archival needs.</P>
      <P>Archival documentation is the primary source for the study of aspects of history. Since the foundation of the State, the processes of central Government have generated a huge volume of records, and this material is being augmented every day.  It consists of records in various formats, varying from traditional files to the software of computer technology. Hitherto, in the absence of national archival legislation, historians have been largely denied access to this material. This has led to the rather anomalous situation whereby the British administrative archives, some of which pertain to Irish affairs, are available for public inspection after 30 years while corresponding Irish papers are not likewise generally available. The incongruous and unsatisfactory result of this situation is that historians, especially those concerned with the study of Anglo-Irish relations and foreign policy, have been obliged to rely almost exclusively on sources outside Ireland, while of course sources existed here also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill now before the House will implement arrangements for access to those Government records which are <Col N="1040" /> essentially of historical significance rather than of current legal or administrative interests.  Under the Bill, the records of Government Departments and offices attached to Government Departments, as well as other major offices of State, will, in future, be made available for public inspection after 30 years.  Of course, there will have to be safeguards to ensure that certain sensitive records such as those relating to security or affecting individual privacy may be withheld for longer periods.  The specific grounds on which records may be withheld are set out in section 8 of the Bill, which also provides for the review of the grounds for the withholding of such documents at least once every five years.</P>
    <P>It is generally acknowledged that one of the potentially most controversial aspects of any policy for release of Government records is the arrangements that will apply to the retention of sensitive records.  There may be fears, for example, that documents will be retained to avoid political controversy.  However, I believe that the arrangements which have been incorporated in the Bill will remove the issue of release of specific material from the political arena.  In addition to specifying the grounds on which records may be withheld, the Bill provides that the certification of records for retention will be a function of departmental officials &mdash; to be designated under regulations to be made by the Taoiseach and subject to overall control by officials of the Taoiseach's Department to provide an insurance against possible over-restrictive attitudes by individual Departments.  It is intended that these functions will be exercised under regulations to be made under the legislation, only by very senior officials.</P>
    <P>My Department have, of course, some experience in the orderly &mdash; if limited &mdash; release of Government records.  This stems from the decision in 1976 by the then Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, to institute a policy of releasing Government minutes and supporting records more than 30 years old.  This represented significant progress, but researchers interested in our political and administrative <Col N="1041" /> history have been largely constrained to examine Cabinet policy in isolation and have been generally precluded from seeing it reflected in the wider administrative interplay with other Departments. This limited form of public access to archival material has so far covered the period up to 1954.  This is very useful but it is also very limited and anyone with any experience of Government Departments &mdash; even the limited experience I have had in two Departments &mdash; can understand how limited and how frustrating it must be for a researcher working in this area, seeking the elaboration of the documents he has, being unable to find it and being forced into the area of conjecture and speculation as to where the document should or could be very readily at hand. In the area of political commentary it might be that the area of speculation and conjecture would prove more interesting, as some of us know, than the actual facts.</P>
    <P>A very important feature of the Bill is that it places a positive duty on Government Departments and other related agencies to preserve records which are of archival value.  Some may suggest that Government Departments are notorious for hoarding records but the reality is that the volume of records produced in modern Government administration is enormous and there is ever-increasing pressure on Departments to dispose of unwanted records and documents.  It must be conceded that, hitherto, little conscious thought has been given to the necessity of implementing positive archival practices to ensure against the destruction of material of potential value to historians.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to remedy that deficiency. The Bill also indicates the specific, restricted circumstances in which the destruction of departmental records may be permitted &mdash; records which are no longer required in connection with the administration of a Department will have to be scrutinised by the Director of the National Archives before they are destroyed &mdash; while envisaging special provision for the destruction of routine and repetitious administrative records.  I would like to assure this House and the <Col N="1042" /> public alike that under this procedure, which the Taoiseach initiated informally by personal directive some time ago pending enactment of this legislation, decisions concerning destruction of official records will be made with the greatest care and will adhere to a preordained process.</P>
    <P>A new National Archives Advisory Council, in respect of the membership of which some specific provisions are made, will be established under the Bill.  The council will have a major role in advising on archival matters and this will be particularly crucial in the establishment of the new archival arrangements.  It would be unrealistic to expect that teething problems will not arise particularly with regard to the huge volume of records that will become available after enactment of the Bill.  The advice of the council on these and related issues will be vital.</P>
    <P>Problems may arise from the release, over a relatively short period of time, of a large volume of departmental records. Clearly, the already overstrained accommodation available to the Public Record Office and State Paper Office will be totally inadequate to deal with such an influx of material.  Preliminary planning work on a purpose-built centre has commenced. It is envisaged that this will be provided on a site already in State ownership.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, arrangements are being made between the head of the State Paper-Public Record Offices and the Office of Public Works to provide satisfactory interim space to accommodate the influx of records which will be accelerated by the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence that this Bill will meet the reasonable expectations of historians.  We in this State are deeply indebted to past historians.  Their work helped to shape national consciousness in the early years of this century.  It is only appropriate that we should facilitate the work of the present generation of historians whose contribution to the understanding of our history has in recent decades been immense.  I think that it is particularly apt that this Bill should have <Col N="1043" /> its First Reading in this House as, over many years, several distinguished historians have contributed with distinction to its work.  It is perhaps worth recalling that as long ago as April 1924, Senator Mrs. Alice Stopford Green, a distinguished Irish historian of her day, urged that the State should undertake the systematic publication of manuscript materials.  We are, then, to some extent now returning to the completion of unfinished business.</P>
    <P>As a final word, in the preparation of this Bill dealing with national archives, archives all over the world have been combed and inspected with a view to producing the best possible format that we could conceive.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit ó Roinn an Taoisigh.  Is trua linn nach bhfuil an Taoiseach anseo linn ach tá ionadaí maith aige agus tá mé cinnte go ndéanfaidh sé an gnó díreach chomh maith.  Tá aiféala orm go bhfuil an Taoiseach tinn agus tá súil agam go mbeidh sé go maith sar i bhfad.  Ba mhaith liom ina theannta sin buíochas a ghabháil leis an Taoiseach agus anois lena ionadaí as uacht an Bille seo um Chartlann Náisiúnta, 1985, a thionscnamh sa Teach seo. Ní minic a déantar amhlaidh agus is onóir dúinn é sin.  Fáiltím roimh an mBille seo. Ní mheasaim go mbeidh morán aighnis anois faoi na forálacha agus mar sin measaim freisin go nglacfar leis go ginearálta ar gach taobh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State from the Department of the Taoiseach here this evening and I also welcome the Bill which he has initiated here.  The Bill is non-contentious and will therefore receive general acceptance on all sides of the House.  The term &ldquo;national archives&rdquo; has wide and far-reaching connotations. Within its range comes responsibility for the custody of and security for the most secretive State papers and also serious concern for the preservation and propagation of all the basic elements of our native culture.  It is to the latter aspect of the Bill that I shall briefly direct my attention.  No doubt other Senators will <Col N="1044" /> be more interested in the legal and security provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Explanatory Memorandum puts the Bill's purpose and main provisions in very clear perspective.  In the introduction, the purpose is concisely outlined under four headings:</P>
    <P>(a)  to provide for the amalgamation of the Public Record Office of Ireland and the State Paper Office to form a single administrative entity under the title &ldquo;the National Archives&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>(b)  to provide for the preservation of Departmental records and for the disposal of records which are no longer required in connection with the administration of a Department of State and which, in the view of the National Archives, have no archival value;</P>
    <P>(c)  to provide for the transfer to the National Archives and the making available for public inspection of Departmental records more than 30 years old, except for records which may be retained on certain grounds;</P>
    <P>(d)  to provide for the establishment of a National Archives Advisory Council.</P>
    <P>In short, the main thrust of the Bill is to centralise the availability of our national archives of whatever dimension and to establish a national advisory council to be responsible for the entire operation. I welcome this decision and I wish it success.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to the fundamental place that all native Irish traditions must always hold in our National Archives.  To demonstrate this one need only refer to the monumental achievements of two great scholars, namely, Seán Ó Donnabháin and Eoin O'Curry. The former travelled Ireland on foot at great physical hardship collecting, investigating and editing all the local lore for the Ordnance Survey Office.  Meanwhile, his brother-in-law and contemporary, Eoin O'Curry, spent his time working <Col N="1045" /> in the Royal Irish Academy and Trinity College interpreting and adapting the old Irish manuscripts which resulted subsequently in his very important series of lectures entitled &ldquo;The Manners and Customs of the Ancient Irish&rdquo;.  Without these documents Ireland would be culturally a much poorer country.  It will be seen that the combined efforts of these two great men re-established in Ireland after almost two centuries of oblivion the ancient scholarship that has been so badly disrupted with the decline of our monastic educational system which resulted from the brutal ravages of conquest.  The fruits of the labour and lore of Ó Donnabháin and O'Curry must surely be compulsive material for our National Archives.</P>
    <P>I want to say a brief word about the vast archival material collected by our various voluntary organisations.  In addition to the Irish language, folklore and traditions of the country were very central to the Irish revival movement since its inception.  This was aptly crystalised by Dr. Douglas Hyde when he said that the ultimate aim was to render the present a rational continuation of the past.  The founding of the Irish Folklore Society was part of this aim.  This body later became known as the Irish Folklore Commission.  Under the guidance and direction of the late Professor Séamus de Largey, who held the Chair for Folklore in University College, Dublin, the commission received State recognition eventually and were granted funds to operate on at least a semi-statutory basis. Collectors were appointed and assigned to various regions of the country.  Their achievements have exceeded all expectations.</P>
    <P>The Irish Folklore Commission have now in their custody the most varied, extensive, richest and most important archives of native culture of any country in Europe.  In the early days there was a difficulty.  This material was being stored away in the society's headquarters and was therefore inaccessible to the public. Of late, these archives are housed in the folklore department of UCD and are now more readily available to the public.  This <Col N="1046" /> is very welcome.  The nation may be proud of this vast and rich collection of ancient materials.  Other voluntary organisations have also done great work in the collecting and preservation of native archival materials.  Ever since their foundation in 1961 Comhaltas Ceolteóirí Éireann have been constantly engaged in collecting, editing and storing various forms of our national lore, music, song, customs, etc.  It is gratifying to record that their efforts to date have been very successful.  Proof of this is to be found in the organisation's headquarters, Cultúrlann na hÉireann, in Monkstown.  A very representative library and an extensive collection of tapes, records and material hitherto unrecorded are preserved and carefully stored there.  The tapes contain three and a half thousand hours of listening material.  Edited and catalogued, these tapes are readily available for inspection by the public.  It is perhaps ironic that at a time when Comhaltas are doing such great work of national importance, the annual grant to the organisation from the Arts Council should be considerably reduced and a national network of valuable entertainment is thereby put at great risk.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would like to invite Members of the Oireachtas to visit the Cultúrlann at any time to see for themselves the activity and extent of the work that takes place there.  Had he been here, I would have been particularly glad to have extended a céad míle fáilte to the Taoiseach to visit the Cultúrlann at his earliest possible convenience.  By so doing, he would be in a position the better to appreciate and evaluate the national importance of the entire operation being conducted from there.  Let me also respectfully add that he would then be in a better position to understand why Comhaltas are so steadfastly convinced that the organisation are so very inadequately funded by the State.  Ar aon nós beidh fáilte roimh an Taoiseach agus roimh aon duine eile ón Oireachtas am ar bith a thagann siad chugainn.</P>
    <P>I must now refer to two sections of the Bill.  Section 5 provides for the appointment of a director of national archives. <Col N="1047" /> In view of the basic importance of the Irish language to this appointment the person appointed should have a good working knowledge of Irish.  Only thus will he or she be in a position to discharge efficiently and effectively the duties attached to that very important office.  Therefore, I would urge the Taoiseach to give this recommendation serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I come now to section 19 which provides for the establishment of a National Archives Advisory Council.  I very much welcome the proposal in general but I have reservations about the restrictive composition of the council.  The Bill stipulates that the council shall consist of a chairman and not more than 11 other members appointed by the Taoiseach on such terms and conditions as shall be determined by him after consultation with the Minister for the Public Service. I believe this number could be augmented to allow for a more broadly based council. That, of course, is a matter of opinion. It is my opinion that the council would be better for being more broadly based.</P>
    <P>Subsection 3(a) again specifies that the members of the council shall include not less than two members of the Irish Manuscripts Commission and not less than two archivists not employed by the National Archives.  While I fully agree that the agencies named in that subsection should be so represented on the council, I respectfully submit that the national voluntary organisations should be given some representation on the council.  I urge the Taoiseach to consider this seriously and give the matter his close attention.  Voluntary bodies such as Conradh na Gaeilge, Comhdhail Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, the GAA, Comhaltas Ceolteóirí Éireann, if indeed I may put it last, and any council concerned with archival materials in this country should have representation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to historians and to Professor Stopford Green who was a distinguished Member of this House.  I believe in the representation of these voluntary bodies who are themselves engaged in the collection, promotion and <Col N="1048" /> fostering of important elements of our native culture.  Any council would benefit by representation from at least some of these bodies.  I ask the Minister to urge the Taoiseach, who will have the final say, to consider that recommendation from me when he appoints the council.</P>
    <P>Sin a bhfuil le rá agam ar an ócáid seo. B'fhéidir nuair a bheidh an Bille i gCoiste go mbeidh tuilleadh le rá agam faoi na forálacha éagsúla a thiocfaidh faoi dhíospóireacht ag an tráth sin.  Bille tábhachtach é seo go mba cheart a bheidh os comhair an Oireachtais agus reachtaíthe ag an Oireachtas blianta fada ó shin.  Fáiltím roimhe agus guím go nglacfar leis le fonn ar gach taobh den Teach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senators who have welcomed this Bill and, indeed, welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I compliment him on the elegant speech with which he commended this Bill to us.  Let me begin with a minor reservation, that having combed the best of the legislation that prevails in European countries and further abroad, that this should in no way preclude him from acknowledging such humble amendments as might be offered on Committee Stage from this domestic Legislature.</P>
      <P>It is a Bill that will be welcomed by many people, not only professional people who have been discommoded in the past in relation to access to material; it is a Bill that is of importance to every citizen.  One of my correspondents on this topic made the point that the epigraph over the door of the National Archives of the United States is, &ldquo;What Is Past Is Prologue&rdquo;, which was translated for him by a taxi driver as, &ldquo;You ain't seen nothing yet.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think all of us who are interested in this Bill will see that an importance, which is not limited by professional concern, attaches to the adequate care of records.  There are several different elements in the Bill which I agree should be teased out perhaps most appropriately on Committee Stage.  One is the matter of definition.  The Bill contains a number of important aspects.  The first part of the <Col N="1049" /> Bill abolishes in many ways a survival of the old pre-Treaty regime, the State Paper Office, which was a depository for the papers of the Office of the Chief Secretary for Ireland in the British administration.  It also removes the old constraints on the Public Record Office which was a depository for court records and, following disestablishment, certain Church of Ireland records, and obscure provisions about items stored in other places and so forth.</P>
    <P>The Bill removes constraints, which is important.  Section 8 contains the important principle of providing access to certain documents.  It has a freedom of information dimension.  It seeks to balance two principles to which the Minister adverted in his speech.  These are the normal protection which should be afforded to the citizen in terms of sensitive information and the right of the public to have access to information which is in its interest.  The period suggested in the Bill is a good balance.  This, however, raises an important question.  It relates to the material to which this Bill will/apply.  It is something we can tease out a little more on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There may be some problem about the definition of &ldquo;archives.&rdquo;  There is a need to draw some distinction between the material that is held in existing sources which falls under the ambit of the Bill and the material which does not.  The Public Record Office was destroyed in 1922 and has never since recovered its former status.  Its professional staff have been run down from ten before World War I to three in the 1960's.  The only subsequent improvement was the creation of five posts of archivist in 1974. However, this increase in staff was not accompanied by the necessary increases in support staff, supporting legislation and accommodation.  If I welcome nothing else, I welcome the advertance of the Minister to the fact that legislation is only as strong as the provisions made for its implementation.  Therefore, he acknowledges the need for additional staff.  His commitment to the provision of space of an interim nature and also of a permanent <Col N="1050" /> kind is welcome.  I would regard the legislation standing on its own as being a very insufficient response.</P>
    <P>To return to my original point.  The Public Record Office having been destroyed, attempts were made later to more or less accept bundles of material of a different nature on the basis, for example, that one could perhaps match documents and secure copies of documents that had been destroyed.  This means that what exists at present is of a very mixed nature.  We welcome a commitment to provide such staff as is necessary to enable us to know the proportion of material that is central to the work of the State and material that is not so, material that is peripheral.  The point I am making relates to the existing material held.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, the Bill deals with the creation of a certain philosophy and a set of procedures for the implementation of a policy on material of historical value among contemporary records.  I am not clear as to the operation of section 8. This is something I will come back to on Committee Stage.  I will be asking about the decisions to be made, by whom they will be made, the review period and so forth.  I am not clear how that section and later sections will be implemented.  As I understand it, material may be retained by the Department if it is necessary for the functioning of the Department, as may sensitive material.  Such material retained will be reviewed after a period of five years.  What procedures will there be to ensure that such a review takes place?  What sanctions, if any, would exist in relation to the non-review of material, etc?  These are matters I intend to pursue in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill is about the creation of a philosophy which would value material and, more importantly, a set of procedures towards the attainment of a certain policy.  We have a flair for national self-delusion in relation to what our attitudes have consistently been towards archives and so on.  Basically, they have not been good.  In many ways a commitment to a policy on archives would have contradicted our other tendency, which is the <Col N="1051" /> invention of pasts for ourselves, recent and farther back.  Our capacity for myth construction will be damaged by the existence of objective records to which scholars will have access.</P>
    <P>I welcome the existence of such historical pointers.  In relation to tragic past events, we have a long memory which often becomes more inaccurate as it lengthens. Therefore, we must welcome the fact that we will have procedures for the keeping of records.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with most of the points I had intended to make.  I could not emphasise sufficiently the importance that attaches to staff.  When this Bill is passed and is being implemented there will be an enormous strain on existing staff.  It would be highly improper and inappropriate for us to pass laws and have only such staff provision as would enable them either not to be applied at all or to be imperfectly applied.  There will be a need for staff not only to deal with the temporary situation of the transfer of documents and their examination, but also a need for a permanent allocation to handle the question of staff needs.  The procedures we are setting up include ones of evaluation as to the relative status, importance and appropriateness of different documents within Departments.  It is not simply a matter of moving other staff sideways.  New skills and specialities are involved in the kind of policy towards which we seem to be moving.  Correctly, it is broad in its scope in relation to the material with which it will deal.  It also creates certain real pressures in relation to the type of skills required.  It will be necessary for us to deal with the question of staff not only in terms of numbers but with staffing requirements in terms of the necessary skills and training if our policy is to be positively implemented.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a National Archives Advisory Council &mdash; and I welcome it &mdash; and if it is to be broadly based, it should be sufficiently sharp to represent those who are to guide its policy in the most effective way, both in the short and medium terms.  We are bringing into <Col N="1052" /> existence something to be known as the National Archives.</P>
    <P>Someone discussing this Bill with me a few days ago asked me what distinction did we draw between the National Archives and the national attic. Obviously, it raises the question again as to the status of the document, both current and historical, with which we are dealing, the evaluation of these and the procedures and criteria which would be used, which in turn refers back to the importance of having not only a comprehensive policy but one that would be effective and operable.  In that regard, one has to try to work out what is the relationship of other institutions and other libraries to the new National Archives.  Here there are a number of problems involved.  Firstly, we are saving material by bringing into existence the National Archives and putting a certain form of protection over the material constituted by the National Archives.</P>
    <P>I must confess to some difficulty about the use of the words &ldquo;archive&rdquo; and &ldquo;archives&rdquo; in the Bill, its plural and singular usage.  I have a difficulty in working out whether it refers to the actual item in storage, the location of the storage, bundles of items in storage and so forth. It is not too clear in sections of the Bill. I will come back to that point on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of the relationship of the new National Archives to other institutions and places of deposit, I must say that we are setting up procedures for the identification of documents that should be protected in the national interest and around which we are placing a certain protection.  The point is that some material which could find itself in the Public Record Office at present may not need this time period.  There may be other material that may be more sensitive. I am interested in material to which the terms of this Bill might unreasonably be extended.  In that respect the work of the policy side of it and the early reports of the National Archives Advisory Council will be very important.</P>
    <P>Another question which arises from the Bill, one which is more appropriate <Col N="1053" /> for teasing out on Committee Stage, is the status of items placed on deposit and their relationship to original items and copies.  In many cases what might make good sense in relation to ease, and facilitate the transfer of documents from one location to another, may reduce the status of the documents in relation to their usage for legal purposes, as evidence and so forth.  Will documents as they arrive be stamped?  What is the status of the seal being placed on documents, and so forth?  These are items we can take up when we are looking at the sections.  I am interested at this stage in welcoming the general provisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the kind of access which affects professional researchers.  He was very apposite in his remarks.  He referred to the ease with which people have had access to records in Northern Ireland and the difficulties of having access to documents here.  We have been very valuably served by the generation of historians and social historians who preceded the existing generation of young scholars in these disciplines. It was they who carved out the importance of social history as a necessary amendment to our stories of heroes, of battles won and lost and the diet of blood and land upon which some of us were reared.  They have corrected the mythic excesses in that regard.  They have undone many prejudices in relation to the existence of the homogenous peasantry. They have told us about our capacity to savage each other, be it in terms of land, the peasantry and so forth.  They did this by the careful amassing of such records as were available to them from private sources and private collections.  The people who studied under them now compose a very valuable generation of scholars to whom the deviant would be the person who would ignore social or economic history.  They are now producing work of first rate value.  These people will, undoubtedly, welcome all the possibilities for access to public documents that this Bill creates.  I agree with the Minister of State in that regard, that it makes their task much more easy.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a point that relates <Col N="1054" /> to staffing.  Is there going to be a new situation following the passage of this Bill in relation to the transfer of material? Some time ago there was in existence a list of material deposited of a valuable kind and I hope that there will be sufficient staff made available so that such material can be indexed and that we will be able to see the type of material being transferred.  This is of more than professional interest because one could from the examination &mdash; indeed, the Minister referred to legislation in other countries &mdash; be able to see material that was being systematically excluded or not transferred.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about the terms regarding the retention of material.  I know too well the ease with which a Minister in charge of a Department, or a very senior departmental official, may decide that a document is, as the Bill would put it, necessary for the orderly functioning of the Department, is sensitive or whatever. I am not happy about the review period and the sanctions for non-compliance with the review period.  Equally, in that regard there should be an appeal system which is sharper than the one envisaged in the Bill.  If material is withheld and a person is in dispute with a Department about the availability of a document &mdash; I am not talking about the professional person seeking access but of the citizen &mdash; that person should be entitled to envisage the Taoiseach raising the matter, if it is a generic body of material, with the Cabinet and that it would be a matter for a Cabinet decision.  I ask the Minister to think about that before we come to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is good to hear the Minister of State say something as hopeful and as positive as a new purpose built building will be erected on a site that the State already owns.  I welcome that.  I will not stray into this matter of rental policy by the State but if we own sites we should build on them.  We do need a purpose built building if we are to have a proper place of deposit.  This is adverted to in the Minister's speech and in the Bill by the specification of the material in such a broad way, including material for electronic <Col N="1055" /> storage, retrieval and so forth.  That is important.</P>
    <P>I will come back to all the questions about the definition of the material and of categories of material on Committee Stage.  It would be improper to raise those matters now.  The Minister might think of ways which would assist in defining documents at different levels of importance. One of the worries I had when reading the Bill &mdash; it was the only one I had &mdash; was that there might be an element of arbitrariness in interpreting the Bill in relation to certain kinds of records.  The Minister should consider that before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that my references to any of these items of detail are motivated by an interest in this area.  It is interesting and valuable that this Bill has been welcomed by both sides of the House.  When one says that one is going to the Seanad to speak on the National Archives Bill, people begin to wonder if there is an element of antiqarianism in it.  We should dispel that notion.  Our possession of records is very important, but our commitment to preserving them, and more importantly, allowing access to them, is a reflection of the state of maturity of our democracy.  It is only the cowardly in present times who would want to hide aspects of their past.  There are fewer people in the present time who would not want there to be a future record of not only their achievements but also of their failures, their cogitations, their half-achieved tasks and also of their total failures and so on.  In that sense it represents a very significant maturity to have a policy.</P>
    <P>It is important for us to realise that this Bill is long overdue.  I join with Senator de Brún in making the point of complimenting all those bodies who over the years made representations to various Heads of State asking for a policy, for legislation and for resources.  We are indebted to them.  It is important that when the Bill is passed that it will be enacted with enthusiasm and commitment. For that reason I most heartily welcome it, particularly the commitment <Col N="1056" /> I believe I heard to provide such physical and staff resources and facilities and such endowment as is necessary for us to have an effective policy.  I have great pleasure in welcoming the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to extend a warm welcome to the Bill.  It is not before its time.  Successive Governments have seen the need for such a Bill.  I wish to focus on the importance of making available for public inspection departmental records which are more than 30 years old and, secondly, to emphasise points that have already been made in connection with the urgent need for adequate staffing and accommodation so that the provisions of the Bill can be implemented in a meaningful way.</P>
      <P>Up to now, only Cabinet minutes have been released from the Taoiseach's Office.  They have provided only very limited insights into political and administrative decisions in the past.  The availability of departmental records will be widely welcomed by researchers, historians, sociologists and political scientists, to name but a few.  When the Bill is implemented researchers will, for the first time, have the opportunity of examining the sources of ideas and the arguments for and against on many issues that eventually resulted in a variety of decisions.  The availability of these records will greatly enrich our understanding of, <i>inter alia</i>, Government policy-making in Ireland in the past.  Up to now we have seen how the British and the Americans viewed various issues affecting Ireland based on their own public records which were released after the 30-year limit.  When this Bill is enacted we will be able to get our own side of the story through the study of Irish departmental records.  I welcome the fact that the political responsibility for the national archives will be located in the Department of the Taoiseach.  This, I believe, will lead to a more effective implementation of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The availability of the departmental records will greatly assist researchers in understanding policy-making and administrative decisions in the past.  I would <Col N="1057" /> take a somewhat different view from that stated in the Minister's opening remarks when he said that the Bill will provide for access to Government records which are essentially of historical significance rather than of current legal or administrative interests.  I feel that these records will also assist researchers in making policy proposals for the future.  I am not an historian but in the course of my own professional work in UCD I am engaged in industrial relations research.  I am quite hopeful that the records will show very important background material on, for example, the Trade Union Act, 1941 and the Industrial Relations Act, 1946 which established the Labour Court, This material from the departmental records will, in turn, likely serve as an important aid to making proposals for change in our industrial relations system in the future. Thus our role in the Department of Industrial Relations at UCD in provoking discussion and in stimulating change through our research work in industrial relations will likely be assisted by the study of the relevant departmental records which will be made available when this Bill is implemented.</P>
    <P>I have already warmly welcomed the Bill, but I put it to the Minister of State that it will not be worth the paper it is written on unless adequate staff are provided for the National Archives.  I do not think that the staffing aspect is spelled out in the Minister's opening statement, whatever about the building proposals which I heartily welcome.  The Bill just cannot become operational without a considerable increase in staff at all levels. At present, for example, the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, which has about half the archival material that we have got, has more than double the staff of our Public Record Office.  The staffing needed to implement this new legislation must be estimated and I want the Minister to give the House a firm assurance that the staffing needs will be estimated and that the provision of the essential staff will actually be made.</P>
    <P>When the provisions of the Bill become effective in two years time &mdash; Senator Higgins has already referred to this &mdash;<Col N="1058" /> masses of records will become available. Trained archivists will be essential to preserve, to store and to conserve this material.  Some of the existing problems in our Public Record Office stem from the inadequate number of staff at executive, clerical and secretarial levels.  This means that the valuable skills of archivists are devoted to purely routine work from time to time.  Therefore, in addition to more trained archivists there will also be a need to increase a range of support staff.</P>
    <P>Linked to the question of staffing is, of course, that of accommodation.  There is an immediate need for temporary accommodation and, looking ahead, the question of long term accommodation also arises.  I welcome the indications in regard to accommodation that the Minister has made in his statement, but in his reply &mdash; perhaps it will be the Taoiseach who will reply in due course &mdash; I would like an indication as to whether the proposed purpose built centre will be adequate to meet the long term requirements of the National Archives.  I recognise that the required staff cannot be provided overnight.  What is needed now is a Government commitment to increase staff over a planned period of a few years. I earnestly seek an assurance from the Minister when replying to Second Stage in respect of increased staffing.</P>
    <P>I should now like to focus on the position of Director of Archives which is provided for in the Bill.  The responsibilities of the post are vital ones concerning the integrity of public records.  It is essential that the post carry a status within the public service hierarchy which will ensure that the director can act with a due degree of independence within the accepted framework and also that his voice will carry clear authority.  The present salary level is too low.  It should be seriously considered that the post carry the grade of Assistant Secretary.  It should certainly not be less than that of the directors of the National Gallery and the National Library, namely principal officer.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a National Archives Advisory Council is both welcome and necessary.  Its main functions <Col N="1059" /> should be to provide advice on the categories of records which warrant scheduling and preservation.  Secondly, to act as a users' council furnishing suggestions regarding access to and use of records and the efficiency of the search room and finding aids.  Finally, the council should formulate recommendations on archival policy.  This advisory council, I would urge, should have a representative membership, but should in particular have a proportion of young working historians who will be frequent users.</P>
    <P>Like previous speakers I hope to raise a number of issues on Committee Stage. In conclusion, I again wish to emphasise that unless the essential staff are provided this Bill will be a dead letter.  I look forward to the Minister's reply and I warmly support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I, too, should like to welcome the Minister of State for coming here at, no doubt, short notice and, of course, I also welcome the Bill.  I express my own enthusiasm for it.  I was intrigued to hear Senator Higgins linking the public perception of the Seanad as a place where aged people discuss ageing matters with this National Archives Bill and suggesting that there was a certain appropriateness attached to our discussing the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to say that people who have a sensitivity for history, a sensitivity for the institutions of State and a feeling of patriotism and love of country should be enthused about the fact that this Bill is before the House today.  I am one of those people and I particularly warmly and enthusiastically welcome this measure. I pay tribute to the Taoiseach who has personally backed the Bill and put a great deal of his own experience into it. I regret that he is ill today and cannot be here to inject his personal style and enthusiasm into the presentation of the Bill.  Nevertheless, the Minister of State did a perfectly good job and I am grateful to him for being here.  I hope, however, that the Taoiseach will be well enough to respond to the Second Stage debate next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1060" /> This important measure will be welcomed by all fair-minded historians and archivists.  It is obvious from a perusal of the various sections that wide and detailed consultations have been undertaken by the Department in drafting the Bill.  Nevertheless, I take the point made by Senator Higgins that if amendments come from this House, despite the fact that consultations and examinations of archives Acts elsewhere have taken place, those humble domestic amendments should be given the consideration they deserve.</P>
    <P>The making of adequate arrangements for the preservation of a country's records is an inescapable duty of Government in any civilised society.  That is precisely what we are about today.  This legislation provides for the formal amalgamation of the State Paper Office and the Public Record Office to be called the National Archives.  There will be a new advisory council with new powers and increased responsibilities.  The Bill is being introduced against a background where the principal legislative arrangements for archives are now over 100 years old.  I am speaking about the Public Record (Ireland) Act, 1867.  It is surprising that no legislation affecting archives has been enacted since the foundation of the State. It is a hallmark of our maturity as a nation that we should busy ourselves in this area and ensure that we have good, adequate, up-to-date legislation on this matter.  It is for this reason that I warmly welcome the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important on Second Stage to look at the context of the legislation.  It is worth studying the principal features of the Public Record (Ireland) Act, 1867 and of the State Paper Office which was set up in 1702 and which became the Records Department of the then Chief Secretary's Office.  The papers of that office were transferred to the Public Record Office after 50 years.</P>
    <P>The principal features of the Public Record (Ireland) Act, 1867 were to establish the Public Record Office of Ireland and to vest responsibility for its management in a deputy keeper of public records.  It also provided for the deposit <Col N="1061" /> in that office of certain records which were at the time mainly court records. Between 1867 and 1922 the Public Record Office of Ireland was primarily a court repository.  There were no ordinary departments of central Government functioning exclusively in Ireland and the only body of departmental papers to be received were those of the Chief Secretary's Office which were deposited in the State Paper Office before transfer after 50 years to the Public Record Office of Ireland.  This same office also held other records such as ecclesiastical records, records of births, marriages, deaths and records of the old Irish parliament, that is, Grattan's Parliament.</P>
    <P>In 1922, as we all know, the Public Record Office of Ireland, which was a depository for this large collection of both civil, testamentary and ecclesiastical documents, had a disaster when during the Civil War the Four Courts building was bombarded and the destruction virtually eliminated the office's holdings of pre-18th century documents.</P>
    <P>The destruction of what was then the bulk of Irish public records, a rich, proud and valuable heritage was one of the most magnificent collections in the whole of Europe of medieval records, was a most tragic episode in the emergence of our State, the consequences of which we are living with to this day.  We are all impoverished as a result of it.  It was one of the major archive disasters of modern Europe and it not only disheartened Irish archivists but has resulted in deflecting public interest and attention from the enormous collections which either survived or have since been acquired in the State Paper Office and the Public Record Office.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that other countries such as Germany have recovered from World War II archive losses and have built up their archive service.  It has taken us a long time to do it and a long time to pursue a very necessary task but I am very pleased that by this legislation we are doing just that.  It is important that the needs of the research people, and the needs of the public in general, <Col N="1062" /> should be serviced by this kind of legislative provision.  The situation in the field of archives in Ireland seems to be suffering from the late after effects of the destruction of the Public Record Office in 1922. Since then the Public Record Office in Dublin, which was set up 100 years ago by the Public Record Act, 1867, has never got equivalent professional archivist staff and equivalent budget to what it had in the period of British administration. I share the concern of other Senators, particularly Senator Hillery who spoke on this that it is an earnest of the Government's intention that staffing and resources be made available to this new national archive.</P>

      <P>Postal voting is not new to the Members of this House and for that reason I look forward with particular interest to Senators' views on these proposals.</P>
      <P>These draft regulations are laid before the House in accordance with section 82(5) of the Electoral Act, 1963, which provides that, where regulations under that section are proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
      <P>There has been a constant demand for the provision of extended postal voting facilities for many years.  This demand comes in particular from groups representing those who, for reasons connected with their occupations or their health, find it difficult or impossible to vote in person at elections.  In response to this pressure, an extended system of postal voting was introduced for the local elections in 1974 but this facility has not been available at any election since.  This situation is now to be rectified.</P>
      <P>A Bill is being prepared at the moment which will provide for an extended system of postal voting at all elections and referenda. This Bill, which takes account of the views expressed by Deputies and Senators in the various debates in both Houses and in the Joint Committee on Legislation, will entitle certain categories of persons to be registered in the Register of Electors as postal voters.  Persons so registered will vote by post at any election which takes place during the currency of the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The registration of persons as postal voters will be carried out as part of the <Col N="1064" /> normal procedure of compiling the register of electors.  This takes place between September and December each year and I will be bringing forward the legislation as soon as possible so as to ensure that the new system will be in place in time for the 1986 register.  The purpose of the draft regulations now before the House is to bring the postal voting system to be used at the local elections in June into line as far as practicable with the permanent arrangements proposed under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The extended postal voting system for the 1974 local elections was provided for by the Local Elections (Postal Voting) Regulations, 1974.  Under those regulations anybody who could not vote in person by reason of the circumstances of his occupation, service, or employment, absence from the place in respect of which he was registered as an elector, illness or physical disability, or his employment by a returning officer, could apply to vote by post.  These regulations were suspended for the local elections in 1979 because they were held with the European Assembly elections and it was considered that it would not be practicable to run two elections together with different postal voting systems.</P>
    <P>Reaction to the operation of the system in 1974 was mixed.  From an administrative point of view, it worked satisfactorily but many public representatives were unhappy about the security of the system. Despite these reservations, there is general acceptance at this stage of the need to cater for those who, for genuine reasons, cannot vote in person.  What we are trying to do in these regulations therefore, and in the Bill, is to provide a system of postal voting which will minimise the risk of abuses, while continuing to provide a simple and accessible facility.  I will now outline briefly the principal changes which the regulations will effect.</P>
    <P>Under the draft regulations, the persons who will be entitled to vote by post at the local elections will be those who will be unable, or are likely to be unable, to vote in person by reason of (a) the circumstances of their occupation, service or employment, or (b) physical illness or physical disability.  This is a <Col N="1065" /> narrower range of eligibility than applied in 1974, but I believe that those with a genuine claim to a postal vote will be catered for under the regulations.  The electors being catered for are those recommended by the Joint Committee, except for diplomats and certain other categories resident abroad who cannot be registered as electors under existing law. These will be dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are several changes in the application procedure, too.  The time for making applications will be earlier &mdash; from 15 to 30 April.  This will take the processing of applications out of the peak period of pre-election activity and give the returning officer the opportunity and time thoroughly to evaluate and investigate applications.  In addition, applications will now have to be independently supported by a certificate from an employer, or medical practitioner, or by a statutory declaration where a person is self-employed.  This will obviously impose a certain burden but we are satisfied that it is essential for the security of the electoral system.  Finally, the returning officer will have a much more substantial role in dealing with applications.  In 1974, his function was basically to check that applications were properly completed; if they were, he had no option but to register the applicant as a postal voter. Under the new regulations, a returning officer will himself have to be satisfied as to the inability of an applicant to vote in person, regardless of whatever certificate or statutory declaration is on the form. He will be empowered to seek additional information for the purpose of satisfying himself that an applicant is a qualified person and to reject an application where such additional information is not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that one of the major weaknesses in the present system arises in the issue of ballot papers to voters by normal post.  Under the regulations, all ballot papers will in future be sent to voters by registered post.  This means that a signature must be received by the postal authorities for every ballot paper entrusted to them for delivery, a <Col N="1066" /> procedure which should help considerably to ensure that the ballot papers get into the correct hands.  It should also help to trace the culprits if ballot papers are interfered with.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the principal changes which the regulations will make.  What we have attempted to do is to identify the areas which we feel are most open to abuse and to tighten up these areas.  We have done this by restricting the eligibility for a postal vote to those with a genuine and constant problem about voting in person &mdash; I think the very wide scope given by the temporary absence from home provision in 1974 was a potential source of abuse.  We have also given the returning officer a more positive role in adjudicating on applications and placed a greater onus on applicants to satisfy the returning officer as to their inability to vote in person.  And, by pushing back the application period, we are giving the returning officer the time he needs to do a thorough job.  Finally, we have tackled what was generally regarded as the weakest area under the old system &mdash; the actual issue of ballot papers by post.  I feel that the requirement that ballot papers be issued by registered post should close most of the loopholes here.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately been brief in these opening remarks and I have confined myself to dealing only with the essentials of the matter.  Postal voting has been discussed on several occasions in recent years and I know that Senators will already be familiar with the subject.  It was my objective, therefore, not to detain the House unduly.  This is not in any way to suggest that these regulations are not important.  They are indeed very important in that they are regulating the system by which our public representatives will be elected.  They are also very important to those who, up to now, have been effectively prevented from exercising their right to vote.  I think the system which will now be available will meet the needs of these people while protecting the security of the electoral system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I too, like most people, welcome this regulation.  I am delighted that it will be in time for the local government elections.  County registrars throughout the country are awaiting a final date for the local government elections.  That is a very serious situation to leave them in.  As the Minister is aware, they will have to draft regulations and there will have to be a certain legal term of notice given to the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice the date fixed for applying for a postal vote is 15 April.  This is the day after the new register comes into operation. One would need to be very much on one's toes as a voter to ensure one sees the register first to see whether one is on it and then apply to the county registrar for a postal vote if one is in one of the categories mentioned by the Minister.  It behoves the Minister today to announce the date of the local government elections, so that most of the county registrars can put in train the necessary <Col N="1068" /> machinery as regards getting the regulations, including this regulation printed and making the public aware of the importance of this regulation.  That is the first thing.  I will be disappointed if the Minister does not make that announcement before he leaves this House this evening.  It is time someone told us whether the elections will be this year or next year.  There is an urgency about this regulation and the public should be informed of the date of the elections.  There is nothing to hide.  There is nothing to be gained by not announcing the date.  I do not know if there is any leakage.  I am not aware of the date but I have heard 26 June and other dates mentioned.  The Minister should not leave this House this evening without announcing the date and letting county registrars to put in train immediately with the printers the notice which will go into the local and national papers.  We are aware that the county registrar for this purpose will be the county secretary of each local authority and each urban and municipal authority involved in the local government elections. It behoves the Minister to make that announcement on behalf of the Government and let the people know the date of the elections.  If there is to be an election in June, there is an urgency because there is a time limit.  From today until the application date for a postal vote there is only one calendar month.  That is a very short period.  Time moves on fairly fast.  It is important that we know the date at this stage.</P>
    <P>This is a regulation governing local elections only.  I would take it that local elections will be held this year.  If a Bill is going to be brought in at a later date that will include EC elections, Dáil elections and referenda there would be no need for this regulation if the local government elections were not being held this year.</P>
    <P>This regulation precedes the Bill.  I am delighted that the disabled people are getting an opportunity to cast their vote in the forthcoming local government elections and other elections that will take place.  Senior citizens are the people who are hurt most by inability to cast <Col N="1069" /> their vote.  They remember when only the householder of each household was allowed to vote until we got our native Government.  They welcome the right to vote.  They welcome the right to have a say in the selection of their local representative.</P>
    <P>Many incapacitated and disabled people were under a disadvantage when they tried to be mobile and to get to the polls.  Some of the polling stations were not accessible and these people had to be carried in from their wheelchairs because the necessary arrangements were not made for taking wheelchairs into some polling booths.  This regulation is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I know that the county secretary, who will be the county registrar, will be the deciding person in all these applications. That will require intense research by the staff of county secretaries in local authorities. It will require time to process all the applications after 30 April.  This gives only the month of May for processing and distributing postal votes and ensuring that they are returned in time for inclusion in the count.</P>
    <P>There is an urgency and a speed required here that I am sure the Minister and his Department have taken into account.  It will need intensive research. If the county secretaries have to make the decision, they will have to undertake detailed research.</P>
    <P>I also want to know from the Minister the position as regards fishermen who will be away from their base, who will be at sea and will be on the register.  What provisions are made in the regulation for this type of voter?  I also want to know the position as regards island dwellers who may be marooned from their homes perhaps on the mainland and will not be able to get back to the islands in order to cast their votes on election day.  What provision is made in the regulation for this type of voter?  Will he be able to apply from the mainland to have his vote posted to him?  He does not come within the categories mentioned.  Perhaps the wide ranging term &ldquo;self-employed or employed in another field of activity&rdquo; may cover him.  If he is on a business trip <Col N="1070" /> is he covered?  If he is attending a wedding or death on the mainland, is he covered? I would like the Minister to spell that out, because that is a very important issue. The trial spin, as I call it, will show up teething problems and that will be of major importance in drafting a new Bill. Worthwhile knowledge will be gained from the operation of the postal vote in local elections.</P>
    <P>I was a candidate when the last postal vote was in operation and there were several abuses at that time.  I would like to see those abuses eliminated.  They left a bad taste and did not do any good to the franchise system.  As a result of this trial spin, I hope we will be in a position to clear up a lot of the abuses that occurred in 1974.  There will be some abuses in this election also but the experience will be valuable in drafting a Bill to cover all facets of elections and referenda.  Careful study should be made of the operation of the postal vote at this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very wary indeed about the introduction of this regulation, from the experience that I had in 1974. My colleague on the other side of the House referred to this as a trial spin.  I do not think local elections should be used as a trial spin because local elections are very, very important elections.  Members of local authorities are extremely important people and I do not think they should be used as guineapigs to try out any regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Minister's intention to introduce a regulation before the local elections. I have no inside information, any more than my colleague on the other side of the House, but I gather that the <Col N="1071" /> elections will be held this year and I am preparing for them.  That makes me wary from the experience I have had in the compilation of the register in County Donegal for this year.  Might I draw the Minister's attention to the dates on which the registers are compiled?  They are compiled between September and December.  Revision courts are being prepared for and preparation work is taking place throughout the Christmas and New Year period.  I ask the Minister to consider changing that completely to start some time in September and end on 15 April or some time after that.</P>
    <P>Might I also draw the Minister's attention to section 15 (3) of the Act where registrars in an authority shall send notice of the decision on each claim or objection to the claimant or objector and to any other person appearing to them to be interested, together with an intimation of the right of appeal against the decision of the Circuit Court under section 8 of the Electoral Act, 1963.  That is not being done.  When the decision of the court is against the interest of the person, they are notified of the decision of the court but there is no intimation given to them of their right to appeal to the Circuit Court and that should be done.  I draw the Minister's attention to this because of the experiences that I have had this year in County Donegal.  I am going to mention three of them.  One was where a rate collector included in the draft register for this year in County Donegal two persons who have been living abroad for 20 years and had been ruled against by the county registrar in the revision court of last year.  I have no doubt that the decision of the rate collector to include those persons was a political decision. The second was where the mother of a person who had reached the legal age was asked by another rate collector to have her son included and that person was omitted from the register, despite the duty of the rate collector to have him included.  The third case, in which I played a role, was where two people were removed from the register by the county registrar on the sworn evidence of a <Col N="1072" /> county councillor that the persons concerned were not resident at the place where they were entitled to be registered on 15 September.  These people had to travel some distance to establish by sworn affidavit that they were resident at that spot, not only on 15 September but until 26 November.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to a revision court in County Donegal that I can only describe as a sham &mdash; I would like a public investigation into that sham &mdash; where a number of appeals for including extra persons on the register were put in at a late date, were initially refused and then accepted by the rate section of Donegal County Council, where the revision court was moved from Letterkenny town to Ramelton town, where no notification was given to some public representatives of the moving of the venue, or the time, or the date of that revision court, where the rate collector involved simply gave evidence to the county registrar on the advice of a county councillor and former Member of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are discussing postal voting and if Senator Loughrey wants to criticise the county registrar of County Donegal he will have a rostrum where he can do that at a later date.  He should not avail of this House for doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator would like to join me later I will give him a sample of light footwork.  If postal voting is to be based on the registers as they were compiled this year in Donegal I ask the Minister if he has any authority to bring to court members of a county council who give sworn evidence in order to keep themselves on the register.  Is it proper that somebody who was residing <Col N="1074" /> with his wife at a particular place of residence can be removed from that place of residence because a member of the county council is prepared to swear lies against them and that they must travel distances to give sworn affidavits in order to defend their right to vote?  Regulations are being introduced to give postal votes while at the same time persons who are entitled to vote are being denied that right.  Section 15(3) of the Act provides that notices shall be sent of the decision on each claim or objection to the claimant and to the objector, together with an intimation of the right to appeal against the decision of the Circuit Court.  Is this being done?  In my experience it has not been done where they have been ruled against.  I would be ready to support the regulation inasmuch as it gives the right to vote to persons who should have the right to vote &mdash; persons who are infirm, persons whose positions of employment render them for that day or for a number of days unable to be present to vote &mdash; but when the Members on the other side of the House refer to dancing, the light footwork which they enacted in 1974 left no dancing classes to be required by some of the persons who are carrying out that light footwork.</P>

      <P>I was not, because I was elected subsequently and I hope to be elected in June if the Minister so orders that the elections be held in June. I will be pleased to come back to give another lecture to the Members of the Opposition on how to treat this matter properly.  There is a saying: &ldquo;Beware of Greeks bearing gifts&rdquo;.  When Fianna Fáil welcome something I am inclined to ask myself: &ldquo;What is in it for them.  Why are they so pleased to welcome it?  Is there something there that I have not seen?&rdquo;<Col N="1075" /> From my experience in 1974, there is something in it for them but I did not see it.  The regulations can be abused.  I would ask the Minister to go through each one of the regulations.</P>
      <P>What happens a small farmer in receipt of unemployment assistance?  Is he deemed to be self-employed?  The declaration of being self-employed has to be signed by a peace commissioner or commissioner for oaths.  I would ask the Minister to delete &ldquo;peace commissioner&rdquo; because while 90 per cent of peace commissioners are very honourable people, 100 per cent of them have been political appointments.  I am sure they would act in the best interests of whatever party appointed them.  I take it that the Minister and his departmental advisers have been very careful in drawing up the regulations but I question the use of this election as a guineapig because local authority elections are very important. Senator O'Toole will agree with me when I say that members of local authorities are very important persons.  They should not be treated as guineapigs in this regard.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister make it clear if we are giving power to one person to decide whether an application for a postal vote is a valid application or not?  If that person applies political judgment as I have seen it applied in the revision courts in County Donegal, I would be still more wary of the regulations. We had for a number of years in Donegal the migratory worker, a type of person who no longer exists.  We do not have migratory workers in the west of Ireland: we have people working abroad who cannot find work at home and come back for a fortnight or three weeks' holidays or maybe come twice a year.  It is suggested that if they provide a letter requesting to be left on the register they may be left there.  Can they apply for a vote?  If their normal place of residence is England, Scotland or Wales and if they apply for a postal vote or if somebody applies on their behalf, must the peace <Col N="1077" /> commissioner witness the signature as it is being made or the signature as he might know it to be?  It is very doubtful that he would know what a person's signature was like.  I have great and grave reservations in view of the catastrophe of 1974. It might have been a worse catastrophe: I might not have been elected but I was. The abuses that existed in 1974&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>If we might withdraw from the battles of Donegal for a few minutes I can be very brief about this.  I, unlike Senator Loughrey, wholeheartedly welcome these regulations basically because of something I have been interested in for some considerable time, that those people in our population who are severely disabled and who are now denied a vote, should be enabled to vote.  I hope very much that, as promised by the Minister, there will be a Bill to enable this type of person to vote at all elections in the future and that this Bill will come in very rapidly.  Obviously, I cannot enter into the difficulties raised by Senator Loughrey but I suggest that these are difficulties which relate to the basic <Col N="1078" /> register rather than to whether one can vote or not.</P>
      <P>If there are difficulties as to the basic register this should be dealt with through other legislation or possibly through a Private Members' Motion or in some other way but not on this regulation.  I would point out, however, that I am elected by an entirely postal vote and all the University Members of the Seanad are so elected.  I do not think that there has been any very great complaint of abuses of this system.  It does rely on the system of registered post as outlined by the Minister for these regulations and even though it is registered post which has to go all over the world, not just Ireland it still seems to work quite satisfactorily. I suggest that if the regulations are properly fulfilled and registered post is used then abuses should not arise.  The main thing is that these regulations will enable disabled persons and the other categories which are also important and are covered by the regulations, to vote.  Important though they are, people who are working away from home at least have the chance of going to a polling station; they have the chance of being able to organise their employment so as to vote, whereas people who are physically unable to go to a polling station are totally denied the vote.  One of them, Mrs. Draper, brought a case to the court to try to ensure her ability to vote and, unfortunately, it was ruled that it was not a matter that the Acts were unconstitutional and that she could not overthrow them on the basis of unconstitutionality. I am delighted to welcome these regulations and I hope that the Bill will be brought forward to carry them into all elections as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BridRodgers" hpid="Mrs. Rogers Mrs. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see these regulations before the House.  I come from a part of Ireland where abuse of the voting system has almost reached disaster proportions, so much so that we have now reached a situation where we have to have identification when we go to the polls.  It has been suggested that it is coming near to the stage of a police state. <Col N="1079" /> If that is the case, those who are responsible are those who have been abusing the system.</P>
      <P>There are just a few points I want to mention with regard to the regulations. The first is that it is good that everyone who is entitled to vote should be able to vote.  I welcome the fact that disabled and sick people and old people who cannot leave their homes will now have the same right as all other citizens.  That is only simple justice.</P>
      <P>On the question of persons who are applying for a postal vote on the basis of illness or disability, I note that the regulation is that a medical practitioner must sign the form.  We have discovered in Northern Ireland that that may give rise to a certain amount of abuse and it might be a good idea to make the regulation to provide that the form must be signed by the person's own doctor, not any doctor.  That was introduced in the North some years ago and it has ruled out a certain amount of abuse.</P>
      <P>I do not know if any consideration is being given to the idea of a permanent list of absent voters, as we call them, because it cuts out a lot of the work in advance if you do have a permanent list. There are some people who are permanently disabled and who are never going to be able to vote.  It is useful to have those people on what is known as a permanent list, having had their doctor's signature, which means that those people do not have to reapply every time there is an election.  The problem of some of those people dying between one election and the next can be dealt with by checking with their doctor, assuming that it is their own doctor who has originally signed the forms and that their own doctor is known. In other words, the permanent list would have to be examined every time an election comes up to see if some people have to be struck off it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of sending out the ballot papers by registered post is very important. We have had experience in Northern Ireland, where we have had the postal vote for the same categories as suggested here for many years, of postmen being <Col N="1080" /> waylaid along the way and the postal votes never reaching the people to whom they were sent.  The problem of occupation has to be defined &mdash; postal votes on the basis of occupation.  I presume that also includes students who very definitely need postal votes because many of them are away at universities and are registered in their home places and elections often happen during the college year. This gives rise to a certain amount of abuse and we have seen it in recent elections in the North where votes were applied for for students, let us say in Queens' University, not by the students themselves &mdash; it is very difficult to check up on that particularly if it is near the election time &mdash; and the votes were to be sent to an address in Belfast, which was the regulation &mdash; that you give your address at Queen's or where you were staying &mdash; but in effect what was happening was that other people were applying and giving an address to which the postal vote was to be sent which was, of course, not that particular student's address. That is an area where there can be abuse unless the regulation is tightened up considerably. People have to be certain, first of all, that the student has applied.  Perhaps the student when applying should get the signature of a tutor or someone in the university on the form which would make it clear that it was the student who was applying and therefore that the student's address would be the correct one.</P>
    <P>In dealing with occupation I wonder if members of the security forces who would be in other places on the day of the election and not able to vote, or people like long-distance lorry drivers who might even be out of the country on the day of the voting, or student nurses who perhaps would not be at their home base are included.  The other category very often forgotten is journalists who very often at election time are in different parts of the country and not at their home base and therefore are not able to vote. Journalists, like everyone else, have rights and ought to be considered as coming within the &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; provision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> I do not want to be too long-winded because I know there are a lot of speakers. It is important, in making provision for people to have postal votes, to be very much aware of the fact that abuses can happen and have happened in the past and will be attempted and, therefore, that it is important to tighten up the regulations as much as possible.  In line with that, the idea of providing that the time for application is well in advance of the election is very good and one that we might take example from in the North, because if application is delayed, it is not physically or practically possible to deal with the amount of work that comes in and, above all, to examine the bona fides of the applicants.  Therefore, it is a very good innovation to have the postal vote application time well in advance of the election itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>In every area in every election there are persons whose names are on the register of electors but who are unable to go in person to the polling station to vote.  We are all aware of this fact.  A check of the register of electors in any polling station on polling day in any election will reveal that there are persons registered as voters who for a variety of reasons cannot cast their votes. The people I refer to are those electors who by reason of being sick, disabled, away from home or otherwise so occupied that it is not possible for them to go in person to the polling station to cast their votes.  Since it is desirable that every citizen, as far as possible, should participate in the electoral process, I am in favour of a system which will enable the maximum number of electors to cast their votes in any election.  A postal voting arrangement for voters who would not otherwise be able to cast their votes is one way of facilitating or encouraging maximum participation in the electoral process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of people cherish deeply the right to vote.  It is a right that was dearly won by our ancestors and it should not be viewed or exercised lightly. The right of the sick or disabled to cast their votes is no less than the right of <Col N="1082" /> those who can do so without any difficulty or inconvenience.  Therefore, I believe that voting by such people should be facilitated in every possible way.  In the same way I believe that any other individual or category of electors who for genuine reasons cannot go in person to their polling stations should not be deprived of their right to vote if it is at all possible to make arrangements to enable them to do so.  In principle, I agree with the idea of postal voting for such persons and I welcome the statement by the Minister that a Bill is being prepared which will provide postal voting in all elections and referenda from next year onwards.  I wish the Minister well in this undertaking because the preparation of a worthwhile postal voting Bill will not be an easy task by any standard.  To be worthwhile, such a Bill cannot be too restrictive and yet it must safeguard against the possibility of abuse.  It will not be an easy task for the Minister to get the balance right.</P>
    <P>The first time postal voting was introduced in this country for persons other than gardaí or Army personnel was in the 1974 local election.  In my view that experiment was not a success.  Under the Local Elections (Postal Voting) Regulations, 1974 almost anybody was entitled to apply to vote by post since absence from the place in which one was registered as an elector was accepted as grounds for the granting of a postal vote. Anyone who was a candidate in the local elections of that year knows what happened but in case the Minister does not, I will tell him.</P>
    <P>Certain individuals armed themselves with pockets full of application forms for postal votes.  Persons whose names were on the register but who were no longer in the area and, indeed, in some cases who were no longer in this world, had applications for postal votes made on their behalf by zealous election workers and, in some cases, over-zealous candidates. Every kind of excuse was given for absence from the area on election day. Some were going to weddings in far away places and others had appointments with medical specialists of every conceivable type.  Many elderly persons and persons <Col N="1083" /> living alone were persuaded by the same election workers and candidates to apply for postal votes on medical grounds.</P>
    <P>The returning officers were swamped with applications when they were up to their eyes in all the other preparations for the holding of the elections.  Applications were not scrutinised at all or were insufficiently scrutinised and postal ballot papers were issued to all applicants.  On the day the postal ballot papers were being delivered the postman was shadowed on his rounds by one of the individuals to whom I referred, the zealous election worker or the over-zealous candidate.  The ballot papers were collected within minutes of being delivered &mdash; in some cases before the envelope was even opened.  I heard of one case where the gentleman who collected the envelope pointed out to the elderly householder that the envelope in question was addressed to the householder's recently deceased brother and was from the Land Commission and was in connection with the late brother's smallholding which the Land Commission had plans to acquire. However, everything would be sorted out and the acquisition proceedings would be halted.  That poor, harmless man gladly handed over that ominous looking brown envelope without even opening it.</P>
    <P>I am aware of another case where it was widely known two days before the election how many postal votes a particular candidate would have and the forecast was exactly correct.  Everybody involved in local elections was very relieved when it was announced that there would not be extended postal voting in the 1979 local elections.  The reason given at the time was that the 1979 local elections were being held in conjunction with the European elections and that it would not be practicable to run two elections together with different postal voting arrangements for each.</P>
    <P>It is also true to say that most existing local authority members felt somewhat apprehensive when it was learned that postal voting was being re-introduced for this year's local elections.  However, in the draft regulations which are before <Col N="1084" /> the House the Minister has attempted to tighten up the system.  The possibility of abuse has been reduced but, in my view, not eliminated.  The restriction on the categories of persons who will qualify to vote by post will, without a doubt, reduce the possibility of abuse but, because of the restriction, many who for genuine reasons cannot vote in person are not being catered for.  The draft regulations provide only for those who are likely to be unable to vote in person by reason of (a) the circumstances of their occupation, service or employment, or (b) physical illness or physical disability.</P>
    <P>Senator Rogers referred to students and I would like to ask the same question. What about students who may be doing examinations at centres far from their homes on the day of the election?  They do not appear to be catered for.  I understand that the date of the local elections has not yet been officially announced and I join with Senator O'Toole in appealing to the Minister to announce today the date of the local elections.  The speculation seems to indicate a date towards the end of June.  That is the time of the year when many students sit for examinations. I am thinking in particular of the thousands of students who sit for the matriculation examination at centres far removed from their homes.  It is possible that hundreds or even thousands of school leavers, many of whom will be entitled to vote for the first time in the local elections, will not be able to cast their votes if they are doing the matriculation examination when the local elections are held.  The reason for this is that the number of matriculation examination centres is limited and many students, from rural areas especially, sit for this examination in centres such as Dublin, Cork or Galway.</P>
    <P>It would be regrettable if a situation were to arise which would result in these young people being deprived of their votes.  I ask the Minister, in the case of students doing examinations, to instruct returning officers to treat them as persons who could be regarded as entitled to a postal vote because of the circumstances of their occupation.  In other words, they <Col N="1085" /> could be treated as a category of self-employed persons.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations also tighten up the application procedure.  Applications for postal votes must be submitted between 15 April and 30 April.  This arrangement will give returning officers the time necessary to scrutinise and investigate every application carefully and to seek further information if necessary in order to satisfy themselves that any particular applicant is entitled to a postal vote.  However, the deadline of 30 April will mean that persons who become ill or suffer an accident after that date will be precluded from obtaining a postal vote. Perhaps the Minister would consider an arrangement whereby late applications would be accepted from persons who could establish that their illness or disability arose subsequent to 30 April.  It seems very unjust that a person who suffers an accident on 29 April will be able to obtain a postal vote while a person who suffers a similar accident two days later will not.</P>
    <P>In the case of an application for a postal vote in respect of which further information is sought by the returning officer the applicant must supply the required information within seven days.  The draft regulations state:</P>
    <P>If he fails to supply the information so required within seven days of being so required, the returning officer shall rule that the application is invalid and shall cause the application form to be marked accordingly.</P>
    <P>I am not happy that the time allowed to an applicant in this situation is reasonable or sufficient.  Does the seven days period start on the day on which the returning officer's request is issued to the applicant? Having regard to the 1937 Interpretation Act it must commence on that day.  If so, let us assume that the letter from the returning officer requesting additional information is dated and posted on 31 May, 1985.  The information so required must then be supplied on or before 6 June.  As 31 May is a Friday, and because the following Monday is a <Col N="1086" /> bank holiday, in many parts of the country the letter will not reach the applicant until Wednesday, the second delivery day after posting.  Even if it were possible for the applicant to supply the information requested by return of post, the reply if posted on Wednesday would not in many cases be delivered until Friday, the second delivery day again after posting. It would then be late, since Friday will be 7 June.  However, I would envisage that in most cases the information sought will have to be obtained and certified. Therefore, it will not be possible to send it by return of post.  Consequently, the seven days allowed in the regulations is far too short.  I would go as far as to say that it is totally inadequate and should be extended to 14 days.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the ballot papers will be sent to voters by registered post.  At least, there will be a record of the signature of the person who accepts delivery of the envelope containing the ballot paper.  If not already the case, it should be an offence for a postal voter to deliver the ballot paper issued to him or her to any other person unless it is sealed in the envelope provided for its return. It should be an even greater offence carrying a much stiffer penalty for anybody to seek to obtain a ballot paper from a postal voter.  Another safeguard I would like to see is that the application forms for postal votes should not be obtainable <i>ad lib</i>, as they were in 1974.  They should be numbered and obtainable only in post offices or Garda stations.  Every person requesting an application form for a postal vote should have to sign it, giving the name of the person for whom it is required.  This would prevent a recurrence of the 1974 situation when, as I said, certain individuals had their pockets filled with forms.</P>
    <P>The last couple of points I want to make are in relation to the application forms also.  When the applicant has completed section (a) the medical or employer certificate or the statutory declaration must then be completed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory declaration in most cases will be signed by a peace commissioner in which case there would be no charge to the applicant.  The same will apply as far as those applications which will be accompanied by an employer's certificate.</P>
      <P>There is just one question I would like to ask concerning the employer's certificate. What will be the position in the case of somebody such as a nurse employed by a health board?  Whose signature will be acceptable in the case of such an applicant? Will the signature of the CEO of the health board be required or will the signature of somebody such as the matron of the hospital in which the nurse is employed be accepted?  This is something on which there should be uniformity as between the various returning officers throughout the country.  In the case of the medical certificate which must be completed where the application for a postal vote is made on the grounds of illness or disability, I am sure most doctors will not charge for completing the certificate.  Certainly, the question will not arise in the case of applicants who are medical cardholders.  However, the doctors would be entitled to charge non-medical cardholders for signing medical certificates.  I do not believe that it would be proper, and it might be unconstitutional, that anybody would have to pay a fee in order to exercise the right to avail of a postal vote.  Therefore, the Minister should request the medical profession to provide medical certificates in connection with these regulations free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An applicant for a postal vote should not have to pay postage on the application. It is stated in page six of the draft regulations that if you were sending the form by post you should please affix a stamp to the envelope.  This may be said to be a very small point but I would not agree.  This requirement is a breach of the principle that one should not have to pay for the right to cast one's vote. Payment of postage on applications should be made unnecessary by the provision of postage paid envelopes with the application forms.  I will be interested in <Col N="1088" /> hearing the Minister's replies to some of the points that I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the regulations before us.  The Minister has done a fine job in simplifying and at the same time copperfastening to a great extent the regulations that existed in 1974.  The point has been well made here today, and many times since 1974, of the abuse that took place then.  We will no doubt be watching with interest the operation of these new regulations.</P>
      <P>I welcome the registered post aspect because, if the 1974 regulations had included a provision for registered post only, much of the abuses that took place on that occasion would not have occurred.  Every effort should be made to ensure that as many people as possible are given the opportunity to cast their votes, not only in local elections but in all elections that take place.  I am often of the opinion that insufficient attention is given by politicians, and particularly by the relevant Ministers during their terms of office, to this matter.  We have an excellent record with regard to voting, with a few exceptions, the most glaring of which is the 1960 local elections when the vote was around 30 or 31 per cent, the poorest showing ever in an election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should not be taken for granted that all our citizens will be as eager to vote as they have appeared to be over the years. A lot will depend on the behaviour of politicians and the service that politicians give to the electorate.  Certainly, this measure is an effort to ensure that the less well-off in our community will be given the opportunity of casting their votes by post.  This means a lot to them. I have seen people who have been on the register for many years and have gone to the polling booth to cast their votes.  Their satisfaction is not appreciated until one meets a person who has been for many years on the electoral register and one polling day arrives at the polling booth to discover that through an error his name has been omitted.  It certainly has happened in my area in almost every election which I took part in that if I did not get the complaint on the day of the election <Col N="1089" /> I would get it afterwards.  People arrive at the polling booth to find that their names were omitted, for whatever reason, from the electoral register.  If one was to meet such a person on polling day only then would it be appreciated the value a vote is to all of us but particularly to those who cannot get to the polling booth.  They have always felt deprived, not only on election day but during election campaigns and when elections were over.  I met a person on polling day whose name was not on the register.  I met him a week later and he said he was highly annoyed and wanted to take the matter to court.  He wanted me to investigate whether it was possible for him to take it to court.  He had been voting for upwards of 50 years and his name was then omitted, through an error, from the electoral register and he did not have a vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I met this man a week later.  He explained that, even though he now discovered that his vote would not have made any difference to the election he still felt he had lost something in his life by being unable to vote.  I believe that the people to whom the Minister is now proposing to bring this exercise of the franchise will thank him for it and will greatly appreciate it even though some of them in his own area may not even support him.  They will certainly appreciate the Minister giving them the opportunity of casting their votes, whether it will be in the Minister's direction or against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we should take it for granted that the vast majority of our citizens will continue to vote.  I would ask the Minister during his time in this Department to pay some attention to this.  Indeed, it might be no harm &mdash; this has been suggested by some previous speakers &mdash; if some consideration were given to identification.  Perhaps we are coming up to the day when we should <Col N="1090" /> present identification and indeed maybe extend our polling over more than one day.  This happens in Sweden where each person has identification and can collect his polling card over a period of two weeks.  I would not like to see us getting into that position here, nor would I like to see us getting into the position that obtains in other countries where a person refuses to cast his vote or does not have a legitimate reason for abstaining from voting.  At the same time we must give every encouragement and opportunity to our citizens, whether they be invalids or old people who cannot physically attend the polling booths to cast their votes. There are others, of course, who cannot be physically present at their own polling stations for other reasons.  Many of them have been mentioned here &mdash; nurses, students, commercial travellers, journalists and others who find it necessary to be away from home on polling day.  It is only right that they should be given the opportunity to cast their votes in this way.</P>
    <P>There is also the category, while it is dealt with to some extent in the regulations, of election personnel.  It will not be possible for those engaged in the election to be present at their home stations.  I dealt with that here before.  Indeed, I raised it in the other House also when I was a Member of it.  I failed to make any real progress with regard to these people. They are not adequately dealt with in the regulations before us today because the returning officer will not know his personnel until it is too late for them to apply for postal votes.  Most of them will not be known.  The returning officer is not appointed in the first place until it is too late to apply as there is a set time for applying for postal votes.  Many of those who are working and operating the polls will be denied the opportunity of voting because many of them are appointed to polling booths outside the area in which they reside and in which they could cast their votes.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give some attention to this and to issue some instructions to returning officers to appoint, in so far as possible, personnel from their home areas and their own polling booths <Col N="1091" /> so that as many as possible will be able to cast their votes on polling day.  In the Dublin area particularly where the areas are so small, it is very easy for a returning officer to appoint personnel without giving some attention to the fact that a person he is appointing to a polling station may be living only down the road but his polling station is in the other electoral area across the street.  It would not be possible for him to cast his vote.  I would ask the Minister to issue some instructions or request to returning officers to appoint presiding officers and polling clerks in their own polling stations, or certainly in their own electoral areas.</P>
    <P>The other point I am concerned about, and it has been dealt with by the previous speaker, is the seven days' requirement for the return of the registrar's query.  If a person who is working away from home applies for a postal vote &mdash; say, a person in the west working in Dublin, or a Dublin person working in the west &mdash; that request will arrive at his home very likely when he is away for the week and he does not arrive back until the weekend. A weekend may not be an appropriate time to get the required information. This seven days provision is totally inadequate to meet the requirements of many people who are away from home.  I would ask the Minister if it would be possible to extend that period.</P>
    <P>I know we here can either reject or accept the regulations.  I have no hesitation in saying that I believe the House will readily accept them.  I would ask the Minister if it would be possible for him to ensure in the meantime, between now and the carrying out of these regulations that the county registrar or county secretary be given a further seven days at least in regard to this requirement.  I am sure the Minister will find a way of doing that and maybe of bringing a further amendment before the House, or he may be able to do it without having to do that. Certainly I would implore him to consider extending the seven days because that would benefit very many people.  The vast majority of those whom it is intended to benefit will be away from home for most <Col N="1092" /> of the time, and seven days would be totally insufficient for them.</P>

      <P>I do not presume I will throw any more light on the subject than has already been done here this afternoon, except to welcome this as one of the plethora of measures that we have had coming before us in both this and the other House in recent times in connection with the local elections.  Obviously, the one area that most people are concerned about is whether these elections will be held this year at all.  One would be inclined to the view that where a Government are so anxious to introduce all the paraphernalia around them and yet reluctant to give the date that perhaps they have something else in mind.</P>
      <P>The Minister might be in a position to give us some firm undertaking as to whether this election will be held in this year or not.  It is quite relevant as far as a number of aspects of this Bill is concerned.  In particular, applications will have to be submitted between 15 and 30 April.  The Minister will accept that all over the country those who are employed have difficulty by virtue of their being away from their place of residence at the time of voting.  Employers and employees generally make the best possible effort to be available in or about their place of residence for voting.  In order that employers and employees alike could make some arrangements to be near their places of residence, they obviously would want to know the date of the elections. That would at least alleviate some of the problems.  That is one area where Senators would be anxious to hear from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In earlier contributions Senator Loughrey of Donegal seemed to be still <Col N="1093" /> suffering from some of the battle fatigue from being pulped up in the Donegal postal voting machine on the last occasion.  I presumed that it was entirely peculiar to Donegal until I heard Senator Mullooly speak about Roscommon.  The south of the country seemed to be spared from the worst effects of the last postal vote in 1974.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously some Senators are going to have problems.  They did not seem to be as acute in the south as they were in the areas referred to.  However, leaving this aside, the Minister has gone a long way towards removing the problems which showed up on that occasion and has, by a number of measures taken in the Bill, tried to correct them.</P>
      <P>In the event of an election being held in June of this year, there will be reasonable time for the returning officer to process and properly identify the qualified applicants under this scheme before the onslaught of the election itself.  The fact that the postal vote is by registered post should also be a help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to &ldquo;the circumstances of their occupation, service or employment&rdquo; and (b) &ldquo;physical illness or physical disability.&rdquo; I notice in all of these areas we refer to physical disability or physical illness.  It will be appreciated that in recent years fairly genuine attempts have been made to assist and rehabilitate and bring into open employment people who are mildly mentally handicapped and people who may not always be in a position to assess fully what their actions should or should not be in any given circumstances.  Genuine efforts have been made to try to motivate and to encourage those groups in society to be more involved in every facet of life.  This is an area in which I have a special interest. I am wondering about people in these categories who would be away from home or in institutions or hospitals and where the consultants there were satisfied that they too should have a right to vote. <Col N="1094" /> Will they be covered under these regulations? Naturally, the numbers would be quite small but in terms of trying to encourage and facilitate people who have these handicaps in modern and more open circumstances, I would like to hear what the Minister has to say.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the Senators who spoke in relation to students.  As invariably elections are held in June many of them are scattered all over the country at this time and they are not in a position to finance the travel which is involved.  In what circumstances will this system cope with this kind of situation?</P>
    <P>With these comments I welcome the contents of these regulations.  The Minister should tell the House now, and not be dilly-dallying, the actual date of the elections.  If we knew this most of the provisions in the regulations could be better put into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  There has been a general welcome for these regulations.  Most Senators have already made the case for the extension of the franchise which the regulations will make possible.</P>
      <P>Essentially what is intended are two considerations: one is that the franchise should be extended as widely as possible to include those whose occupations or health preclude them from exercising their vote.  This is one consideration.  The second consideration is that such arrangements as are made should not be amenable to abuse.  I am very impressed by the thoroughness of the observations made by Senators Mullolly and Loughrey. Senator Mullolly went into detail on the different ways in which the regulations made in 1974 had been abused.  The abuse of the ballot has a long history in Irish electoral affairs.  It goes way back before the first secret vote for local elections in 1899 and it was accompanied, at times, by different kinds of intimidation. It is an aspect of our civilisation that we are now able to organise elections a little differently, although we have been slow in making the necessary reforms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to comment on one fundamental point.  I welcome the Minister of <Col N="1095" /> State and I welcome the regulations and the extensions that are contained on behalf of the Labour Party, but I am worried about one point.  The changes in the voting registration arrangements are being made piecemeal.  Frankly, the structure upon which the regulations are placed is one that is out-dated.  We are speaking about regulations that are laid before the House in accordance with section 82 (5) of the basic Electoral Act, 1963.  I am disappointed that we have been so slow to look at the obvious defects in that legislation in relation to the question of the surround of voting itself.  We are in a minority of electoral systems now that allow so many possibilities of abuse in relation to going to the polls.</P>
    <P>In relation to postal voting, people have stated that at least they &ldquo;do not have to go down there now&rdquo;&mdash; the idea of battering their way past people who are busily creating mounds of litter and wasting their own money and public money.  The 1980s have always struck me as a time of appalling mess at polling stations and I am in favour of banning all this activity for, perhaps, 48 hours before polling takes place.  Announcements, speeches and music surrounding polling stations should be eliminated.  There should be listings of contributions made at elections.  There should be an upper limit on the amount of money spent on elections.  All this should have been changed before now.  While there is a certain antiquarian charm in continuing to count votes the way we do, it is inefficient, slow and unacceptable in an electronic age.  It is quaint and should be changed.  The way we conduct elections and the atmosphere surrounding them should be changed.  In the mining towns of Canada they close the pubs for 48 hours before an election so that the people would be somewhat sober as they are carted in to vote.</P>
    <P>We should not be so reluctant to make necessary changes.  Bits and pieces of electoral regulations are no substitute for a fundamental reform of the 1963 Act. This is no reflection on the Minister of State or on the regulations, or on the <Col N="1096" /> speech which he has made here this afternoon. I should like to place that on record.  In the 12 years that I have been here, I have made the point to many different administrations that changes in this area are overdue.  Equally, in relation towards the manner in which a register will be compiled, I support the Senators who have been asking for some form of identification.  Senator Mulloly said that when people request a form they should have to identify themselves or issue a signature.  I support this.  I do not share the reservations of Senator McMahon who said that we are moving too much in the direction of having to produce an identification.  I would welcome us having to produce an identification at the polling stations.  It is a good idea and a much more meaningful control on voting patterns than what we have now.</P>
    <P>I am confused as to what the arrangements are in relation to diplomats.  This is entirely my own fault.  It is wrong that the people who work for us abroad and who are involved in the public service should be unable to vote.</P>
    <P>I was interested too, in another point upon which some Senators touched.  It is in relation to this question of the institutionalised. There is no doubt at all that one of the most pathetic aspects of voting in general has been the abuse of access for patients who are not in a position either physically or mentally to get themselves to the polls.  It would be very wrong if any regulations we made were open to abuse in the same fashion, or with the same consequence as occurred when people abused that aspect of the electoral Acts before now.  In other words, the issuing of a request for a postal vote on behalf of somebody.  That is the point. We would be compounding by regulation what was a defect in relation to a bad practice in the Act itself.  I support those Senators who have made a request to the Minister to think about this in relation to the way it should be done.  I was in anticipation of the Leas-Chathaoirleach asking me a question.  I can assure her that I am not developing any fearful tendencies in her regard at all; she has always been so helpful to me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> Another point is that I think the registered post arrangements for the sending of ballot papers is certainly a very significant advance on the procedures in 1974. With some alarm I listened to Members referring to people going around with pockets full of papers.  I can accept this because I am used to the idea of people travelling around with pockets full of cards going to the polling booths, particularly from the flatland of Dublin, and from areas where students are suspected to stay and so on.  May I very humbly add my support to the case made by Senator Smith for students who are usually away from their polling area?  Students, even to get on the register, have had the most extraordinary problem in getting through not only registration courts but having actually to stake a case before the courts to establish their rights to register under the Act.  It was a long, slow process. Nothing should be placed in their way if they want to register in their way if because of the fact that they are away to earn a living.</P>
    <P>This raises an interesting question.  I was associated somewhat with offering advice on this and I was not able to offer advice on some parts of it.  Those in charge of the registration process interpreted it as the duty of the student to take himself or herself off every register other than the one they sought to be placed on.  We had an argument as to where the obligation lay, on the registration authority or on the person registering and so forth.</P>
    <P>I believe that the basic structure, the Electoral Act, 1963, and the way it is operating is deficient as something upon which to make regulations.  If the whole surround of the voting process is antiquated, out of date, daft and not really helpful towards wider participation, equally the registration process is cumbersome and slow.  There is no doubt at all that a person would encounter the greatest difficulty in getting back an answer to a query from a registrar and having a reply back in time.  It is not possible under the period of time I mentioned. I also think the orientation of the <Col N="1098" /> average person in charge of the registration process would not be such as to do it with such expedition as to facilitate the person involved.  For example, the advertisements for registration are generally placed in newspapers not read by the young.  I write for a small minority paper that is read by a great number of young people under 30 and, for some extraordinary reason, it has never been allocated an advertisement by the Department of the Environment.  The places where the young would read of the registration process are not being used for advertisements for registration.</P>
    <P>I hope that when we make these regulations it may prod us into a fundamental review of the whole voting and registration process.  I very much welcome this motion and I congratulate the Minister on it.  When those responsible come forward with a proposal to amend the basic Act, particularly in regard to those areas I mentioned I will be the first to support it.  The present arrangements are reasons why we are switching people off voting. That has happened because of the hullabaloo that takes place on polling day.  I was almost going to say that it had a carnival atmosphere but it is far from that.  It is very much a kind of dirge-like occasion when people mournfully crowd against each other, elbow each other out of the way and indulge in behaviour that is quite unbecoming in many cases in a modern democracy.  I look forward to fundamental electoral reform that will bring us into the 20th century.  I will be glad to compete in those conditions on any occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support this motion and compliment the Minister on its introduction.  When I was elected to Dáil Éireann one of the first issues I raised &mdash; Fianna Fáil were in Government &mdash; was the fact that people suffering from illnesses such as multiple sclerosis or confined to wheelchairs could not vote at election time.  I was fully conscious of the fact that people who are disabled spend a lot of time reading papers or listening to the news and usually have a very strong interest in politics.  They have <Col N="1099" /> more time than most to read about politicians, sport and so on.  However, on an election day those people are deprived of their voting right because they cannot avail of the facilities at the polling station for one reason or another.  I often wondered why we call ourselves a democratic State when we leave that situation as it is.  I am delighted something is being done about this.  I was sorry that the 1974 regulation was scrapped after only one year.  I know there were numerous complaints at that time but it should have been reviewed and whatever anomalies existed dealt with.  The regulation should have been streamlined in order to ensure that the system operated correctly.  I was indeed disturbed that last year we could pass a Bill allowing a vote for non-nationals and not incorporate voting rights for people such as invalids.</P>
      <P>I still have worries about the operation of the regulations for the first time.  The draft register will be completed by 15 April and some people on that register will have the letter P in front of their names indicating that they are postal voters.  I presume a supplementary register will be provided.  I can see problems arising and checking and double-checking being necessary.  The Minister should allay the fears that I have of discrepancies in the operation of the system.</P>
      <P>I was disturbed by Senator Loughrey's contribution.  He expressed scepticism because we in Fianna Fáil gave our full support to this motion.  We gave our full support because we were concerned that invalids who are entitled to vote were not given the right to exercise the franchise.  I felt that perhaps Senator Loughrey was not aware that these people existed, judging by his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should let the House know the principle applied when through accident a postal voter is omitted from the final register.  If that person takes an oath will he or she be given a right then to exercise the franchise?  There is confusion in this area.  I know a 70 year old man who voted all his life but when he had moved house he was struck off the register.  He lived in a rural area and <Col N="1100" /> because his name was not on the register in the urban area to which he moved he was not allowed to vote.  He asked to be taken to the local sergeant to take an oath but this was not accepted by the returning officer.  The man felt hurt and remarked that it might be his last time to get a chance to vote.  As it happened, it was his last time because he has since died.  It is a great privilege to have a vote and it is something we should all be proud of.  We should do everything in our power to ensure that the voting system operates as smoothly and effectively as possible so that everybody who has a right to vote can do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's indication that this is the advance guard of a system and that a more fundamental appraisal of the Electoral Act to cater for the problems of voting at Dáil and other elections is to follow.  The reason I do that is that I am not in favour of the regulations before us.  It is acceptable that having had similar regulations in 1974 we should try another experiment this year and I certainly will not oppose the regulations but I am not in favour of them.  I was a candidate in the 1974 local elections and the position was, indeed, far from satisfactory.  All political parties &mdash; it was not confined to any one political party &mdash; abused the position.  One might say that probably the net result was that it was a self-cancelling exercise.  It probably was but abuse of the right to vote by putting undue pressure on elderly people is very serious.  It is much more serious than whether an individual candidate gains or loses votes out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to a document which I will mention later about 1.5 per cent of the electorate applied for postal votes in 1974.  That understates significantly the true percentage of the electorate affected because while 1.5 per cent of the electorate applied they represented between 3 and 4 per cent of the people who voted. In County Leitrim as a county on that occasion 5.3 per cent of the electorate applied for postal votes.  Allowing for the non-voters in County Leitrim on that <Col N="1101" /> occasion nearly 10 per cent of the electorate who voted in County Leitrim used postal votes.  In Milford, County Donegal, 10.7 per cent of the voters applied for postal votes.  Allowing for the non-voters there, up to 15 or 16 per cent of the people of Milford who voted chose to exercise their votes through postal means.  There was widescale abuse of the system and I do not think that the changes the Minister has made have gone anywhere towards meeting the problem.  I realise that there are arguments in favour of extending the system to include those with physical handicaps.  Of course, I understand that and, of course, I understand that we must make facilities available for these people but I do not think these are the right facilities.  That is the point I am making.</P>
    <P>The Government appointed a working party on the register of electors, which reported in March 1983.  I do not think any Member has referred to the fact that they did report.  I am referring to publication 1471.  One of the terms of reference of the working party was to examine and make recommendations on a scheme of postal voting for disabled persons and others who may be unable to vote at an election.  Their report was a very valuable one and I would recommend it to anybody who wants to examine the matter. In fact, the proposals the Minister has brought before us are almost word for word from that working party's report. The matter is dealt with in chapter 8 of the report and their recommendations are given in paragraph 8.7.  The report reviews the position in other countries. For instance, we find that in neither Italy nor Luxembourg are there postal votes. In Belgium and France postal voting has been abolished because of abuse even though there is some arrangement in respect of proxy voting.  In the Netherlands it is only civil servants abroad, and their spouses, who can use the postal vote.  In Germany, United Kingdom, and Denmark there are wide facilities for postal voting.  There is no postal voting arrangement in Greece.</P>
    <P>Other countries have had to tackle this problem and a lot of them have tackled <Col N="1102" /> it by saying they will not have postal voting.  There is, of course, a difficulty with regard to general elections and the kind of postal arrangements which we had in 1974, that is arrangements made when the elections were coming.  They are not suitable for elections the exact date of which is not known.  It is because we have general elections the exact dates of which are not known until shortly beforehand that the 1974 system is not suitable.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is seeking to do is to establish a list which will be produced annually.  It will be a system which can be used, with proper modifications, for general elections and other types of elections. That objective is correct and, obviously, the Minister is wise to give this a trial run because I see this local elections system as being a trial run.  If the same abuses as took place in 1974 take place again, we should set our face against postal voting and just say we will not have postal voting and we are very sorry for people who cannot go out to cast their votes but, that is too bad.  The abuse which took place in 1974 was a scandal.  It was a bigger scandal than denying people votes.  The abuse of a vote is a bigger scandal than denying people a vote.</P>
    <P>The working party to which I referred made a number of recommendations most of which are contained in the regulations which are before us.  The main thrust of the working party's report deals with what it calls the standing list of postal voters.  That standing list of postal voters covers the type of system which is now suggested.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have spoken with regard to the short time, seven days, for allowing people to respond to queries from the officer.  They have a fair point but at the same time the time has got to be reasonably short so as to prevent people who make multiple applications getting time to organise suitable replies. There is one point I am not happy with in the regulations, even allowing for the fact that these regulations are by and large experimental.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> The working party considered, at paragraph 8.6, the question of mental disability and whether people suffering from a mental disability should be facilitated by having a postal vote.  The position is that because of suggested previous abuse of the system a system has been devised where those in mental institutions who are eligible to vote, who are the overwhelming majority of people, are eligible to vote but only in their own home location, the place where they would otherwise be resident if they were not in the hospital.  From a practical point of view that means that many people in mental institutions cannot vote.  The alternative of that was to set up polling booths and to put them on the register there.  However, that gave rise to a situation where there was intensive political activity among the supporters of political parties and the staff of the hospital to influence people with regard to the way in which they should vote.  That is not wise.  That problem of undue pressure could revive if regulations were introduced to give persons with a mental disability the facility of postal voting.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that people of unsound mind are not eligible to vote.  In addition it is true that in all other EC countries mental illness disqualifies people from voting.  Of course, the position is that the vast majority of people in mental institutions are not people of unsound mind.  They may be of unsound mind but they are not, legally speaking, people of unsound mind.  Therefore, they are on the register of electors.  Having considered all these factors the working party arrived at the following conclusion:</P>
    <P>The working party has considered this matter at length and is of the opinion that postal voting facilities should not be extended to persons suffering from mental disability.  There are relatively large numbers of such persons; they are probably more open to undue influence than other categories and, judging from experience in 1966, there would be a risk that they could innocently provide a focus for electoral <Col N="1104" /> abuse.  If postal voting is to become an accepted part of the electoral process, it is important it should be seen to be as free as possible from the potential for abuse.</P>
    <P>The problem I see is that in the regulations as drafted it appears that a convincing case could be made by a person who is in a mental institution that he falls within the category of persons entitled to be considered.  Article 42 of the amended regulations will read that the categories of people entitled to be considered for postal voting will be persons of physical illness or physical disability.  While we all know what mental illness is, a convincing case could be made that it is also physical illness, that it is something to do with the way in which the mind works.  It may be both mental and physical.  The mental illness of a person may be as a result of some physical malfunction of his brain. In those circumstances I would like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of mental hospitals are not under these regulations entitled to be registered.  If they are, that would be an abuse.  That would reimpose pressure on these people.  They were registered in their own home place.  As a result of pressure the facility was removed from them after some particularly unfortunate experiences in elections in areas where there were mental hospitals.  I ask the Minister to consider that carefully.</P>
    <P>I am willing to support the regulations on the basis that they are an experiment but if the position is as chaotic as the 1974 situation we must go back to other suggestions.  For example, we should consider travelling polling booths.  In the case of a person who applies and is put on a postal register a polling booth should visit that person on the day of the election.  It is not so difficult to organise that in this day and age.  That would overcome the difficulty of undue influence which is an unfortunate characteristic of the previous experience of postal voting we have had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief for a number of reasons, largely because the <Col N="1105" /> general franchise is an area that I am not familiar with.  I have a limited franchise. On the other hand I do have a very intimate knowledge of postal voting and, I was going to say, of the potential for abuse but that would sound like a confession. I am well aware of suggestions of abuse.  I have never noticed them in my own constituency in which there are 50,000 postal voters but I am intrigued by the looseness of the arrangements in that election by comparison with the actual vote I have as an elector for the other seats in this House where I have to go through a most extraordinary procedure in order to vote.  I found it extraordinary on the first occasion I was involved. The looseness of the arrangements in the other elections in which Senator Higgins, myself and a number of other people are involved is quite astonishing.</P>
      <P>What I really want to talk about briefly is our perceptions and, in particular, the difficulty we seem to have in perceiving the needs of individual sub groups.  We spend a long time talking about democracy as a mass of people out there.  We are only beginning to realise that we are a collection of minorities among whom we have now identified the handicapped and people who for reasons of employment need postal votes.  It is arguable that there are many women who for reasons to do with their domestic circumstances may find it impossible or extremely difficult to vote.  There is no doubt that certain combinations of socio-economic factors prevent people from voting or people do not bother to vote.  In the Minister's constituency, and in other constituencies in Dublin, the level of participation in elections is frighteningly low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are beginning to talk about encouraging participation, and in a society like we have which is beginning to fall apart at the edges, the effort should be directed towards maximising participation in elections and all other processes. A general Bill on the whole area of electoral activity and electoral participation should begin to recognise that there are all sorts of minority groups. We should look at the possibilities for modifying electoral procedures generally <Col N="1106" /> to increase access.  There is a good case for opening polling booths earlier and leaving them open later.  Some countries have decided for good reasons to have elections on Sundays.  I do not want it to be added to other accusations that I now want to desecrate the Sabbath, but nevertheless, Sunday has a lot of attractions for a lot of people.  There is also a good case to be made in the light of various comments that have been made here, and things I have experienced, for the regulations that exist in other countries whereby election campaigning ends on the night before the election or perhaps even 48 hours beforehand and there can be no further campaigning, to be adopted here.  They provide a much more healthy atmosphere for electoral participation and for people to make free choices.</P>
    <P>I am sure that there is no system that can be devised by man for elections that is not open to abuse.  The ingenuity of those of us who seek election to find ways of maximising our votes probably knows no bounds.  I am being very careful to include myself though I am not for one second suggesting that I have been involved in abuses.  What I am saying is that the ingenuity of people seeking election knows no bounds.  Therefore, I would not like to have us, in the tone, for instance, of Senator O'Leary's remarks, discriminate against a particularly vulnerable group, the handicapped, whose needs in a whole lot of areas we have only recently begun to recognise, because of the possibilities of abuse.</P>
    <P>The area of abuse that I would be a little more worried about is where people's employment may interfere with their voting and the possibility of employers bringing pressure to bear on people to seek postal votes and, therefore, to have a considerable impact on how people vote.  Whatever my criticisms, I have a reasonable degree of faith that the medical profession will not allow itself to be party to widespread abuse.</P>
    <P>The basic principle of my remarks is that I hope that when the Minister brings in the Bill he referred to, it will begin to look at voting in the context of the <Col N="1107" /> technology that is available in the late 20th century, the methods of communication available and also in terms of the perception of our society as having a large number of minority groups, for example, the travellers.  I wonder how many travellers ever vote in an election?  If people are to be encouraged to feel they have a stake in our society those of us who have a stake in society have an obligation to reach out.  The most obvious need is for the handicapped and I welcome these regulations, but there is a need to extend the same understanding to other groups who may be neither as fashionable nor as articulate nor as easily identified as being deserving of sympathy.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the possibility of abuse by employers.  That being said, I welcome the regulations.  They are a sign of an increasing consensus about the needs of the handicapped and it is very welcome to find a consensus on both sides of the House on this issue.  The handicapped deserve a great deal more of our understanding. For a long time we failed to understand that it was not a case of what we thought handicapped people needed but what handicapped people themselves recognised as their needs that should be dominant.  I therefore welcome the regulations.</P>

      <P>Senator Ferris.  We have just a quarter of an hour left.  Another speaker may wish to speak for ten minutes and Senator W. Ryan may speak for five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a general welcome for the motion on both sides of the House and there has been understandable reservation in regard to the possible areas of abuse.  That stems from all our experiences of the level of abuse that took place formerly.  There is no doubt whatsoever that abuse did take place.  It took place in institutions, particularly. Senator O'Leary asked if people who were mentally ill would be entitled to vote.  The vast majority of them are on the voter's register and as such are entitled to vote.  What happened on the last <Col N="1108" /> occasion was that peace commissioners collected all their votes, witnessed them and filled them in for them.  That is the kind of abuse there was.</P>
      <P>This amending regulation will tighten up the procedure in that a formal application will have to be made in a specific period and will have to be substantiated by, perhaps, a doctor.  I would not share Senator Ryan's optimism that doctors would not be politically motivated.  I have my own views on that, as I know quite a lot of them who are politically motivated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reason to be careful about what I say about doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of what Senator Ryan says, and he has spoken from experience, everyone will try to ensure his or her own election.  If you are a doctor and you are also a politician, you will try to ensure your own election also. I am satisfied that the regulations as set down here will go in some way towards tightening up the areas of abuse that existed.</P>
      <P>The period 15 to 30 April has been mentioned as being the possible application dates, which is quite early in comparison with the election date, which will probably be the last week in June, depending on the legislation which will be before the House next week or the week after.  Presuming that it will be at the end of June, this is quite early.  Administratively, that is very important.  A number of people will have got ill after 30 April and will be ill in or about election time and they will not have the facility to have a postal vote because they will have got ill after the due date.  That is one disadvantage of having the date too early. I understand that from an administrative viewpoint it is desirable to get the applications in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister confirm that specific application forms would be printed the same way as application forms to have one's name on the register?  Will it be a form that will have a stamp and that the person applying for the vote will be able to submit to the post office, together with <Col N="1109" /> the substantiating circumstances, such as a certificate from their employer?</P>
    <P>I understand the occupational problems in the case of commercial travellers being away from home.  I can see no employment reason, if the hours from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. are correct why a person could not vote, apart from being absent from the area.  Physical illness will be dealt with correctly and physical disability. The reason for the regulations is the tremendous wrong that was done to people in wheelchairs, in particular, who showed such tremendous interest in being able to cast their vote.  These people have association with many of us through various voluntary organisations and at election time they like to show their appreciation.  They have been precluded from doing so since 1974 because of abuse by other people.  I want to stress that people in wheelchairs would be the last in the world to abuse that facility.  I hope that for them in particular, this will be a major breakthrough.  Those of them that I have contacted through the Irish Wheelchair Association have expressed delight at the fact that they will have a vote in the election in June.</P>
    <P>The provision of a mobile polling station is the ideal.  In a local election, it could be quite difficult because people could be outside their own electoral area in hospital in another electoral area. Administratively, that could prove quite difficult.  It probably would be very successful in a general election, where most people in hospital would be in their own electoral area, at least.  I can see problems. I am concerned, therefore, to ensure that there is a specific application form which should be easily available at a Garda station, or post office, or by application in writing and that it would be stamped and suitable for return to the returning officer.</P>
    <P>Are we insisting on the postal registration of the vote being returned, because that is important?  That is required in the Seanad election.  As Senator Ryan said, there is an extraordinary amount of safety involved in voting for the Seanad in that you get your vote by registered post; you have to cast your vote in front <Col N="1110" /> of somebody of standing; you also have to register the return of it.  This ensures that nobody can interfere with the vote between the time the person genuinely casts it, fills in the application and returns it.  Is it a requirement in this amendment that the vote would also be registered when being returned?</P>
    <P>I could deal with many other areas, particularly students, in whom I have an interest, because there will be students away from home.  That is possibly for another day.  They are not specifically mentioned here so there is no point in talking about them.</P>
    <P>I hope that, when we have tidied up the whole area of postal voting, the 1986 register will include all these people and everybody will know in advance who is a postal voter.  On this occasion, I take it that the returning officer for local authority elections, which is generally the county manager or county secretary will know in advance who the postal voters are.</P>
    <P>When will the applicant be advised that his request is successful?  It is important that he be notified fairly quickly.  Our greatest concern will be to ensure that people cast their votes.  In regard to the areas of verification the Minister might quantify or qualify what the statutory declaration will be for a self-employed person.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, with those reservations I welcome these regulations, particularly for handicapped persons.  I hope they will go some way towards meeting the problems handicapped persons have encountered in trying to get into polling stations in their wheelchairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamRyan" hpid="Mr. W. Ryan Mr. W. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I welcome these regulations.  They are long overdue.  With all the restrictions that have been provided for on this occasion, I am sure that postal voting will not be abused as it was on a former occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Ferris, I feel that 30 April is too near the date of the election.  The election, I understand, will be 27 June. So much can happen in a month.  People who are anxious to vote might not have <Col N="1111" /> looked for a postal vote on 30 April and by 30 May may find that they cannot vote. I do not know if the Minister can review that at this stage.</P>
    <P>Many young people perhaps from Tipperary or Limerick, are working away from home and only come home on Friday evenings.  They are on the register at home.  If they get a letter from their employer to say that they are not available to vote, would they be eligible for a postal vote?  It is important that that be taken into account.  Many people have to leave Dublin at 6 o'clock in the evening and rush down the country to vote.  They are as much entitled to their vote as the person who has to go to Dublin and cannot be at home to vote.  They should be treated similarly.  When people apply for a postal vote, will they have to know their number on the register?  That is not going to be too easy unless some local politician, who thinks they will vote for him, will help them out.  Where will they find a register?  If they send in the application without the number, that should not debar them from a postal vote.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary mentioned mental hospitals.  When patients in mental hospitals were allowed a vote, they voted, on the first occasion in the mental hospital. I understand that in places certain Deputies were elected as a result of this.  I remember canvassing in a very large mental hospital.  Some patients had their faculties but others mentioned some TD who had died 20 years before.  That was because he had been a TD when they went into the mental hospital.  These patients, are entitled, since they are on the register at home, to a postal vote.  How will the Minister ensure that all the mental hospital patients do not vote the one way because of somebody in the mental hospital advising them that way? Things like that do happen.</P>

      <P>That is all I have to say. Senator Higgins mentioned changing the register.  That is for another day, but the <Col N="1112" /> Minister should take into account the registers we have at present.  For one polling booth, there might be six registers with 50 names on one and 100 on another. The registers should be brought up to date.  Our county council have decided that they will do that.  Every county council should do so.</P>
      <P>There is one other speaker on the other side.  If we could stretch things a bit, as he probably will not be any longer than five minutes, perhaps an extra five minutes could be allowed after 8 o'clock for the other Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>By nature I am very brief and tonight I will be twice as brief.  It is very difficult, in a minute or two, to summarise what should be said.  I had one experience of a wheelchair person who weighed nearly 18 stone who went to all the trouble of going to the polling booth and people were unable to get the chair in.  He had to go home without voting. We should go out of our way to help people like that person, who want to vote.  There is a lot of talk about the abuse of postal voting.  It is politicians who have abused the system.  I am not talking about Fianna Fáil; I am including Fine Gael.  It is quite clear that there are abuses from every side of the House. Politicians of some sort or other are the ones who are going around talking to people in mental hospitals and if they set a good example, there might not be as much abuse.  I would hate to see rheumatism or lumbago cited as cases where it <Col N="1113" /> was inconvenient for people to go personally to vote.</P>
      <P>Sunday voting would solve a lot of our problems.  It would solve Senator Willie Ryan's problem about people coming from Dublin.  Voting is always in the middle of the week.  People are away from home and if we had Sunday voting, people would be at home.  They have their good clothes on and they are going out to Mass and you might have a much better and a more accurate poll.</P>
      <P>It is time the political parties on all sides were cleared from polling booths on polling day to within a minimum of 100 yards.  If people go to the trouble of voting and they have to jostle their way into polling booths, it is embarrassing. Anybody who goes out to vote has his or her mind made up who to vote for.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senators for the very constructive and useful debate on this issue.  The measure has been welcomed with open arms by Senators on all sides of the House.  Several Senators referred to the desirability of having postal votes at elections generally.  I mentioned in my speech that this is intended in the forthcoming Bill and will be in operation for 1986.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole and others asked about the date of the election, and said that nothing can happen in the meantime. I would like to point out that in national elections there can be three weeks in which all this happens.  We are talking here about four months.  I want to assure the House and everybody, particularly on my right, that there will be no problems. There will be plenty of time.  We will be announcing the date in good time.  All will have all the time they want to operate and move in the direction they want to move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked about the position of fishermen.  In replying to his question, it would be better to outline briefly the categories which we hope to cover. <Col N="1114" /> A number of other Senators also asked about this.  Apart from the ill and physically handicapped, the voting facilities aim particularly at those people who are resident in this country and away from home on a regular basis whether to other parts of this country or abroad in the course of their employment.  Categories which immediately come to mind are company representatives, long distance lorry drivers, fishermen, journalists, airline pilots, among others.  It would be up to the returning officers to decide on others. It is not the intention to accommodate people who are resident in other countries. Such people would not be registered electors under the existing laws.</P>
    <P>Senator Rogers asked about the Garda and the Army.  We are aware that they are at present on the postal vote.  Senator Loughrey asked about small farmers, whether they were self-employed.  Of course, they are self-employed but the fact that they are self-employed does not entitle them necessarily to a postal vote. They must prove that they will be away, or that they are normally away and would not be available on the day of polling. That is possibly unlikely, unlike other people such as fishermen or trawler owners and people like that.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked about the position of island dwellers.  There are no special provisions relating to postal voting by islanders.  Their right to a postal vote is governed by the same rules as apply to everybody else.  The qualification is illness or physical disability and islanders do not come under this.</P>
    <P>The question was raised by Senator Loughrey of people voting who were working abroad.  Briefly, the position is that persons working or resident abroad should not be on the register of electors and the question of voting should not arise.  There could be people working abroad on a seasonal basis, or people who have recently moved abroad and are still on the register.  These could obviously apply for a postal vote if their occupation prevents them from voting at the polling station.  However, there are no provisions for ballot papers to be sent <Col N="1115" /> abroad.  They will be sent to the address at which the person is registered.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins asked about diplomats. That problem will be dealt with in the forthcoming Bill.  Senator Smith raised the question of postal voting for mental patients.  Senator O'Leary raised that question in regard to the working party on the register of electors.  On balance, they recommended against it, because it was felt that these patients are probably more open to undue influence than other categories.  It is something that we should be always looking at.  The whole basis of what we are about is to try to include as many people as possible on the register and at the same time minimise abuses.  We should, on an on-going basis, review this from time to time but, under the present regulations, that would not operate.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred to abuses which took place in 1974.  Of course, this is the nub of postal voting &mdash; how to provide a reasonable facility and at the same time guard against abuse.  A number of Senators said this.  I believe what we are doing now is striking a reasonable balance.  If we impose too many restrictions, then we would be undoing what we are trying to do and preventing people from voting.  I think we have taken sufficient precautions on that.</P>
    <P>Some people were trying to classify this as a trial run.  It is not.  This is the type of legislation which will be going into the Bill, but we have not moved on the Bill in time, so we want to put these provisions into regulations to enable people to vote and I believe it will be successful. There are penalties to deal with people abusing postal voting.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins mentioned the matter of pressure being put on voters at polling stations and other aspects of the conduct of elections.  I noted his comments and I will have them considered.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon mentioned staff employed by the returning officers.  They were not included in the regulations because, again, the application period is now going to be much earlier.  This matter <Col N="1116" /> was raised by other Senators as well regarding illness and accidents and so on. No matter what date we have, we would have problems.  The idea of bringing the date forward was to give the returning officer plenty of time in which to examine applications and adjudicate and make decisions.  It is in the interest of a good system that that be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Loughrey is interested that peace commissioners should not witness statutory declarations, that that should only be done by a commissioner of oaths. We want to make this as reasonable and as accessible as possible and debarring peace commissioners would create problems and I do not intend to do that.</P>
    <P>Senator Loughrey made some very serious criticisms of the way in which the register of electors is compiled in Donegal.  Indeed, it is not relevant to the matter now under consideration and I will just say that he should bring these matters to the attention of the appropriate authorities.  If he will let me have details of the irregularities, I will have them investigated.  He also suggested that the dates for the compilation of the register should be changed.  I will note that too.  That has been mentioned in other places as well.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch raised the question of a person whose name is omitted from the register of electors.  When your name is not on the register, there is no provision to allow you to vote.  You cannot swear an oath or anything like that.  Regrettably, you cannot vote.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised the point about students.  They are not specifically mentioned in the regulation but they may qualify under the occupation qualifications. It would be a matter for the returning officer to decide on each qualification, if they use that as a means for getting a vote.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris asked about application forms.  An application form, if specified, will be a schedule to the regulations and stocks of forms are being printed and they will be available at post offices and local authority offices.</P>

      <P>No.  They are there by application and the post will not be free. Senator Ferris also asked whether the completed ballot paper will be returned by registered post.  The answer to that is no.  The main beneficiaries of this regulation will be the ill and disabled and it would be a major imposition if such categories were required to register their envelopes.  The risk of abuse at that stage is rather small but again it is a matter we can look at.  At present we do not intend to do that.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question of the application period and expressed concern that people might not be aware of the new system.  Senator Higgins mentioned this as well.  This will be well publicised. We will have it on television, radio and in all the national newspapers and periodicals.  I have no doubt that public representatives, aspiring candidates, will play a very active role in ensuring that everybody is aware of postal voting.</P>
      <P>Senators Mullooly and McMahon mentioned that the period of seven days being allowed for providing further information was too short.  We must accept that a cut-off time is essential and that the supplementary postal voters list must be completed within a reasonable time and made available to candidates.  Again, it is something we can look at but I think we will leave it seven days and examine this as we go along.  I do not anticipate a huge volume of requests for additional information.  I would hope that that would not be the case.</P>
      <P>Senator Mullooly also asked about the charge for medical certificates.  The question of charges for medical certificates will, of course, be a matter for individual doctors.  We have to assume that there could be a separate charge.  I am not saying that there will not be a charge. As we are aware, most genuinely ill or disabled persons should not face this additional financial burden, because they would be having frequent visits from the doctor and I hope that would take care of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned accessibility to polling booths.  At the Department we are always trying to ensure that better <Col N="1118" /> buildings and facilities are made available at polling booths.  That is most important. It is not good enough to give a postal vote to a person in a wheelchair if they want to exercise their right to vote at a polling booth.  That right should be there for them.  Senator Willie Ryan mentioned people who work away from home and go home at weekends only.  These people would qualify on the employment criteria.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Senators for their helpful and constructive contributions.  It is great to get this kind of consensus in the House on this very important matter. These measures are long overdue.  I have no fears about them.  If there are any problems we can look at them again.  It is our right as democrats to ensure that as many people as possible have access to voting.  A Bill will be brought before the Dáil shortly to ensure that these rights will be conferred at every election, referenda, general elections and European elections.  Then we can truly say that we are endeavouring to give everybody, particularly those who are unable to vote, their right to vote.</P>

      <P>We now come to Senator Durcan's request under Standing Order No. 29.  The time limit on this is one and a half hours.  I suggest that the Minister be allowed at least 20 minutes to reply.  Is that agreed?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter on what, within Standing Orders is a matter of specific and important public interest requiring urgent consideration, the matter being:</P>
      <P>The widespread disquiet in west Mayo and the western seaboard arising from the recent outrages particularly of last weekend committed against the elderly which suggests inadequacies in existing rural policing methods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I moved this morning to seek leave of the Seanad to introduce this emergency motion tonight I was very moved by the fact that whereas Standing Orders provide that five Members of the House must stand to support the Member who seeks to introduce such a motion, in this case every Member of the House present at the time stood in support of the motion.  By doing so Members of the House in a silent way, in a way that will not be recorded on the record of the House, showed their solidarity with the <Col N="1120" /> old, the weak, with the thousands living in fear behind bolted doors.</P>
    <P>I was motivated to introduce this emergency motion first by virtue of the occurrences of the last weekend but also by virtue of my knowledge of what has been happening in the west in recent times.  The events of last weekend brought home very clearly to me what has been happening in other parts of the western seaboard.  I know the Carroll family and also the Tunney family.  The Carroll homestead which was burned is about two-and-a-half miles from my home.  The seriousness and horror of the crime committed against that family can only be understood clearly if one realises where that house is situated.  It is situated about one-quarter of a mile from the public road in a hidden valley and access to it is over a rough mountainside.  There is no driveway; there is no rural road leading to the Carroll home: it is simply a mountain track.  It was over that mountain track that these bandits with criminal intent went on Friday night of last week to perpetrate a crime which was frightening and which has, by its nature, created tremendous fear in the hearts and minds of many people.</P>
    <P>On Monday night of last week I went to the home of a friend about one mile from Westport town.  It is a house I have visited frequently at night time when normally I would gain admission to the house by pushing in the back door.  It did not strike me that the dwellers in that house would be fearful.  Their attitude was portrayed very clearly to me by the presence of a new lock on their door and by the fact that before I was afforded admission I was asked from behind closed curtains who I was.  That is the kind of situation which has developed and which gives rise to the concern which motivated me to bring this motion before the House.</P>
    <P>My friend, Senator O'Toole on the Opposition benches, lives about eight miles from where I live.  He knows the people who have been the subject of these crimes.  He shares with me the horror and the feeling of unrest and fear that is prevalent in the area we represent.</P>
    <P>In relation to the solution of these <Col N="1121" /> crimes I would like to compliment the Gardaí for their activity in recent days and for their determination to ensure that those responsible are speedily brought to justice.  I thank them also for their concern for those who have suffered.</P>
    <P>In addressing myself to the events which have occurred I have specified in the motion that there are inadequacies in existing rural policing methods.  I want to refer to three of these inadequacies.  In suggesting that some of these inadequacies are glaring I am not necessarily criticising the Garda as such.  I am criticising a system which has developed within which they are caught.  I am asking the Minister, as the person with ultimate responsibility, to issue the required directive to ensure that these inadequacies are speedily remedied.</P>
    <P>The first inadequacy I see in the existing system of rural policing is what I would call the insensitivity with which the Garda frequently carry out their duty. Policing in any rural community, if it is to be effective, must be of a personalised nature.  Gardaí must know the people with whom they are dealing.  One example of the kind of insensitivity I am speaking about is what I would call the indiscriminate operation of road traffic patrols operating in rural Ireland.  In one of these areas affected by these crimes, the Mayo traffic corps did a very detailed patrol on Monday last.  I would call that total insensitivity in an area where people were living in fear and where people were still recoiling from the shock resulting from these attacks.  I do not think it is appropriate at a time when people are suffering from shock that they should be faced with road traffic patrols.  One can say that if somebody is in breach of the road traffic law he should be subject to the law.  This to my mind was very bad policemanship, that at a time of stress people should be subjected to that type of thing.</P>
    <P>The Garda in rural Ireland until recently were looked upon in the same way as the priest, the lawyer, the doctor or the politician.  The garda was the kind of person in whom people imposed trust. In the exercise of his duties he operated <Col N="1122" /> in a very discriminating way.  I do not think that the indiscriminate operation of road traffic patrols is of any help.</P>
    <P>The second matter which is of concern to me and which I would see as an inadequacy in existing rural policing is the location of Garda stations.  It seems to me that Garda stations are located in roughly the same places as they were 100 years ago when the RIC were operating effectively.  I would like to see the Garda and the Department of Justice carrying out a detailed survey to ascertain the best places for the location of Garda stations in rural Ireland.  There is a need to open up many of the small stations that have been closed down.  I am happy to know that the Minister has given a commitment that no more small Garda stations will be closed, but I think a look must be taken at the places where closures have occurred and a look must also be taken to see if there are any other places where stations could be conveniently opened.  It is interesting to note that the two Garda stations which were closed in my area are Garda stations which would relate in terms of proximity, very closely to the Carroll and Tunney households.  What was the Murrisk Garda station is a very short distance from the Carroll household and what was the Carrickkennedy Garda station is a very short distance from the Tunney household.  I wonder if these stations were still manned by resident gardaí, would the situation be any different.</P>
    <P>I would tie in with the question of the location of Garda stations the whole question of what is being termed as the pilot rural policing schemes, operated in south Mayo and Kilkenny initially and I believe now operating in other places. That scheme, while preserving the rural police station, certainly in its operation has not given any confidence to the people it was meant to serve.  It was meant to be a pilot scheme but it seems to be a pilot scheme that is moving on now without direction and it is a pilot scheme the operation of which we have not been given any account.  I would like the Minister to comment on the operation of that scheme and to indicate <Col N="1123" /> whether its operation is to continue or whether he is satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>The third inadequacy which I see in rural policing and the one that I am most concerned about, is the fact that too many of our gardaí do not live in the area to which they are assigned.  The garda is a privileged person in society.  He is a person with a permanent and pensionable job.  He is a person with a statutory position in many situations.  He is a person who is accorded traditional respect.  He is person who until recently was the repository of many people's trust.  That trust and respect which people had for the garda in great measure developed because people knew the garda, he lived in their area and he, in turn, knew them.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the greatest weapon against crime is not necessarily a sophisticated radio system which is now operating throughout the country.  I compliment the Minister for bringing that system into operation and bringing it as far as it has been brought: it is welcome and it certainly is an aid, but it seems to me that the most important weapon a garda can have in dealing with crime is his eyes and his ears and his feet.  If the garda is to use these human faculties properly then he must live in the area. He must be able to respond to any change in that area, whether it be a change in normal traffic or a change in people's habits or a change in the occupation of buildings.  The garda can get that information only if he resides in the area.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that it was a rule in the Garda Síochána until recently that a member of the Garda Síochána should live in the area within which he operated. If it is still a rule it is honoured more in the breach than the observance.  I raised this matter in this House on Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill.  I referred then to the situation existing in County Mayo.  The Minister responded at that time by saying that he was aware of the situation in County Mayo but that he understood that the situation was being improved.</P>
    <P>At that time I made a public statement expressing concern at the fact that the <Col N="1124" /> chief superintendent for County Mayo does not live in the county, that he lives in County Cork and that he simply comes and stays for the working nights of the week in an apartment in County Mayo. I am very dissatisfied with that position. I am equally dissatisfied with the fact that of six superintendents in County Mayo, to my knowledge only two of them, the superintendents in Ballina and Castlebar, live in their areas of operation.  I am horrified at the fact that, as I understand it, four superintendents in County Mayo do not permanently reside within the county.  Of the seven senior Garda officers in County Mayo only two of them, I understand, reside permanently in their areas of appointment.  Five reside permanently elsewhere with their wives and children.  If these men are to give effective leadership and if the Garda are to get the kind of support that they need, and that we all want them to have, then the people must know who they are.  I do not believe that half a dozen people in County Mayo know who the chief superintendent is.  To my mind, the Garda officer in charge in a particular county should be known and should be seen.  He should be seen in uniform on ceremonial occasions.  He should be available to people who have recourse to the law. People should be aware of his existence, of who he is and of his availability.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the six superintendents. If they are to achieve confidence, if they are to instill leadership in their men, and if they are to instil leadership in all of us as law-abiding citizens who want to have communication with the Garda, then they should be residing with their wives and children and have permanent roots in the areas to which they are assigned.  The same thing goes right down to the ordinary garda and to the sergeant rank.  There are many members of the force in County Mayo who do not live permanently in the area to which they are assigned.  I submit that by virtue of the privileged position which the Garda have they should either come in or get out.  By that I mean that they should come in and live in their areas and become part of the community in the <Col N="1125" /> full sense or else they should resign their commission or their membership and leave it to many other people who would dearly love to have the job.</P>
    <P>I call upon the Minister and the Government to issue a very specific direction to the Garda Commissioner and to every member of the force to ensure that operational gardaí &mdash; those from superintendent rank downwards &mdash; come and live and operate permanently among the people that they serve, so that the people can at least achieve a knowledge and an understanding of them.  These are the inadequacies existing in rural policing. These are the inadequacies which have brought about a lack of confidence on the part of the people in rural Ireland in their Garda force.  That lack of confidence exists.  In the clinic which I held last weekend &mdash; I spent all of last Saturday from 11.30 a.m. to 1 a.m. in the morning on a non-stop clinic trip &mdash; every second person I met spoke to me about this issue and expressed their concern.  On investigating their views on the issue I detected an alarming lack of confidence in the Garda.</P>
    <P>As a public representative and as a member of the legal profession who comes into frequent contact with gardaí, I do not have a lack of confidence in them.  I have confidence in the Garda; I have confidence in most members of the force, certainly in my area along the western seaboard.  I want to see that confidence communicated to the people at large.  I believe it can only be done if the inadequacies which I have mentioned are remedied.  We can speak about the Criminal Justice Act and we can speak about the Community Work Act.  I compliment the Minister on introducing both of these measures.  These measures are necessary. This Government have given to the Garda the additional technical equipment which they need to carry out their duties effectively.  If the Garda are to be truly effective, if our rural policing system is to be truly effective, then the members who operate within that system must be known to and must be trusted by the people.</P>
    <P>I have heard many people fashionably <Col N="1126" /> criticise the role once played by the Garda in checking for noxious weeds and compiling census returns or involving themselves, as they did in former years, in social welfare assessments.  We can say that is not the role of the policeman.  I believe the role of the policeman is to have trust in people and to know what is going on.  In rural Ireland it might be no harm if gardaí got out of their white squad cars and got back on their bikes and engaged themselves in the activities which will give them an understanding of what is happening in the area.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons why I put forward this motion.  I put it forward because I am aware of the concern and the worry. I am also concerned about what the Minister is trying to do to remedy the matter.  But I would hope that the direction in relation to the three specific matters I have mentioned will issue from Government to ensure that these inadequacies existing in our rural policing system are remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let me say that I welcome the opportunity for this debate here this evening.  It is what I would call an emergency debate and I am delighted that Senator Durcan took the initiative. Early today I found out that he had a motion down; so I did not put down a motion as I had intended.  But it is even better as it is since we have more time to debate this in full whereas on a matter on the Adjournment one only gets 20 minutes, with ten minutes for the Minister to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that we in Mayo took the initiative long before the recent crimes over the last two or three weeks.  We got in touch with the chief superintendent and the superintendents of the county with a view to having a debate in committee with Mayo County Council.  That took place last Monday night week and we had roughly a two and a half hour debate and I can assure the Minister that it was frank and forthright with no punches pulled.  We have 31 able councillors in Mayo on all sides, who are well able to put their case and outline the inadequacies which exist with regard to <Col N="1127" /> crime detection or prevention.  We did not await the burning of the home mentioned by Senator Durcan, the Carroll home, or the break-ins we had during the week.  If you like, we were ahead of the posse in the awareness of the lack of security in Mayo at the moment.  I speak about Mayo, but the west of Ireland is identical in that respect.  I will speak about Mayo because I know it best.  I live very close to the families that were concerned, poor defenceless people.  The Minister mentioned the Carroll family on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; and the deplorable attitude of these thugs who reach for defenceless people, people who have very little, if any, money.  But for their tact and ingenuity in trying to get released from the house, I think they would have been in much greater danger.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of Mayo County Council on Monday night after these events, we put forward two resolutions.  We suggested a £5,000 reward for anybody who would come up with information to the Garda leading to a conviction of the criminals in these cases.  That was a positive step in the right direction.  We also called on the Minister to reintroduce the overtime for gardaí in the area.  Our meeting was held in committee for one positive reason, so that we would not make any political capital on either side.  Senator Jim Higgins, who is a member, is sitting here, and he was at that meeting.  There was no political capital-making involved. No statement was released after that meeting, but at least we got home to the Garda force the home truth of what the people on the ground were feeling &mdash; the terror and the fear in the hearts of the old, disabled and infirm of the county.  It was a worthwhile exercise.  At least we let the authorities know our position and our feelings as regards security in the area.</P>
    <P>I have the height of respect for the Garda force in our area, but I feel they have not enough facilities and enough overtime to curb the break-ins that we have had recently in that part of the country. Crime is not confined, I can assure you, just to the rural part of Mayo but it <Col N="1128" /> is indeed very prevalent in the towns of Mayo where people are continually breaking into premises and escaping detection or conviction.</P>
    <P>My own view is that the Government should have prepared an emergency plan in consultation with the chief Garda officers in the county with a view to intensification of surveillance.  That is a very important thing.  So is the setting up of checkpoints.  If, as the Minister was saying on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;, these criminals have gone across the Border, surely many checkpoints could be in operation between Mayo and the Border to ensure that these people would not get through the net in the early hours of the morning. That is important.</P>
    <P>Responsible advice should be given to the aged, the infirm and the disabled, in a television programme and on radio to warn them about what they should and should not be doing and try to prepare themselves against attack and to assure them that there is protection for them and that it will be put into operation. To date there is no radio or television programme to assure old people that they have any protection whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Change in the social welfare code is a necessity.  These people have small amounts of money in their possession. They are in fear of lodging it in any bank or post office in case they may lose their old age pension or their widow's pension. Some latitude should be allowed for old age pensioners, widows and the disabled so that they could lodge their money without getting into difficulty with either the pension officer or whoever would be investigating their old age or disability pension claims.</P>
    <P>The divisional task force should be reestablished in rural areas with a specific brief to combat this type of terrorism.  Notwithstanding what the Minister has stated, there is a reduction in the Garda force in rural areas.  This is deplorable. Listening to the Minister speaking on a TV programme last night, one would believe that all the moneys that are necessary were available to the gardaí to deploy forces to deal with this terrorism, <Col N="1129" /> regarded by him as an epidemic.  This is an untruth.  There is £12 million provided for overtime this year and there will be over the next three years as outlined in <i>Building on Reality</i> on page 137:</P>
    <P>7.27 &ldquo;the present strength of the Garda force at 11,400 is some 600 higher than when the Government took office at the end of 1982.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This increase was inherited from the Fianna Fáil Government.  You cannot take gardaí down off a shelf in the Department of Justice and put them out onto the streets; they have to be examined academically.  They must be screened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister has to leave.  I will continue, as Standing Orders will not allow this House to adjourn.</P>
      <P>The increase of 600 gardaí mentioned by the Minister was in line and came on stream when he took office.  It was the policy of our side of the House to bring the Garda force up to 12,000 in number. This is 600 less than our target.  In 1982 we made provision for £18 million for overtime for the Garda force.  This is now reduced by one-third to £12 million and will continue to be reduced for the next three years.  With inflation running at what it is the figure required in real terms is much higher.  It is no use having the Minister telling the people on television that moneys are available for overtime. There is a cut-back of £6 million, one-third of the £18 million which was provided in 1982.  I am open to contradiction. The people from my county have a very high IQ and they do not believe these statements.  There is no presence of gardaí on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that he closed no rural station since he took office, but he reduced the personnel in rural stations. Most of the rural stations are closed for <Col N="1130" /> periods.  As a result squad cars are conveying gardaí from one location to another.  This is mostly what the squad cars are used for when they should be patrolling rural areas, setting up checkpoints and bringing terrorists to justice.</P>
    <P>It is a sorry state of affairs for the Minister to go on TV, at the same time as old people were about to roll stones and iron bars to their doors in order to keep terrorists out, saying that everything is all right, that the Garda will get all the money they want to deploy gardaí from the city or elsewhere to deal with this epidemic problem which has now arisen.  This problem has existed for the last two years.  Outside Ballinrobe two brothers were murdered by itinerants and a third brother died at a later date as a result of the abuse he received.  There was a disabled woman tied up on the same night outside Headford.  The Government have taken no action in bringing the terrorists responsible for this to justice.  The blame for the fear of the people and for the break-ins that are prevalent in the west lies with the Minister and the Government.  Corrective measures should be taken.</P>
    <P>It was stated at a meeting in committee that a squad car left County Mayo with a prisoner for Mountjoy.  After the prisoner was admitted the squad car occupants went for a meal.  On their way down, at Maynooth, the same prisoner hitched a lift home from that same squad car.  This is the type of imprisonment which the Minister has talked about.  The Minister inherited the improved accommodation at Mountjoy, Cork, Lusk and Trinity House.  This was in train long before the Minister took office.  He provided accommodation for 500 more prisoners. It was Fianna Fáil planning over the years that brought this increase about and not planning during the Minister's time.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Durcan in relation to the location of new garda stations. Garda stations were built at the beginning of the century and were for a garda force who were then on pedal cycles.  The terrain was such that it was more advantageous to have the station located at a <Col N="1131" /> given point so that mileage would be curtailed considerably.  This does not apply now.  Advantage for detection should be the criterion for locating garda stations in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I will not hog the time of the Seanad further on this except to say that I am appalled at the attitude adopted by the Minister, on TV last night, when he made political points.  People in County Mayo are not worried about who is in Government. They are more concerned about their protection.  The Garda are there to provide protection.  It is the Minister's duty and not the Garda Commissioner's duty to deploy gardaí.  It is the Minister's duty to make the necessary funds available in this emergency.</P>
    <P>We were unfortunate in County Mayo that we had the lowest crime rate in Ireland. This is the reason that the garda force was moved from the western counties to intensify activity in other areas where crime was at a high level.</P>
    <P>I concur with most of the opinions expressed by Senator Durcan.  I appeal to the Minister to make funds available to bring back the task force in a temporary capacity and to increase overtime so that terrorism can be curbed.  People living in County Mayo are living in fear and awaiting the Minister's action in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure you I will be considerate of the fact that a number of Senators wish to contribute and my remarks will accordingly be brief.  I want first of all to concur with the mover of this resolution and with Senator O'Toole from the opposite benches in condemning the most recent spate of attacks on elderly people living alone in isolated accommodation in Mayo.  In doing so, may I say that I think attacks upon the elderly <Col N="1132" /> in isolated areas are particularly cowardly? It is a kind of crime which has correctly brought the condemnation of all right-minded people.  Following what the other Senators said, those who have watched the interviews of people who were attacked could not but be moved by the description they gave, the appalling incursion, the attack made on their lives. I refer in particular to people who lost their home through fire and who had been burned in a particularly savage way.  I would agree with the mover and seconder of this resolution in saying that it is a particularly horrific kind of crime.</P>
      <P>I am concerned not only about the people who live in the west but also about the elderly who live in fear and trepidation behind locks and bolts in the inner city of Dublin.  Those of us who have canvassed during by-elections know the trepidation with which older people answered the door.  To take up the point at which Senator O'Toole left off, and to be very brief, it is very important that anything we say and do now should be such as not to increase or amplify the fears of the elderly living alone and in isolated areas.  I am very worried, as someone who has been interested in crime and the victims of crime for a great number of years, that we would not make worse a situation in which people are already living in fear.  A number of people have spoken to me about what is likely to happen.  People are influenced by the media.  A great responsibility devolves on the press in striking a balance between accurate reporting and sensational reporting in relation to crimes that are committed against the elderly.  The total impact on the elderly is a reasonable criterion by which to judge reporting, publication and action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should, out of the worst of things, seek to gain something.  We have had dramatically demonstrated to us the circumstances in which many of the elderly are now living.  The movers of the motion are particularly interested in the west. The demographic statistics show that in Leitrim and Roscommon, there are a great number of people, particularly women who are widowed and women <Col N="1133" /> whose husbands have left and so forth, living alone.  Equally, in Mayo, there are a great number of widows and a great number of deserted wives.  There is the additional complication in Mayo of the terrain and the geographical features of the county.  This means that demographically a great number of people are coming at risk.  We need to ally the issues of supervision and crime with other issues in relation to the care of the elderly. With the greatest respect I support all the suggestions for a more efficient deployment of the Garda Síochána. They should be given the necessary facilities and there should be much reorganisation of schedules as would make an impact.  I do not believe that you can reduce the risks to the elderly by Garda overtime.  I would question that assumption. You need to use this experience of the fear of the elderly living alone.  As a member of a health board reading the publications of other health boards and the publications of the Medico-Social Research Council and so forth I have found that where the elderly have been surveyed their feeling of loneliness is greater than their fear of intrusion.  We must ask ourselves how we have addressed ourselves to the circumstances of the elderly.  The millions about which people speak could probably be better spent in an integrated approach towards the needs of the elderly.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the fact that we can put a figure on the number at risk who live alone and can identify their needs. It would not involve an enormous sum beyond our resources to provide for such electronic means as would enable the elderly to alert their neighbours when they are in danger.  The advantage is that it makes it possible to deal with the person who is having a heart attack or a stroke or who is ill.  Sometimes a great deal of money is wasted by the specification of qualifications for services for the elderly when it could be decided that everyone over a certain age living alone could qualify for a certain kind of provision.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves whether it does not in a way reflect on us to think that the presence of gardaí &mdash; and I will <Col N="1134" /> support the Senators who want more gardaí if they feel that will help &mdash; is a suitable approach.  The force should be given every assistance to improve the detection rate and to apprehend those responsible for crime.  They would have my support.  Equally, there are questions that the communities involved must ask themselves in relation to the isolation of the elderly.  We are being continually told that in urban Ireland we never had a sense of community or have lost it.  A community spirit has existed in rural Ireland. My experience is that the isolation of the elderly in the rural community is far greater than in urban areas.  I say that very deliberately.  That is the evidence brought home to me as a sociologist where this issue has been surveyed.</P>
    <P>We must ask the question as to the responsibility of the communities in which the elderly live, the extent to which they have been kept integrated into the life of the community.  I do not mean just at Christmas Day.  I mean on a regular basis.  People who have studied ageing speak of the manner in which people have broken their links with life and have become isolated from regular contact with the community.  Some of the people who are now most vulnerable are people who were isolated before they became elderly.  We must ask a question about that and what barriers were placed in their way.  I am in favour &mdash; I say this knowing that times are economically strained &mdash; of dealing with this grave, serious situation to which attention has been drawn and having a developed integrated approach towards it.  It is possible in 1985 to make provision for such services as are necessary to enable the elderly to make contact not only, as I said, at times when they are being attacked physically but also when they have medical or other social needs.  This could be done through the community care service of the health boards.  I want to score no points whatsoever in relation to who will provide money or who will not.  I happen to have the naive belief that it does not make a great deal of difference to the lives of the elderly in terms of reducing their fear as to which of the two major <Col N="1135" /> parties are leading the Government of the day.  I might be wrong in that.  I make my appeal principally for the reduction of uncertainty and fear in the lives of elderly people.</P>
    <P>In relation to the other question of apprehending criminals, it is its own comment on modern Ireland in many ways that criminals are far more mobile now and that people are able to drive through and past people who feel threatened.  We must realise that this is happening.  We must accept that as citizens we have an obligation to assist in the apprehension of these people and in making sure that their actions are not repeated in various areas.  We would not want to minimise that obligation.  Frankly, I think rural Ireland cannot be made safe.  Perhaps the Garda can be better deployed and located.</P>
    <P>I respect the right of the elderly, the handicapped, to live in isolated places if they so wish.  They cannot be made to feel safe, negatively, by control.  They have to be made safe positively by being shown that they belong and by a great deal of community responsibility in the provision of the services and the resources which I spoke about.  I do not think that the cost of that is too high.  It would provide security.  I support Senator O'Toole when he said that there should be more advice for the elderly as to how to protect themselves.  I do not think that it should be totally a matter of locks and bolts and guns.  They must be shown that they matter.</P>
    <P>We have to raise questions about attitudes that we assumed did not exist but which do exist in relation to the care of the elderly.  The evidence is that they have been neglected, that they feel alone, that in many cases people have been callous towards them when they looked for assistance.  It is time to ask ourselves the most serious questions.  I make my plea to the Minister for Health and it is two fold.  I would like to see the perpetrators of crimes against the elderly quickly apprehended.  If this does not happen a number of dangerous statements may be made as to who is responsible for these <Col N="1136" /> crimes, which would be irresponsible and regrettable.  It is important that the criminals be apprehended so as to create a feeling of security in the minds of the elderly.  Above all else I would ask the Minister for Justice to consult with the Minister for Health and the Cabinet with a view to making available such additional resources as are necessary to move from a very serious situation affecting the elderly to one that will be of positive benefit to them.  I support the idea of an integrated approach towards this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been here for the entirety of the debate.  From what I heard from Senator O'Toole and Senator Higgins, it is commendable and very worthy of this House that everything I have heard has been an expression of genuine concern for the elderly.  There has not been a loud beating of the law and order drum in the way in which, sadly, sections of the media have responded to this problem.  The problem here is not a problem so much of law and order as a problem of old people living in fear.  That should be the centre of our concern and of the Government's concern rather than a cheap sort of point-scoring about who is better at law and order.  What happened to old people in these recent weeks is reprehensible.  It is wrong and beyond any sort of comprehension or excuse.  I say that as one who is fairly frequently on his feet here in a variety of roles but the assaults on old people are among those things that nobody could ever justify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if any good comes <Col N="1137" /> out of these happenings it will be to re-emphasise the need to think about our old people not just when there is a spectacular tragedy but in the kind of continuing sad tragedy of their isolation and in the continuing sad tragedy of their exclusion not just by virtue of the demographic structure of many areas of rural Ireland but also because of the increasing concentration of younger people in urban areas.  This happens for reasons of employment and indeed, in some cases for reasons of planning.  Where young people are free to live and to build houses is often in less isolated and more urbanised areas.  So the old people are being further and further excluded from participation in a community.</P>
    <P>A community is not something that can be switched on when there is a major crisis.  It is something that has to exist.  If we are going to help our old people in this specific area then quite clearly the first requirement is that the perpetrators of these recent horrible crimes should be brought to justice.  Perhaps because I am innocent and also because I like the man, I am happy with the Minister's assurance that he believes that this will happen in the immediate future.  It is to be hoped that he is correct and that this does happen.  Apart from that, if these individuals are dealt with, what we have had identified for us is the frightening vulnerability of a large section of our society and it is not just a vulnerability, as Senator Higgins quite rightly said, in the area of crime; it is a vulnerability in the area of health and of other domestic problems such as outbreak of fire or anything like that.  What we have to address now is means and methods of minimising the vulnerability of our old people.  Crime is probably spectacular.  It is definitely something that sections of the media will latch on to with the greatest of enthusiasm but the tragedy of old people who are ill, or who are frightened by fire or who perhaps have a threat of fire, who are living in dreadful conditions or whose health declines painfully and often in dreadful isolation is an equal part and an extra dimension of this tragedy which we need to address.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> If any good is to come out of these awful tragedies it is that we will begin to reflect not just on the criminal activities by criminal elements against our old people but indeed on the criminal neglect that we as a society often are guilty of towards our elderly people in the way we house them, in the way we ignore them, in the way perhaps many of our well-intentioned plans exclude them from society.  I therefore hope that as well as the obvious necessary law and order dimensions that arise in this issue, the other dimensions of health, of mental welfare, of isolation, of communication, of support, will be addressed so that we will have a comprehensive plan to protect our old people not just from this immediate horrible threat but from all the other threats that arise from their being separated and excluded from the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief indeed because I do not believe in regurgitating what has been said.  I would agree with virtually everything that has been said in relation to this particular sad state of animalism that is particularly prevalent in the west of Ireland and particularly relevant to my own county, County Mayo.  It is unfortunate that a county that some 18 months ago was bottom of the crime statistics has now gone very much to the top of the league, not so much top of the league but top in relation to this particular sad barbaric type of crime.  As has been said, the central focal point, the objective of the whole exercise, should be the point made by Senator Brendan Ryan, initially made by Senator Michael Higgins, that was, that we should focus on the old, the vulnerable, the isolated, their welfare, their role in society, their role in the community and the need for a fully integrated social policy to care for these people, to look after their welfare and to ensure that protection accrues therefrom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make the point that even if we had a massive Garda presence on a one-to-one basis it would need manning around the clock because of the sheer <Col N="1139" /> difficulty in dealing with the type of terrain in Mayo.  We are talking about hundreds and thousands of square miles, rugged, isolated, very difficult to control which again re-emphasises, revamps, underlines and highlights the need for participation by the community.  I would agree wholeheartedly with the points made by Senator Durcan in relation to the role of the police force.  We need an integrated police force.  We need to get them out of the cars.  We need to get them again into the traditional role that they held in society, that they were trusted, that they were made feel part of the community and people felt they could go to them in confidence and impart information to them.  Nowadays a situation has arisen that by and large people do not feel that there is much point in going to them, unless they have something of particular grave substance to impart.  The type of attitude that people automatically go to the Garda Síochána to pass on information that might possibly lead to deterrence or side-tracking of a crime or would-be criminal has been lost. We have got to revamp, resuscitate, revive that attitude and ensure that it is prevalent in the community.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Senator Michael Higgins on the need for some type of electronic device.  I would make the point that the west of Ireland is very badly serviced with regard to telephones.  I have a letter from Telecom Éireann to a constituent. I am very conscious that Telecom Éireann is a high profile organisation that has done an enormous amount of work and is good in expediting the provision of telephones.  However, the letter states:</P>
    <P>There is a large volume of urgent work on hands and requiring attention in the area generally.  You can be assured that your application will be dealt with at the earliest possible date, but present indications are that the work necessary to enable services to be provided is unlikely to be completed until towards the end of next year.</P>
    <P>The person involved is old and lives in an <Col N="1140" /> isolated area.  I urge Telecom Éireann to adopt as their priority the provision of telephones for this category of persons.  I am not talking about the provision of telephones so that they will be able to ring garda stations but so that they would be able to ring a neighbour or friend. They should have telephones so that they would be able to make instant communication if their livelihood or welfare is being threatened.  This is something the Government should address themselves to.  There are vast subsidies for the provision in rural areas of roadways, ESB supply services to the tune of 70 per cent, and water schemes amounting to 80 per cent but there is no subsidisation from the EC of this type of vital infrastructure. I would reiterate the words of exhortation from both sides of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that Senator Higgins has been very brief.  I come from an area that has suffered very badly from the attacks on old and disabled people, and people who live in isolated areas.  It appears that we are now trying to deal with a situation which should have been dealt with 12 months ago when the spate of robberies commenced first in the west. In quite a number of cases people were robbed in broad daylight, not at night. People had money taken from their homes and were beaten up.  Old people have been murdered in the past 12 months because people thought they had money.  That has been the basic cause of a lot of the problem.  We should ask public servants to consider carrying identity cards with them when calling on these people.  They should have an identity card to be produced upon arrival at a person's door.  There have been cases where old people have been conned by vandals who pretended they were from either the Department of Social Welfare, BTE, or some other organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lack of garda presence in the west and in rural areas especially.  I drive quite a lot at night and I have not been stopped at a garda checkpoint in the last 12 months.  There have been no late night or early morning checks.  It was regrettable last night to hear the Minister say <Col N="1141" /> that these culprits may have escaped across the Border into Northern Ireland. The journey from Louisburgh to the nearest point on the Border, either Ballyshannon or Blacklion, where they could cross is at least two or two and a half hours drive.  I should like to ask the Minister how many Garda stations in the west were manned last Friday night.  How many of them had no member at all in attendance?  How many patrol cars were in operation in the west last Friday night? How many patrol cars are in operation on any night?  There is a lack of garda presence which I believe is due to cutbacks in the Minister's Department.  The cutbacks seem to be continuing on because as Senator O'Toole said this year there is £6 million cutback in overtime, not allowing for inflation.  I understand that the Minister's Department got only a 2 per cent increase for the Garda.  That is not enough to help the Garda fight crime when one takes account of inflation.  It is obvious that there are cutbacks because the cars gardaí are being provided with would not pass a Honda 50 in a lot of cases.  The people committing crimes are using high powered vehicles to help them escape from garda patrols. In Dublin the joyriders do not take a bad car if they are going to taunt the gardaí. They take a car they know can outpace the Garda car.  The Minister must give the Garda the necessary support by providing them with suitable vehicles.</P>
    <P>I fear that there will be more deaths in the west but it will not be the hooligans who are causing the trouble who will suffer.  I am concerned to hear that old people are buying shotguns.  Senator Durcan when he went to a neighour's house had to call out who he was.  However, if somebody arrives at a door whoever is inside may not be as cautious as Senator Durcan's friend.  They may blast the shotgun and some innocent person may be found dead outside a neighbour's door as a result.  That is sad but it is true. I hope advice will be given through the media to old people on how to protect themselves.  Anybody who saw the Carrolls on television yesterday would feel for them.  Those people were almost <Col N="1142" /> afraid to talk about what happened to them for fear of reprisals from their assailants. It was sad to see an elderly person show a hand which had been burned by being stuck in the fire.  That is something we do not expect to happen in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to deal with the problem.  He should make available to the Gardaí the necessary resources to allow them fight this problem.  I should like to ask him how much he has made available to the Garda in the west in the past week to cover the cost of the necessary overtime to deal with this problem. I hope he has made the money available and that he has instructed the chief superintendants in the area that whatever overtime is necessary will be paid to the Gardaí.  I hope that is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not there will be more deaths.  The Minister has a grave responsibility to maintain law and order. When these criminals come before the courts I hope the justices who have the privilege of administering justice will not be too lenient with them.  If they are sentenced I hope they will not, as in the case mentioned by Senator O'Toole, be taken to Mountjoy only to be released a short time later.  One individual was passed by the squad car that had taken him to Mountjoy and was thumbing a lift home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These crimes are committed against the most helpless section of our community. They could rank in the same category as murder because they lead indirectly, due to the pressure caused to these people to death from worry and fear.  We, as a community, and the Government have a responsibility to prevent these crimes and to deal with the people who are perpetrating them.  I hope the Minister will instruct the Garda that whatever overtime and extra staff is needed will be provided.  He should provide a 24-hour service at all Garda stations.  A number of stations in very strategic places in the west and on the Border do not have 24 hour Garda presence.  In cases squad cars <Col N="1143" /> responsible for patrolling areas can be 40 miles away, at the other end of the area they are expected to patrol.  It is impossible for gardaí to apprehend people carrying out crimes at the other end of their district.  I hope that in future those unfortunate enough to be attacked will immediately, when the attackers have left, try to get to their nearest neighbour who would notify the Garda.  An area within 50 or 60 miles should be sealed off and combed so that these people who are a menace to Irish society are brought to justice.  Justice, when it is being handed down, should mean full sentences.  Such a move should have the full support of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am glad to have the opportunity to place on the record of this House my utter condemnation of the atrocious crimes that have been committed against elderly people in the west of Ireland in the recent past and particularly in the last week or so.  As Minister responsible for law and order in this State, I view these developments with great concern &mdash; as indeed does every member of the Government &mdash; and I am firmly committed to ensuring that everything that can possibly be done to detect and apprehend these criminals and bring them to justice will be done by those responsible for law enforcement in the country.  Naturally, I wish to extend my sympathy, and that of the Government, to all the people who have been victims of these attacks, especially the elderly brother and sister who lost their home last week.  Of course, to repeat a sentiment I expressed in the other House yesterday, sympathy without much more is not an adequate response in present circumstances. Action is what is required and what people now expect and, so far as I am concerned, action is what is being and will be provided by me and by the appropriate authorities in relation to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming straight to the point, let me say at once that, as far as I am concerned, the appropriate authorities or, perhaps <Col N="1144" /> more correctly, the appropriate authority, in relation to criminal investigations here is the Garda Síochána, the established police force of this State.  The Garda have the necessary knowledge, skills, and resources and, above all else, they have the required determination to deal with these outrages and I am fully confident that the measures now being taken by them &mdash; some of which I will outline presently &mdash; will be successful in the not-too-distant future.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with that, let me recall briefly for the information of the House that this is not the first time that attacks of this kind have been perpetrated against elderly people in remote parts of rural Ireland.  There was a spate of attacks in Donegal in the latter part of 1984 and the Garda response then was to send in a special unit of experienced detectives to assist local gardaí.  My information is that, as a result of this action, the Garda have had a fair measure of success and some of the culprits have been made amenable to the law.  I understand in fact that, in a number of the more serious cases, charges are still pending before the courts.  In the two murders committed suspects have been charged.</P>
    <P>I use this example solely in order to underscore the point I am making which is that the work of detecting and solving these crimes successfully is well within the competence of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific measures that have been and are being taken to deal with the latest outbreak of attacks, I should like to say that, for the past two weeks or so, a special detective unit of the Garda Síochána has been operating in the Galway area under a detective inspector from the Technical Bureau. This unit has been assisting local gardaí and co-ordinating their efforts to locate these criminals.  As the House may know, on Monday last another special detective unit was dispatched to Sligo to perform work of a similar nature there.  All of the work is under the personal supervision of a Deputy Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, and has already visited one of the main centres to confer with local divisional chief superintendents and to <Col N="1145" /> review Garda strategy.  Immediate steps are being taken to intensify Garda efforts and additional manpower is being devoted to the investigation by redeploying existing resources within the areas affected.  Special patrols are being mounted and these will concentrate particularly on the times and on the days of the week on which offences of this kind have been most frequently committed.  I cannot, for obvious reasons, go into any greater detail about the measures the Garda are employing in their efforts to apprehend the perpetrators of these attacks.  I can say, however, that the Garda believe that these attacks are the work of a small number of organised and highly mobile gangs and that there is a cross-Border dimension to at least some of the crimes.  As I have said already they believe, in fact, that they know the identity of some of the people who were involved in a number of the recent attacks and they are following a definite line of inquiry.  They also have information relating to the makes and registration numbers of vehicles suspected of being involved in some of the crimes.  It would not be prudent of me to say more about that at present except that I am satisfied that everything possible is being done by the Garda to detect and apprehend those responsible and bring them to justice.</P>
    <P>In all of this, of course, preventive measures have a very important role to play.  The Garda are carrying out an urgent reappraisal of preventive measures to improve protection for elderly people living in isolated areas who may be at risk.  One such measure, which is already in hand, is the preparation of a register of all elderly people living in western counties who may be vulnerable to attack.  The purpose of this register is to provide the Garda with a quick and easy method of identifying elderly people who were most at risk and to enable the Garda to provide them with the maximum protection possible.  The use of an appropriate alarm system may have a role to play here &mdash; many Senators mentioned this.  In this context community alert project sponsored by Muintir na Tíre in the Cork area is being look at.  The Garda <Col N="1146" /> have already been working in close cooperation with local community groups and have been advising those groups and individuals on security measures.  When attacks of this nature first occurred people were strongly advised not to keep large sums of money in their homes.  They were urged to lodge their savings in banks or other financial institutions.  I should, perhaps, remind the House that the Minister for Finance provided for special savings relief for older people in his recent budget and this should act as an incentive in this regard.  The evidence available suggests that the advice given to people not to keep large sums of money in their homes is having an effect, if one is to judge at all events from the fact that, in the most recent attacks, very little cash appears to have been stolen, less than £180 in eight raids in total.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of days quite a few suggestions have been put forward as to how this problem and, indeed, some other current problems on the crime front might be tackled.  Some of these suggestions seem to have merit and, to the extent that the Garda find them practicable, will be implemented.  Others, if I may say so, are not practicable, indeed some are fanciful, though no doubt they have been put forward for the best of motives and from a genuine concern to see the problem of crime successfully tackled.  A few, however, in my view can only be described as mischievous and seem to be motivated solely by political considerations.  Take for example the idea that the solution to this problem requires ground to air surveillance using Knock airport.</P>
    <P>What contribution can ground to air surveillance be expected to make when most of these offences are committed and the criminals make good their escape during times when aircraft are rendered ineffective as far as surveillance is concerned because of the darkness?</P>
    <P>While on this topic I want to repeat what I said yesterday about a possible role for the Army in the detection of these criminals.  Nobody could exclude the use of the Army in support of the civil power if it could be shown that there <Col N="1147" /> was a useful role for them to play.  However, all the indications are &mdash; so far as I am aware &mdash; that there is no dimension to these crimes, either in terms of the use of arms, equipment, tactics or style of operation that would necessitate a military-type response.  It should be remembered that the Garda Síochána, and particularly senior Garda officers, have many years of experience behind them and they are the professionals in this area. At the present time we must rely on the Garda Síochána to tackle crime.  Certainly they need the assistance of the community as a whole to do this.  What they do not need is empty rhetoric, destructive criticism and distrust.  I am not accusing any speaker here this evening of such an approach because it was a most moderate debate and everybody was motified by genuine concern for the plight of old people living alone.  Unfortunately, however I have to say that the Garda have been treated to an unacceptable amount of this type of criticism in recent times.</P>
    <P>I have been urged to intervene to secure the re-establishment of the divisional task forces of some years back. Every time we have some outrage or other we have this proposition brought forward again notwithstanding the fact that I have on more than one occasion dealt comprehensively with the reasons why the Commissioner decided to reorganise these units.  I would refer Senators to a statement I made in the other House on 24 January 1984, if anybody wishes to check the record.</P>
    <P>The genesis of the task forces was an idea &mdash; thought to be a good one then but shown by hard experience not to have had much merit &mdash; that the best way to combat armed mobile organised terrorists was the setting up of units of this kind.  However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that those units were wasteful of scarce Garda resources; that they were structured in such a way as to create serious problems of accountability for their activities, and that it is widely acknowledged in the local managerial structures of the force that, since their <Col N="1148" /> disbandment, the personnel involved, who have been organised within the normal Garda command structure, are now much more effective in tackling crime.  To be specific, these views are shared by the overwhelming majority, if not indeed all, of the Garda divisional officers throughout the force &mdash; those who have been appointed by the Government of the day to be primarily responsible for the local deployment of resources for the prevention and detection of crime.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to overtime restrictions that I am alleged to have introduced and also to the closing of rural stations.  I have already said that the national plan allows for very reasonable levels of Garda overtime in this year.  I want to stress however, lest there should be any misunderstanding about it, that financial considerations are not being allowed to restrict in any way the effectiveness of Garda operations in relation to these crimes.  I want that to be clearly understood.  It is also untrue to say that rural stations are being closed.  I have checked the record on this and the simple fact is that no rural stations have been closed for years past &mdash; certainly not since I became Minister or, indeed, I believe, for at least a decade.</P>
    <P>While on the question of small rural stations there is one matter that I want to mention.  There have at various times recently been rumours, very strong rumours indeed in some cases, that different small Garda stations were about to be closed down completely.  I want to state here that responsibility for the provision of Garda stations or the closing of Garda stations rests with me as Minister for Justice and I want to say publicly and emphatically that I have no plan to close any Garda station anywhere in the country.  That is the fact of the matter and I would ask the House to accept this and ignore all rumours to the contrary that may come to the ears of Members.</P>
    <P>This very recent phenomenon of persistent and serious crime in rural areas is in marked contrast to the position of only a short while ago and it has caused some <Col N="1149" /> people to question the present deployment of Garda manpower as between urban and rural Ireland.  It is true to say that, because our rural areas have traditionally been almost crime-free, Garda strengths in these areas, leaving aside Border regions, have for a number of years tended to remain fairly static.  But growing concern about crime in rural areas means that thought must now be given to ways of providing an improved Garda service to such areas.  I am not here referring only to the outrageous crimes currently under discussion.  Atrocities of this nature and viciousness are something totally new in our experience and are, I sincerely hope, a very temporary phenomenon. But apart from crime of this nature, the fact is that robberies, violence, and vandalism are now more prevalent in our rural communities than once was the case.</P>
    <P>Given the nature of the areas to be policed &mdash; very wide areas, with intricate road networks and populations thinly spread &mdash; it seems reasonably clear that these require a system of Garda development different from that necessitated by the problems of towns and cities.  The traditional system of policing has served rural areas well in the past but the changing pattern of crime, and the greater mobility enjoyed by criminals, make it necessary to see whether this system can, in fact, be improved upon.  It is a common occurrence now for criminals to move quickly through several rural areas committing crime and the present policing system may have to be adjusted to cope with this problem.  The greater availability of Garda cars and the provision of the new national Garda radio communications network &mdash; and in this respect I want to say that the network will be going &ldquo;live&rdquo; in all the rural divisions in the next couple of weeks &mdash; mean that new ways of providing a Garda service can be tried out.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan referred to studies that have been carried out.  Studies have in fact been carried out by a team consisting of representatives of the Garda Research and Planning Unit and the Operations Research Unit of the Department of the <Col N="1150" /> Public Service and a scheme designed to improve the policing of rural areas is in operation at present in the Garda districts of Claremorris, County Mayo and Thomastown, County Kilkenny.  The main feature of the scheme is that the Garda personnel allocated to a group of four or five rural stations combine as a team to provide patrolling and other services for the whole area covered by these stations.  This means, for example, that when personnel attached to a particular station are off duty, other gardaí assigned to the area will attend as required &mdash; for example, to open the station and to answer calls from the public for assistance. This scheme is under review at present to see how satisfactory it is in practice and to see whether the system as it is operating under the pilot scheme, or some variation of it, should be brought into operation in other areas.  I can assure Senator Durcan that his criticisms of the scheme will be taken into account before I agree to any extension of it because while there are good features attached to the scheme it has been the object of criticism in local areas.  I will take the Senator's views and the views expressed by other Senators into account.</P>
    <P>As we strengthen the law &mdash; as we have done in the Criminal Justice Act &mdash; and as we improve Garda effectiveness with modern technology and equipment, it is to be expected that detection rates will improve.  This will mean that more accommodation will be necessary in our prisons to hold those convicted and sentenced by the courts.  The lack of adequate accommodation in prisons can render much of the good work done by the Garda and other sectors of the law enforcement area nugatory.  For that reason I am determined to ensure, during my term of office, that additional prison accommodation will be provided. Already, in the space of two years, I have improved matters substantially.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the daily average prison population was 1,235.  Today there are 1,693 prisoners in custody.  The rate of increase in the prison population is accelerating at present and it would appear this trend is going to continue.  For example, since <Col N="1151" /> 1 January last, 189 persons have been sentenced to imprisonment, either on remand or to serve sentences, for offences involving car theft &mdash; another current epidemic &mdash; and, I understand, that there is about another 290 currently remanded on bail awaiting trial.  This kind of intake into the prisons is putting an enormous strain on the prison system. As I have already indicated elsewhere, I have been discussing with some of my Cabinet colleagues various options which would help relieve the prison accommodation problem, at least on a temporary basis, and I would hope to be able to report progress in this area soon.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to respond to another contribution to this debate that I heard on radio this morning.  There was a suggestion made &mdash; I do not remember exactly who the speaker was but he was from a local trade organisation &mdash; that people in rural Ireland should get out their old shotguns and make them ready to defend themselves against attacks of this kind.  This is, of course, an understandable emotional reaction to the ordeal that people are undergoing at present.  However, it is &mdash; to say the least of it &mdash; dangerous talk and, if heeded, it could place many lives at risk that would not otherwise be at risk in prevailing circumstances. I cannot condone this kind of advice and must urge people not to heed it.  There are too many risks inherent in people arming themselves against possible intruders.  I am glad that a number of Senators referred to that here this evening.  If certain measures have to be taken ultimately, it is to the Garda that I will be looking to to take them.</P>
    <P>I want to say that some people &mdash; including even some Members of this House &mdash; do not appear to understand clearly the distinction between the role of the Minister for Justice and that of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána because they have &mdash; some more than once &mdash; demanded that I as Minister should direct the force to do certain things.  In the context of this debate I think it is right that I should say something about this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> While I accept that I am responsible to the Oireachtas and to the Government for the force and while, as I have already said, I am happy to answer for that role, I do not run the force on a day-to-day basis or indeed at all.  This is the task of the Commissioner and his senior officers. My role is to provide the Garda Síochána with the resources they require to do their job, that is manpower, equipment, and a sound legal basis for operation.  Since I became Minister for Justice I have been doing these very things.  Manpower is being maintained at 11,400 &mdash; the highest number ever.  I am providing better recruitment procedures; an expert committee has been established to examine the whole area of Garda training and I have introduced a new promotion scheme.  The Garda are being provided with the most up-to-date equipment available in terms of radio communications &mdash; which I have already mentioned &mdash; and also computerisation.  On the legal front I brought forward the Criminal Justice Bill within a short period of assuming office to give the Garda the necessary legal powers to tackle the criminal and to reform some of the procedures in our courts so as to secure the more effective administration of justice. I stand on my record in my two years of office and I look forward to continuing the work in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret to me that I do not have time available to comment on the individual contributions made by Senators but I accept the sincerity of all the speakers and, in so far as advice was offered on specific matters, I will take that advice into account, particularly in the case of the proposer of the motion who made a very detailed contribution. One statistic which is worth putting on the record before I finish is the number of gardaí in the different counties.  In Donegal' when I came into office in December of 1982, there were 445 gardaí. In December 1984 the number was 492 while on 28 February this year it was 491. Members can see from those figures that there was an increase of almost 50 in the number of gardaí.  In December 1982 in Mayo the strength was 257 while at 31 <Col N="1153" /> December 1984 it was 259.  The number in Mayo at the end of February this year was 260, a slight increase.  In Sligo-Leitrim in December 1982 the figure was 251 while at the end of December 1984 it had increased to 283.  At the end of February this year the figure was 282.  In Galway-West at the end of December 1982 the figure was 308 while at the end of December in 1984 it had increased to 316.  At the end of February this year the figure was 314.  In Roscommon-Galway East at the end of December 1982 the <Col N="1154" /> figure was 255 while at the end of December 1984 it had increased to 260.  The figure at the end of February this year was 261.  In all cases there has been an increase in Garda strength compared to the number in December 1982, when I took office.  I should like to thank the House for giving me an opportunity to make a contribution and I thank the Senators who spoke.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 20 March 1985.</P>
